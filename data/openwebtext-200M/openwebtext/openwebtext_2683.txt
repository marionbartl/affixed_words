There a lot of space tutorials out there some are better than others , I have managed to try and select a few of what I think can allow you to get great effects that look like they belong and do n’t look completely Photoshopped .
I tried to be as varied as possible so there are tutorials for creating planets , stars , nebulas and atmospheric type gasses .
The great thing is that they lay down the building blocks to experiment and create you own stunning universe .
[ otw_is sidebar=otw-sidebar - 1 ]
This tutorial shows you how to create some great gas explosions coming from the planets atmosphere with some pretty simple tools , yet looks stunning
Create realistic star fields , the trick with this one is to be totally random and keep building up your layers the end result will speak for it self , with an image that looks like its evolving .
Create simple yet affective star fields in 8 easy steps .
I think if you have the time to do this tutorial it would be very worth while , the end result is very realistic and it seems is one of few great galaxy tutorials .
This is a much simpler way to create a Nebula with different techniques but with a similar stunning result .
How to create a space nebula that looks like its bursting at the seems and full of life , you will need to download a brush pack for this tutorial , but the link is broken on the tutorial site to download them , but do n’t worry I have managed to find them for you here : Rust - n - Grunge brushes
One of my favourites as it is relatively easy to accomplish yet the planet can look totally realistic with its surface glow and texture effect .
This is a similar tutorial to the one above but will show you what other outcomes can be achieved with this method .
A smart and simple way to create a realistic looking asteroids from nothing but photoshop .
If you cant view the tutorial you can find it on this tutorial page instead
An extremly fast and simple way to add rings around your planet like Saturn has .
With this Nebula tutorial it shows a different technique using Photoshops preset brushes and filters to create a vivid result .
I think the end result could be better but i like the way the glowing crater and asteroids were created i think with some more motivation the end result could look truly amazing .
Quite a lengthy tutorial but a few smart ideas as well such as using a garden rock as an asteroid , with a pleasant explosion to great affect
A very dramatic explosion with terrific light effects .
This one is different again and is created by using a brushing technique which gives it a unique look , i would say this is quite an advanced technique and would take much longer than most of the others listed .
If you cant view the tutorial you can find it on this tutorial page instead
A modern take on lighting effects to create a spectrum of colour within space .
That ’s one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind

Here 's a snapshot in words of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner when he was still president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from a recent portrait in the New York Times :
Small world , do n't you think ?
This catches something of the lifestyle of Wall Street 's rich and financially powerful as well as those who " regulate " them .
It 's no longer news that the revolving door from Wall Street to Washington and back now spins endlessly .
Hence , the increasingly popular moniker " Government Sachs . "
" Crony capitalism " was once a term applied to the powerful oligarchs of " emerging economies " or -- a term not heard so much these days -- banana republics .
Now , however , as economist Simon Johnson has written , the U.S. is beginning to look startlingly more like one of those " emerging economies " in meltdown .
And overseeing the response to the crisis are , of course , representatives of the same crony capitalists and oligarchs who helped create it .
Not surprisingly , the " solution " to the crash of '08 crafted by former Goldman Sachs chairman Henry Paulson , Jr. -- Rubin held the same job before going to Treasury in the Clinton years -- and former New York Fed chief Tim Geithner ( who made Mark Patterson , a former Sachs lobbyist , his chief of staff and kept on Sachs alum Neel Kashkari to lead the bailout effort ) is clearly meant to staunch the wounds of their world , not ours .
TomDispatch regular Andy Kroll , who 's read all the latest economic reports so you would n't have to , suggests below just what an instrument of Wall Street their rolling bailout program has really been .
Tom
On October 3rd , as the spreading economic meltdown threatened to topple financial behemoths like American International Group ( AIG ) and Bank of America and plunged global markets into freefall , the U.S. government responded with the largest bailout in American history .
The Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 , better known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , authorized the use of $ 700 billion to stabilize the nation 's failing financial systems and restore the flow of credit in the economy .
The Greatest Swindle Ever Sold How the Financial Bailout Scams Taxpayers , Subsidizes Wall Street , and Props Up Our Broken Financial System By Andy Kroll
The legislation 's guidelines for crafting the rescue plan were clear : the TARP should protect home values and consumer savings , help citizens keep their homes , and create jobs .
Above all , with the government poised to invest hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars in various financial institutions , the legislation urged the bailout 's architects to maximize returns to the American people .
That $ 700 billion bailout has since grown into a more than $ 12 trillion commitment by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve .
About $ 1.1 trillion of that is taxpayer money -- the TARP money and an additional $ 400 billion rescue of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The TARP now includes 12 separate programs , and recipients range from megabanks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to automakers Chrysler and General Motors .
Seven months in , the bailout 's impact is unclear .
The Treasury Department has used the recent " stress test " results it applied to 19 of the nation 's largest banks to suggest that the worst might be over ; yet the International Monetary Fund as well as economists like New York University professor and economist Nouriel Roubini and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman predict greater losses in U.S. markets , rising unemployment , and generally tougher economic times ahead .
What cannot be disputed , however , is the financial bailout 's biggest loser : the American taxpayer .
The U.S. government , led by the Treasury Department , has done little , if anything , to maximize returns on its trillion - dollar , taxpayer - funded investment .
So far , the bailout has favored rescued financial institutions by subsidizing their losses to the tune of $ 356 billion , shying away from much - needed management changes and -- with the exception of the automakers -- letting companies take taxpayer money without a coherent plan for how they might return to viability .
The bailout 's perks have been no less favorable for private investors who are now picking over the economy 's still - smoking rubble at the taxpayers ' expense .
The newer bailout programs rolled out by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner give private equity firms , hedge funds , and other private investors significant leverage to buy " toxic " or distressed assets , while leaving taxpayers stuck with the lion 's share of the risk and potential losses .
Given the lack of transparency and accountability , do n't expect taxpayers to be able to object too much .
After all , remarkably little is known about how TARP recipients have used the government aid received .
Nonetheless , recent government reports , Congressional testimony , and commentaries offer those patient enough to pore over hundreds of pages of material glimpses of just how Wall Street friendly the bailout actually is .
Here , then , based on the most definitive data and analyses available , are six of the most blatant and alarming ways taxpayers have been scammed by the government 's $ 1.1 - trillion , publicly - funded bailout .
1 . By overpaying for its TARP investments , the Treasury Department provided bailout recipients with generous subsidies at the taxpayer 's expense .
When the Treasury Department ditched its initial plan to buy up " toxic " assets and instead invest directly in financial institutions , then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Jr. assured Americans that they 'd get a fair deal .
" This is an investment , not an expenditure , and there is no reason to expect this program will cost taxpayers anything , " he said in October 2008 .
Yet the Congressional Oversight Panel ( COP ) , a five - person group tasked with ensuring that the Treasury Department acts in the public 's best interest , concluded in its monthly report for February that the department had significantly overpaid by tens of billions of dollars for its investments .
For the 10 largest TARP investments made in 2008 , totaling $ 184.2 billion , Treasury received on average only $ 66 worth of assets for every $ 100 invested .
Based on that shortfall , the panel calculated that Treasury had received only $ 176 billion in assets for its $ 254 billion investment , leaving a $ 78 billion hole in taxpayer pockets .
Not all investors subsidized the struggling banks so heavily while investing in them .
The COP report notes that private investors received much closer to fair market value in investments made at the time of the early TARP transactions .
When , for instance , Berkshire Hathaway invested $ 5 billion in Goldman Sachs in September , the Omaha - based company received securities worth $ 110 for each $ 100 invested .
And when Mitsubishi invested in Morgan Stanley that same month , it received securities worth $ 91 for every $ 100 invested .
As of May 15th , according to the Ethisphere TARP Index , which tracks the government 's bailout investments , its various investments had depreciated in value by almost $ 147.7 billion .
In other words , TARP 's losses come out to almost $ 1,300 per American taxpaying household .
2 . As the government has no real oversight over bailout funds , taxpayers remain in the dark about how their money has been used and if it has made any difference .
While the Treasury Department can make TARP recipients report on just how they spend their government bailout funds , it has chosen not to do so .
As a result , it 's unclear whether institutions receiving such funds are using that money to increase lending -- which would , in turn , boost the economy -- or merely to fill in holes in their balance sheets .
Neil M. Barofsky , the special inspector general for TARP , summed the situation up this way in his office 's April quarterly report to Congress : " The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being used , particularly as billions of dollars are going to institutions for which banking is certainly not part of the institution 's core business and may be little more than a way to gain access to the low - cost capital provided under TARP . "
This lack of transparency makes the bailout process highly susceptible to fraud and corruption .
Barofsky 's report stated that 20 separate criminal investigations were already underway involving corporate fraud , insider trading , and public corruption .
He also told the Financial Times that his office was investigating whether banks manipulated their books to secure bailout funds .
" I hope we do n't find a single bank that 's cooked its books to try to get money , but I do n't think that 's going to be the case . "
Economist Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington , suggested to TomDispatch in an interview that the opaque and complicated nature of the bailout may not be entirely unintentional , given the difficulties it raises for anyone wanting to follow the trail of taxpayer dollars from the government to the banks .
" [ Government officials ] see this all as a Three Card Monte , moving everything around really quickly so the public wo n't understand that this really is an elaborate way to subsidize the banks , " Baker says , adding that the public " wo n't realize we gave money away to some of the richest people . "
3 . The bailout 's newer programs heavily favor the private sector , giving investors an opportunity to earn lucrative profits and leaving taxpayers with most of the risk .
Under Treasury Secretary Geithner , the Treasury Department has greatly expanded the financial bailout to troubling new programs like the Public - Private Investment Program ( PPIP ) and the Term Asset - Backed - Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) .
The PPIP , for example , encourages private investors to buy " toxic " or risky assets on the books of struggling banks .
Doing so , we 're told , will get banks lending again because the burdensome assets wo n't weigh them down .
Unfortunately , the incentives the Treasury Department is offering to get private investors to participate are so generous that the government -- and , by extension , American taxpayers -- are left with all the downside .
Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel - prize winning economist , described the PPIP program in a New York Times op - ed this way :
" Consider an asset that has a 50 - 50 chance of being worth either zero or $ 200 in a year 's time .
The average ' value ' of the asset is $ 100 .
Ignoring interest , this is what the asset would sell for in a competitive market .
It is what the asset is ' worth . '
Under the plan by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , the government would provide about 92 percent of the money to buy the asset but would stand to receive only 50 percent of any gains , and would absorb almost all of the losses .
Some partnership !
" Assume that one of the public - private partnerships the Treasury has promised to create is willing to pay $ 150 for the asset .
That 's 50 percent more than its true value , and the bank is more than happy to sell .
So the private partner puts up $ 12 , and the government supplies the rest -- $ 12 in ' equity ' plus $ 126 in the form of a guaranteed loan .
" If , in a year 's time , it turns out that the true value of the asset is zero , the private partner loses the $ 12 , and the government loses $ 138 .
If the true value is $ 200 , the government and the private partner split the $ 74 that 's left over after paying back the $ 126 loan .
In that rosy scenario , the private partner more than triples his $ 12 investment .
But the taxpayer , having risked $ 138 , gains a mere $ 37 . "
Worse still , the PPIP can be easily manipulated for private gain .
As economist Jeffrey Sachs has described it , a bank with worthless toxic assets on its books could actually set up its own public - private fund to bid on those assets .
Since no true bidder would pay for a worthless asset , the bank 's public - private fund would win the bid , essentially using government money for the purchase .
All the public - private fund would then have to do is quietly declare bankruptcy and disappear , leaving the bank to make off with the government money it received .
With the PPIP deals set to begin in the coming months , time will tell whether private investors actually take advantage of the program 's flaws in this fashion .
The Treasury Department 's TALF program offers equally enticing possibilities for potential bailout profiteers , providing investors with a chance to double , triple , or even quadruple their investments .
And like the PPIP , if the deal goes bad , taxpayers absorb most of the losses .
" It beats any financing that the private sector could ever come up with , " a Wall Street trader commented in a recent Fortune magazine story .
" I almost want to say it is irresponsible . "
4 . The government has no coherent plan for returning failing financial institutions to profitability and maximizing returns on taxpayers ' investments .
Compare the treatment of the auto industry and the financial sector , and a troubling double standard emerges :
As a condition for taking bailout aid , the government required Chrysler and General Motors to present detailed plans on how the companies would return to profitability .
Yet the Treasury Department attached minimal conditions to the billions injected into the largest bailed - out financial institutions .
Moreover , neither Geithner nor Lawrence Summers , one of President Barack Obama 's top economic advisors , nor the president himself has articulated any substantive plan or vision for how the bailout will help these institutions recover and , hopefully , maximize taxpayers ' investment returns .
The Congressional Oversight Panel highlighted the absence of such a comprehensive plan in its January report .
Three months into the bailout , the Treasury Department " has not yet explained its strategy , " the report stated .
" Treasury has identified its goals and announced its programs , but it has not yet explained how the programs chosen constitute a coherent plan to achieve those goals . "
Today , the department 's endgame for the bailout still remains vague .
Thomas Hoenig , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , wrote in the Financial Times in May that the government 's response to the financial meltdown has been " ad hoc , resulting in inequitable outcomes among firms , creditors , and investors . "
Rather than perpetually prop up banks with endless taxpayer funds , Hoenig suggests that the government should allow banks to fail .
Only then , he believes , can crippled financial institutions and systems be fixed .
" Because we still have far to go in this crisis , there remains time to define a clear process for resolving large institutional failure .
Without one , the consequences will involve a series of short - term events and far more uncertainty for the global economy in the long run . "
The healthier and more profitable bailout recipients are once financial markets rebound , the more taxpayers will earn on their investments .
Without a plan , however , banks may limp back to viability while taxpayers lose their investments or even absorb further losses .
5 . The bailout 's focus on Wall Street mega - banks ignores smaller banks serving millions of American taxpayers that face an equally uncertain future .
The government may not have a long - term strategy for its trillion - dollar bailout , but its guiding principle , however misguided , is clear :
What 's good for Wall Street will be best for the rest of the country .
On the day the mega - bank stress tests were officially released , another set of stress - test results came out to much less fanfare .
In its quarterly report on the health of individual banks and the banking industry as a whole , Institutional Risk Analytics ( IRA ) , a respected financial services organization , found that the stress levels among more than 7,500 FDIC - reporting banks nationwide had risen dramatically .
For 1,575 of the banks , net incomes had turned negative due to decreased lending and less risk - taking .
The conclusion IRA drew was telling : " Our overall observation is that U.S. policy makers may very well have been distracted by focusing on 19 large stress test banks designed to save Wall Street and the world 's central bank bondholders , this while a trend is emerging of a going concern viability crash taking shape under the radar . "
The report concluded with a question : " Has the time come to shift the policy focus away from the things that we love , namely big zombie banks , to tackle things that are truly hurting us ? "
6 . The bailout encourages the very behaviors that created the economic crisis in the first place instead of overhauling our broken financial system and helping the individuals most affected by the crisis .
As Joseph Stiglitz explained in the New York Times , one major cause of the economic crisis was bank overleveraging .
" [ U] sing relatively little capital of their own , " he wrote , " [ banks ] borrowed heavily to buy extremely risky real estate assets .
In the process , they used overly complex instruments like collateralized debt obligations . "
Financial institutions engaged in overleveraging in pursuit of the lucrative profits such deals promised -- even if those profits came with staggering levels of risk .
Sound familiar ?
It should , because in the PPIP and TALF bailout programs the Treasury Department has essentially replicated the very overleveraged , risky , complex system that got us into this mess in the first place : in other words , the government hopes to repair our financial system by using the flawed practices that caused this crisis .
Then there are the institutions deemed " too big to fail . "
These financial giants -- among them AIG , Citigroup , and Bank of America -- have been kept afloat by billions of dollars in bottomless bailout aid .
Yet reinforcing the notion that any institution is " too big to fail " is dangerous to the economy .
When a company like AIG grows so large that it becomes " too big to fail , " the risk it carries is systemic , meaning failure could drag down the entire economy .
The government should force " too big to fail " institutions to slim down to a safer , more modest size ; instead , the Treasury Department continues to subsidize these financial giants , reinforcing their place in our economy .
Of even greater concern is the message the bailout sends to banks and lenders -- namely , that the risky investments that crippled the economy are fair game in the future .
After all , if banks fail and teeter at the edge of collapse , the government promises to be there with a taxpayer - funded , potentially profitable safety net .
The handling of the bailout makes at least one thing clear , however :
It 's not your health that the government is focused on , it 's theirs -- the very banks and lenders whose convoluted financial systems provided the underpinnings for staggering salaries and bonuses while bringing our economy to the brink of another Great Depression .

Thanks to my needing the loo in the department of government security , I 've finally found out what 's been happening to me ; why my world has turned 16 shades of meatball since stumbling six days ago into the mad , bad and dangerous - to - know world of Bilderberg .
My story is over .
Here 's how it ends ...
* * *
The meeting has been airless and fruitless .
It has been the usual " How you know these are policemen ? " and " Do you have the numbers of the motorbikes ? " – the same old belittling of my word and my intelligence .
I explain again : " The detective at Omonioa police station told me that the two men following me , the two men I fought with in the metro station , were police officers .
He said ... , " and here I flip open my reporter 's notebook , the one I found randomly in the street yesterday , my talisman , and read the quote : " ' They are police .
They are just doing their job , nothing else . '
These men were the ones giving orders to the men in uniforms .
And I was detained , even though I was the one who called the police .
Can you tell me what is going on ? "
" We have no information . " I turn to the captain 's colleague .
Same face .
" We know nothing about this incident . "
I 've barely sat down and they " know nothing about this incident " .
I ask them directly : " How do you know that you know nothing ? "
" We are the department that ... we look after the state , the government . "
One of the men who arrested me in Vouliagmeni – nice to bump into him again in Athens .

" You protect politicians , government buildings ? "
" Exactly .
As a department we are interested mostly with anarchism and the people who do illegal actions .
But of course , we do n't know all the anarchist people ... "
So why have I been sent here ?
Why this department in particular ?
To the Ypodieftinsi Kratikis Asfalias – the department of government security ?
I ask them directly : what is my status here in Greece , what happens when they look up my name , am I a criminal ?
The deputy answers : " Only if you do a crime do you have a record .
If you have not done a crime in Greece or in your home country you do not have a record .
It is illegal to keep personal information on European citizens . "
That 's comforting .
I ask again why I am being followed .
I ask him if he thinks it 's a problem that I 've been so threatened by people following me around Athens that I took a cab to my own embassy .
" No , I do n't think you have a problem .
They only follow you to see where you are going .
I think they do n't want to harm you .
And if they do want to harm you , I 'd sooner they do n't do that in Athens . "
His words .
Written in my notebook .
" They follow you from police station to police station .
They know that you have informed police that you are threatened .
They are more careful now . "
Glad he can see so clearly into the minds of the men ( certainly not policemen , of course ) who 've been chasing me around .
I show him the photo I took of the man I grappled with in the metro station .
The one whose partner shoved me about and forgot that he was n't a police officer , pointing into the little metro police office , screaming at me " Get in here !
Get in here ! " and marching in ahead of the uniformed officers .
In charge .
I ask the captain if he recognises the man .
" No . "
I show him another photograph , of a man I saw coming out of this building , yesterday , when I came to arrange an appointment .
He was one of the pair who arrested me the second time in Vouliagmeni , for taking photographs of car wheels .
We recognised each other and laughed as we passed .
I took his photograph .
I showed the photograph to the officers .
Bless them , they could n't help but smile .
Hands wiped across mouths to become stern .
Glad they 're taking this in such good spirits .
" So you recognise him ? " Serious faces now .
" He reminds me of someone I know , but ... no ... I do n't know him . "
They 're quoting me lines from bad movies .
It 's going nowhere .
I get the address of another police department , get the captain 's name , and ask his advice .
I could use it .
" Here in Greece we have a saying , we hold a small basket to anything we hear and to anything we see .
I do not have big expectations for your situation . "
The interview is over , I 've been successfully stonewalled , nothing confirmed , nothing certain .
The cloak of Bilderbergian darkness still envelops me .
I 'm going to go to the Acropolis and scratch rude words in a pillar or something .
Anarchist that I am .
But first , I need the loo .
And at this point , the captain makes his big mistake .
He lets me go .
And everything changes .
I am led along the sixth - floor corridor to the lavatory .
And there , standing there – bam – right in front of my eyes , is one of the men who 's been following me around Athens .
The one who tailed me here on the first day .
The one who I gave the slip to in my stairwell , and then quietly watched as he stood at the edge of the museum park , scouring the tourists .
He was looking anxious .
I waved cheerily when he finally spotted me .
It was him .
It was proof .
Everything up until now could be fudged , denied , explained away , attributed to coincidence or paranoia , but not this .
I think he was as shocked to see me as I was to see him .
He did n't know what to do , so he literally ran off .
He ran away , into his office .
I darted after him – what was I doing ?
I was yelling , I was pointing : " Here !
One of the men !
One of the men who 's following me ! "
I whistled to the captain up the hall : " In here , he went in here ! "
It was absolute , unbridled mayhem .
Detectives came into the hall , people were shouting , I was led back up the hall .
I was FUMING .
I was shaking .
I was angrier than I 've ever been in my life .
All I 've been , all along , is lied to .
Harassed and lied to .
And I only caught them out because of an extra cup of coffee at breakfast .
The captain was in a tizz .
" Wait here , we sort this all out now . "
Mutterings from next door .
A minute later and I 'm ushered into the boss 's room .
The chairs were plumper , the TV screen showing Eurovision highlights was bigger , and he was fatter .
" Sit down . " I sat .
" What 's your problem ? "
" I think you know what my problem is . "
" There is no problem . "
" I saw a man , up the hall , in the lavatory .
One of the men who has been following me . "
He looks me deep in the eye , not a blink .
" There was no man .
You did not see any man . "
My mouth actually fell open .
I looked at him open - mouthed .
There were no words .
Again , it was just " an idea in my mind " .
I had imagined it all .
I 'd encountered a phantom taking a leak .
" Close your mouth .
It is rude to sit like that with mouth open . "
I was n't blinking either as I said : " It 's rude to lie . "
" There was no man . "
" Shall we go and ask him ?
He is just up the corridor . "
" You go now . "
" And that 's the best you can do ? "
I looked around at the captain ; at his colleague .
" This is crazy . "
" To you it is crazy .
Not to me . "
He started punching numbers into his phone , it was over .
" I have a job . "
" I have a job , too . "
But you know , it did n't matter what he said .
I have been stalked and harassed by Greek government security , I have hidden from them in stairwells , challenged them in the street , tried to arrest them , and been lied to by them .
The Greek prime minister , Kostas Karamanlis , was a delegate at Bilderberg 2009 , and the special government security department of his police force has been protecting him from me .
Protecting the dignitaries from a sort of journalist .
A dangerous man .
I wonder how much it all cost .
How many thousand euro .
I bet Greek taxpayers would love to know .
I have n't had time to reflect yet .
This is me writing off the top of my head in a nice populous cafe attached to my hotel .
Lots of people around .
I 'm too tired and baffled to think any more .
I may not know a whole lot more about what went on at this year 's Bilderberg , but I know what went on up the road , and further still , in Athens ' city centre .
I came to make a few cracks about Bilderberg and ended up getting sledgehammered in the nuts .
I tell you one thing : they 're not very good at their job ( unless their job was to freak me out ) .
If I was the Greek prime minister I 'd be out looking for better spooks .
How about Avion ?
We know they were at Bilderberg , why not extend their contract ...?
Right now , all I want to do is to go home .
I 'm sitting here scared to go to the loo .
I do n't like the look of the stairs .
I 'm thinking of giving the bellboy € 20 to stand outside while I pee .
When I filled out my report in Sintagma police station , with the nice captain , he was obviously using the wrong paperwork because there was a box where it said : " Name of item lost . "
It was a lost property form .
I wrote " innocence " .
Writers need to be more entrepreneurial in the current climate — and that ’s good for the film industry , says David Pearson , director of the Screenwriters ’ Festival .
There wo n’t be many screenwriters in Cannes this week .
It is traditionally the preserve of producers and financiers , and they may find less free champagne to neck casually at parties as struggling companies stay away and others choose cocktails économique .
Next year , though , I do expect more British writers on the Croisette , because British writers are becoming more entrepreneurial .
“ As the development puddle in the UK dries up , writers are behaving like producers — if not actually being producers ”
As the digital revolution impacts on distribution and traditional production funding models break down , writers ’ true value could be recognised — both for a new - found spirit of enterprise and for their ability to be lightning rods for the audience ’s psyche .
Producers and directors help bring to life writers ’ stories such as Slumdog Millionaire and Brokeback Mountain so they become successful films catching the spirit of their age .
As newspapers reduce their ranks of journalists and television shrinks its ambitions , films still provide special insight , as writer - director Armando Iannucci and his co-writers Jesse Armstrong , Simon Blackwell , Ian Martin and Tony Roche have just demonstrated with In The Loop .
This comic stab at the flaws of politicians , with a minister quipping about whether he should put his porn film bill on his expenses , provided a striking echo of Westminster ’s scandals last month in a way newspapers and TV news could n’t manage .
Iannucci will be among the line - up at the Screenwriters ’ Festival ( SWF ) in the south of England this October , where exchanges on working approaches , best practice and projects will again take place between writers , directors and producers .
How to make money from film will definitely be a topic .
As the development puddle in the UK dries up , writers are behaving like producers — if not actually being producers .
They do this to protect their investment in scripts they have written but not yet been paid for .
It follows a trend of TV writers setting up production companies .
The reduction in paid gigs for writers may also embolden them to go forward with their pet project .
Bill Nicholson , screenwriter and SWF regular , is optimistic : “ It could be a period of creative development , maybe a new golden age for scripts . ”
Screenwriters need a passion for their story , tempered with awareness of the audience whose cinema visit is often a diversion from their own troubles .
Bill Nicholson believes : “ The writer must write the story that ’s buried inside them , and bring it to people .
If it ’s good , something will make people realise it is special to the moment . ”
As the belt tightens around the industry at the Palais , everyone will be trying to work out what the new models are .
It is not just development money that ’s gone , production funding in the UK has shrunk too .
Technology may help reduce the entry - level cost of making micro- budget features , but it ca n’t solve the problem of getting films funded on its own .
The UK industry has to find a way to make more films that make more money , but that does n’t have to mean empty popcorn fare .
So what would we like from Cannes in 2009 ?
I ’d like a demonstration that original screenplays can be as successful as adapted work .
They can .
Let ’s wish Cannes well and hope that enlightened courage and realism informs everyone lucky enough to raise a glass there .
Champagne or Cava .
Faced with a ballooning deficit and a clear signal that voters wo n’t pay more to fix it , California Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger released a budget plan Tuesday that would eliminate welfare , drop 1 million poor children from health insurance , cut off new grants for college students and shut down 80 percent of state parks .
In a state that long has prided itself on its social safety net , it could well go down in history as the most drastic reduction in social programs ever .
And billions in further cuts will be unveiled later this week .
The governor ’s proposal to whack an additional $ 5.5 billion from state programs stunned even longtime Capitol - watchers with its blunt force .
Ending cash assistance for 1.3 million impoverished state residents , for example , would make California the only state with no welfare program .
“ Every single first - world nation has a safety net program for children , ” said Will Lightbourne , Santa Clara County ’s social services director .
“ This would return us to the era of Dickens — you ’d have to go back to the 19th century to find a comparable proposal . ”
The governor ’s office reiterated that the cuts were painful but unavoidable , with the proposed budget for the 2009 - 10 fiscal year already outdated before lawmakers even begin debate .
Schwarzenegger ’s finance team now says the deficit will grow to $ 24.3 billion by July 1 , up from the previous $ 21.3 billion projected shortfall .
“ The scope and the severity of this recession have forced us to put options on the table that would have been unthinkable just a few short months ago , ” said H.D. Palmer , the state ’s deputy director of finance .
Schwarzenegger had warned before last week ’s special election that if voters did not approve a host of tax and budget - reform measures , stunning cuts to social services , education and other vital state programs would be necessary .
The deepest cuts
So , in the wake of the resounding “ no ” that came from a disillusioned electorate , he has held true to his promise and then some :
The budget proposal would eliminate vast swaths of programs , including CalWORKs — the welfare program serving more than 521,000 families who now receive $ 526 average monthly grants — and Healthy Families , which subsidizes health care for low - income children whose families do n’t qualify for Medi-Cal .
Those cuts would also cost the state billions in federal matching funds .
Medi-Cal coverage for dialysis and for breast and cervical cancer treatment for those over age 65 would be cut .
Undocumented immigrants would lose nonemergency health care .
In the prisons , rehabilitation , education and vocational programs would be hacked .
So would the sentences of nonviolent , non-serious offenders , who would go free a year early .
More than 200,000 college - bound students would lose some or all of their tuition assistance under the Cal Grant program .
New grants for students to attend college would be eliminated , and existing grants would be reduced .
All of that would come on top of $ 335 million in cuts for the University of California and California State University systems — which already have seen $ 415 million in cuts this year , forcing student fee increases .

Google says users are becoming more sophisticated at search Web giant Google has unveiled new products that it says will push search in a new direction .
Google is using so - called semantic web technology to leverage the underlying data on websites to enhance results .
" The race in search is far from over and innovation and continued improvement is absolutely pivotal , " said Google 's Marissa Mayer .
Google said it could not afford to rest on its laurels in the quest to build the perfect search engine .
Google has over 63 % of the US market compared with rival Yahoo , on 20 % .
" I 've said this many times but search is still in its infancy .
Our engineers are worried about what is the next big thing in search and how are they going to find it , " said Ms Mayer , who is the vice - president of search products and user experience .
She said that last year Google had released more than 360 products and in the first quarter of this year it had been 120 .
Ms Mayer added that this was proof that " Google gets better all the time " .
Google has in the past said that despite its lead in the marketplace , users were " one click away " from switching to other alternatives .
Vanessa Fox of SearchEngineLand told the BBC that Google 's ability to constantly innovate gave them a leading edge .
" Google is saying : ' We have to provide for all searchers and do things at scale . '
It means they have to launch all sorts of features while some companies can concentrate on just one thing .
The key thing behind why they are still ahead is because they are able to innovate at such a pace , " said Ms Fox .
Rich snippets
During the Searchology event at Google 's Mountain View headquarters , Ms Mayer and her team showcased four new products that she said would give users a " different way to look at the web " .
Google Squared is still experimental and far from perfect , says the company Rich Snippets are search results that return more information in every listing .
For example , users looking for reviews of a new restaurant might get a " rich snippet " of average review scores , number of reviews and the restaurant 's price range .
" This is a step toward making the whole internet smarter , " said Google product manager Kavi Goel .
Rich snippets use the metadata from web pages , such as address information , calendar information and semantic web mark - up specifications , called Resource Description Frameworks .
The use of these so - called microformats allows the search engine to better understand the meaning of data and to employ it more intelligently .
Google can understand the relationship between different sets of data , and so can pull the correct address listing of a shop without that information having to be specifically tied together .
Google Squared
One of the more experimental products was called Google Squared , which will go public in the next month or so .
It takes information from the web and displays it in a spreadsheet in " split seconds " , something Ms Mayer said would normally take someone half a day to do .
During the demonstration , a query for " small dog " was typed into the search box .
Seconds later a table popped up showing photographs of various dogs , their origin , weight and height in a clear and simple layout .
While Ms Mayer described this product as " transformative " , she would only hint at the specific techniques that Google uses to drive this feature .
" I think we can open the kimono a little bit without talking about the computer science behind it .
" What they are basically doing is looking for structures on the web that seem to imply facts .
Like something ' is ' something .
" Different tables , different structures , and then corroborating the evidence around whether or not something is a fact by looking at whether that fact occurs across pages .
" This is all in the secret sauce of what we are doing and it takes an incredible amount of compute power to create those squares , " said Ms Mayer .
' Refine , filter and view ' Google Search Options is a tool that is aimed at letting users " slice and dice " results so they can manipulate the information and get what they want faster .
Search options is a " tool belt " giving new ways to interact with search
They come into play after a normal web search and allow users to drill down into the results by offering an option for different genres like product reviews , forum posts or videos .
Other choices include recently added blogs , images , timelines and so on .
Ms Mayer said this new feature should help people who struggled with the " vexing " problem of exactly what query they should type into the search box .
It is meant to give users the opportunity to " refine , filter and view results in a different way " .
' Skymap ' A final feature had Ms Mayer " reaching for the stars " with an app for mobile phones using the Android operating system .
Google said it was still working on finding keys but can find the stars " For a long time here at Google we joked could we actually find physical things like keys and now with the power and technology of Android , coupled with search , you can see we are starting to find some physical things like stars , " said Ms Mayer .
Skymap displays the constellations .
By using the smart phone 's GPS capability , it offers the user a dynamic star map that knows where they are standing and which way they are pointing
The feature came about as a result of Google 's 20 % time , which allows engineers to spend one - fifth of their time working on pet projects .
The app is now available on the Android app market .
" Clearly Google is still pushing the envelope with all these new additions , " said Rob Hof , Silicon Valley editor of Business Week .
" They are certainly continuing to improve daily .
Whether it makes a difference and will stave off the competition , I do n't know .
But they are not standing still . "
Ms Mayer said keeping the user happy was at the heart of everything they did .
" There is a shoe company called Stuart Weitzman and their slogan is ' a little obsessed with shoes ' .
" Google is a little more than obsessed with search , " confessed Ms Mayer .

My Top Secret Plans for America w/ Bonus Portrait of Rahm Emanuel
The White House
Dear Brian Mcfadden ,
To thank you for your commitment to liberal elitism and fart jokes , I have taken the liberty of drawing this week 's " Big Fat Whale " cartoon for you :
" Allahu Akbar ! " Disneyland to become secret Muslim headquarters
Mountain of confiscated guns
High speed rail that also conducts gay marriages
Wasilla oficially renamed " Turdburg "

THAT people have personalities goes without saying .
There are the shy , the cruel , the kind , the sceptical .
Pet owners will quickly argue that their animals have personalities too .
It is hardly uncommon to hear a dog described as friendly or inquisitive , and scientific research has confirmed that dogs do indeed have personality traits similar to those found in people .
In dogs , for instance , these are usually referred to as energy - level , affection - aggression , anxiety - calmness and intelligence - stupidity ; in people they are extroversion , agreeableness , neuroticism , openness to experience and conscientiousness .
Yet in spite of all this , rather little has been done to find out if such characteristics exist in wild animals .
One such study , published recently in Animal Behaviour , shows not only that some do , but also that the presence of such traits is skewing the way data are collected by researchers .
The animals in question are birds — collared flycatchers , to be specific .
László Garamszegi , who was at the University of Antwerp at the time of the study ( he is now at Doñana Biological Station in Spain ) , and a team of his colleagues monitored the courtship behaviour of this species .
The 41 males observed were nesting in boxes long used by the species , and a single attractive female was placed in an enclosure on top of each box .
First , the team measured the varying intensity of the courtship behaviours displayed by the 33 males that responded to the caged female .
After they had collected enough data to act as a baseline , they then attached a white piece of paper to each of the boxes used by these males and watched how the males in question responded to this novelty .
They found that roughly half seemed afraid of the paper and reduced their courtship of the female .
The other half ignored the paper and continued displaying as they had done before .
In the third phase of the experiment a male was placed in the cage over the box where the female had once been , and the amount of aggression towards this male from the nesting male was measured .
In general , those males who had been undeterred by the presence of the paper attacked the newly presented competitor with vigour while those who had been intimidated by it seemed reluctant to attack the putative competitor if , indeed , they attacked him at all .
Another part of the study analysed male willingness to fight in the presence of potential predators , by watching aggressive interactions between nesting males and caged competitors when an unfamiliar human slowly approached the site .
Those males who had been afraid of the paper often fled when the human was as much as 20 metres away .
Those who had continued their courtship in the presence of the paper again proved their courage and often kept fighting until the observing human was just two metres away .
Lastly Dr Garamszegi and his team placed traps within the nesting boxes and monitored which birds were caught .
They found that the aggressive , risk - taking males were twice as likely as non-risk - takers to be trapped .
These results are both interesting and worrying .
They are interesting because this is the first time that differences in personality have been shown in wild birds .
If birds , as well as mammals , have personalities , it may make it easier to study the evolutionary pressures that give rise to such systematically different ways of behaving within a single species .
The results are worrying , however , because ecologists conduct thousands of studies each year that involve analysing animals caught in traps .
These analyses are based on the assumption that the animals collected represent a randomly selected and thus representative sample of the population .
Yet among collared flycatchers this does not appear to be the case .
Instead it looks as if such trapping studies are selecting the bravest individuals .
If that is true more widely , decades of ecological research will have to be re-examined .
For this is one case where fortune most definitely does not favour the bold .
Sphinx on Dreamhost
Published : March 10 , 2009
If you wish to to install the Sphinx search engine on Dreamhost , you can and it is really quite easy and painless .
The first step is to download , compile and install sphinx into your home directory ( as you do not have permissions to install this elsewhere ) :
cd ~/ mkdir -p local wget http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-0.9.8.1.tar.gz tar - xzf sphinx - 0.9.8.1.tar.gz cd sphinx -0.9.8.1/ ./ configure --prefix=$HOME/local / -- exec - prefix=$ HOME/local / make install
Now you simply need to modify your $ PATH to include ~/ local / bin :
echo " export PATH= \ " $ PATH:~/local / bin\ " " >>
~/.bash_profile source ~/.bash_profile
Now you should have a working searchd and your only remaining concern is how to keeping it running , as Dreamhost will kill off long running processes .
My solution was to add it to crontab :
* * * * * /home/you/local/bin/searchd --config /home/you/path/sphinx.conf
This appears to be a grey area with Dreamhost , but I ’ve never really seen sphinx use any real CPU or memory ( on my sites at least ) and personally I think they should make it available as part of their standard build .
Now , we can safely assume none of these models said the words that they have reported to have said by the flyer designer .
Begs a question .
Is this a violation of iStock rules and if so , what are they going to do about it ?
Also , with their history of support for the Fascists , the Daily Mail image is no real surprise and despite contacting them , I have found no indication they contacted the BNP to ask them to not use their images .
Putting the somewhat unsavoury nature of the content to one side for one moment , it does highlight another issue for designers .
We are often asked to ‘ invent ’ testimonials for projects .
With better reverse image searches now available we need to make sure these are as unique as possible .
If a client is asking for a testimonial , then it is best to ask them to at least provide the image to be used .
This could be a real customer or just someone from the workforce .
Note to the teabaggers : two - thirds of Republicans in one of the more conservative states in the nation love their country and do n't want to secede .
This , of course , means that about a third of Georgia Republicans do want out of America , but you can't have everything .
Research 2000 for Daily Kos. 4/27 -29 .
Likely voters .
MoE 4 % ( No trend lines )
Do you think Georgia would be better off as an independent nation or as part of the United States of America ?
US : 68
Independent nation : 27 Democrats : US 88 , Ind 8
Republicans : US 52 , Ind 43
Independents : US 61 , Ind 33 Would you approve or disapprove of Georgia leaving the United States ?
Approve : 18
Disapprove : 76 Democrats : Approve 5 , Disapprove 89
Republicans : Approve 32 , Disapprove 63
Independents : Approve 14 , Disapprove 79
Those are n't nearly as bad as the Texas numbers we 've seen , but they are n't exactly flattering for the GOP base .
Apparently , the most conservative of Republicans only love their country when they 're in power .
Charming .
This group of fringe GOP 'ers seems to include much of the Georgia Senate , which is not altogether surprising when you consider the cast of characters the electorate in Georgia tends to send to Atlanta ( and to Washington ) under the GOP banner .
Take the Congressional delegation .
When the entire Republican delegation to the House is composed of Republican Study Group wingers ... when Tom Price , Lynn Westmoreland , Jack Kingston and Phil Gingrey are all duking it out for the title of second nuttiest Republican ( our hats are off to Paul Broun on that one ) ...
... it should be no wonder that the other GOP elected officials occasionally come up with this kind of crazy talk .
In their recent fiscal report for 2008 - 2009 , Konami released some surprising numbers regarding the Playstation 3 .
The Playstation 3 represented 28 % of Konami ’s total software sales last year .
This makes Sony ’s behemoth the top seller for Konami last fiscal year .
Of course , the release of Metal Gear Solid 4 may have done something with the numbers .
In fact , the jump from the previous fiscal year is astounishing .
For the 2007 - 2008 fiscal year , the Playstation 3 only accounted for 8 % of Konami ’s total sales .
Going more in - depth , here are the platform - by - platform performance figures :
Playstation 3 – 28 %
Nintendo Wii – 17 %
Playstation 2 – 17 %
Nintendo DS – 16 %
PSP – 12 %
Xbox 360 – 7 %
PC – 2 %

It ’s easy to dismiss sci fi flicks as clumsy and loud , but the critiques miss a key virtue .
Unlike other genres , fanboy blockbusters are a constantly innovating form , with an important message about the present even as they outline visions of our future .
In romantic comedies , the scene can shift from the Civil War to the Los Angeles real estate market as long as boy meets girl amidst the bayonets or billboards .
Horror movies can switch weapons with no fall - off in audience long as there are coeds to dice .
Come Oscar season , World War II films are such a reliable source of nominations that Kate Winslet ’s turn as a sexy Nazi became a simultaneous joke on the genre and a lock for the Academy Award .
Science fiction and superhero movies do n’t have the luxury of simply finding the latest neighborhood where attractive singles are settling or the flashiest car on the market and plugging those accessories into a formula .
By nature , those films have to imagine the future , to put something on screen that audiences would never see in their everyday lives .
Sometimes , those visions are farfetched , unrealistic , paranoid , immature , or deeply cheesy .
Of the four major sci - fi movies being released this spring and summer , two feature vengeful giant robots .
Another centers on a guy who metalizes his skeleton , and the fourth plants spaceships in Iowa cornfields .
They ’ll vary in quality , and plausibility , but at least they have something to say about the perils and opportunities of the future .
X - Men Origins : Wolverine , the first of these movies , is a perfect example of the power of a bad fanboy movie .
The film is far too full of cheap - looking special effects and dialogue that seems ludicrous outside a cartoon bubble to be really absorbing .
But Wolverine has far more to say about its chosen subject , the scientific manipulation of the human body , than , for example , the romantic comedy Ghosts of Girlfriends Past has to say about relationships between men and women .
The movie is the origin story of one of Marvel Comics ’ most popular characters , a Canadian roughneck named Logan , who — thanks to a genetic mutation — can sprout claws and heal rapidly from serious injuries .
In the film , Logan decides to undergo a procedure to coat his skeleton in super - strong metal after a series of tragedies leaves him seeking revenge .
The experiment Logan participates in provides a breakthrough for a group of scientists who give Logan ’s powers to another superhero , Wade Wilson — and then sew his lips shut .
When the two modified men fight for the last time the awful power of technology is less evident in Wade ’s threatening new abilities than in the mutilation of his formerly delicate , expressive mouth .
The actual science in Wolverine may be outlandish , but the dilemma is not .
Debates about the potential applications of available technology color arguments over issues like the morality of screening of fetuses for genetic defects when such screenings could encourage parents to abort children with a wide range of traits .
It ’s one thing to think about the misdirection of science in the abstract : it ’s quite another to watch those consequences acted out violently on screen against a character whose only apparent crime was his verbosity .
That one striking image of a character ’s mutilated face does n’t do a lot to redeem a deeply mediocre movie .
But it offers more than Ghosts of Girlfriends Past , which dishes up the message that a modicum of contrition expressed at an appropriate moment makes up for a life of emotional abuse .
The sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison was not an invention of maverick guards , but part of a system of ill - treatment and degradation used by special forces soldiers that is now being disseminated among ordinary troops and contractors who do not know what they are doing , according to British military sources .
The techniques devised in the system , called R2I - resistance to interrogation - match the crude exploitation and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib jail in Baghdad .
One former British special forces officer who returned last week from Iraq , said : " It was clear from discussions with US private contractors in Iraq that the prison guards were using R2I techniques , but they did n't know what they were doing . "
He said British and US military intelligence soldiers were trained in these techniques , which were taught at the joint services interrogation centre in Ashford , Kent , now transferred to the former US base at Chicksands .
" There is a reservoir of knowledge about these interrogation techniques which is retained by former special forces soldiers who are being rehired as private contractors in Iraq .
Contractors are bringing in their old friends " .
Using sexual jibes and degradation , along with stripping naked , is one of the methods taught on both sides of the Atlantic under the slogan " prolong the shock of capture " , he said .
Female guards were used to taunt male prisoners sexually and at British training sessions when female candidates were undergoing resistance training they would be subject to lesbian jibes .
" Most people just laugh that off during mock training exercises , but the whole experience is horrible .
Two of my colleagues could n't cope with the training at the time .
One walked out saying ' I 've had enough ' , and the other had a breakdown .
It 's exceedingly disturbing , " said the former Special Boat Squadron officer , who asked that his identity be withheld for security reasons .
Many British and US special forces soldiers learn about the degradation techniques because they are subjected to them to help them resist if captured .
They include soldiers from the SAS , SBS , most air pilots , paratroopers and members of pathfinder platoons .
A number of commercial firms which have been supplying interrogators to the US army in Iraq boast of hiring former US special forces soldiers , such as Navy Seals .
" The crucial difference from Iraq is that frontline soldiers who are made to experience R2I techniques themselves develop empathy .
They realise the suffering they are causing .
But people who have n't undergone this do n't realise what they are doing to people .
It 's a shambles in Iraq " .
The British former officer said the dissemination of R2I techniques inside Iraq was all the more dangerous because of the general mood among American troops .
" The feeling among US soldiers I 've spoken to in the last week is also that ' the gloves are off ' .
Many of them still think they are dealing with people responsible for 9/11 " .
When the interrogation techniques are used on British soldiers for training purposes , they are subject to a strict 48 - hour time limit , and a supervisor and a psychologist are always present .
It is recognised that in inexperienced hands , prisoners can be plunged into psychosis .
The spectrum of R2I techniques also includes keeping prisoners naked most of the time .
This is what the Abu Ghraib photographs show , along with inmates being forced to crawl on a leash ; forced to masturbate in front of a female soldier ; mimic oral sex with other male prisoners ; and form piles of naked , hooded men .
The full battery of methods includes hooding , sleep deprivation , time disorientation and depriving prisoners not only of dignity , but of fundamental human needs , such as warmth , water and food .
The US commander in charge of military jails in Iraq , Major General Geoffrey Miller , has confirmed that a battery of 50 - odd special " coercive techniques " can be used against enemy detainees .
The general , who previously ran the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay , said his main role was to extract as much intelligence as possible .
Interrogation experts at Abu Ghraib prison were there to help make the prison staff " more able to garner intelligence as rapidly as possible " .
Sleep deprivation and stripping naked were techniques that could now only be authorised at general officer level , he said .

Today at lunch , a few of my colleagues got into a discussion of the merits of some of the new language features in the .
Net family .
Unfortunately , I was at the wrong end of the table to participate in the discussion , but it has spawned an article that I want to respond to .
Go take a look at it , then come on back .
To distill Ben 's thesis , he 's " annoyed that many of these ' cool ' language features in C# are nothing more than libraries in Smalltalk " .
I can understand his annoyance .
C# is being touted for having new , innovative language features while languages like Smalltalk get relatively little attention despite having similar features ( though usually as a part of a library ) for years .
Ben goes on to show how C#'s ??
operator ( which returns the left expression if that expression is not null , and otherwise returns the right expression ) can be added very easily to Smalltalk .
I guess this is why , despite all of its faults , I have a lot of trouble giving up on Smalltalk .
C#s a good language , and .
NETs a good framework ; but I cannot help but feel that this isnt an issue of reinventing the wheel , as much as forgetting that we can provide programmers the tools to make their own types of locomotion .
Unfortunately , I think he is missing the bigger point .
I do not disagree that giving programmers the ability to " make their own locomotion " is important .
It is , in fact , completely necessary if you want a language to have useful libraries .
But it is also a virtue when languages make it unnecessary to create a new five wheeled vehicle .
And we 've been there before .
There was a time when language designers seemed to think that a good language implemented a minimal set of features .
And from that mentality we got languages like C++ , which could n't even go as far as implementing a native string type .
In fact , there are so many that people have created comparison pages to help you figure out which one to use .
So while I can understand his frustration that Smalltalk has n't gotten the same attention as .
Net for features that are trivially implemented , I feel that his argument is analogous to saying that I should not be excited about Python having a built in string type because C++ has always had the ability to implement one .
The SHA - 3 Zoo ( work in progress ) is a collection of cryptographic hash functions ( in alphabetical order ) submitted to the SHA - 3 contest ( see also here ) .
It aims to provide an overview of design and cryptanalysis of all submissions .
A list of all SHA - 3 submitters is also available .
For a software performance related overview , see eBASH .
At a separate page , we also collect hardware implementation results of the candidates .
Another categorization of the SHA - 3 submissions can be found here .
The idea of the SHA - 3 Zoo is to give a good overview of cryptanalytic results .
We try to avoid additional judgement whether a submission is broken .
The answer to this question is left to NIST .
However , we categorize the cryptanalytic results by their impact from very theoretic to practical attacks .
A detailed description is given in Cryptanalysis Categories .
At this time , 56 out of 64 submissions to the SHA - 3 competition are publicly known and available .
51 submissions have advanced to round 1 , 14 submissions have made it into round 2 and 5 candidates have been selected for the final .
The following tables give a first impression on the cryptanalysis of the SHA - 3 candidates .
The tables only show the best known attack , more detailed results are collected at the individual hash function pages .
A description of the main table is given here .

Hundreds of civilians are being killed or seriously injured in artillery and gun attacks as the Sri Lankan army attempts to finish off the last Tamil Tiger rebels trapped in a shrinking pocket of land .
Injured civilians lucky enough to get out have told of carnage in this so - called " no - fire zone " - a 17 sq km strip of coast where the Tigers are penned in with their backs to the sea .
No
Horrific stories of limbs ripped off by shellfire and bodies buried where they fell are emerging , despite the government 's efforts to hide the scale of the killing by confining the injured to hospitals in a military area around the government - declared no - fire zone , from which the media are strictly excluded .
The casualties ' graphic accounts of a fierce onslaught on the no-fire zone , supported by the evidence of their severe wounds , have been reported by doctors who have treated them at a field hospital at Pulmoddai , inside the military area , where thousands of evacuees have been taken by ship .
According to the senior doctor handling the casualties for the Sri Lankan government as they arrive at Pulmoddai , shells are falling among the tightly packed tents and shelters that are home to tens of thousands of civilians , killing and wounding dozens every day .
" Most of the people have shell blast injuries and gunshot injuries .
Some people have lost their limbs , other people have lost other parts of the body , some people have wounds in the abdomen , some in the chest , " said Gnana Gunalan , a doctor who treats the flood of casualties as they arrive by Red Cross ship .
Gunalan , chairman of the local Sri Lankan Red Cross , said : " All these people are very badly traumatised .
Some have lost all their loved ones and come here alone , one boy losing both legs .
One girl came who had lost her husband and children and everybody . "
The doctor said the accounts of the evacuees appeared to support previous claims from doctors in the no-fire zone that the shelling had not come from Tamil Tiger positions in the zone .
The Sri Lankan government has vehemently denied firing into the zone , but it is not possible to verify the claims .
Gunalan - who is based in the town of Trincomalee , surrounded by heavy Sri Lankan army security - said that the field hospital at Pulmoddai had treated 1,468 casualties among the 5,456 people evacuated by sea from the no-fire zone in the last month .
Doctors say most of those killed have been buried near where they died and there has been no attempt to bring out the bodies .
Determined to resist international pressure to stop the fighting before it has finished off the hardcore rump of the Tamil Tigers cornered by the military , the Sri Lankan government has kept casualties away from the eyes of the world .
This weekend the government rejected an appeal by the UN to give civilians more time to leave the no-fire zone .
And last night the Sri Lankan military sources said 2,857 civilians had broken through Tamil Tiger lines and made their way to safety during the day .
They added that 5,000 people had tried to escape and had come under fire from the rebels .
But it was not possible to verify the reports because the military has denied access to the area surrounding the no fire zone .
Until last month the government allowed civilians injured in the no-fire zone to be taken to the larger hospital in Trincomalee , but then decreed that they must be kept inside the military area .
At Pulmoddai the most serious injuries are stabilised by a team of Indian doctors working in temporary metal huts .
By Friday , 26 had died at the Pulmoddai field hospital .
It is not possible to verify the doctors ' accounts , because neither side will allow access to the no-fire zone .
The military has permitted international media access on occasional day trips to the surrounding military area only .
The Observer was refused entry to the hospital , turned back at a checkpoint on the edge of Pulmoddai , and refused access to the camps where those who have escaped the fighting are being held .
Pulmoddai is two and a half hours ' drive north of Trincomalee , a journey involving countless military checkpoints .
Soldiers are everywhere , in bunkers or standing beneath trees watching the road .
No one can move without permission from the Defence Ministry .
However , reports continue to get through .
Two regional health directors , defying government instructions , have described at length the extent of the unfolding humanitarian disaster .
One , Thangamutha Sathiyamorthy , told the Observer on Friday that civilians were still being killed and injured by shelling inside the zone .
He also said there had been a number of attacks by helicopters .
He said the previous day , five people had died in the hospital from their wounds and a child of 13 had perished from the effects of diarrhoea .
He said many people had dug shelters in the sand to try to escape the shelling .
" The fighting is continuing .
Shells are falling .
But these people have no alternative .
They can not move .
Most of the injuries we are treating are from shells and bullets .
Today we received 58 injured civilians , including 16 children . "
Most of the Tamil Tiger fighters were on the front line , he said , but some were moving among the civilians , visiting family members or moving casualties .
He said Tamil Tiger police were still operating , attempting to control the crowds .
The Sri Lankan health secretary , Athula Kahandaliyanage , last week accused Sathiyamorthy and another doctor of spreading " malicious propaganda " , claiming their accounts " cannot be credible , since these officials are operating under duress and the dictates " of the Tamil Tigers .
The Health Ministry says both doctors will face disciplinary action .
But Sathiyamorthy denied he was under pressure from the LTTE .
" We are telling the truth .
The government has strongly asked us not to tell the truth , but we must . "
An unusual form of swine flu has been detected in seven people in the last few days , but government health experts say there is no cause for alarm or undue concern .
The new flu has symptoms very much like conventional influenza , and all seven victims have recovered fully , Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday in a telephone news conference .
It is susceptible to at least two antiviral agents , she said .
“ We do n’t think this is a time for major concern around the country , ” she added .
It is not clear whether the virus is new or whether it has been around for a while and has simply been recognized now because of more intensive laboratory testing and disease surveillance , she said .
It contains segments of human virus , avian virus from North America ( not the infamous bird flu ) and pig viruses from three continents .

The CDC announced this week that the virus had been found in a 10 - year - old boy in San Diego County and a 9 - year - old girl in Imperial County .
Schuchat said researchers had now identified it in a father and his teenage daughter in San Diego County ; a 41 - year - old woman in Imperial County ; and two 16 - year - old boys in Guadalupe County , Texas , near San Antonio .
Only the Imperial County woman was hospitalized .
Authorities could find no evidence of contact between the victims in Texas and California .
None of the seven had any exposure to pigs , which is the normal way of catching swine flu .
Officials thus think the virus is passed from person to person , which is unusual , but not unheard of , for swine flu .

Dr. Jonathan Fielding , Los Angeles County health officer , said no cases had been observed yet in the county , possibly partly because the symptoms are virtually indistinguishable from conventional influenza .
“ But now that we have these cases , we are significantly increasing our surveillance . . . and I would n’t be surprised if we had some cases here also , ” he said .
The United States has had two previous outbreaks of swine flu , one in 1976 and one in 1988 .
In both , the virus was passed from person to person , but the outbreaks were limited in scope .
“ Swine influenza has emerged and spread from person to person , but nothing has come of it , ” Schuchat said .
“ It spontaneously disappeared twice without causing any problems . ”
The U.S. also has a low background rate of swine flu infections , typically about one case every year or so .

From December 2005 to January of this year , however , CDC identified 12 cases .
In all but one , the victims were found to have had contact with pigs .
Although CDC officials say they are not overly concerned about the new virus , they are actively monitoring the situation .
“ Any time there is a new influenza virus that can be spread from person to person , public health officials get concerned , ” Schuchat said .
She emphasized that there was absolutely no risk of contracting the virus from eating pork products .
She also said that the influenza vaccine would probably provide no protection against the swine flu virus .

RICHMOND , B.C. - Police say a bloody man bound with duct tape managed to escape his kidnappers in Richmond , B.C .
The Mounties say they received several calls about the man running down a busy street before a Good Samaritan stopped to pick him up and drove him to the RCMP detachment .
Cpl. Nycki Basra says the man had been abducted from Burnaby and held for several days in Richmond before he managed to make his getaway Thursday .
Twenty - six - year - old Mark Anthony Bie of Vancouver , who is known to police , has been charged with unlawful confinement .

There is no doubt that online ads are hurting in our current economic recession .
And Google ’s ads , the main source of the company ’s income , are no exception .
So it should n’t surprise anyone that the company is thinking outside the box — literally .
Today , the AdSense team announced new expandable ad units .
If you ’ve used the Internet at all in the past few years , you ’ve undoubtedly already seen these from other ad providers .
They are ads that start out as regular box or rectangle ads , but then expand into much larger ones that sit on top of content .
Yes , they are annoying .
Luckily , unlike ads on sites like ESPN.com ( which are awful ) , Google ’s expanding ads wo n’t auto - expand or do so on a mouse roll - over .
They will only expand when the user clicks to interact with the ad .
And these ads could actually be somewhat useful in very specific circumstances .
For example , I ca n’t stand the tiny box ads that display movie trailers .
Sometimes I actually do want to watch the trailer , but why would I ever watch it on a tiny 200×200 ad space ?
With expandable ads , these movie trailer players could be made larger , as Google notes in its blog post .
Like other ads , these new expandable ones come in the cost - per - click ( CPC ) or cost - per - impression ( CPM ) variety .
Google has more info on its FAQ page .
Will these ad turn around the fortunes of the online ad market ?
No .
Will they take Google ’s ad revenues to new heights ?
Probably not .
But hey , it ca n’t hurt to try new things in a market like this , and seeing as they do n’t auto - expand , I have no problem with them .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As unemployed Americans struggle to find full - time work , many will have to settle for positions that are easier to come by - freelance .
Freelance professionals now make up more than a quarter of the U.S. working population , or 26 % , according to a survey by human resources consulting firm Kelly Services , Inc , up from 19 % in 2006 .
" As the economy contracts , there are not only more people looking for new ways of earning money , there are also more companies looking to make their employment practices more efficient , " said Rob Palmer , CEO of GoFreelance.com , a job search site for freelancers .
Freelance positions fill both needs .
For businesses , taking advantage of freelance labor is a means of saving money .
By hiring freelancers instead of full - time workers , firms can only pay for workers when they need them , in addition to cutting back on costly benefit plans .
" [ Employers ] can hire freelancers for short - term projects in response to changes in their market , without having to make a long - term commitment , " Palmer added .
But freelance jobs can be less cost effective for workers .
Freelance paychecks can be erratic , plus freelance workers are vulnerable during down times , as they are the often first ones cut when companies scale back .
Moreover , freelancers , who file taxes as self - employed workers , must pay out of pocket for their own health insurance , fund their own retirement plan and generally do n't qualify for unemployment insurance benefits .
James
Blome knows what that 's like .
Blome , 46 , was an executive vice president for a firm that specialized in selling agricultural products to retail stores .
He was laid off in January 2008 when the business dissolved and has been unable to find another full - time position .
" There are n't many executive - level , full - time jobs , " he said .
" Everyone is contracting . "
To make ends meet , Blome is freelancing for an investment bank based in New York that focuses exclusively on the agriculture sector .
But since the majority of the work is based on mergers and acquisitions , Blome was squeezed again when that market dried up .
" With fewer projects to work on , my salary has been impacted quite a bit , " he said .
Blome estimates that he now makes about 50 % less than he did when he was employed full time .
While Blome hopes to eventually get his own consulting firm off the ground , the major downsides to freelancing are " the lack of benefits and a consistent paycheck , " he said .
" The overarching disadvantage to being a freelancer is that you have to cobble together your own social safety net , " said Althea Erickson , a senior manager at the Freelancers Union , referring to the lack of benefits including health insurance .
For those trying to make it in the world of freelance , Erickson recommends creating a safety net first .
She advises workers to find an inexpensive group health insurance plan like the one offered through the Freelancers Union , contribute to an IRA , which offers tax - deferred growth on your savings , and pay quarterly estimated taxes that include Social Security and Medicare taxes .
But despite the challenges , for many , freelancing offers independence and mobility in their career paths .
" There are a lot of options out there , " said Kristen Sabol , a spokeswoman for Guru.com , an online marketplace for freelancers , but " you have to put them in place for yourself . "
Scott Fraser plans to do just that .
Fraser , 53 , looked for a full - time job in public relations for over a year since he was laid of from Blue Cross in December 2007 .
Now , he has two freelancing jobs to help cover his expenses and plans to launch his own public relations company in the near future and leave the job search behind .
" If you decide to do this , go full speed ahead , that 's my goal , " he said .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The financial crisis has weighed heavily on American households , and millionaires are no exception , according to a report released Wednesday .
The number of American households with a net worth of $ 1 million or more , excluding the value of their primary residence , fell 27 % to 6.7 million in 2008 from an all - time high of 9.2 million the year before , according to a report from market research firm Spectrem Group .
" America has a lot fewer millionaires than when this economic crisis began , " said George Walper , president of Spectrem Group , in a written statement .
But do n't weep only for the 2.5 million fewer millionaires .
The report , which is based on surveys of 3,000 affluent households , also showed the number of both multi-millionaires and aspiring millionaires plummeted last year .
Affluent households , defined as those with a net worth of $ 500,000 or more , declined 28 % to 11.3 million from 15.7 million .
Even the very rich have not been immune .
Households worth $ 5 million or more , excluding primary residence , fell 28 % to 840,000 last year from 1.16 million households in 2007 .
" The culprit is not just the stock market , which we all know has dropped precipitously , but broad declines in the asset classes available to the nation 's wealthiest investors , " Walper said .
Respondents said the average value of investments in their principal residence , mutual funds , managed accounts and IRAs all fell in 2008 versus 2007 , according to the report .
Millionaire households estimated that the financial crisis dented their net worth by between 30 % and 40 % .
And the survey 's measure of investor attitude fell to an all - time low .
With such a grim economic outlook , about 45 % of respondents said they have made changes to their investment portfolios .
A majority of respondents said they are shifting capital into safer assets such as cash .
But about 30 % of those surveyed , mostly younger households , indicated that they are still buying stocks .
The report did not bode well for financial advisers .
Only 36 % of those surveyed said they have a satisfactory relationship with their primary financial adviser .
That 's down from 85 % last year .
The swine flu scare has made it clear why Barack Obama picked Joe Biden for vice president .
As the White House ’s unfiltered talking head , Biden is the perfect warning bell to show the White House when things are veering out of control .
A kind of mental canary in the governmental mine shaft .
As the new strain of flu spread around the country , you could imagine the president going over a mental to - do list : Monitor situation carefully .
Check .
Make sure the medical infrastructure is working to prepare for any worst - case scenario .
Check .
Be careful not to scare the public silly so they start cowering in their homes , terrified to get on a plane or even board the subway .
Whoops .
“ If you ’re out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes , that ’s one thing .
If you ’re in a closed aircraft or a closed container or closed car or closed classroom , it ’s a different thing , ” Biden babbled happily on the “ Today ” show .
He also assured Matt Lauer that he had warned his family away from subways and that he “ would n’t go anywhere in confined places now , ” but unfortunately Lauer did not inquire whether the Oval Office counts as free range .
These days , one name is sure to be mentioned whenever theologians get together to share their thoughts with the wider world .
It is that of Richard Dawkins .
One of his achievements is to make the discussion of belief and non-belief respectable again .
His name was heard in the tents of the Hay festival on the day when much of the programme was devoted to religious matters .
The highlight was a conversation between Rowan Williams and AN Wilson about the Archbishop of Canterbury 's book Dostoevsky : Language , Faith and Fiction .
This was followed by the announcement of the winner of the Michael Ramsay prize , which is given for innovative theological writing aimed at a wider audience .
The £ 15,000 cheque was handed to Richard Bauckham for his book Jesus and the Eyewitnesses : The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony .
Whether Dawkins would approve of the discussions that were had as his name echoed off the canvas is another question .
For it does seem that new lines are being drawn in the debate between belief and non-belief .
In short , the initial dispute appears to be exhausting itself and in its place , a more subtle discussion is emerging .
The question is no longer simply , Does God exist ?
That has never admitted of a final answer anyway .
Instead , it is this :
What would it be like to live in a world without God ?
Rowan Williams explained that it is the genius of Dostoevsky to explore the consequences of modern atheism , particularly in The Brothers Karamazov .
The character Ivan is the atheist , and strikingly , it is he who utters the famous phrase , " Without God , everything is permitted . "
Ivan spends much of the novel voicing the reasons why God cannot be real , why divinity must be a delusion .
And yet , he also realises what the consequences of his atheism are .
If there is no longer any foundation for ethics , because there is no ultimate source of goodness , then human beings alone must choose how they will live .
Some people will choose to be good .
But others will not ; they will choose to be evil .
And it is not easy to say why they should not .
That is the nihilistic possibility of which 19th century writers like Dostoevsky , and others like Nietzsche , became very conscious .
The issue at stake here is not whether atheists can be good , Williams explained : clearly they can .
Rather , it is the realisation that human beings are on their own when grappling with how to live .
Who is going to decide what is good ?
Who is going to take responsibility when evil prevails ?
We must do so .
But are we up to the task ?
The responses that people have to this challenge have moved on since Dostoevsky 's time .
Today , it is much harder to believe that Enlightenment values can rid the world of superstition and irrationalism , so that a virtuous way of life can flourish .
In between Dostoevsky and us are the Nazi camps and other 20th - century horrors .
We now know that " people will not be taught not to commit stupidities , " Williams said with striking understatement .
Contemporary humanists and believers alike are waking up to the reality of that .
This is the more subtle discussion that is now coming to the fore .
Williams highlighted the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman as one literary contribution .
In Pullman 's books , all the children have daemons , imagined as animals with whom they continually converse .
The animals are like souls ; the conversations are what keep the kids human .
In the story , the evil Magisterium seeks brutally to sever the relationship between the children and their daemons , and so break the children themselves .
Pullman himself has the church in mind when he describes that dehumanising programme , though Williams interprets the action more generally to include any force – cultural or institutional – that seeks to turn human beings into automatons .
Totalitarian regimes are one example .
The scientistic conception of human beings as gene - transmitting machines would be another .
In the books that were shortlisted for the Michael Ramsay prize similar themes are explored too .
One asks how God might be found in the world , particularly in an age when the church clearly is not satisfying many people 's " immortal longings " .
Another sees human desire as at the heart of the religious impulse , desire defined as " love trying to happen " .
Another argues that what is important about the figure of Jesus is not so much what he said as what he did ; he provides a model for how we can relate to others .
One questioner asked whether we need new places to have these subtler conversations , places in which individuals can seek sophistication , and not just deliver knock - out blows .
The internet was raised as the obvious place .
It seems to me that Cif belief is playing its part in that too .

massingir is an unremarkable town .
The electricity supply here in rural Mozambique is erratic , clean water is hard to come by , and the hotels — well , calling them hotels is a little too polite .
The town center is two ragged blocks of colorful bars , stores , and market stalls arranged along a reddish sandy furrow — the main street — with goods packaged in the smallest possible quantities to match the pinched cash flow of local buyers : individual quarts of fuel in old bottles , spoonfuls of soap powder in bright little packets , single cigarettes , microcans of tomato paste and sardines , all laid out in creative patterns to catch the eye .
Babies doze in the shade while their mothers gossip , pausing on the way back from the unicef tent outside the shabby clinic ; loose - limbed teenagers play rough games of pool under a thatched roof by the side of the road .
Hardcore nature nuts sometimes pass through Massingir ; tourism has been picking up as word spreads of the giant Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park , a “ peace park ” that will merge the Mozambican wilderness of the nearby Limpopo National Park with South Africa ’s world - famous Kruger National Park ( just across the border ) and some adjacent Zimbabwean wildlands to make one of Africa ’s largest protected areas .
But I ’m here for something bigger than elephants .
This backwater is also the beachhead for an enormous project that promises to spend some $ 500 million , employ at least 2,000 people , and use nearly 75,000 acres of native woodland and savanna — an area five times the size of Manhattan — to grow sugarcane and produce ethanol for the growing global biofuel market .
Known as ProCana , it ’s an endeavor that could not just transform Massingir , but also , via a mess of land claims and conflicting promises , put at risk the transnational park and other significant conservation projects .
ProCana is just the first in a long line of massive biofuel projects backed by investors ranging from local speculators to multinational corporations like BP .
Some have asked the government — which legally owns all land here — for entire districts ( the equivalent of US counties ) .
Government officials told me that as of 2007 , biofuel investors had applied for rights to use about 12 million acres , nearly one - seventh the country ’s 89 million acres of arable land ; unofficial tallies are double that .
The message is clear :
This country , almost twice the size of California , is beckoning the plow .
ProCana and its ilk are the vanguard of an underreported land revolution — a movement that could reshape vast terrains and the livelihoods of millions as international agribusiness sets its sights on the cheap soil of Africa .
i find the big man of ProCana , Izak Cornelis Holtzhausen — Corné to his friends — in an unexceptional ’60s modernist office block in Maputo .
A secretary shows me to a small boardroom with new furniture , extremely shiny parquet floors , and a promotional banner for a new coal mining area along the Zambezi River .
Holtzhausen walks in , plants himself sideways at the table , and introduces himself with a charming smile ; as we talk , his chubby fingers spin a tiny cell phone in unbalanced orbits on the table .
Holtzhausen is the Mozambique manager of the Central African Mining & Exploration Company ( camec ) , which does what its name suggests and owns half of ProCana .
He wo n’t tell me who owns the other half ( “ Ask me next month ” ) , and he does n’t want to talk about camec at all .
There ’s been too much in the media about the company ’s allegedly corrupt mining deals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its connections with two notorious white Zimbabwean businessmen , Billy Rautenbach and John Bredenkamp , who were blacklisted by the US Treasury Department in November for their support of Zimbabwean despot Robert Mugabe .
( Six months after our interview , a British Virgin Islands - based company named BioEnergy Africa , led by top camec officials , bought 94 percent of ProCana ; Holtzhausen remains its head . )
An Afrikaner born and raised in South Africa ( he served in the apartheid - era army and often uses Afrikaans in conversation ) , Holtzhausen has taken Mozambican citizenship and married a Mozambican woman of color .
He believes in the place .
Many Afrikaners , he says , ask him for business connections in Mozambique .
“ Most of them are scum .
Absolute scum .
They go on about the bad black government over there , and when they start using the k - word ” — kaffir , the racist slur — ” I just put the phone down on them .
Afrikaners have caused a lot of trouble in Africa . ”
Mozambique is set to become a major biofuels producer , Holtzhausen assures me , and other agribusiness ventures are booming , too .
( Among other things , he has a stake in the country ’s growing beef industry . )
ProCana will process its cane in a Brazilian - built sugar - ethanol factory .
It will lay miles of track to link the plant up with the national rail network .
Eventually , trains will take about 9.5 million gallons of ethanol a month down to the Maputo harbor , where it will be pumped into tankers and shipped to Europe .
Once the operation is up and running , ProCana will be printing money .
Yes , Holtzhausen acknowledges before I even ask , he ’s putting his plantation in the driest part of Mozambique — but he ’s investing a fortune in efficient drip irrigation .
“ You ca n’t produce a green fuel and waste water , ” he says .
Still , ProCana will use 108 billion gallons of water per year , supplied via canal from the nearby Massingir Dam .
I ’ve heard that this has downstream farmers worried , but Holtzhausen says those stories are pure fiction : “ I ’ll give you a million bucks if you find me one of those farmers ! ” he brags , grinning broadly .
I ’ve also heard that much of the area ProCana aims to plant had previously been slated to complete the development of the peace park , but that Holtzhausen levered it away , leaving the project in chaos .
He laughs this off , too .
I tell him of rumors that he got his land rights because powerful people had equity in the venture .
( The story around Maputo is that Graça Machel , widow of Mozambique ’s first president and now wife of Nelson Mandela , is involved in ProCana — though verifying this is near impossible . )
“ No prominent people have invested in ProCana , ” he replies , after some thought .
“ But it will only be good for me if she did . ”
Machel is a friend , he says .
“ I would be honored to have her as an investor . ”
Another triumphant smile .
Despite Holtzhausen ’s disavowals , out in Massingir I discover that many of ProCana ’s 75,000 acres had indeed been slated rather precisely ( and publicly ) as part of planning for the Transfrontier Park .
Some 29,000 people still live within Limpopo National Park ’s borders , and as many as 9,000 in the heart of the park are supposed to be relocated .
After years of delicate negotiations , park authorities have arranged for the inner 9,000 to move to the valley of the Rio dos Elefantes , just downstream of Massingir Dam .
They have — as Mozambican law requires — obtained permission from “ receiving ” communities to build houses for the newcomers and , very important , identified a sufficiently large grazing area for the new residents ’ livestock .
A ProCana map I ’ve managed to obtain shows that the company ’s 75,000 acres cover this intended grazing zone .
The same chunk of land has been promised to both the inner 9,000 and ProCana .
How did this happen ?
I ’ll need a 4×4 and two interpreters ( Shangaan to Portuguese , Portuguese to English ) to find the answer .
a trip into the Rio dos Elefantes valley is a journey into a cliché of Africa : hardworking women in colorful cloth , relentlessly pecking chickens , and thin , lazy yellow - brown dogs scattered around circular grass - roofed huts .
In most village centers a hand - carved flagpole carries a Mozambican flag ( crossed hoe and Kalashnikov , nice bright colors ) .
Take away the occasional T - shirt , radio , and cell phone , and the ever - present cheap plastic buckets and chairs , and you have something like the Mozambique of 500 years ago .
Polygamy is common , many children and cattle are a sign of wealth , and the village leader and his elders are not to be crossed .
Villagers build their homes near a river , plant crops in the fertile floodplain , and graze cattle in the nearby savanna ; like about 70 percent of their compatriots , they rely on the land for their livelihood .
Mozambique was colonized by the Portuguese starting in the early 1500s ; they set up vast plantations whose laborers were kept in line with brutal corporal punishment .
In 1975 , after Portugal ’s Carnation Revolution , Mozambique was chaotically catapulted into independence .
The civil war that followed , one of the Cold War ’s many proxy conflicts , shattered the country ’s infrastructure and killed about a million people before petering out in 1992 .
To this day , bullet holes pockmark buildings , amputees beg along the roads , and crushing poverty saturates the country .
During one of my trips to Mozambique early last year , riots broke out a day after a high - profile visit by the president of the World Bank , who had congratulated the country on its success in becoming “ a major destination for foreign invest­ment . ”
Thousands took to the streets to protest skyrocketing prices ; Mozambique ’s staple food , corn , had become vastly more expensive as the United States turned an increasing percentage of its crop into ethanol .
“ It ’s important to remember that Mozambican independence was about liberating people and land , ” Diamantino Nhampossa , a land - rights activist , told me .
Mozambique ’s constitution decrees that all land is owned by the state .
Individuals and private companies can acquire rights to use parcels for 50 - year periods , but the country ’s sweeping Land Law requires them to find out if any local people are already using the land and , if so , obtain their permission for any project .
In theory , the law gives Mozambican peasants more power to determine their fate than their counterparts around the world .
In practice , as I was to discover , the arm of the law has limited reach .
driving down to the Rio dos Elefantes from Massingir along a rough track , I pass a rust - flecked sign announcing a relocation area for a community from the Limpopo park .
I stop in some villages along the land ProCana has claimed and , following protocol , ask to speak to the headman in each .
Everywhere , I hear versions of the same story .
Yes , people from the park are coming to live with us here , but we do n’t know when .
Yes , ProCana is taking a lot of land , but we think there will be enough for the project , the people , and their cattle .
In every village , I ’m told that ProCana has promised a house for the headman and jobs for others , but written evidence of those promises is nowhere to be seen .
Villagers have conflicting stories about how much land ProCana is taking ; some direct me to Ernesto Bandi Ngovene , traditionally the leading headman for the whole area .
I find him reclining in the shade outside his home , barely able to move after a stroke .
He has not been to the disputed land for a while , does not know how to read a map , and cannot say exactly how much land has been promised to the people from the park , or to ProCana .
One afternoon I run into a couple of village elders when their headman is n’t around .
They say that in the middle of their negotiations with the park , ProCana came along and took all the valley ’s headmen away for meetings .
These were not held in front of the communities or elders , as is customary .
Afterward , their headman told them that he ’d signed a paper giving ProCana a large piece of the village ’s land .
They have never seen this paper .
They do not want to give away their land , but ProCana came with powerful people , and they are afraid .
They have been told that they have rights under the Land Law , that they can say no to ProCana , but they do not have a copy of this law .
Can I please send them one ?
We drive in the 4×4 into ProCana ’s claim .
The bush rustles and sings ; birds are everywhere , and the savanna is filled with gray - barked and butterfly - leafed mopane trees , some of the biggest and oldest I have ever seen .
A giant baobab , centuries old , provides a backdrop for a screaming flock of parrots , while a black - breasted snake eagle hovers overhead .
Holtzhausen told me his environmental people found no trees of value here — charcoal burners , he said , cut them long ago .
I ’m not sure where those experts looked , because here , in the perfectly cadenced afternoon light , is paradise .
I ask the Limpopo park administrators in Massingir what they made of ProCana swiping the resettlement land from under their noses .
They wo n’t say much on the record except some boilerplate about it ’s being a fait accompli , about the resettlement ’s being delayed but not scuttled , and that ProCana ’s 2,000 jobs could be a good thing for the region .
Other locals tell me ProCana made it very clear that it had the support of “ important people , ” including President Armando Guebuza — a millionaire politician - businessman who has his fingers in many pies and flew to Massingir to officially open the project .
Ominous rumors even link Nyimpine Chissano , the late gangster son of former president Joaquim Chissano , to ProCana .
I try numerous times , to no avail , to get formal government comment on ProCana and Mozambique ’s broader plans for biofuels .
A few administrators do agree to talk — but only in secret .
“ ProCana were smart , ” one official with intimate knowledge of the Limpopo park relocation tells me .
“ They approached the leader of Chitar village ” — the stroke - hobbled Ngovene — ” first .
They made sure he said yes to the project because they knew the other chiefs in the valley would follow . ”
Details of land rights in the Massingir area prove hard to find , but after many quiet meetings I get my hands on several credible maps .
They tell a story of cascading land chaos following ProCana ’s arrival .
The company ’s claim on the Limpopo park land has left park officials scrambling to identify another place for the relocatees ’ cattle .
They ’ve found one — but much of this land was previously identified as a game reserve , in which a US conservation group had already allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The reserve project has now collapsed , and South Africans , Americans , and Mozambican military officers are claiming fragments of it for private safari operations .
On one map , a big chunk of land adjacent to ProCana ’s carries the legend “ Emelia Machel ” — apparently a relative of Graça Machel .
Local people tell me the Machel family keeps cattle there .
The maps make it clear that much of the land around Massingir has been allocated to two , sometimes three , different people or entities .
This is widespread in Mozambique ; in practice , land is owned by those who have the most influence , or the money to fence or patrol it , no matter what the documents say .
Foreign governments and donor agencies — which supply fully one - half the government ’s budget — generally wo n’t get involved in land disputes , even if these conflicts cause projects funded by their own donors ’ or taxpayers ’ money to go up in smoke ( or into Mercedes - Benzes and Hummers for the corrupt elite ) .
They refuse to upset the government — which , as it happens , is busy handing out rights to a string of potentially lucrative gas , oil , and coal deposits .
Carlos Castel - Branco , a respected local economist , tells me that the primary function of politicians in Mozambique is to mediate between competing private interests , including their own .
They lack both the political will and the administrative capacity , he says , to build a modern state .
The current land rush — for biofuel plantations , export - oriented farms , and private hunting concessions — is the first stage in a war over land that Mozambique ’s fragile democratic and legal systems might not survive .
“ The government is not politically capable of stopping this process of land speculation .
People feel that the dignity of the state and of themselves has been taken away .
It ’s not hopeless , but it ’s going to be a big fight . ”
I present a plausible nightmare scenario to ProCana ’s Corné Holtzhausen .
His 75,000 - acre farm / factory will have serious ecological impacts — lost wildlife habitat , greenhouse gases released as natural vegetation is destroyed , massive water consumption , fertilizer and pesticide pollution .
On the greater scale of Africa , these might be considered small , but ProCana is not alone .
What about the hundreds of other big investors who will rush in if he succeeds ?
Who will stop his beloved Mozambique , and much of the rest of the continent , from being turned into vast pesticide - and - fertilizer - soaked monocultures ?
He smiles , a great gotcha smile , and pauses .
“ People like you , ” he says .
“ People like you who wear cotton shirts that take 25,000 liters of water to make — you like to wear them , because they ’re comfortable .
People like you who drive private cars and like to fly around the world in aeroplanes .
The consumer .
That ’s who determines what happens . ”
I had a happy , but I sqwershed it

Russian Soccer Referee Gets Nailed In The Face By A Ball : Video
During a match between Amkar and Kuban in the Russian Premier - Liga , referee Almira Kayumov got a little bit too close to the action .
Following a stoppage , play restarted with a free kick , but the referee either was n’t ready for play to begin or simply was n’t paying attention .
Whatever the case , he got smacked in the head with the ball .
Someone get that man a shot of vodka , and he ’ll be just fine .

My dear friends ,
It ’s 4 AM here and I ’m dog tired .
I just finished uploading the book to lulu and it ’s now available for purchase .
Visit there and you can take a look at the back cover and index .
For those that do n’t know about it , Lulu.com is the world ’s largest print - on - demand company so it ’s pretty safe .
In the end it turned out to be a 250 page book , 98.000 words long .
At first I wanted to do a 50.000 word manual just with the basics and relating some personal experience but well , sometimes your creations take control of things and you just try to hang on .
These last few ( months ? )
I ’ve been just a holographic image in my house .
Writing this book absorbed all of my time .
I remember when I said I ’d try to finish the book by Christmas 2008 :) …
I ’m sorry for all these delays .
I never wrote a book before so I had no idea .
But well , thank God now it ’s done .
Thanks for all the support and suggestions .
I had lots of ideas thanks to you guys for a better cover but I just wanted to finish once and for all so I used what I had .
Read it several times but I ’m sure there ’s enough typo errors .
Given that English is my second language I did my best to make it as clear and error free as possible .
Sill , when you have nearly 100.000 words it ’s easy to make mistakes .
Other than that … the book rocks !:)
I know “ parents ” ca n’t be very objective but it ’s the kind of book I wish I had found myself a long time ago , but never did .
I ’ll nervously wait for the reviews but I think there ’s a bit for everyone .
Hard core survivalist , guy just getting started , or just for handing over to the girlfriend or wife .
Yes , I ’m definitely not objective :)
I ’ll wait and see what you guys think about it .
I ’ll leave the index here so you can have a better idea of what the book is about .
There are some things I use in the book that can be found in the blog as well .
The Emergency bag , edc , and altoids kit I just copied the lists .
I also used the article on SHTF gun cleaning since I think is good to have in the manual .
Other than that and maybe a couple more pages where I found myself writing the same thing twice , its all original content that I ’ve been writing for a long time .
The price is 29,95 .
I know there are cheaper books but I ’m doing the print on demand thing here .
Less than that an honestly , I could n’t have written the book .
I took a huge risk just by dedicating so much time to it with the hope that people would like it and it would sell well .
Again , I ’m sorry for the delays , as well as the unanswered emails and messages .
I ’ll go get some much deserved sleep now .
Again , thanks everyone for the support .
Hope you all have a nice Holy Saturday .
God bless you all .

Klare Allen , a once - homeless mother turned community activist , was stunned at a public meeting in 2002 when she and her friends learned that Boston University Medical Center officials planned to build a biological defense laboratory in one of the city ’s poorest neighborhoods .
“ We heard anthrax and Roxbury - South End , ” she recalled .
“ Then we heard Ebola .
The last thing we heard was bubonic plague .
We looked at each other and said , ‘ No way are they bringing that . . . into our community .’ ”
Seven years later , the $ 198 - million lab complex stands completed between an apartment building and a flower market .
But state and federal lawsuits by anxious residents , backed by skeptical scientists , have blocked the opening until late next year at the earliest .
The battle marks the first major setback in the vast growth since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks of labs authorized to research the world ’s most dangerous diseases .
It also underscores a growing debate over the safety and security of such labs -- and whether so many are needed .
Advertisement
Federal officials and scientists say the labs will not secretly create germ weapons , which the United States renounced in 1969 , but they are determined to stiffen America ’s defenses against pathogens that terrorists might use .
“ There ’s nothing military about this operation , ” said Dr. Mark Klempner , a microbiologist who heads the Boston lab .
“ We are scientists who are interested in defending the nation , and the world , against infectious diseases . ”
Klempner said the facility would conduct no classified research for the government , and would bar any attempt to make an organism more virulent .
“ There ’s nothing nefarious or hidden about this , ” he said .
The high - containment lab is deep inside the building , a 13,000 - square - foot vault behind foot - thick walls and blast - proof doors .
Negative air pressure will keep germs inside if a leak occurs .
Lab workers will wear fully enclosed , air - supplied moon suits .
Advertisement
But still opponents fear the accidental release of deadly toxins or organisms into a crowded urban area .
They also warn that the supply of “ hot ” strains in a lab may attract terrorists , or push other nations into a biological arms race .
In theory , bioweapons are inexpensive to produce , difficult to detect and capable of killing millions .
In practice , no terrorist group has launched a successful biological attack , and many U.S. experts believe the threat is vastly overstated .
“ This lab is part of the biodefense enterprise , ” argued Dr. David Ozonoff , a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health .
“ It ’s not a public health enterprise .
Its goal is to do research on biological weapons , even if it ’s defensive .
I trust my colleagues .
But no one knows how their research will be used . ”
Dan Goodenough , a biology professor at Harvard Medical School , worries that scientists may cut corners with safety rules .
“ Most of the time , it does n’t matter , ” he said .
“ In this case , it might . ”
Advertisement
A congressionally ordered , bipartisan study released in December provided ammunition to both sides .
It warned that the threat of bioterrorism , including the potential use of genetically modified viruses and germs , was rising .
But it also noted that no single federal agency regulates the labs , and that their “ rapid growth ” had “ created new safety and security risks . ”
Critics of the labs cite the 2001 anthrax attacks as proof that gates and guards cannot stop an insider who aims to do harm .
According to the FBI , a mentally unbalanced scientist at the U.S. Army ’s premier biodefense laboratory carried out the worst bioterrorist attack in U.S. history .
The anthrax researcher , Dr. Bruce Ivins , committed suicide last year before he could be charged with mailing the spores that killed five people and sickened 17 others .
Advertisement
Less known is a record of recent accidents across the country .
In the most serious case , Texas A&M ; paid a $ 1 - million federal fine last year after a citizens ’ group discovered that the university had failed to report that a researcher had been infected with the bacterium Brucella , which causes severe fever , and that others were exposed to Q fever , another infectious agent .
Most of the nation ’s high - security labs study diseases that are curable but could still be used in a terrorist attack , such as anthrax or tularemia .
The federal government is unable to say how many such labs exist , however .
A March report from the Congressional Research Service estimated the number to range from 386 to 630 .
The Boston facility is in a smaller group categorized as “ high - containment ” labs .
These handle only the most dangerous agents , such as Ebola and Marburg , for which no vaccines or treatments exist .
Advertisement
The United States operated five high - containment labs before 2001 .
It now has 15 , and several have come under criticism .
The University of Texas Medical Branch , for example , built a $ 174 - million facility similar in size and mission to the Boston lab .
It opened last fall in Galveston , just weeks after Hurricane Ike had ravaged the barrier island .
The lab suffered no apparent damage .
“ I have trouble understanding why they put a dangerous facility in such a vulnerable place , ” said Jim Blackburn , an environmental lawyer in Houston .
“ I do n’t know that it ’s unsafe .
But I do think it ’s unwise . ”
Officials at the National Institutes of Health , which provided most of the money to construct the Boston and Galveston labs , say they were designed to withstand hurricanes , earthquakes and other natural disasters .
Advertisement
Not everyone is convinced .
A group of Texas research facilities sued in federal court last month to block the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from building a $ 523 - million high - containment lab in Manhattan , Kan .
A tornado struck the town last year .
Citing the danger , the lawsuit seeks to move the proposed National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility to San Antonio .
At stake are hundreds of jobs , as well as research on hoof - and - mouth disease and other threats to crops and animals .
In Boston , a black steel fence surrounds the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories , as the complex is called .
No sign yet identifies the site to pedestrians .
Training is scheduled to start this summer , lab officials said .
But no work will begin unless U.S. District Judge Patti B. Sarris approves a risk assessment that the NIH has promised to deliver next year .
Two safety reviews have been rejected as inadequate .
Advertisement
Allen , who first challenged the project , said her neighbors do n’t plan to gamble if the lab is allowed to open .
“ We want the spacesuits that the lab workers are going to have , ” she said firmly .
“ That ’s the only way we ’ll be safe . ”

We Are Change Seattle
September 15 , 2008
We Are Change Seattle was able to catch up and chat with Janeane Garofalo .
We were curious where she was at since her Conan O’Brien piece where she mentions 9/11 being an inside job .
Also , her thoughts on the current bubble of Obama & McCain .
Garofalo clearly indicated the need for a new 9/11 investigation , but had doubts that any truth would emerge from any official efforts for many , many years to come , slamming the 9/11 Commission ’s “ pitiful ” investigation , which was never meant to uncover the truth .
Garofalo suggested that the real truth was 20 - 30 years away from being officially revealed in declassified documents and / or other means of investigation .

LOS ANGELES–American soldiers serving in Vietnam wondered what they were fighting for .
U.S. troops in Afghanistan do n’t have that problem .
They know exactly what they ’re fighting for : rapists .
After President Obama ’s coming “ Afghan surge ” there will be 72,000 soldiers in Afghanistan .
Their primary mission is to prevent Afghans from overthrowing the unpopular regime of Hamid Karzai , the former oil consultant installed by George W. Bush when the U.S. occupation began nearly eight years ago .
America ’s media repeatedly claimed that Afghan women would be better off under the U.S. - supported Northern Alliance puppet government headed by Karzai than under the Taliban .
But when I went to Afghanistan and asked women what they thought , they had a different story .
The defeat of the Taliban brought about the collapse of law and order , making life even more dangerous , especially for women .
“ Under the Taliban , ” a woman told me , “ I watched rapists being executed .
Now I see them in the government . ”
The Afghan women ’s rights group RAWA has repeatedly told anyone willing to listen that there has n’t been much improvement for women and girls since the U.S. occupation began in 2001 .
But no one –least of all left - of - center Americans eager to embrace the Afghan war–has wanted to hear what they had to say .
“ Most women still wear the all - encompassing burqa through fear of attack and social pressure , a third of women in Kabul do not leave the house , forbidden from doing so by the male members of the family , and it is still almost impossible for women to get a divorce , ” reported The Sunday Herald in 2005 .
Liberal Democrats who cling to Afghanistan as “ the good war ” the U.S. should be fighting are being forced to confront the ugly truth about their ally .
Karzai has signed a law that states that “ women cannot leave the house without their husbands ’ permission , that they can only seek work , education or visit the doctor with their husbands ’ permission , and that they cannot refuse their husband sex , ” reported the British newspaper The Guardian on March 31st .
The Shiite Personal Status act applies only to devotees of the Shia branch of Islam , which account for between 10 and 20 percent of the population .
How can a secular democratic state have different laws depending on a citizen ’s faith ?
The answer is :
It can ’t .
Afghanistan is n’t secular or democratic .
The “ new ” Afghanistan ’s constitution is based on Sharia law–exactly as it was under the Taliban .
But the U.S. media has purposefully failed to report the icky truth about our ally .
The new law requires women to have sex with their husbands at least once every four days unless they are sick or menstruating .
“ Obedience , readiness for intercourse and not leaving the house without the permission of the husband are the duties of the wife , ” reads the law of a nation ostensibly invaded by U.S. troops in part to liberate Afghan women .
“ As long as the husband is not traveling , he has the right to have sexual intercourse with his wife every fourth night , ” it says .
Afghan Senator Humaira Namati calls the rape bill “ worse than during the Taliban ” and said it was rammed through parliament without debate .
“ Anyone who spoke out was accused of being against Islam , ” she said .
Several hundred women protesting the law on the streets of Kabul were viciously assaulted by men as police stood back and watched .
In fairness to the responsible male legislators , they did add a provision to protect Shiite women from “ dead bed ” : Afghan men have to put out “ at least once every four months . ”
Karzai signed legalized rape into law in order to appease right - wing legislators in an election year .
After international criticism , however , he began backpedaling with the lamest of all possible reasons : he did n’t read the bill before he was for it .
“ I was not aware of what I had signed , ” Afghan parliamentarian Sabrina Saqib said Karzai told her .
The legislation “ has so many articles , ” Karzai told CNN .
“ Now I have instructed , in consultation with clergy of the country , that the law be revised and any article that is not in keeping with the Afghan constitution and Islamic Sharia must be removed from this law . ”
As Karzai BSes for the cameras , hundreds of Afghan women languish in prisons around the country .
Their crime ?
They ’re teen brides , some as young as 10 , who ran away from much older husbands who purchased them .
“ In President Hamid Karzai ’s Afghanistan , women are still imprisoned for running away from home , ” reports The Sunday Herald .
Nice theocracy you got there , Mullah Karzai .
Remember this column the next time you watch a flag - draped coffin returning from Afghanistan .
The young man inside that box did n’t die for nothing .
He died to protect rapists .

Eight years wasted
May 19 , 2009 by lestro
by lestro
Today , the president announced plans to change the mileage standards on American cars , increasing them 30 percent in the next eight years .
Which , I admit , is a lot .
It ’s going to take some serious work .
But it will be worth it on many fronts .
Here ’s what the pres said today :
And that ’s why , in the next five years , we ’re seeking to raise fuel - economy standards to an industry average of 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016 , an increase of more than eight miles per gallon per vehicle .
That ’s an unprecedented change , exceeding the demands of Congress and meeting the most stringent requirements sought by many of the environmental advocates represented here today .
As a result , we will save 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the lifetime of the vehicles sold in the next five years .
Just to give you a sense of magnitude , that ’s more oil than we imported last year from Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , Libya , and Nigeria combined .
( Applause . )
Here ’s another way of looking at it :
This is the projected equivalent of taking 58 million cars off the road for an entire year .
That got me to thinking : that ’s a whole lot of foreign oil we would no longer be dependent on .
And the sooner we start , the more we save .
And it ’s not only as individual consumers when our cars go further on the same amount of gas ( for you American car owners , ask a foreign car owner what that ’s like … ) , but also as a nation when we reduce our dependency on foreign oil , and maybe we can stop wasting so much blood and treasure fighting over sand dunes that happen to have oil deposits below them .
It got me to thinking about how this administration actually doing something about it .
That ’s a tremendous change from any prior administration since Jimmy Carter , who was laughed at for telling us to conserve energy ( and wearing the sweater ) and invested heavily in alternate energy until Reagan and his oil money knocked the whole thing down , setting us back about 28 years .
Within 130 days of taking office , Obama actually set new standards , which will work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil .
Bush never did that , despite talking about it until his fool head nearly fell off .
2008 State of the Union :
To build a future of energy security , we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology .
Our security , our prosperity , and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil .
2007 SOTU :
Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America ’s economy running and America ’s environment clean .
For too long , our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil .
And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy .
It ’s in our vital interest to diversify America ’s energy supply .
The way forward is through technology .
We must continue changing the way America generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology , solar and wind energy , and clean , safe nuclear power .
We need to press on with battery research for plug - in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel .
We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol , using everything from wood chips to grasses to agricultural wastes .
note please , that increasing fuel standards never gets mentioned .
2006 SOTU , and this one was a big , big deal at the time :
Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy .
And here we have a serious problem : America is addicted to oil , which is often imported from unstable parts of the world .
The best way to break this addiction is through technology .
Since 2001 , we have spent nearly $ 10 billion to develop cleaner , cheaper , and more reliable alternative energy sources .
And we are on the threshold of incredible advances … .
We must also change how we power our automobiles .
We will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollution - free cars that run on hydrogen .
We ’ll also fund additional research in cutting - edge methods of producing ethanol , not just from corn but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass .
Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within 6 years .
Again , note that “ increase fuel standards ” never comes up as a way to save oil .
He only goes with big - ticket ideas he knows will never get through congress .
2005 SOTU , though in this one he did n’t actually say “ oil ” :
My Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens .
And my budget provides strong funding for leading - edge technology – from hydrogen - fueled cars , to clean coal , to renewable sources such as ethanol .
Four years of debate is enough – I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy .
For the record , the “ Clear Skies ” legislation actually allowed the largest polluters in the country to pollute more by actually changing the standards and creating loopholes for said polluters .
It ’s part of the Bush Doublethink Series that brought you “ Healthy Forests ” and the “ Patriot ” Act , all three of which do almost exactly the opposite of what they are called .
2004 SOTU :
Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run , so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system , promote conservation , and make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy .
For the record , the 2004 Republican Party Platform does n’t contain anything about fuel efficiency , although they did want clean energy by drilling in ANWR .
2003 SOTU :
Tonight I ’m proposing $ 1.2 billion in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean , hydrogen - powered automobiles .
A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy , which can be used to power a car , producing only water , not exhaust fumes .
With a new national commitment , our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom , so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution - free .
Join me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy .
I like that one .
He ’s gearing up for reelection and is still trying to snow us into thinking he gives a damn about the air as well as the foreign oil .
But again , no mention that we could be less dependent on foreign oil by increasing standards .
Instead , he went pie - in - the - sky , proposing BIG MONEY on something he knew would n’t affect his oil buddies .
2002 SOTU :
Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy .
This Congress must act to encourage conservation , promote technology , build infrastructure , and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil .
2001 Address to Congress :
We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation , and we must .
America must become more energy independent , and we will .
But we ca n’t pin it totally on Bush ( though for most of his presidency he had both houses of Congress and the Court in his pocket and could – and often did – get away with literally anything ) .
Or can we ?
Here ’s Bubba in 2000 ( on his way out , mind you ) :
I also ask the auto industry to use the available technologies to make all new cars more fuel - efficient right away .
It goes on basically the same through the ranks until you get to Jimmy Carter , who actually was concerned with this issue for real , having been president through the Gas Crisis of the 70s .
The first mileage standard was introduced in 1978 : 18 mpg .
It steadily rose to 27.5 in 1985 before dropping , inexplicably ( Reagan , I am looking at you ) to 26 again before going back up to 27.5 in 1990 and then staying there until today , when the president announced it would go up 30.2 in 2011 and continue up to 42 in 2016 .
But imagine if instead of just talking about reducing our dependence on foreign oil for the past three decades – especially the last eight years when foreign oil was at the forefront of almost every policy discussion – by doing something simple like increasing standards .
Five years from now , we ’ll be glad we did instead of just talking about it and wasting another 1.8 billion barrels of oil .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California ’s main source of irrigation water is expected to go dry this year for most of its growers due to drought , idling at least 60,000 workers and up to 1 million acres of farmland , federal officials and experts said on Friday .

The zero allocation for most of the farmers who buy water from the federally managed Central Valley Project was declared as California water officials repeated their plans to cut amounts supplied from a separate state - run water system to 15 percent of normal .
The drought - forced cutbacks are a huge blow to thousands of farmers in the Central Valley , which produces over half of the fruit , vegetables and nuts grown in the United States .
Higher prices are likely for a wide range of crops as a result .
The Central Valley , a fertile but arid region stretching some 500 miles from Bakersfield to Redding , is the agricultural heartland of California , which ranks as the nation ’s No. 1 farm state in terms of the value of crops produced -- more than $ 36 billion a year .
The principal source of water for farms and ranches in the valley is the federally built and managed CVP , a vast network of dams , pumping stations and canals that collects runoff from the Sierra Nevada mountain range and delivers it to irrigation districts throughout the region .
A recent forecast by University of California economists projected losses of 60,000 to 80,000 jobs and over $ 2 billion in income from a scenario like the one announced on Friday .
The state unemployment rate already tops 9 percent , well above the national average .
‘ IT DOESN ’T GET WORSE ’
Richard Howitt , a co-author of that study , said he expected that 850,000 acres of land would be left dry and fallow , and another 2 million acres would grow less food than normal .
His analysis assumes farmers will make greater use of groundwater to help offset cutbacks from the state and federal government .
Officials at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation , which runs the CVP , estimated that 1 million acres , roughly a third of the land irrigated by the system , would be put out of production .
Agency spokeswoman Lynnette Wirth called the situation “ grim . ”
“ It does n’t get any worse than zero , ” California Farm Bureau Federation President Doug Mosebar said in a statement .
“ Our water reliability has hit rock bottom . ”
He called on state authorities to take any steps possible to ease the situation , including ensuring that short - term water sales and transfers between farmers can proceed smoothly .
The Westlands Water District , the largest on the CVP and the nation ’s largest overall , encompasses just over 700 farmers on 600,000 acres of land , two - thirds of which will be idled by the cutoff in water supplies , spokeswoman Sarah Woolf said .
She said layoffs already have begun in anticipation of the cutbacks .
Some growers will do their best to get by with unused water supplies left over from last year and local groundwater .
Federal officials say allocations might be increased later in the year to 10 percent of contracted amounts , but only if an unexpectedly large amount of rain and snow falls .
The CVP last declared a zero supply in 1992 , but farmers ultimately received 25 percent of their normal allotment that year after conditions improved , Wirth said .
Despite a recent flurry of winter storms , California is in the third year of a drought shaping up as the state ’s worst ever .
The snowpack in the Sierras remains far below normal , and reservoirs fed by mountain runoff are badly depleted as well .
Complicating matters are federal court restrictions on water that can be pumped from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta in Northern California , which furnishes much of the state ’s irrigation and drinking supplies , in order to protect endangered fish species .
I found this fascinating aside in a 1969 article on ‘ Psychiatric Illness in the Clergy ’ about a group of monks who underwent psychoanalysis , causing two thirds of them to realise they were “ called to married life ” .
The Pope immediately banned psychoanalysis from the priesthood as a result :
[ Bovet ] suggests that many clergy would benefit from psychotherapy during their training .
This was attempted in Mexico when in 1961 a group of 60 Benedictine monks underwent group and individual psychoanalysis .
However , of the original 60 monks taking part in this experiment , only 20 are still monks ; and of the 40 who have left the monastery it is reported that “ there are some who realized that they were really called to married life ” ( Lemercier , 1965 ) .
The Papal Court answered this “ threat ” the following decree : “ You will not maintain in public or in private psychoanalytical theory or practice , under threat of suspension as a priest , and you are rigorously forbidden under threat of destitution to suggest to candidates for the monastery that they should undergo psychoanalysis ” ( Singleton , 1967 ) .
This would not be the last time psychotherapists cause stirrings in the faithful .
The book Lesbian Nuns , Breaking Silence contains a chapter by the former Sister Mary Benjamin of the Immaculate Heart of Mary convent in California .
Psychotherapists Carl Rogers and William Coulson arranged for the nuns to take part in encounter group , essentially a form of fashionable 60s group psychotherapy aimed at well people rather than patients for ‘ personal growth ’ .
The effect was disastrous for the convent , with hundreds of the nuns defaulting on their vows , and several , including Sister Mary Benjamin , discovering repressed lesbian desires .
The convent eventually collapsed and was closed in 1970 .
There ’s a brief online article that also recounts this story and I was intrigued to see a footnote at the end :
Having abandoned his once lucrative career , Dr. William Coulson now lectures to Catholic and Protestant groups on the dangers of psychotherapy , with a particular emphasis upon the “ encounter group ” dynamic .
There ’s a whole novel right there in that footnote .

The chief executive of the company that installs the majority of speed cameras on Britain 's roads was banned from driving for six months today after admitting driving at more than 100mph .
Tom Riall , the boss of Serco 's civil government division , which supplies and installs the Gatso fixed radar cameras to police forces , was travelling at 102.9 mph on the A14 in Newmarket , Suffolk , just before 1 pm on 4 January , magistrates in Sudbury heard .
The speed limit on the dual carriageway is 70 mph .
Riall , 49 , had two other driving convictions from the last three years , including another speeding offence , the court heard , meaning the six - point penalty imposed by magistrates took him past the 12 - point mark , incurring the ban .
He was also fined £ 300 .
Riall , who took part last year in a road safety campaign called Safe Drive Stay Alive , told the court he would like formally to apologise , saying : " In my role I am all too aware of the consequences of speeding . "
Riall said he was driving to visit friends in Newmarket before a business meeting in Norwich and the road was clear .
He asked magistrates not to impose a ban , saying it would cost about £ 30,000 to employ drivers to take him on business trips during the six months , and that the speeding offence had already caused " some considerable personal embarrassment " .
He said : " Of course , while I have had a number of fixed penalty notices in the past , this is the first time I have exceeded the speed limit to this degree . "
The magistrates rejected this , saying a six - point penalty was fair .
Serco , which has installed about 4,500 speed and traffic light cameras since 1992 , began as a defence firm and over the years has won a series of lucrative government contracts in areas which also include prisons , leisure centres and NHS facilities .
Riall , who joined Serco four years ago and became chief executive in January 2007 , is a former soldier who served in Northern Ireland and Cyprus before entering the business world .
Renowned film composer Maurice Jarre , who won the Academy Award three times for his epic scores , has died at 84 .
He was best known for his soundtrack to Dr. Zhivago , but he composed over 100 scores in his career .
Maurice Alexis Jarre was born Sept. 13 , 1924 , in Lyon , France .
He studied music at the Paris Conservatory , where his teachers included the Swiss composer Arthur Honegger , the timpanist Félix Passerone and Joseph Martenot , the inventor of an electronic keyboard , a predecessor of the synthesizer .
Jarre married four times ; he is survived by his wife , Fong , whom he married in 1984 .
Other survivors include two sons , synthesist Jean - Michel , and Kevin , a screenwriter ; and a daughter , Stéfanie .
Though Mr. Jarre had lived in the United States for decades , the president of France , Nicolas Sarkozy , issued a statement after his death , calling Mr. Jarre “ a great composer ” who , by working in film , “ broadened the public for symphonic music . ”
“ He showed everyone that music is just as important as images for the beauty and success of a film , ” said French President Nicolas Sarkoz .
While Jarre ’s son Jean - Michel Jarre is better known for his synthesizer music , Maurice Jarre helped pioneer the use of synthesizers in film soundtracks .
Here ’s a segment from the German dub of Witness , 1984 , that demonstrates Jarre ’s use of synths in soundtracks :

" Known to Man " and the advent of the space aliens
Last week I wrote about how I was systematically changing the phrase " known to man " to just " known " in Wikipedia articles .
Two people so far have written to warn me that I would regret this once the space aliens come , and I have to go around undoing all my changes .
But even completely leaving aside Wikipedia 's " Wikipedia is not a crystal ball " policy , which completely absolves me from having to worry about this eventuality , I think these people have not analyzed the situation correctly .
Here is how it seems to me .
Consider these example sentences :
Diamond is the hardest substance known to man .
Diamond is the hardest substance known .
There are four possible outcomes for the future :
Aliens reveal superhardium , a substance harder than diamond .
Aliens exist , but do not know about superhardium .
The aliens do not turn up , but humans discover superhardium on their own .
No aliens and no superhardium .
In cases ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , both sentences require revision .
In case ( 4 ) , neither sentence requires revision .
But in case ( 2 ) , sentence ( a ) requires revision , while ( b ) does not .
So my change is a potential improvement in a way I had not appreciated .
Also in last week 's article , I said it would be nice to find a case where a Wikipedia article 's use of " known to man " actually intended a contrast with divine or feminine knowledge , rather than being a piece of inept blather .
I did eventually find such a case : the article on runic alphabet says , in part :
In the Poetic Edda poem Rígþula another origin is related of how the runic alphabet became known to man .
The poem relates how Ríg , identified as Heimdall in the introduction , ...

I expect the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , a newspaper I ’ve long admired , to go belly up — even though I have no specific information about its finances and whether it is , indeed , in danger of folding .
But this week , it gave its product to me for free .
I would have gladly paid up to 5 cents to read just one of its stories .
But the JS did n’t charge me .
What kind of business model allows me to consume a product for free ?
I learned of the story through an e-mailed version of Romenesko , the legendary ( or infamous , depending on your POV ) , media news page at Poynter .
org , the Web site of the Poynter Institute , a journalism think tank .
The Poynter e-mail contained this tease : “ Wisconsin university football coach bans student reporters ( http://www.jsonline.com/business/43539347.html).”
I clicked on the link and — ta da — there it was , a story written by JS reporter Don Walker .
Free .
Did n’t have to pay a penny .
And I would have .
Gladly .
I know this is n’t a rare phenomenon .
I suspect you ’ve read news for free online , too .
Bet you kinda expect it to be free , even demand that it be free .
Perhaps you think it ’s some kind of birthright .
But in the long run , if you do not pay for the product of professional journalists , you will lose one of your best defenses against secrecy , corruption , and tyranny .
Those who wish to keep information from you , those who demand or offer kickbacks and bribes to get what they want , those who wish to secretly manipulate the levers of power unfairly for selfish financial advantage , those who wish to attain and maintain power over you … they ’re winning .
They ’re winning because fewer and fewer journalists are keeping an eye on them , holding them accountable for their words and actions .
Remember , that ’s the deal the Founders gave the press :
Hold government accountable , and we ’ll protect you from government intervention .
If you do n’t pay for the product produced by professional journalists who cover the “ eat - your - spinach ” stories bloggers do n’t , wo n’t , or can ’t , then do n’t complain if the powerful and influential take advantage of the lack of scrutiny formerly provided by the 5,900 journalists who lost their jobs last year .
In 1990 America ’s daily newspapers had 56,900 staffers , very close to the historical high , according to the American Society of Newspaper Editors .
Newspapers were cash cows for investors , with profits north of 20 percent .
In 2000 , the population of journalists at dailies was still high — 56,400 .
Then the Internet came , folks say , and stole all the advertising revenue .
Profit margins have been halved — as revenue has dropped precipitously .
( Of course , it ’s not as simple as that .
Apparently , bad management and arrogance had much to do with the decline of circulation , and hence the declining advertising revenue , of daily newspapers .
In effect , corporate newspaper management shot itself in the foot as it bad - mouthed the Internet as an irrelevant upstart . )
To attempt to maintain the profitability of that now - highly suspect business model , newspaper managements whacked jobs — the very jobs that produce the product those executives presumably want to sell .
This has to be among the dumbest responses to economic stress in corporate history .
At the end of 2008 , only 46,700 journalists were left at the America ’s daily newspapers .
2009 is off to a rough beginning : The Web site Paper Cuts reports that about 8,500 newspaper staffers ( including journalists ) have been laid off or bought out as of mid-April .
( Paper Cuts is a Web site by Erica Smith , who has been tracking newspaper layoffs since 2007 . )
It is possible that by 2010 , the number of daily print journalists will have been halved in only a decade .
Surely that ’s not a positive development for the democratic health of the Republic .
Interestingly , the nation ’s premier journalism graduate programs are seeing marked increases in applications : Columbia , up 38 percent ; Stanford , 20 percent ; and NYU , 6 percent .
But these new students are not necessarily seeking to become journalists .
Says Jim O’Brien , director of Northwestern University ’s Medill Career Services office :
Corporate communications is a growth area in terms of opportunities for jobs for our MSJ grads .
Both corporations and nonprofits who are interested in communications , where they had typically looked at an English major before , are now thinking that a journalism grad might have leg up on those candidates because of their training .
This is a two - pronged blow to “ eat - your - spinach ” news .
First , newspapers are shedding the very people trained — and paid — to do that .
Second , former journalists and others are seeking graduate journalism degrees to become corporate communicators .
That means fewer professionally trained and experienced journalists are digging for information corporations and governments wish to hide , and more smart people are being trained — and , eventually , paid handsomely — to do the hiding .
They ’re winning .
Democracy is losing .
Please consider that next time you read a news story online — for free .
It may be , in the long run , a very costly read .
In 1901 , Nikola Tesla began work on a global system of giant towers meant to relay through the air not only news , stock reports and even pictures but also , unbeknown to investors such as J. Pierpont Morgan , free electricity for one and all .
It was the inventor ’s biggest project , and his most audacious .
The first tower rose on rural Long Island and , by 1903 , stood more than 18 stories tall .
One midsummer night , it emitted a dull rumble and proceeded to hurl bolts of electricity into the sky .
The blinding flashes , The New York Sun reported , “ seemed to shoot off into the darkness on some mysterious errand . ”
But the system failed for want of money , and at least partly for scientific viability .
Tesla never finished his prototype tower and was forced to abandon its adjoining laboratory .
Today , a fight is looming over the ghostly remains of that site , called Wardenclyffe — what Tesla authorities call the only surviving workplace of the eccentric genius who dreamed countless big dreams while pioneering wireless communication and alternating current .
The disagreement began recently after the property went up for sale in Shoreham , N.Y .
For a long time now , Android and the T - Mobile G1 have been pretty much synonymous , defining not only form - factor but functionality of what makes a “ Google Phone ” .
Gatecrashing that arrangement comes the HTC Magic , second Android smartphone to reach the market and the slimmer , prettier sibling to the G1 , bringing with it the latest iteration of the Google OS , version 1.5 “ Cupcake ” .
Expectations for both hardware and software have been huge ; read on for the Android Community opinion .
In the box there ’s the Magic itself , a 1,340 mAh battery , 2GB microSD card , AC adapter , USB cable , wired stereo headset , hands - free adapter ( for using your own 3.5 mm headphones ) and a leather - effect pouch .
The Magic measures 113 x 55.56 x 13.65 mm ( 4.45 x 2.19 x 0.54 inches ) and weighs 116g ( 4.09 oz ) with the battery ; that makes it shorter , slightly narrower and – most importantly – thinner than the T - Mobile G1 , as well as lighter .
The reason for that reduction is the absence of a hardware keyboard , of course , though in keeping with Google ’s Android requirements there are a fair few buttons on the curved front panel .
As well as the trackball ( which lights up when messages are received ) there ’s a Home key , Menu key , back and search , together with call and end buttons .
As for that curve , it ’s less pronounced than the G1 ’s jutting chin , and cups the ball of the thumb nicely .
The only other hardware control is the volume rocker , a narrow strip on the top left - hand side .
Primary navigation , then , is done via the 3.2 - inch capacitive touchscreen , ostensibly the same as on the G1 .
It ’s a bright and responsive panel , evenly backlit , and the size and shape of the Magic now makes it far more reasonable to use the phone one - handed .
Since there ’s no hardware keyboard , the Magic could n’t avoid but come with Android OS 1.5 Cupcake .
That update , preloaded on all Magic handsets , brings with it an on - screen QWERTY keyboard , usable in both portrait and landscape orientations .
Google have obviously learned from other on - screen keyboards in circulation , as the most - requested features are in place .
Tapping a button pops up a preview of that letter , visible above your thumb or finger , and you can change your selection by dragging across to another key .
As you type , the Magic suggests words in a scrolling bar above the keyboard ; it does a decent job of avoiding misspellings , but unwanted corrections are easily amended by hitting the backspace key and choosing the word as - entered .
Upright , it ’s possible to type with reasonable accuracy with one - hand , making Android far more usable when walking or holding a bag .
In landscape orientation , two - handed thumb typing – cradling the Magic in your fingers – is straightforward , and we ’re pleased to see the accelerometer - based screen rotation extended to many more apps throughout the platform ( although it only rotates 90 - degrees to the left , not to the right ) .
The homescreen and the dialer do n’t support rotation , but other than that it ’s pretty much spread throughout the OS .
If the inbuilt keyboard is n’t to your liking , third - party versions can be downloaded via the Android Market ; there are already more than a hundred to choose from .
The next significant addition from Cupcake is in the Magic ’s imaging abilities .
The same 3.2 - megapixel autofocus camera is on offer – HTC claim to have tweaked the software processing , but there ’s still no flash or even an LED light – but now it supports video capture and playback .
Sharing media is also made quicker , thanks to integration with YouTube and Picasa .
Enter your login details for an account with either service , and the “ Share ” option in the gallery allows one - touch uploads in addition to sending image / video attachments via email or MMS .
Other apps can also add their own media sharing options to that list ;
Twitter client Twidroid , for instance , lets you instantly create a new photo tweet from a shot you ’ve just taken .
Cupcake speeds up the camera load - time , and both shutter delay and saving time are reduced , but of most interest will be the video recording .
Shooting video is pretty much the same as taking photos – hit the record button to stop and start , tap the thumbnail to review – with the Magic recording in 3GPP format .
Quality is reasonable for a cellphone – we ’ll have a follow - up post with sample video and images – but wo n’t be replacing any standalone camcorders or even the video mode on a point - and - shoot camera .
As on the G1 , outdoor scenes with plenty of light produce the best results , both for stills and video .
Nonetheless , it ’s good to see the facility finally officially added to Android .
Slightly less obvious , but no less welcome , OS 1.5 brings with it a new WebKit browser engine and JavaScript engine , reducing page render times .
What ’s not included is the trick circular zoom control that showed up in Cupcake preview videos ; instead , since Google still wo n’t enable multitouch support in Android , it ’s down to the same zoom in / out controls as before .
These work , but we ’d rather have the zoom scroll bar in more recent builds of Opera Mobile , that permits more granular control over magnification level .
The address bar has now merged with the search bar , offering Google search results , entries from the history and new address entry in one place , a system which works well .
There ’s also a text search function , which flags up matches as you type rather than waiting for you to hit enter .
In all , the browser is less impressive than Mobile Safari on the iPhone ; we particularly miss the way you can double tap on a block of text , and have the page perfectly render to fit it on - screen .
The Magic almost achieves that , but there ’s still scrolling to be done .
Where it steps ahead of the iPhone , though , is in handling bookmarks : as well as instantly bookmarking the current page , you can scroll through your most - viewed pages and instantly add them to your bookmark list .
Finally there ’s a history tab , which again allows you to bookmark individual entries .
Everything is straightforward and finger - friendly : other platforms could learn a lot from Google ’s bookmarking system .
Android is n’t perfect , though .
Cupcake may add plenty of features , but it still lacks out - of - the - box Microsoft Exchange support ( only IMAP and POP3 are offered ) and we ’re not impressed by how tricky hooking up a USB connection to a PC or Mac can be .
Given how Windows Mobile HTC devices can simply show up as mass storage devices when plugged in via USB , we hoped the Magic would offer the same – instead , it took some messing with drivers and general coaxing to establish a connection .
Another obvious frustration is the lack of a standard 3.5 m m headphone jack , with HTC using their standard Ext - USB port which combines mini-USB connectivity and audio in one .
The supplied wired headset wo n’t win any awards for musical clarity , but HTC tell us they ’re working with Vodafone to get adapters – which allow you to plug 3.5 mm headphones into a microphone / call - answer - button dongle – included with retail packages .
Alternatively , of course , there ’s Bluetooth A2DP , another fresh introduction courtesy of Android OS 1.5 .
This worked well with the test headphones we tried it with , as did more traditional Bluetooth connections to standard headsets .
Bluetooth pairing is simple , and can be turned on and off independently of WiFi .
Similarly , the Magic ’s WiFi b/g connection is quick to identify new networks and re-found previous ones with no hassles .
Call quality in general proved high , with no noticeable echo .
The Magic had no problem finding and keeping hold of a 3G signal in London , and we experienced no dropped calls .
It ’s worth noting that there ’s no front - facing camera for video - calls , not that Android seemingly supports it right now , but future upgrades that might introduce the facility wo n’t be much use on the Magic .
HTC rate the Magic ’s battery for up to 400 minutes of WCDMA talktime ( 450 of GSM ) and up to 660hrs of WCDMA standby ( 420 of GSM ) .
With heavy use – surfing over 3G and WiFi , checking email and Twittering , texting and calling – we ran through a full charge in a day , which puts the Magic on a par with other smartphones ( and better than the iPhone , which we can drain even faster with the same usage ) .
In a more regular routine we reckon every - other - day charges would be sufficient .
Use of the Magic ’s media functionality will obviously have an impact on battery life , and the phone makes for a reasonable PMP .
Audio is handled by a standalone app , with options to browse by artist , album , song or playlist ; once a track is playing , there ’s a display of album art , plus shuffle and add - to - playlist controls , as well as ID3 tags .
The menu button calls up options to set the track as a ringtone , delete it , or kick off a “ party shuffle ” which seemingly uses some sort of musical heuristics to throw together compatible songs .
It ’s all serviceable and pretty flexible , but there ’s none of the gloss of an iPod touch , just layers of lists to scroll and tap through .
Tracks will continue to play in the background while you use other apps , and the currently - playing song is listed in the pull - down status bar .
An optional widget can be dropped onto the homescreen with basic play / pause and ID3 control .
Video files , meanwhile , are accessed through the gallery , where they show up in a separate category to images .
It ’s a pretty basic setup , more so than the audio app , but functional all the same .
More usable is the dedicated YouTube app , which – like HTC ’s program for its Windows Mobile phones – gives access to categories , favorites , searches and the currently most - popular clips .
It ’s also possible to upload your own videos directly from this YouTube app ( including signing up to a completely new user account if you do n’t already have one ) but , like when watching footage , it ’s worth finding a WiFi connection rather than steaming through your 3G data allowance .
With the addition of paid applications , the Android Market is growing in content ; though it may languish far behind the many thousands of titles available through Apple ’s App Store , there ’s still a decent range , many of which are free .
First - time users will probably want to pick up one of the IM clients – the Magic only comes preloaded with a Google Talk app – and then take a look at the games , which are conspicuous by their absence in its untinkered - with state .
Cupcake adds the background ability for an app to check with Android whether the device it ’s being installed on has the necessary hardware functionality for it to run : if , say , the phone lacked GPS then software that require that feature would n’t install .
That may not be such a big deal on the Magic , which has basically the same hardware as the G1 and , as such , existing software should have no problems on that front , but as more Android devices are released it will make future installs less confusing .
Paired with the clear warnings about what functionality – WiFi , GPS , 3G access – an app will have access to , users have just about all the info they can handle to avoid installing malware .
Something we ’re seeing more of with Android is location - aware software , and Google do n’t hold back on their own functionality .
The Magic comes ready for Google Latitude access in its maps app , offering the ability to share your geographical location with those people you ’ve approved , and similarly see them on the map .
There ’s also the standard satellite and traffic view options , together with Street View .
Optionally you can switch on the Magic ’s internal compass and use it to pan Street View in accordance with your own physical orientation .
Directions tap into the Magic ’s contacts , offering either manual input or pulling addresses from those people you already have records for , but there ’s still no turn - by - turn guidance , only a list and a map view as you ’d have on the desktop version of Google Maps .
Newcomers to the HTC Magic wo n’t necessarily know anything about Cupcake .
They may never have used a T - Mobile G1 , not really know much about Google ’s work on Android .
The good news is that the compromises and allowances the G1 demanded are no longer present in the Magic .
Occasions where you ’re expected to wait patiently for a firmware upgrade , or rely on third - party apps for otherwise common functionality ( such as video playback ) are addressed by Cupcake , and happily the G1 early - adopters will have those gaps filled too as OS 1.5 filters out .
What all that means is that the HTC Magic crosses the important boundary from geek ’s phone to mainstream phone .
Build quality is decent , with the handset looking slick in either gloss white or black , and Android has already matured into a usable , straightforward OS with plenty of flexibility .
The Magic still offers the openness that Apple ’s iPhone lacks , but now that ’s an optional ethos rather than a necessity to get the same functionality that feature - phones offer from the get - go .
With the Samsung I7500 around the corner , and Android handsets from other manufacturers tipped as imminent , 2009 looks to be the year that Google ’s mobile platform really builds its momentum .
Those new entrants will find a strong contender in the shape of the HTC Magic , though , and for now it ’s the Android smartphone to beat .

During last year ’s U.S. presidential campaign , Barack Obama campaigned on a pro-pie platform .
But apple pie , an epitome of Americanness , is threatened by the apple ’s stagnant gene pool .
Like many Americans , the apple is an immigrant to the United States .
The apple ’s ancestors came from Central Asia .
Today , wild apple trees grow in the Tien Shan Mountains in Western China and in neighboring Kazakhstan .
Almaty , the former capital , of Kazakhstan literally means ‘ the Father of Apples ’ .
In addition to wild apple , Central Asia is home to more than 300 wild fruit and nut species , including plum , cherry , apricot , pistachio , walnut and many other important food trees from which domesticated varieties are thought to originate .
A team of international scientists have completed an inventory of Central Asia ’s trees and identified 44 species in Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , and Tajikistan as globally threatened with extinction .

The Red List of Trees of Central Asia ( pdf ) lists two ancestors of today ’s domesticated apples as endangered .
“ Two wild apple species , Malus niedzwetzkyana and Malus sieversii , are still found in the fragmented fruit and nut forests of Central Asia and are threatened by habitat degradation , mainly from agricultural development and overgrazing . ”
Most apples grown today in the United States come from the same five or six parents .
As Michael Pollan explained in a 1998 article in the New York Times :
That genetic uniformity makes the apple a sitting duck for its enemies .
In the wild , a plant and its pests are continuously coevolving , in a dance of resistance and conquest that can have no ultimate victor .
But coevolution freezes in an orchard of grafted trees , since they are genetically identical .
The problem is that the apples no longer get to have sex , which is nature ’s way of testing out fresh genetic combinations .
The viruses , bacteria and fungi keep at it , however , continuing to evolve until they ’ve overcome whatever resistance the apples may have once possessed .
Over the past century , the genetic diversity of America ’s apple varieties have dropped from several thousands to a handful .
With apples genetically locked in , pests have an evolutionary advantage of wiping out America ’s apple crops .
“ Anyone with an apple in his yard knows how pathetic these trees can be …
No other crop requires quite as much pesticide as commercial apples , which receive upward of a dozen chemical showers a season , ” Pollan observed .
“ The solution , ” according to Philip Forsline , a USDA horticulturist at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station , “ is for us to help the apple evolve artificially ” and mingle in fresh genes to our domestic apple varieties through breeding .
Keeping as many wild apple genes available is therefore vital for the domesticated apple ’s survival .
Pollan wrote :
“ It ’s a question of biodiversity , ” Mr. Forsline said , as we walked down rows of antique trees , tasting apples as we talked .
Every time an old apple variety drops out of cultivation , or a wild apple forest succumbs to development ( as is happening today in Kazakhstan ) , a set of genes vanishes from the earth …
The greatest biodiversity of any crop is apt to be found in the place where it first evolved , where nature first experimented with what an apple , or potato or peach , could be .
Only eight years later , ScienceDaily reported Forsline and plant geneticist Gennaro Fazio experiments breeding wild apples with domestic varieties found them to me more resistant to diseases and fungi .
A finding that they “ documented with astonishment ” .
Fazio and Forsline were “ most impressed with the material collected in Kazakhstan , especially accessions of Malus sieversii “ .
According to Forsline , the Kazak trees showed significant resistance to apple scab–the most important fungal disease of apples - as well as to fire blight .
They were highly resistant against Phytophthora cactorum , which causes collar rot , and Rhizoctonia solani , an agent of apple replant disease , according to Fazio .
Both researchers found genes in the Kazak apples that allow them to adapt to mountainous , near - desert , and cold and dry regions .
As the Red List study , which was published by the Fauna & Flora International ( FFI ) , explains :
The genetic diversity of fruit and nut trees within the region is of outstanding global significance .
As elsewhere in the world , the trees of Central Asia face an onslaught of threats from habitat destruction , over - grazing , over - harvesting and the increasing impact of global climate change …
The mountains of Central Asia are a recognized global biodiversity hotspot , supporting over 300 wild fruit and nut species .
These include wild species of apple ( four species ) , almond ( 8 - 10 species ) , cherry ( 8 - 10 species ) , plum ( 4 - 5 species ) , and walnut ( one species ) as well as many domesticated varieties .
So not only are the ancestors of our apples from Central Asia , but also other genetically important species of fruit and nut trees come from the region .
Protecting these trees ’ natural habitat and cultivating them may prove vital to keeping the world ’s food supply resilient into the future within a changing climate .
Ninety percent of the forest habitat for these fruit and nut trees has been lost in the past 50 years according a Conservation International estimate .
In addition , as the study notes , “ the region has undergone dramatic economic , social and political transition following independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991 ” which has put tremendous stress on Central Asia ’s forests and woodlands to prove fuel , food , and income .
“ Although logging is officially illegal in the majority of the indigenous forests in Central Asia , substantial quantities are still removed ” , according to the study .
80 percent of the rural Tajikistan household rely on wood fuel for cooking .
Additionally , “ walnuts , apples , and pistachios are an important source of livelihoods for rural communities in Central Asia . ”
Collection “ ranges from subsistence harvesting to collection for international trade ” which “ can be a major source of income for the local population , especially during years of good harvest ” .

The trees in one Central Asian country were not inventoried in the Red List study .
With the ongoing war in Afghanistan , the trees in its forests went unexamined .
Afghanistan was once “ known as the orchard of Central Asia ” as then - Senator Hillary Clinton said in 2005 .
A stable Afghanistan may be vital to the survival of Central Asia ’s vulnerable trees .
The United Nations ’ Food and Agricultural Organization wrote in 2002 :
In happier days , Afghanistan was a paradise of orchards and vineyards , spice gardens and forests .
Sophisticated irrigation systems watered crops and were channeled into beautiful pleasure gardens for the leisure classes .
In the 1960s , high - value horticulture and dried fruit provided Afghanistan with almost half of its export revenue …
In most of Afghanistan today , the gardens have been decimated by drought .
All that remains of the extensive pistachio forests of Badakhshan province , for example , are a few trees standing stark against the mountains .
“ We have destroyed an economic resource , ” says the provincial Acting Governor , Muhammed Shah Zijhum .
“ And bare mountains mean more floods and soil erosion . ”
If the remaining forests of Central Asia are allowed to fail , then I think it is possible that more wars will break out and spread in the region .
As the Red List study illustrates , the forests of Central Asia are shrinking due to the demands placed on them and these pressures , combined with a lack of forest management , is making it a possibility , as BBC News emphases , that these wild fruit trees face extinction .
The fruit and nut trees are “ disease - resistant and climate - tolerant ” and “ could play a role in our future food security . ”
Antonia Eastwood , the lead author of the research , described the region as a “ unique global hotspot of diversity ” .
“ A lot of these species are only found in this area …
It ’s very mountainous and dry , so many of these species have a great deal of tolerance to cold and drought .
“ A lot of our domestic fruit supply comes from a very narrow genetic base , ” she continued .
“ Given the threats posed to food supplies by disease and the changing climate , we may need to go back to these species and include them in breeding programmes . ”
Apples are not uniquely vulnerable .
Many of the grains , roots , fruits , and vegetables that we eat today are susceptible to disease and pests .
The world ’s wheat crop , for example , is threatened by a virulent new strain of stem rust fungus spreading out of Kenya .
The banana that is widely available today is not the tastier Gros Michel variety , which was wiped out by disease by the 1960s , but the blander , inferior Cavendish banana .
And , climate change in the Andes Mountains is allowing potato blight , the same mold that contributed to the Great Famine in Ireland , to cause problems for farmers in Peru .
There are “ a number of limitations ” in relying on seed banks , according to a 2006 study by WWF International , Food Store : Using protected areas to secure crop genetic diversity ( pdf ) , so interest in “ the conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats and the maintenance and recovery of
viable populations of species in their natural surroundings ” has been growing steadily since the 1990s .
Compared to maintaining seed banks , it is more cost effective to preserve ecosystems .

Additionally , seed banks have the same problem of locking the plant ’s genes in place , just like we ’ve done with our domestic apples .
Storing seeds “ freezes adaptive evolutionary development , especially that which is related to pest and disease resistance ” .
Allowing for plant species to live in their natural environments “ allows for natural genetic interactions between crops , their wild relatives and the local environment to take place ” .
The danger with relying solely on conservation , however , is “ under extreme conditions of environmental change ( such as catastrophes , or rapid climate change ) catastrophic loss of genetic diversity rather than adaptation is likely to occur ” .
So , a mixed approach is important .
Keeping the wild varieties in seed banks and in research stations , and preserving these plants natural environments .
Because , the genes contained in these wild varieties may prove essential to the survival of not only our domestic varieties of apple , but many other fruit and nut varieties .
A financial commitment in preserving and protecting can make a difference according to the Red List study .
“ Many of the state agencies lack basic equipment and infrastructure such as uniforms , horses or vehicles , communication equipment and ranger posts .
In order to alleviate the immediate pressures on forests from firewood collection and illegal logging , pilot projects that provide alternative sources of energy to villagers should be trialled , assessed and rolled out . ”
It is a sad irony that the progenitor of the domesticated apple , Malus sieversii , is threatened by extinction in its natural environment , whilst the export value of apples from the top ten apple producing countries is over US $ 3 billion a year .
More poignantly , Malus sieversii germplasm collected in the 1990s from Kazakhstan is currently being used by the USDA Agricultural Research Service to improve disease resistance in current apple cultivars .
So far , researchers have discovered Malus sieversii samples that show resistance to apple scab , fire blight , drought and numerous soil pathogens .
These research findings once again highlight the global importance of conserving the wild relatives of domesticated fruit and nut trees .
The good news is that it is n’t too late that we can make a difference .
The Independent reports :
FFI is already working in Kyrgyzstan to save and restore one of the most highly threatened apple species identified in the report , the Niedzwetzky apple ( Malus niedzwetzkyana ) , as part of its Global Trees Campaign .
Only 111 individuals of this tree are known to survive in Kyrgyzstan and the species features on the Red List as “ endangered ” – the second highest category of threat . ”
FFI is also working with local communities and government forest services in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to encourage sustainable use and more effective protection for forest resources , including providing training for community groups and grants for eco-friendly small businesses to assist local livelihoods .
But , I think NGOs such as FFI cannot do this alone .
The United States , the European Union , and other nations have an interest in not only the stability and security of their country ’s and the world ’s food supply , but also with the potential spread of Taliban - inspired radical Islam in Central Asia .
So , perhaps in addition to the military payments and the USAID programs , the U.S. is funding in Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , and Tajikistan in 2009 that focus on each country ’s economic sector , healthcare system , and democratic institutions , I think we should also invest in helping them protecting their threatened forests and other ecosystems .
Not only would we be helping the people of Central Asia , but we ’d also be helping ourselves .
After all , I think it would be a terrible loss if we let a shrinking gene pool take away something as American as apple pie .

Does Open Source Need Better Evangelists ?
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 20 , 2009
Do commercial open source companies need better evangelists ?
There are some good reasons to believe that they do .
For example , Savio Rodrigues notes that in Fast Company 's recent roundup of the " the world 's most innovative companies , " there is n't a single open source vendor listed .
Sun Microsystems made the list last year , but this year only appeared in the ghettoized list of " 33 companies from last year ’s Fast Company 50 that did n’t make the list this time but deserve watching . "
I do n't think the problem here is lack of innovation among notable open source candidates for a list like Fast Company 's ; instead , the problem is poor evangelism .
The term " evangelist " was widely used by notable Microsoft and Apple employees for many years as the companies grew .
I remember thinking how that word is closely associated with people who seek wide audiences for religious messages , including some who are fanatics .
That 's exactly why the moniker got attached to people like Guy Kawasaki at Apple , though .
The title was meant to conjure up fervor , faith in platform , the need to take the message to the masses .
And speaking of Apple , who is the open source equivalent of Steve Jobs ?
In a post from last year titled " Four Things Linux Needs , " Joe Brockmeier argued that one of the four things needed is " unified marketing . "
He wrote :
" If you took the marketing budgets of all the Linux vendors combined , and then doubled that figure , and then added a zero , you might start approaching what Microsoft spends on marketing Windows .
Maybe .
The ad councils for various industries have the right idea -- it 's a good idea to pool your money to grow the market when you 're jointly competing with another industry . "
That 's the kind of unified marketing effort that smart evangelists could easily get going for not just Linux , but open source at large .
Part of the reason why we see very little of this is that the open source community is too clubbish for its own good .
I think the Linux Foundation is making some good unification inroads , but more effort is needed for strong , unified open source evangelism , and money is too .
Dana Blankenhorn has a good piece up today on how much hype -- rather than good information - - comes out of the open source community .
He points to dubious claims from Sun's Jonathan Schwartz about how JavaFX is “ the fastest growing RIA [ Rich Internet Application ] platform on the market . ”
Why is n't Schwartz instead touting the fantastic success that MySQL has been having recently ?
That 's part of good evangelism -- delivering solid information with force and feeling .
Here is a recent think - tank piece from researchers at U.C. Berkeley , on cloud computing .
It contains 25 pages of fine print on the state and future of cloud computing , and mentions open source only once , in passing .
That 's true , even though open source efforts are now a vital part of the cloud computing scene .
I find it ludicrous that Hulu , which delivers video content online ( who ' dathunk ? ) , is number three on Fast Company 's list of innovators , but not one open source company appears .
The problem is n't lack of innovation , but rather lack of good messaging and a dearth of unified open source evangelism .
fun now , sparkly poopz later it's a win-win .

They reach the pedals in my car , walk me from said car into seedy strip joints , and kick the living shit out of oak trees .
But for some people that 's not enough , they want animal - like legs .

Bionic Animal Legs Are Built For Theater and / or Enchanted Woodlands [ gizmodo ]
Here 's another of Terunobu Fujimori 's projects photographed by Edmund Sumner : this time Takasugi-an , a tea house in Chino , Nagano Prefecture , Japan .
The tea house is built atop two chestnut trees , cut from a nearby mountain and transported to the site , and is accessible only by free - standing ladders propped against one of the trees .
Following the tradition of tea masters , who maintained total control over the construction of their tea houses , Fujimori designed and built the structure for his own use .
The interior is covered with plaster and bamboo mats .
The name Takasugi - an means , “ a tea house [ built ] too high . ”
See more Japanese architecture in our Top Ten Japanese Projects
Here is some text about the Tea House , written by Yuki Sumner :
--
Takasugi-an
Chino City , Nagano Prefecture
Terunobu Fujimori , 2003 - 2004
The academician and architect , Terunobu Fujimori , has observed that a teahouse is “ the ultimate personal architecture . ”
Its extreme compactness , which would at most accommodate four and a half tatami mats ( 2.7 square metres ) or even just two tatami mats ( 1.8 square metres ) of floor space , makes it feel as though it were an extension of one ’s body , “ like a piece of clothing . ”
The tea masters traditionally maintained total control over the construction of these " enclosures , " whose simplicity was their main concern .
They therefore preferred not to involve an architect or even a skilled carpenter - an act considered as being too ostentatious .
Following this tradition , Fujimori decided to build a humble teahouse for himself and by himself over a patch of land that belonged to his family .
His interest as an architect , however , lay more in pushing the limit and constraints of a traditional teahouse rather than pursuing the art of tea making , and as a result , he has created a highly expressive piece of architecture .
Takasugi-an , which literally means , “ a teahouse [ built ] too high , ” is indeed more like a tree house than a teahouse .
In order to reach the room , the guests must climb up the freestanding ladders propped up against one of the two chestnut trees supporting the whole structure .
The trees were cut and brought in from the nearby mountain to the site .
Shoes are taken off at the midway point .
Once inside the room , which is padded simply with plaster and bamboo mats , the architect ’s adventurous spirit gives way to the serenity more suited to the purpose of making tea and calming one ’s mind .
The room displays a large window that frames the perfect bird ’s eyes ’ view of the town where Fujimori grew up .
It effectively replaces kakejiku ( a picture scroll ) that would indicate clues appropriate to the time of the year in traditional teahouses .
This kakejiku not only displays the cyclical seasonal changes but also the profound irreversible changes taking place in provincial towns like Chino .
Also visible in the distance is Fujimori ’s very first project , Jinchokan Moriya Historical Museum .
The architect ’s penchant for the personal , vernacular , and everyday is particularly evident here in this swaying teahouse .
Reuters :
The images are among photographs included in a 2004 report into prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison conducted by U.S. Major General Antonio Taguba .
Taguba included allegations of rape and sexual abuse in his report , and on Wednesday he confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that images supporting those allegations were also in the file … .
The newspaper said at least one picture showed an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee .
Others are said to depict sexual assaults with objects including a truncheon , wire and a phosphorescent tube .
Obama :
“ The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals , ” the president said at a White House briefing .
Well , I for one am feeling a bit had .
You ’ll recall that the GOP line of attack on the abuse photos previously was that they were indicative of nothing more than the equivalent of fraternity pranks .
Well , I do n’t know what fraternity these boys went to , but US soldiers raping female prisoners goes far beyond a frat prank .
Yes , we knew that they scared the prisoners with dogs and humiliated them by making them stand nude in front of women .
( There was also that photo of the dead prisoner on ice … )
I do not believe that we had any clue that prisoners were being raped as part of their interrogation .
This most certainly adds something new , if only to silence those critics who claimed that this was just another day at the office .
I ’d also add that this was not just the errant acts of a few soldiers .
Torture was official US policy .
And the Obama administration has already made clear that there is no benefit in holding accountable those who came up with this policy .
So these photos shed quite a light on Obama ’s decision not to hold the intellectual fathers of these acts accountable .

And her fight for better screening will help Ontarians
Karla Van Kessel became an advocate for better cervical cancer screening , leading to change in Ontario that continues after her death .
While the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) in The Hague , Netherlands , issued a landmark arrest warrant against Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir for ordering war crimes to be committed in Darfur , a CNN reporter , Nic Robertson , interviewed a former Sudanese soldier who was ordered to rape and kill children by his superior officers .
The use of rape as a weapon of war is common in the Darfur area of Sudan and inside the huge displacement camps serving as home to the several million Darfuri refugees , who have been uprooted by the war .
In many camps rape victims are giving birth to as many as 20 babies per month - - babies who are then subsequently abandoned by their mothers .
The soldier is called Adam , but that is not his real name .
Adam was forcibly conscripted into the Sudanese army and trained to kill by shooting targets , after which his officers told him " we will be taken to a patrol and then soon after that we were asked to join other people to go and burn and kill people . ”
It was then that he realized that he was being forced into a war against his will and against his own people .
He was told that if he resisted his superior officers ’ orders , he would be killed .
" The order is that the soldiers at the front , and there are some people who are watching you from behind , if you try to escape or do anything you will get shot .
The order is that we go to the village , burn it and kill the people , " said Adam .
" I had no choice , " he said " but I will say that I did n't kill anybody , but the raping of the small children , it was bad . "
The children , " they cry out , " said Adam .
" Two persons will capture her while she is crying and another raping her , then they leave her there . "
Adam said that the soldiers raped girls as young as 12 , and the officers ordered them to so because it will make people flee their villages -- make them run away and never come back .
Adam tried to desert the army as soon as possible , but he was caught and subsequently tortured .
The soldiers tied him down under a tree , and then the officers would set fire to tires above him .
The burning rubber would drip onto his body burning his skin .
He showed the scars left on his skin by the burning rubber .
Was he forced to rape children ?
" Yes I did , they were government orders , " replied Adam .
" It did n't feel like raping , I was feeling very bad but as I was ordered , I had to do something .
What I did was take off my trousers and lay myself on top of the girl but I did n't feel like raping , so I lay there for about 15 minutes . "
" So you did n't actually penetrate the girls ? " he was asked .
No , he said , " because I had no feeling for it , my penis did n't actually wake up , so there was no actual penetration , " Adam answered .
Adam said that he has trouble sleeping at night .
But he is not alone .
Aid workers in Darfur say that millions of women in Darfur also have trouble sleeping at night .
But , more importantly , they also live in constant fear of rape day and night .

Imagine that you are a frail , elderly person , perhaps in the last days or weeks of your life .
You are so sick that you have been admitted to a hospital ward for care .
But care is rarely what you get .
Instead you have entered a nightmare world in which weakness is punished and misery ignored .
You are lying in bed , gaunt and almost breathless , the bones in your pale face etched against the pillow .
You are whispering because the pain is so acute .
You tell the nurses - delicately , almost apologetically - that you are in agony .
You do not know that it is because the drugs for your terminal cancer are being wrongly administered , and that you are suffering needlessly as you die .
All you know is that no one cares .
Around you , you see other elderly patients , unable to walk alone , crying because nurses wo n't help them get to toilets on time .
Old people are left to sit or lie in their own urine .
One old woman is left in her soaking bed for almost nine hours because nurses wo n't fix her catheter .
Some patients are too sick or shaky or confused to feed themselves .
They go hungry , while some of the nurses eat the patients ' food in the ward kitchens .
Patients die alone and unnoticed .
Here 's a question for you .
When this shocking institutional cruelty is revealed on national television , who would you expect to be banned from working in the health service ?
The managers who could find nothing substantially wrong with the way the ward was run , even after receiving numerous complaints ?
The sisters and nurses who saw patients suffering , and were callously indifferent to it ?
Or the dedicated and caring undercover nurse who was so distressed by what she witnessed that she agreed to spend three months filming it ?
Perhaps you already have a fine understanding of the rules that govern contemporary Britain , a country in which whistleblowing , protesting , or embarrassing the authorities is rapidly becoming extremely hazardous for those who dare to do it .
Twelve days ago the Nursing and Midwifery Council announced , in one of the year 's most outrageous decisions , that Margaret Haywood , the nurse who filmed those scenes for BBC's Panorama , would be struck off the nursing register in perpetuity .
No one else involved has been publicly sanctioned , let alone lost their livelihood .
Abusing and degrading people at the very ends of their lives is , it seems , much more acceptable than exposing it .
Nothing about the NMC 's conclusions stands up to scrutiny .
The judgment starts off well , by dismissing the complaints made against Haywood by the Royal Sussex Hospital .
The trust had complained that Haywood had broken their own rules by going public , instead of complaining internally .
The panel was scathing about this .
Haywood had in fact reported her concerns to a ward manager .
In any case , her actions were justified because so many relatives and staff had complained , with no apparent effect .
In a rather fine paragraph the panel writes that what Haywood did was defensible because " the concerns were of an exceptionally serious nature .
The failure to deliver basic nursing care to these patients , many of whom were in the last stages of their lives , rendered many of their lives miserable .
It was so serious because it was so fundamental .
There was a failure to meet basic human needs . "
The judgment goes on to make clear that it was only the broadcast that forced radical reform .
Until then , internal complaints had produced a sluggish and " not very impressive " response .
So far , so good .
But then the judgment takes a bewildering turn .
Before the film went out , Panorama obtained the retrospective permission of every patient - or their relative - whose cases were featured .
One elderly man is not featured , but is glimpsed in the background in a handful of shots .
Suddenly the panel decrees that the fact that he is on a ward is confidential information , and that therefore Haywood has contravened the nursing code by betraying patient confidentiality .
Moreover , she can not be excused for it because " she should not have gone public until she had explored and exhausted , with management and senior management ... all other avenues of addressing the inadequacies on the ward . "
The result ?
She may not work as a nurse again .
What ?
What ?
Only a few paragraphs earlier , Haywood is fully justified in forcing change .
Now an anodyne background shot of a man in pyjamas means she must lose her livelihood .
I read the nursing code .
There is nothing in it to back up the panel 's preconditions on whistleblowing .
They seem to have been plucked out of the air .
But the sense of official relief at a reason to ban her rises off the page .
This , if it is allowed to stand , will be a major miscarriage of justice .
Whistleblowers know they take risks .
The Home Office leaker , Chris Galley , was unsurprised to be sacked last week .
But this is a punitive action , clearly designed to deter imitators .
Haywood might have expected suspension or a caution , but she acted as she did so that we might sleep more safely in a hospital bed .
Will we back her in return ?
She - devastated - has 18 days left to launch an appeal .
More than 15,000 people have signed the Royal College of Nursing petition in her defence , set up to gauge the level of public support .
Haywood deserves ours .
If she does n't get it , the message to every potential whistleblower in Britain will be : do n't bother .
We do n't really care .

None of the authors uses that conclusion to render easy moral judgments , nor to argue that the population fervently embraced the regime ’s lethal anti-Semitism ( pace Daniel Goldhagen ’s now largely discredited Hitler ’s Willing Executioners ) .
But both indirectly and explicitly , these books make clear that just as the Final Solution itself is now understood to inform so many aspects of Nazi Germany , so too the Germans ’ knowledge of the murder of the Jews influenced and altered the history of the Third Reich and the war it started .
Three decades of scholarship ( a good deal of it undertaken by Kershaw , as well as by the historian David Bankier , in his innovative study The Germans and the Final Solution ) reveal that from the very onset of the war , it was impossible not to know the Jews ’ fate .
Soldiers and officers wrote home of mass shootings ( one letter explicitly details the massacre of 30,000 Jews in a single town ) , and when they returned on leave , they spoke of the murders in private and in public .
Reports of the killing squads , which detailed the number of murders , were routinely routed to midlevel bureaucrats in various departments in Berlin .
The “ White Rose ” student resistance movement in Munich declared in its 1942 manifesto that 300,000 Jews had been killed in Poland , a crime “ unparalleled in the whole of history . ”
News of Auschwitz — the death camp within the borders of the expanded German state , exchange 2258 on the German telephone system — reached the diarist Victor Klemperer in March 1942 , and by that October he was describing it as “ a swift - working slaughter - house ” ; another diarist recorded hearing an official of the SS security service on a suburban train brag about the number of victims killed at that camp every week .
When the BBC beamed detailed descriptions of the workings of the death camps to Germany in 1942 , the Viennese diarist Ludwig Haydn said that “ with regard to the mass murder of Jews , the broadcast merely confirms what we know here anyhow . ”
The Final Solution , too vast in scale and scope to be comprehended fully , was also too vast to be kept secret , as Evans explains :
Railway timetable clerks , engine drivers and train drivers and other staff on stations and in goods yards could all identify the trains and knew where they were going .
Policemen rounding up the Jews or dealing with their files or their property knew as well .
Housing officials who reassigned the Jews ’ dwellings to Germans , administrators who dealt with the Jews ’ property — the list was almost endless …
The mass murder of the Jews thus became a kind of open secret in Germany from the end of 1942 at the very latest .
Summing up the evidence he has weighed and sifted for 30 years , Kershaw concludes :
Hard information , not just vague rumor , was being brought back to the Reich and was available .
Its extent was considerable , the information itself often impressive in its detail .
Only those anxious to shut their ears … could have been utterly ignorant .
And only the willfully ignorant could have imagined a drastically different fate for the Jews than was actually in store for them .
Germans responded to this knowledge in various but all - too - predictable ways .
True , Nazi rule had penetrated and altered popular attitudes , so by 1939 most Germans believed that Jews should be segregated or removed from the “ folk community . ”
But the anti-Semitism of most Germans stopped far short of genocide — only a small minority overtly approved of the Nazis ’ war against the Jews .
Of course , an even smaller number publicly condemned Nazi policy and were prepared to help the Jews : whatever their private feelings , most Germans responded outwardly with indifference , and with an attitude nicely characterized by Bankier as knowing “ enough to know that it was better not to know more . ”
Although certainly not a commendable stance , it ’s hardly surprising .
For one thing , as Kershaw writes , “ the vast majority of Germans had plenty of other things on their mind . ”
The Final Solution reached its height just as Germany ’s military fortunes began to ebb .
Severe wartime privations , ever - mounting death tolls , growing anxiety about the fate of loved ones engaged in a savage and increasingly desperate struggle on an ever - retreating Eastern Front , the disintegration of everyday life caused by an ever - intensifying Allied bombing offensive against Germany ’s cities — all crimped human empathy , to say nothing of collective action .
Scientists in Germany and India are reporting development of a new polymer that reduces the amount of radioactive waste produced during routine operation of nuclear reactors .
Börje Sellergren and colleagues note that structural materials such as carbon steel in power plants ' water cooling systems form deposits of metal oxides when they interact with coolants .
In nuclear power plants , these oxides trap radioactive ions , leading to buildups of radioactivity that require costly cleanups of reactor surfaces .
Cobalt , present in some alloys used in the reactors ' water systems , is a major contributor toward this problem because of its long half - life .
In the study , the researchers created an adsorbent material that — unlike conventional ion-exchange resins that are frequently used in reactors — is selective for cobalt but has the unique ability of disregarding iron - based ions .
The polymer 's high selectivity increases its appeal , the researchers add , for use in decontamination processes in reactors that utilize a variety of structural materials .

More than half of the 15 trillion gallons of sewage Americans flush annually is processed into sludge that gets spread on farmland , lawns , and home vegetable gardens .
In theory , recycling poop is the perfect solution to the one truly unavoidable byproduct of human civilization .
But sludge - based as fertilizer can contain anything that goes down the drain — from Prozac flushed down toilets to motor oil hosed from factory floors .
That ’s why an increasing number of cities have begun to explore an alternative way to dispose of sludge : advanced poop - to - power plants .
By one estimate , a single American ’s daily sludge output can generate enough electricity to light a 60 - watt bulb for more than nine hours .
Here are the six most innovative ways that human waste is being converted to watts :
Poop - Eating Bacteria
Digesters similar to brewery casks house anaerobic bacteria that eat sludge and belch out methane .
This technology is the oldest , cheapest , and most proven poop - to - power method .
Even so , fewer than 10 percent of the nation ’s 6,000 public wastewater plants have the digesters ; of those , just 20 percent burn the methane gas for energy ( the rest simply flare it off ) .
Flint , Michigan , and several other cities use the methane gas to fuel fleets of city buses .
The problem with anaerobic digesters is that they only reduce sludge ’s volume by half and capture a portion of its embedded energy .
Turd Cell Smashers
Destroying the cell walls in sludge — by heating it under pressure , zapping it with ultrasonic waves , or pulsing it with electric fields — boosts its methane production by 50 percent or more in anaerobic digesters .
On the downside , researchers have found that some of these processes can unleash nasty odors and even a “ chemical attack ” on sewage machinery .
Geological Toilets
Last summer , Los Angeles began injecting sludge into a mile - deep well , where pressure and heat are expected to release enough methane to power 1,000 homes .
The well also dissolves and sequesters carbon dioxide that the sludge would normally release , removing the equivalent exhaust of about 1,000 cars per year .
“ This renewable energy project is absolutely electrifying , ” Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told the LA Times .
“ It will save money and make money . ”
Feces Ponds
As a cheaper green option , some 50 waste plants in 20 countries have installed versions of UC Berkeley professor William J. Oswald ’s Advanced Integrated Wastewater Pond Systems Technology –large open - air ponds that primarily rely on anaerobic digestion and photosynthesis to break down sludge and convert it into a fertilizer or animal feed of nitrogen - rich algae .
The algae in turn can be used as a feedstock for biofuels .
Rich Brown , an environmental scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , sees an obstacle in the ponds ’ huge footprint : “ For rural areas it ’s great , ” he says .
“ For San Francisco it would n’t work so well . ”
Gassifiers
Sludge gasification plants are popular in Europe and especially Germany .
A low - oxygen reaction transforms the solids in sludge into a carbon - rich “ char ” similar to BBQ briquettes .
Next , the char is gasified in the presence of air to produce a syngas that can be burned for energy .
Poop Pyrotechnics
Last year , Atlanta - based EnerTech built the world ’s first commercial sludge “ pyrolysis ” plant in Southern California .
Its patented SlurryCarb process converts sludge from a third of Los Angeles and Orange Counties into char pellets that replace coal at a nearby cement kiln ; its ash is mixed into the cement .
One Small Poop for Man. . .
With billions in stimulus funds slated for wastewater improvements , is the time right for poop power ?
Such efforts , which reduce landfilling and emissions , have earned praise from some anti-sludge groups .
Caroline Snyder , the founder of Citizens for Sludge - Free Land , calls it a “ win-win situation . ”
The EPA says sludge power holds promise , but it ’s not ready to quit pushing sludge as a wonder fertilizer .
This has n’t deterred the sewage industry , which sees a chance to get into the renewable energy business and put a stop to the stream of health complaints and costly lawsuits .
“ After almost 40 years of working in biosolids , ” a sewage industry official wrote in a recent newsletter .
“ I never thought I ’d say this : it is an exciting time for sludge ! ”

The inevitable has happened - the secret Australian blacklist of banned websites has been published on the internet .
The list contains some 2,395 sites about half of which do not contain child sexual abuse images .
It includes online poker sites , fetish , satanic and Christian sites , Wikipedia pages , gay and straight pornography , a travel operator and even the website for a Queensland dentist .
The Australian government is trialling technology to filter the internet for all its citizens .
The list would have been sent to all ISPs in the country - at which point it would definitely have leaked .
It is just surprising it has happened so quickly .
University of Sydney associate technology professor Bjorn Landfeldt told the Sydney Morning Herald the leak was every parent 's worst nightmare because curious children would now be looking for the list .
But he told the paper , which has seen the document , " It seems to me as if just about anything can potentially get on the list . "
The list has gone to Wikileaks which told the Herald it would publish the list shortly - it already hosts lists for several other countries .
At the time of writing Wikileaks is unavailable , presumably because it is struggling with requests from mucky - minded intellectually curious Aussies .
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told the Herald that such secret censorship was inevitably corrupt .
Thailand implemented a similar system apparently in order to counter child abuse images , but the list included over a thousand sites critical of the Thai royal family . ®

NEWARK , N.J. -- Eric Staal was a great player long before his Carolina Hurricanes began their Eastern Quarterfinal matchup against the New Jersey Devils .
On Tuesday night , he gave hockey fans across the globe another example of what makes him so great .
Just 48 seconds after Jussi Jokinen erased a 3 - 2 deficit with 1:20 left in regulation , Staal propelled the ' Canes into the second round of the postseason as he beat Martin Brodeur with a wrist shot from the right circle to give Carolina a surreal 4 - 3 victory in Game 7 at the Prudential Center .
It was a Hollywood script ending to a series for the ages -- one that certainly was n't short on breathtaking moments .
It was also no surprise that Staal was there , front and center , to deliver a heroic ending that has the ' Canes heading to Boston to face the top - seeded Bruins in Round 2 .
It was the latest game - winning goal in the third period of a seventh game in NHL playoff history .
The previous record was held by Al MacAdam of the Minnesota North Stars , who scored at 18:34 of the third period in a Game 7 win over the Canadiens in 1980 .
Before Tuesday night , the latest time at which a team trailed in a Game 7 that they won in regulation time was until 8:36 of the third period .
That was on April 7 , 1959 in Boston , when the Bruins had a 2 - 1 lead over the Maple Leafs until Bob Pulford tied the game at 8:36 .
Gerry Ehman 's goal at 17:27 broke the tie and Toronto won the game , 3 - 2 , and the series , four - games - to - three .
" I 'll remember that one when it 's all said and done , " Staal said with a smile as wide as the nearby Hudson River .
" That 's one you keep in the memory bank .
Now it only gets better from here .
We 'll go on to the second round and continue our season and play the Boston Bruins .
We look forward to the challenge against them . "
A challenge seems to always bring out the best in Staal , who burned the Devils in 2006 by scoring a game - tying goal in the playoffs with three seconds to go -- a match Carolina would go on to win in overtime .
Three years later , he helped send the Devils packing again .
But this was a challenge that seemed insurmountable .
New Jersey was literally 80 seconds away from advancing to a second - round matchup against the Washington Capitals -- who won Game 7 against the New York Rangers earlier in the night -- when Jokinen silenced the capacity crowd of 17,625 as he one - timed a cross-ice feed from Joni Pitkanen through Brodeur 's legs to make it 3 - 3 .
For those who thought that was unbelievable , they had n't seen anything yet .
" It was pretty quiet after Jussi scored , " Staal said .
" We were on the bench and we were obviously the only ones pretty excited .
When we went over the boards after that goal , we 're like , ' Why not get another one ? '
It happened . "
It sure did .
A mishap in the neutral zone allowed Staal to get some separation , and he quickly took a pass from Chad LaRose in full stride .
With time winding down and trying to avoid what would have been the third overtime of the series , Staal ripped a wrist shot from the right circle that beat Brodeur to the far side to make it 4 - 3 with just 31.7 seconds to go .
Just like that , Carolina 's season went from over to far from it .
" It was probably the most ice I had in the whole game tonight , " said Staal , who was shadowed pretty effectively by John Madden for much of the night .
" I got a couple of quick strides with the puck and looked up and had some time .
I got a good shot off on Marty . "
One that could have renamed this state - of - the - art facility the Prudential Library .
Everyone in attendance -- Staal included -- was shocked that his wrister found its way past the same goalie who had stopped all 44 shots he faced in Game 5 .
" A little bit … I 'm not going to lie , " Staal said when asked if he was surprised that his shot went in .
" He 's a pretty good goaltender .
I got a lot of shots on him in this series and he 's made some big saves .
Sometimes in those instant - reaction moments , you 're not even thinking .
It 's pretty sweet . "
In the other dressing room , it was beyond sour .
" It 's shocking , " Brodeur said .
" I thought we did everything we could .
We worked really hard in this game .
Guys performed really well , and we have nothing to be ashamed about losing like that .
It 's definitely shocking and that is the bottom line , but we had them on the ropes .
It 's really disappointing . "
In a way , it was also fitting .
Not so much who won or who lost , but how this series came to an end .
A series that had ups and downs , wild endings , dramatic goals .
Maybe it would have been even more dramatic had the game included a fourth period .
Instead , though , one of the best players in the NHL added yet another great moment to his resume .
" You almost think that 's the way it should be … the game should go to overtime , " Carolina coach Paul Maurice said .
" But the right guy had the puck .
" There 's good players and there 's great players .
To get to be a great player , you have to be able to do those things in those moments .
It 'll be one of those moments that define his career .
There 's something special about people like that . "

With their team 's season on the line , Carolina 's trio of Rod Brind ' Amour Jussi Jokinen and Sergei Samsonov managed to keep puck in the Devils ' zone for roughly a minute before Jokinen one - timed Joni Pitkanen 's feed past Martin Brodeur to erase a 3 - 2 deficit with just 1:20 remaining in regulation .
Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward , who kept his team in the game in the third period and thus allowed it to make a comeback .
Martin Brodeur was the Devils ' best penalty killer during a 68 - second two - man disadvantage in the second period .
Brodeur , who looked uncomfortable early , made three tremendous saves during Carolina 's power play to preserve New Jersey 's 3 - 2 lead .
Brian Rolston 's power - play goal at 8:47 of the second period was just New Jersey 's third of the series in 25 opportunities .
It 's not often that Martin Brodeur allows two goals in a 49 - second span , but it came at the worst possible time as Jussi Jokinen and Eric Staal beat the Devils ' netminder to complete this remarkable feat .

When elementary school kids want to escape the confines of their circumstances they pretend to be pirates , princesses , and Jedi knights .
Now , with the relaxation of " mark to market " valuation rules announced yesterday by the accounting trade 's self - regulatory body , our bankrupt financial institutions can escape their own reality by pretending to be solvent .
The unraveling of our fairytale economy over the last few months has not yet convinced us that the time has come to put away childish things .
The applause that greeted the news yesterday on Wall Street is a clear sign that we still have some growing up to do .
The imaginative conceit that lies behind the accounting change is that the toxic assets polluting bank balance sheets are not really toxic at all .
They are in fact highly valuable assets that for some irrational reason no one wants to buy .
Using the " mark to market " accounting method , mortgage - backed securities were valued relative to the latest prices fetched by the sale of similar assets on the open market .
Currently , those bonds are being sold at deep discounts to their original value .
By " marking " their unsold bonds down to those prices , the insolvency of our financial institutions had been laid bare .
The new accounting changes will allow the nervous owners to assign more " appropriate " ( i.e. higher ) values .
Problem solved .
It is important to note that the Financial Accounting Standards Board made their rule modifications only after intense pressure had been applied by Washington and Wall Street .
In their heart of hearts , I can't imagine that there are too many bean counters happy with the outcome .
The banks and the government have argued that the assets should be valued based solely on current cash flow .
Most mortgages , after all , are not delinquent .
Therefore , a few bad apples should not spoil the whole cart , and those that are not yet delinquent should be valued at par .
This method assumes we have no ability to look into the future and make assumptions about what is likely to happen , which is presumably what the market is already doing by valuing the assets lower than the banks wish .
All kinds of bonds ( corporate , government and municipal , etc. ) that are not in default frequently trade at discounts .
In fact , the reason that agencies such as Moody 's and Standard and Poor 's rate bonds is to assess the probability of default .
The higher that probability , the lower the value placed on the bonds , regardless of their current cash flow .
For example , GM bonds that mature 10 years from now currently trade for only 8 to 10 cents on the dollar , despite the fact that GM is current on all interest payments .
The 90 % discount reflects investor awareness that GM will likely default long before the bonds mature .
By the new logic , financial institutions with GM bonds on their balance sheets should be able to ignore the market and value these bonds at par .
Some argue that the comparison is invalid because GM 's bonds are liquid while mortgage - backed securities are not .
However , if sellers of GM bonds were holding out for 70 or 80 cents on the dollar , those bonds would be illiquid too .
The reason GM bonds are trading is that sellers are realistic .
The same should apply to bonds backed by mortgages .
To assume that a 30 - year , $ 500,000 mortgage on a house that has declined in value to $ 300,000 has a high probability of remaining current to maturity is ridiculous .
The borrower could lose his job , his ARM might reset higher , or he may simply tire of paying an expensive mortgage for a house that is unlikely to be sold at a profit .
Any bond investor with half a brain will factor in these probabilities and look for deep discounts .
The only way to accurately assess a real present value is to let the market discover the price .
Despite the pleas from bankers and politicians , mortgages are not plagued by a lack of liquidity but a lack of value .
If sellers would be more negotiable , there would be plenty of liquidity .
Who knows , at the right price I might even buy a few .
The problem is that putting a market price on these assets would render most financial institutions insolvent , which is precisely why they do not want to let that happen .
Simply pretending that all these mortgages will be repaid does not solve the underlying problems .
It may keep some banks alive longer , but when they ultimately do fail , the losses will be that much greater .
In the meantime , solvent institutions are deprived of capital as more funds are funneled into insolvent " too big to fail " institutions - hiding their toxic assets behind rosy assumptions and phony marks .
Going from the sublime to the completely ridiculous , in a speech at the just - concluded G20 summit in London , President Obama urged Americans not to let their fears crimp their spending .
It would be unwise , he argued , for Americans to let the fear of job loss , lack of savings , unpaid bills , credit card debt or student loans deter them from making major purchases .
According to the president , " we must spend now as an investment for the future . "
So in this land of imagination ( where subprime mortgages are valued at par ) , instead of saving for the future , we must spend for the future .
I guess Ben Franklin had it wrong too - apparently a penny spent is a penny earned .

To the surprise of exactly no one , it 's now turning out that if you peek at what 's really behind those teabags , you 're gonna find out that what 's back there does n't pass the smell test .
What ?
Why are you all laughing ?
Cut that out , this is serious !
It 's about freedom and stuff !
That 's why you owe it to yourself and your teabags to read up on the astroturfing that 's behind the drive to encourage Americans to whip out their teabags tomorrow .
Great work has been done on this front at Firedoglake :
And Think Progress :
Despite these attempts to make the " movement " appear organic , the principle organizers of the local events are actually the lobbyist - run think tanks Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works .
The two groups are heavily staffed and well funded , and are providing all the logistical and public relations work necessary for planning coast - to - coast protests
And News Hounds :
Also , as was reported by two Playboy reporters ( more on Playboy 's report here ) , CNBC 's second - stringer Rick Santelli 's rant against President Obama on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was n't exactly spontaneous , but was actually a carefully - planned trigger for an anti-Obama campaign , funded and assisted by the right - wing big - wig Koch family , the multibilllionaire owners of the largest private corporation in America , and funders of scores of rightwing thinktanks and advocacy groups , including the Cato Institute , Reason Magazine and FreedomWorks .
( The Koch Family 's head rightie , Fred Koch , was also a co-founder of the notorious extremist - rightwing John Birch Society ) .
Does seem a little odd , does n't it , that a bunch of tea party websites and organizations were online and live within hours , even minutes , after his rant , and voila – a week later a protest was born .
And Crooks & Liars :
The right - wingers want to know how FOX is financing this movement ?
It 's because they are endlessly promoting it on every show that has .
The hosts are saying they will be covering the event as if it's a presidential debate .
And Fired Up ! Missouri :
And The Plum Line :
Looks like opponents of the Employee Free Choice
Act are going to try to use the much - ballyhooed " Tea Parties " as a way to get a leg up in organizing against the measure .
The " Tea Parties , " as you know , are the conservative anti-Obama protests that Fox News and other right - wing outlets have been heavily promoting as a national movement .
Now the Workforce Fairness Institute , a leading opponent of EFCA , is set to blast an email out to hundreds of thousands of people on its list encouraging them to go to " Tea Parties " on April 15th , the big " Tea Party " day , and speak out against the measure .
The email asks recipients to attend as " WFI Tea Party Captains "
And Media Matters :
Fox News has in dozens of instances provided attendance and organizing information for future protests , such as protest dates , locations and website URLs .
Fox News websites have also posted information and publicity material for protests .
Fox
News hosts have repeatedly encouraged viewers to join them at several April 15 protests that they are attending and covering ; during the April 6 edition of Glenn Beck , on - screen text characterized these events as " FNC Tax Day Tea Parties . "
Tea -party organizers have used the planned attendance of the Fox News hosts to promote their protests .
Fox News has also aired numerous interviews with protest organizers .
Moreover , Fox News contributors are listed as " Tea Party Sponsor[s ] " on TaxDayTeaParty.com .
Well , you get the idea .
You wo n't be able to swing a teabag tomorrow without hitting a corporate lobbyist or paid plant .
So why try to avoid it ?
Now you can join in the crowdsourcing of the information on it , all at SaveTheRich.com .
Yes , the reality of the mass teabagging set for tomorrow is that it turns out to have been largely a creation of the same gang that already ran conservatism off the rails .
That 's already discouraging some teabaggers not previously shamed by the silliness .
And to the extent that the teabagging has grown out of the interactions of consenting individual adults , it 's mutated into a grab bag ( if you will ) made up of every nutty ( if you will ) sorta - kinda conservative boogeyman , pet peeve and outright black helicopter conspiracy theory there is .
Are they teabagging about taxes ?
About the bailout ?
About Obama supposedly not being American born ?
About guns ?
About socialism ?
About ending the war , freeing Mumia , legalizing hemp or building giant puppets ?
But the usual suspects are hard at work , making sure that teabaggers are properly corralled , and their names and email addresses harvested for their lobbying work .
Surprise !
You came to teabag the government , and ended up putting your teabags into the cupped and waiting hands of corporate lobbyists , many of whom have already had their hands in your pockets during one or another of the bailouts .
Head on over to Save The Rich to get up to speed on which lobbyists will be disguising themselves as ACORN operatives and trying to gather signatures ( presumably from people who will need to hold their teabags in their teeth while they sign ) , how the " fair and balanced " FOX Nutwork will be providing on - site , blanket coverage of these anti-government events nationwide ( and then asking you to decide ) , and which GOP elected officials will just happen to wander onto the stages , shocked and surprised to find microphones there as if by magic .
And if you find yourself passing by when the nation 's teabags are twisting in the wind and you happen to observe something even more nuts than you were expecting , you can add your report to the mix .
Lt. Dan Choi appeared on the Rachel Maddow show tonight discussing his recent ouster from the Army National Guard thanks to Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ( DADT ) .
Rep. Joe Sestak was also on the program discussing the unfairness of the policy and how it might be repealed .
Lt. Choi responding to how DADT might be repealed …
Well , I ’m not a politician myself , I just like so many thousands of others , gays and lesbians that are in the army , that are in the armed forces , who raised their right hand and said “ We are in a time of war right now ; ” it ’s not about what timing is good or bad , its not about what you want to do , its about what your responsibility is .
And we are saying that we are standing up to our responsibilities , and we are saying “ we want to serve . ”

Ladies and gentleman , may we present the most visible evidence yet that President Obama not only understands what Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell is , but how it affects gay servicemen and women .
Six days after Barack Obama was sworn into office , Second Lt. Sandy Tsao wrote him a letter — coming out as a lesbian .
Like Obama , Taso is from the South Side of Chicago .
Unlike Obama , she pledged her service to defending America by risking life and limb .
But after serving some 15 months on active duty , Taso , a first - generation American , expects to receive an Article 15 honorable discharge because of homosexual conduct on May 19 ( just like Dan Choi ) , after she agreed to publish her letter to Obama in Chicago ’s gay Windy City Times newspaper .
Taso wrote Obama : “ I am a Second Lieutenant currently serving in the United States Army .
In addition to being an officer , I am a Christian , a woman and a Chinese - American .
I am proud of all these identities .
Lastly , I am also a homosexual .
On December 21 , 2007 , I was appointed as an army officer .
In the oath of office I swore that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
Unfortunately , I will not be able to fulfill this oath because the current policy regarding sexual orientation contradicts my values as a moral human being . ”
Obama , who reportedly reads a select 10 letters a day from Americans , responded with a short , handwritten note .
It reads : “ Sandy– Thanks for your wonderful and thoughtful letter .
It is because of outstanding Americans like you that I committed to changing our current policy .
Although it will take some time to complete ( partly because it needs Congressional action ) I intend to fulfill my commitment ! ”
That Obama would personally respond to a gay officer ’s letter says plenty unto itself .
Tsao says she is “ very hopeful , ” adding , “ I believe he is a man of his word . …
My heart is bounding with joy . ”
Reading between the lines , however , we see this : Obama says he ’s “ committed to changing ” Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell , which is not the same as “ repealing . ”
That difference in wording is what got Obama into trouble when the White House website revamped the president ’s Civil Rights section and replaced a promise to repeal DADT with a commitment to “ changing Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell in a sensible way . ”
Also :
A built - in excuse for not tackling the subject right away “ because it needs Congressional action . ”
What else needs Congressional action ?
Bailing out Wall Street , but he got that done overnight .

As firearms sales surge , Democrats drop assault weapons ban John Byrne
Published : Monday April 13 , 2009
Print This Email This NRA has ' stranglehold ' on Congress , senator says
As firearms sales in the United States hit new highs , the Obama Administration and Democrats in Congress are squelching talk of a renewal of the assault weapons ban passed by Congress that lapsed in 2004 , saying they do n't want a distraction from their agenda and do n't have the votes in Congress .
Seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since November in an effort to buy guns , according to the FBI .
That figure does n't include Virginia , whose gun shows do n't require any background checks .
The buying bonanza has stripped some stores almost bare of assault weapons and yielded a national ammunition shortage .
As gun sales blossom , Democrats ' interest in regulating gun sales appear to be waning , despite the recent spate of high - profile gun violence .
Two recent reports have fingered the Obama Administration and the assault weapons ban 's most ardent supporter in Congress -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) -- as putting off any effort to regulate high - powered weapons .
Congressional officials told a reporter in comments published Saturday that Obama and top White House aides have all but abandoned a push for tighter gun control , indicating they can't stomach a fight with the National Rifle Association when they 're focused on other issues .
" He and other White House strategists have decided they can't afford to tangle with the National Rifle Association at a time when they 're pushing other priorities , like economic renewal and health - care reform , " congressional officials said .
" The president supports the Second Amendment , respects the tradition of gun ownership in this country , and he believes we can take common - sense steps to keep our streets safe , " Ben LaBolt , a White House spokesman said .
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , whose effort to extend the assault weapons ban failed in the Senate 9 - 80 in 2004 , signaled on 60 Minutes Sunday that she wo n't currently pursue the ban 's renewal .
Feinstein authored the original ban , which was in place from 1994 until 2004 .
She said she " agrees " that an effort to renew the ban now would pose a distraction to Obama 's agenda and spark a culture war .
" So you are going to hold off ? " 60 Minutes ' Lesley Stahl asked .
" That 's correct , " Feinstein said .
" I 'll pick the time and the place , no question about it . "
Feinstein said there is n't support for the assault weapons ban in Congress .
Pro-gun Democrats picked up seats in the last election .
" The National Rifle Association essentially has a stranglehold on the Congress , " Feinstein said .
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was a prominent advocate for the bill while serving in the House , but now appears to be silent .
" It 's weird , " Peter Hamm , the communications director for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , told Newsweek .
" When you see people like [ Attorney General ] Eric Holder or Hillary Clinton or [ White House chief of staff ]
Rahm Emanuel become muted on this issue , you feel like you want to call up a friend and say , ' What 's up ? ' "
Gun control advocates blame Americans ' disapproval of tighter gun control on misleading efforts by the National Rifle Association and gun advocates to suggest that President Obama would " take away " citizens ' guns .
" That extreme position apparently prompted a man , who told friends he was afraid the government would take his guns away , to shoot three police officers in Pittsburgh last week , " notes the Guardian .
" But more commonly such views are boosting gun sales , from Ohio to Texas and from Wyoming to Virginia . "

• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
At least three people were killed in a firefight between Cambodian and Thai troops Friday in the latest of a recent series of clashes along the disputed Thai - Cambodian border .
The skirmish comes days before the two sides were set to discuss the issue at a regional summit .
Agence France - Presse reports that two Cambodian soldiers and one Thai soldier died during a number of skirmishes Friday .
" We are fighting with each other , it is serious gunfire .
Two of our soldiers have been killed , " Cambodian government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said .
" The gunfire is continuing in at least two areas , " he added ....
Cambodian and Thai authorities confirmed heavy gunfire had broken out at 2:00 pm ( 0700 GMT ) in a number of spots near the border , which has never been fully demarcated due to landmines left after decades of war in Cambodia .
" We have occupied many areas now .
The gunfire ended after about 35 minutes of fighting .
We have won the fight now , " Cambodian commander Bun Thean told AFP .
Bloomberg reports that the fighting has now stopped and that the two sides are discussing the situation , according to Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Tharit Charungvat .
" The army chiefs are now talking , " Tharit said .
" We asked for a ceasefire and do not want to use force . "
Cambodian and Thai troops engaged in " large - scale fighting " today , Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said by phone .
Two Thai soldiers were killed and six wounded , he said .
Tharit denied the claim and said Thailand had suffered no deaths or injuries .
The battles took place around the 900 - year - old Preah Vihear temple , the ownership of which has been contested by Thailand and Cambodia .
Although the International Court of Justice at the Hague ruled in 1962 that the temple was within Cambodia 's territory , the court did not address the ownership of the surrounding land , which both nations have claimed .
As a result , the temple has remained a flashpoint .
In July 2008 , both countries engaged in a troop buildup and saber - rattling over the temple , after UNESCO designated it as a World Heritage Site for Cambodia , The Christian Science Monitor reported .
Several soldiers were killed in a subsequent skirmish near Preah Vihear in October .
Friday 's gun battles come a day after a Thai soldier lost a leg to a land mine in a forest near Preah Vihear , reports The Phnom Penh Post .
The Post writes that the soldier had been on patrol when he stepped on the mine , which had probably been placed there years before , according to a Cambodian military official .
Yim Phim , commander of Brigade 8 , said the Cambodian troops " do n't dare walk " in the area where the Thai soldier was wounded .
" Mines were laid there during the fighting in the 1980s and 1990s , " he said , referring to clashes between government troops and resistance fighters .
Bloomberg notes , however , that Mr. Charungvat said that Thai officers believe that the mine had recently been planted .
The BBC reports that Friday 's battles seem to have been sparked during a subsequent visit by a Thai patrol to the site where the Thai soldier was injured Thursday .
" After talks between the two sides failed , the Cambodian side started to walk away and turned back to open fire at Thai troops with rifles and RPG rockets , forcing the Thai side to fire back in self - defence , " said a statement from Thailand 's foreign ministry .
" It was an accident , a misunderstanding among officials on the ground , which is common when you are closely positioned , " said Thai Defense Minister Pravit Wongsuwan .
However , the Cambodian foreign ministry called it an " intended aggressive invasion by the Thai military " , and said a letter of protest would be sent to Thailand .
The Associated Press reports that a Cambodian soldier said they opened fire only after some 60 Thai soldiers entered Cambodian territory , sparking a gun battle that lasted about 10 minutes .
The AP adds that neither side reported any casualties in the first round of fighting .
The BBC notes that the battles come just days before representatives from Thailand and Cambodia were scheduled to discuss the issue peacefully .
The Cambodia - Thailand Joint Border Committee was set to begin three days of talks on Sunday , in the Cambodian town of Siem Reap .
Bloomberg adds that leaders of the two countries are scheduled to meet during an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit next week , and that Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva is due to visit Cambodia later in April .
The Purpose of Scala 's Type System
A Conversation with Martin Odersky , Part III
by Bill Venners and Frank Sommers

Summary
Martin Odersky talks with Bill Venners and Frank Sommers about the design motivations behind Scala 's type system .
Scala is an emerging general - purpose , type - safe language for the Java Platform that combines object - oriented and functional programming .
It is the brainchild of Martin Odersky , a professor at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) .
In this multi-part interview series , Artima 's Bill Venners and Frank Sommers discuss Scala with Martin Odersky .
In Part I , The Origins of Scala , Odersky gives a bit of the history that led to the creation of Scala .
In Part II , The Goals of Scala , he discusses the compromises , goals , innovations , and benefits of Scala 's design .
In this installment , he dives into the design motivations for Scala 's type system .
The value of Scala 's " scalability "
Frank Sommers :
In your talk at last year 's JavaOne , you claimed the Scala is a " scalable language , " that you can program in the small and program in the large with Scala .
How does this help me as a programmer to use a language like this ?
Martin Odersky :
The way it helps you is by not having to mix many specialized languages .
You can use the same language for very small as well as very large programs , for general purpose things as well as special purpose application domains .
And that means that you need not worry about how you push data from one language environment into the next .
Currently if you want to push data across boundaries , you are often thrown back to low level representations .
For instance , if you want to ship an SQL query from Java to a database and you use JDBC , your query ends up as a string .
And that means that a small typo in your program will manifest itself as an ill - formed query at runtime , possibly at your customer site .
There 's no compiler or type system to tell you that you should n't have done that .
This is very fragile and risky .
So there 's a lot to be gained if you have a single language .
The other issue is tooling .
If you 're using a single language , you can have a single environment with tooling .
Whereas if you have many different languages , you have to mix and match environments and your build become much more complicated and difficult .
Scala 's extensibility
Frank Sommers :
You also mentioned in your talk the notion of extensibility , that Scala can be extended easily .
Can you explain how ?
And again , how does that help the programmer ?
Martin Odersky :
The first dimension of scalability is from small to large , but I think there 's another notion of extensibility from general to your specific needs .
You want to be able to grow the language into domains that you particularly care about .
One example is numeric types .
There are a lot of special numeric types out there — for instance , big integers for cryptographers , big decimals for business people , complex numbers for scientists — the list goes on .
And each of these communities really cares deeply about their type , but a language that combined them all would be very unwieldy .
The answer , of course , is to say , well , let 's do these types in libraries .
But then if you really care about this application domain , you want the code accessing these libraries to look just as clean and sleek as code accessing built - in types .
For that you need extensibility mechanisms in the language that let you write libraries such that users of those libraries do n't even feel that it is a library .
For users of a library , let 's say a big decimal library , the BigDecimal type should be just as convenient to use as a built - in Int .
Programming in the small with types
Frank Sommers :
You mentioned earlier the importance of types in the context of having one language instead of many .
I think most people appreciate the utility of types when programming in the large .
When you have a very large - scale program , types help you organize the program and make changes to it reliably .
But what do types buy us in terms of programming in the small , when you program just a script , for example ?
Are types important on that level as well ?
Martin Odersky :
They are probably less important when programming in the small .
Types can be in a spectrum from incredibly useful to extremely annoying .
Typically the annoying parts are type definitions that are redundant , which require you to do a lot of ( finger ) typing .
The useful parts are , of course , when types save you from errors , when types give you useful program documentation , when types act as a safety net for safe refactoring .
Unit tests and free expression
Scala has type inference to try and let you minimize the annoying bits as much as possible .
That means if you write a script , you do n't see the types .
Because you can just leave them off and the system will infer them for you .
At the same time , the types are there so if you make a type error in the script , the compiler will catch it and give you an error message .
And I believe no matter whether it is a script or a large system , it 's always more convenient to fix this thing immediately with the compiler than later on .
You still need unit tests to test your program logic , but compared to a dynamically typed language , you do n't need a lot of the more trivial unit tests that may be just about the types .
In the experience of many people , you need a lot fewer unit tests than you would in a dynamic language .
Your mileage might vary , but that 's been our experience in several cases .
The other objection that 's been leveled against static type systems is that they constrain you too much in what you want to express .
People say , " I want to express myself freely .
I do n't want a static type system getting in the way . "
In my experience in Scala this has not been true , I think for two reasons .
The first is that the type system in Scala is actually very flexible , so it typically lets you compose things in very flexible patterns , which a language like Java , which has a less expressive type system , would often make more difficult .
The second is that with pattern matching , you can recover type information in a very flexible way without even noticing it .
The idea of pattern matching is that in Scala I can take an object about which I know nothing , and then with a construct like a switch statement , match it against a number of patterns .
And if it is one of these patterns , I can also immediately pull out the fields into local variables .
Pattern matching is a construct that 's built deep into Scala .
A lot of Scala programs use it .
It is a normal way to do things in Scala .
One interesting thing is that by doing a pattern match you also recover the types automatically .
What you put in was an object , which you did n't know anything about .
If a pattern matches , you actually know you have something that corresponds to the type of the pattern .
And the system is able to use that .
Because of pattern matching , you can quite easily have a system where your types are very general , even maximally general — like the type of every variable is Object — but you can still get everything out that you want through the use of pattern matching .
So in that sense , you can program in Scala perfectly well as if it were a dynamically typed language .
You would just use Object everywhere and pattern match everywhere .
Now people usually do n't do that , because you want to take more advantage of static types .
But it is a very fluid fallback , a fallback that you do n't even notice .
By comparison , the analog in Java where you would have to use a lot of type tests ( instanceof ) and type casts is really heavyweight and clunky .
And I completely understand why people object to having to do that all over the place .
Quacking like a duck
Bill Venners :
One of the things I have observed about Scala is that there are a lot more things I can express or say about my program in Scala 's type system compared to Java's .
People fleeing Java to a dynamic language often explain that they were frustrated with the type system and found they have a better experience if they throw out static types .
Whereas it seems like Scala 's answer is to try and make the type system better , to improve it so it is more useful and more pleasant to use .
What kind of things can I say in Scala 's type system that I can't in Java's ?
Martin Odersky :
One objection leveled against Java 's type system is that it does n't have what 's often called duck typing .
Duck typing is explained as , if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it is a duck .
Translated , if it has the features that I want , then I can just treat it as if it is the real thing .
For instance , I want to get a resource that is closable .
I want to say , " It needs to have a close method . "
I do n't care whether it 's a File or a Channel or anything else .
In Java , for this to work you need a common interface that contains the method , and everybody needs to implement that interface .
First , that leads to a lot of interfaces and a lot of boilerplate code to implement all that .
And second , it is often impossible to do if you think of this interface after the fact .
If you write the classes first and the classes exist already , you can't add a new interface later on without breaking source code unless you control all the clients .
So you have all these restrictions that the types force upon you .
One of the aspects where Scala is more expressive than Java is that it lets you express these things .
In Scala it is possible to have a type that says : anything with a close method that takes no parameter and returns Unit ( which is similar to void in Java ) .
You can also combine it with other constraints .
You can say : anything inheriting from a particular class that in addition has these particular methods with these signatures .
Or you can say : anything inheriting from this class that has an inner class of a particular type .
Essentially , you can characterize types structurally by saying what needs to be in the types so that you can work with them .
Existential types
Bill Venners : Existential types were added to Scala relatively recently .
The justification I heard for existentential types was that they allow you to map all Java types , in particular Java 's wildcard types , to Scala types .
Are existential types larger than that ?
Are they a superset of Java 's wildcard types ?
And is there any other reason for them that people should know about ?
Martin Odersky :
It is hard to say because people do n't really have a good conception of what wildcards are .
The original wildcard design by Atsushi Igarashi and Mirko Viroli was inspired by existential types .
In fact the original paper had an encoding in existential types .
But then when the actual final design came out in Java , this connection got lost a little bit .
So we do n't really know the status of these wildcard types right now .
Existential types have been around for a number of years , about 20 years now .
They express something very simple .
They say you have a type , maybe a list , with an element type that you do n't know .
You know it 's a list of some specific element type , but you do n't know the element type .
In Scala that would be expressed with an existential type .
The syntax would be List [ T ] forSome { type T } .
That 's a bit bulky .
The bulky syntax is in fact sort of intentional , because it turns out that existential types are often a bit hard to deal with .
Scala has better alternatives .
It does n't need existential types so much , because we can have types that contain other types as members .
Scala needs existential types for essentially three things .
The first is that we need to make some sense of Java 's wildcards , and existential types is the sense we make of them .
The second is that we need to make some sense of Java 's raw types , because they are also still in the libraries , the ungenerified types .
If you get a Java raw type , such as java.util .
List it is a list where you do n't know the element type .
That can also be represented in Scala by an existential type .
Finally , we need existential types as a way to explain what goes on in the VM at the high level of Scala .
Scala uses the erasure model of generics , just like Java , so we do n't see the type parameters anymore when programs are run .
We have to do erasure because we need to interoperate with Java .
But then what happens when we do reflection or want to express what goes on the in the VM ?
We need to be able to represent what the JVM does using the types we have in Scala , and existential types let us do that .
They let you talk about types where you do n't know certain aspects of those types .
Bill Venners : Can you give a specific example ?
Martin Odersky : Take Scala lists as an example .
I want to be able to describe the return type of the method , head , which returns the first element ( the " head " ) of the list .
On the VM level , it is a List [ T ] forSome { type T } .
We do n't know what T is , but head returns a T .
The theory of existential types tells us that is a T for some type T , which is equivalent to the root type , Object .
So we get this back from the head method .
Thus in Scala , when we know something we can eliminate these existential qualifications .
When we do n't know something , we leave them in , and the theory of existential types helps us there .
Bill Venners :
Would you have added existential types if you did n't need to worry about the Java compatibility concerns of wildcards , raw types , and erasure .
If Java had reified types and no raw types or wildcards , would Scala have existential types ?
Martin Odersky : If Java had reified types and no raw types or wildcards , I do n't think we would have that much use for existential types and I doubt they would be in Scala .
Variance in Java and Scala
Bill Venners :
In Scala variance is defined at the point the class is defined whereas in Java it 's done at the usage sites with wildcards .
Can you talk about that difference ?
Martin Odersky : Because we can model wildcards in Scala with existential types , you actually can if you want do the same thing as in Java .
But we encourage you to not do that and use definition site variance instead .
Why ?
First , what is definition - site variance ?
When you define a class with a type parameter , for instance List [ T ] , that raises a question .
If you have a list of apples , is that also a list of fruit ?
You would say , yes , of course .
If Apple is a subtype of Fruit , List [ Apple ] should be a subtype of List [ Fruit ] .
That subtyping relationship is called covariance .
But in some cases , that relationship does n't hold .
If I have , say , a variable in which I can put only an Apple , a reference of type Apple .
That 's not a reference of type Fruit because I can't just assign any Fruit to this variable .
It has to be an Apple .
So you can see there are some situations where we should have the subtype relationship , and others where we should n't .
The solution in Scala is we annotate the type parameter .
If List is covariant in T , we would write List [ + T ] .
That would mean
List s are covariant in T .
There are certain conditions that are attached to that .
For instance , we can do that only if nobody changes the list , because otherwise we would get into the same problems that we had with the references .
T
List
List
What happens in Scala is the programmer says , well I think lists should be covariant , which means they respect the subtype relationships .
Then the programmer would decorate the type parameterwith a plus sign at the declaration site — only once for alls that anybody ever uses .
Then the compiler will go and figure out whether all the definitions withinare actually compatible with that , that there 's nothing being done with lists that would be conflicting there .
If there is something that 's incompatible with covariance , the Scala compiler will issue an error .
Scala has a range of techniques to deal with those errors , which a competent Scala programmer will pick up fairly quickly .
A competent Scala programmer can apply those techniques and end up with a class that compiles and is covariant for the users .
Users do n't have to think about it anymore .
They know if I have a list I can just use it covariantly everywhere .
So that means there was just one person who wrote the list class , who had to think a little bit harder , and it was not so bad because the compiler helped this person with error messages .
By contrast , the Java approach of having wildcards means that in the library you do nothing .
You just write List < T > and that 's it .
And then if a user wants a covariant list , they write not List < Fruit > , but List <? extends Fruit > .
So that 's a wildcard .
The problem is that that 's user code .
And these are users who are often not as expert as the library designers .
Furthermore , a single mismatch between these annotations gives you type errors .
So no wonder you can get a huge number of completely intractable error messages related to wildcards , and I think that this more than anything else has given the current Java generics a bad rap .
Because really this wildcard approach is quite complicated for normal humans to grasp and deal with .
Variance is something that is essential when you combine generics and subtyping , but it 's also complex .
There 's no way to make this completely trivial .
The thing we do better than Java is that we let you do it once in the libraries , so that the users do n't have to see or deal with it .
Abstract type members
Bill Venners :
In Scala , a type can be a member of another type , just as methods and fields can be members of a type .
And in Scala those type members can be abstract , like methods can be abstract in Java .
Is there not some overlap between abstract type members and generic type parameters ?
Why does Scala have both ?
And what do abstract types give you beyond what the generics give you ?
Martin Odersky : Abstract types give you some things beyond what generics give you , but let me first state a somewhat general principle .
There have always been two notions of abstraction : parameterization and abstract members .
In Java you also have both , but it depends on what you are abstracting over .
In Java you have abstract methods , but you can't pass a method as a parameter .
You do n't have abstract fields , but you can pass a value as a parameter .
And similarly you do n't have abstract type members , but you can specify a type as a parameter .
So in Java you also have all three of these , but there 's a distinction about what abstraction principle you can use for what kinds of things .
And you could argue that this distinction is fairly arbitrary .
What we did in Scala was try to be more complete and orthogonal .
We decided to have the same construction principles for all three sorts of members .
So you can have abstract fields as well as value parameters .
You can pass methods ( or " functions " ) as parameters , or you can abstract over them .
You can specify types as parameters , or you can abstract over them .
And what we get conceptually is that we can model one in terms of the other .
At least in principle , we can express every sort of parameterization as a form of object - oriented abstraction .
So in a sense you could say Scala is a more orthogonal and complete language .
Now the question remains , what does that buy you ?
What , in particular , abstract types buy you is a nice treatment for these covariance problems we talked about before .
One standard problem , which has been around for a long time , is the problem of animals and foods .
The puzzle was to have a class Animal with a method , eat , which eats some food .
The problem is if we subclass Animal and have a class such as Cow , then they would eat only Grass and not arbitrary food .
A Cow could n't eat a Fish , for instance .
What you want is to be able to say that a Cow has an eat method that eats only Grass and not other things .
Actually , you can't do that in Java because it turns out you can construct unsound situations , like the problem of assigning a Fruit to an Apple variable that I talked about earlier .
The question is what do you do ?
The answer is that you add an abstract type into the Animal class .
You say , my new Animal class has a type of SuitableFood , which I do n't know .
So it 's an abstract type .
You do n't give an implementation of the type .
Then you have an eat method that eats only SuitableFood .
And then in the Cow class I would say , OK , I have a Cow , which extends class Animal , and for Cow type SuitableFood equals Grass .
So abstract types provide this notion of a type in a superclass that I do n't know , which I then fill in later in subclasses with something I do know .
Now you could say , well I could do the same thing with parameterization .
And indeed you can .
You could parameterize class Animal with the kind of food it eats .
But in practice , when you do that with many different things , it leads to an explosion of parameters , and usually , what 's more , in bounds of parameters .
At the 1998 ECOOP , Kim Bruce , Phil Wadler , and I had a paper where we showed that as you increase the number of things you do n't know , the typical program will grow quadratically .
So there are very good reasons not to do parameters , but to have these abstract members , because they do n't give you this quadratic blow up .
Getting used to the syntax
Bill Venners :
When people look at random Scala code , there are two things that I think can make it look a bit cryptic .
One is a DSL they are not familiar with , like the parser combinators or the XML library .
The other is the kinds of expressions in the type system , especially combinations of things .
How can Scala programmers get a handle on that kind of syntax ?
Martin Odersky : Certainly there 's a lot of new stuff there that has to be learned and absorbed .
So this will take some time .
I believe one of the things we have to work on is better tool support .
Right now when you get a type error , we try to give you a nice error message .
Sometimes it spans multiple lines to be able to explain more .
We try to do a good job , but I think we could do much better if we could be more interactive .
Imagine if you had a dynamically typed language and you only had three or four lines max for an error message when something went wrong at runtime .
There would be no debugger .
There would be no stack trace .
There would be just three or four lines , such as " null pointer dereference , " and maybe the line number where it happened .
I do n't think dynamic languages would be very popular under those circumstances .
Of course , that 's not what happens .
You 're thrown into a debugger where you can quickly find out where the root of the problem is .
For types , we do n't have that yet .
All we have are these error messages .
If you have a very rich and expressive type system that requires more knowledge to make sense of those error messages , you want more help .
So one thing we want to investigate in the future is whether we can actually give you a more interactive environment such that if the types go wrong , you could find out why .
For example , how the compiler figured out that this expression has this type , and why it does n't think that this type conforms to some expected type .
You could explore these things interactively .
I think then the causes of type errors would be much easier to see than they are now .
On the other hand , some syntax is just new and takes some getting used to .
That 's probably something we can't avoid .
We only hope that a couple of years from now these will be types that people take completely naturally and never question .
There have been other things in mainstream languages that took some getting used to .
I remember very well when exceptions came out , people found them strange .
It took a lot of time to get used to them .
And now of course everybody thinks they are completely natural .
They are not novel anymore .
And certainly Scala has a couple of things , mostly in the type side , which take some getting used to .

Take a second and think about the physical location in which you ’re the most creative .
Think about where you ’re inspired to write , where good ideas hit you , or where you have the urge to draw or create music .
Is that place where you do your creative work ?
Many of us do n’t actually correlate our creative energies with particular places for several reasons .
One , we have strange views of creativity and mental processes that all too often minimizes the role of physical and environmental conditions in the creative process .
Two , we ’ve got too much going on to think about something as mundane as where we ’re creative – it ’s like that chair that we trip on every day , that , if we stopped and thought about it , could be moved three inches out of the way to prevent the stubbed toes .
But regardless of whether we think about it , the correlation ’s there .
How often do you run from your couch to your “ office ” because you get an idea that you have to work on right then ?
Is there a way that you could set up your workflow so that you could just work on your couch – where you ’re the most creative in the first place ?
This question is n’t just for those creatives who work from home .
If you do creative work and the place where you work is n’t conducive to creative work , you ’ve got a problem .
Is there a spare meeting room at work that you could reserve for a few hours a day and take your work there ?
Can you negotiate to work part of your day in the coffee shop ?
( Note : if you ask for either of these , make sure you deliver .
Do n’t negotiate to work in a coffee shop for two hours a day and come back empty - handed .
If you need to , do some unreported creative work on your own time so you have that work to submit in case you end up daydreaming for your first creative session , which is likely to happen . )
The idea of working where you ’re the most creative is really not much different than the idea of working when you ’re the most creative when you think about it .
If you ’ve ever had a creative buzz killed by distractive coworkers , you know exactly what I mean – it may actually be all the more frustrating than trying to do creative work when you ’re not creative since you could do it were it not for your bored and underemployed coworkers .
Of course , I ’m not just talking about coworkers ; the thing that kills your creative mojo could be an uncomfortable chair , an office without windows , a hard drive that rattles , a child that cries , or , for that matter , pants that are a smidge too small in the wrong places .
If something distracts you routinely enough where you do your creative work , the odds of you getting that creative spark become lower and lower , and , at a certain point , you just wo n’t be inspired there .
So , thinking you should do your creative work where you ca n’t do it is much the same as thinking you should do your creative work when you ca n’t do it .
If your creative time is your most valuable time , and you ’re more likely to have creative time in certain places , then it makes sense for you to get as much of your creative work ( and only your creative work ) in those places .
If that means you have to buy some equipment – a laptop , for instance – then do n’t resist it just because you ’d have to buy a laptop .
How long would it take for a laptop to pay for itself if you did four times the creative work on it during a week because you could do it where you ’re the most creative .
Think in terms of investments and / or means to production here to get real about this .
( No , this does not necessarily give you an excuse to run out and buy that shiny new laptop you ’ve been wanting . )
Be careful with this one , though , if your creative place is in the places you share with family or in the places that you wind down .
If your living room couch is where you get your spark , then make sure to set some limits on how much you ’re working and when you ’re working so that your work place does n’t change that space for everyone else .
Separating “ work ” areas from “ personal ” areas makes the psychic separation easier for us , so you may have to be more cognizant and diligent at making this separation if you mix the types of areas .
Also be mindful that you only do your creative work in that space .
If you move to your kitchen table because that ’s where you get your groove on only to start doing all of your “ office work ” there , then you risk losing the creative energy of that space .
Of course , you could move to someplace else after that happens , but why dilute it in the first place ?
Lastly , you may decide that you do n’t want your creative place to be the place that you work because you want to have a sacred place where work does n’t officially go .
If your library is intentionally an electronics - free zone , then hauling a laptop in there to work ruins it .
Some places are worth leaving sacred , even if you could be “ more productive ” by repurposing that space .
( If only our society paid more attention to this … )
I ’m quite aware that this may have a mystical , Feng - Shui-ish air about it , and that ’s just too much for some people .
Whether you believe or think that there ’s some other - worldly energy that flows through the places we inhabit or merely that we have habits that we ’re not conscious of at the cognitive level , the reality of our experience is that we are , in fact , more creative in some places than others in a very similar way that we ’re more creative at some times than others .
So , where are you the most creative ?
What can you do to do more of your creative work there ?
Municipalities are catching on to an innovative plan started by the City of San Diego to make solar panels more affordable to city residents , with a number of city governments expressing interest in the new financing scheme .
The San Diego Clean Generation Program , announced in December , will be the first of its kind in any major US city , according to San Diego 's Mayor , Jerry Sanders .
Under the scheme , the city will pay for residential solar panels , which householders and businesses will then pay for over time through their property taxes .
The up - front capital cost of installing solar panels can total around $ 25,000 after installation fees , material costs and inverter equipment is paid for .
This scheme gives residents the chance to pay for it over 20 years , according to the Mayor , who added that because the panels are tied to the property , the cost would pass to the new owner if a house with installed panels was sold .
Payment under the San Diego programme would amount to roughly $ 150 a month on top of the existing property tax bill - a fee advocates of the scheme claim will be largely offset by savings on utility bills .
The scheme will not come into effect until July 1 , but counties in Santa Fe , New Mexico are already considering rolling out the initiative , after the introduction of a bill by State Representative Brian Egolf .
The San Diego scheme will be conducted in partnership with a financing partner who will sell the loans as taxable bonds .
It was made possible by Assembly Bill 811 , which makes it possible for Californian municipalities to finance residential renewable energy projects .
The scheme is likely to act as a forerunner for a raft of green financing initiatives , both in California and further afield .
For example , last month the British Government said it was investigating similar legislation that would allow green home loans to be attached to a property rather than an individual , so that residents could install solar panels or insulation safe in the knowledge they would only pay for the technology while they own the property .

I ’ve always taken it for granted that brokers disseminate lies through the media to tweak property values .
But a couple of weeks ago , I became a small cog in the national real estate propaganda machine myself while reporting for the New York edition of Time Out — on Kensington , Brooklyn , a supposedly “ hot ” new neighborhood stretch bordering wealthy the Park Slope district .
Given the slick nature of the magazine , I filed a smoothed over narrative of what I saw — Bengalis , Hispanics and Hasids , chattering away amongst themselves in ancient dialects .
I left out the trash filled yards , chop shops and nasty eyed stares from the locals .
But a questioning email came back from my editor : where are the boutiques , cafes and charming restaurants ?
My answer , that there were n’t any , did n’t cut it with him .
My problem was I did n’t comprehend the nature of my assignment :
To hype an up - and - coming “ fringe neighborhood , ” for bottom - feeding brokers .
That ’s what this was all really about .
By the time my copy went through the editorial spin cycle it gleamed with low - slung starter homes and exotic eateries .
I should n’t feel too bad ; journalists have been burying the nabe ’s true identity in acres of idyllic imagery since the end of the boom — when the area was shilled as a junior yuppie ’s version of Park Slope ’s family utopia .
A typical example of how this message filtered through the media appeared in the Times , on May 25th , 2008 .
Experienced city reporter Jake Mooney introduced his readers to young artists moving their children to Kensington .
The reason he gave for the artists fleeing was n’t very convincing but it did n’t need to be : “ [ T ] he last straw in Park Slope was the parking . ”
Stylish boom - era readers did n’t need Mooney ’s 1400 words to get his drift .
Artists were moving there , so “ Kensington was the new Park Slope . ”
Across the US , similar salesmanship — masquerading as journalism — can be found in money - hemorrhaging publications , kept on life - support by brokers ’ ad revenue .
Reading the LA Times most e-mailed article this week , it ’s difficult to imagine the infusion of real - estate cash not holding editorial sway .
“ [ P]ent - up demand in traditionally stable or chic areas have kept prices up — not as high as the market ’s peak , but not nearly as low as they had feared , ” the broker - sourced piece gushes , bending over backwards to assure readers that — contrary to popular belief — the sky has n’t fallen on the real estate market .
Right .
But nowhere is this snake oil being sold as strongly and as cunningly as New York City , where self - conscious transplants eagerly suck down the so - called real estate “ service journalism , ” found in slick weeklies , Sunday newspaper supplements and websites such as Curbed.com .
In the last year , vacancies have risen drastically , and prices have dropped , so Kensington ’s marketing campaign has been adjusted to gear towards a less - wealthy demographic .
Clamoring as to why it ’s the borough ’s “ Best Value Neighborhood , ” the Daily News even rechristened the district with a hip - sounding designation : “ Called K - Town by some , Kensington combines an urban feel with row - house living … “ Contrast the News ’ description to a post on City - Data.com , a nationwide urban house hunters ’ forum .
Responding to a thread titled “ What is Kensington Like , ” a moderator wrote that although it was pretty safe it was also pretty grim .
“ It ’s very dirty and there is a lot of graffitti . [ sic ] ”
Read more here and here .
The term K - Town reeked of PR bullshit so I looked it up on Wikipedia .
It was flagged with a “ citation needed , ” tab .
Okay , academics routinely comb through the site with a virtual red pencil , so that did n’t prove it bogus .
A friend of mine , Mike Byrnes , grew up right off Kensington ’s main strip .
In his 30’s , Byrnes ’ still visits his parents there frequently .
I asked him about the name “ K - Town . ”
When his gravelly outer - borough laugh finally died down he said , “ I never heard it called that in my fucking life . ”
Even without the rebrand , The Daily News piece is dubious .
It reads in part , “ The neighborhood also has its own watchdog .
Two friends run kensingtonbrooklynblog.com to monitor growth … ”
When I was scrambling for a cluster of hipsters to write about for Time Out , I had breathed a sigh of relief on finding a post on the very same .
Entitled “ where the cool kids go , ” it seemed just what I needed to write about the alternative Kensington .
The cool kids were all at “ Jerbar , ” a brand new hipster bar with a “ speakeasy vibe , ” right smack in the middle of Church Avenue ’s Bengal grocers .
It took me about a minute to realize that Jerbar was a turgid fantasia cooked up by the overzealous anonymous flaks behind the site .
The bar does n’t exist .
You would n’t know it from reading Wikipedia ’s poorly sourced entry on Kensington , but , according to Byrnes , the place was rebranded before .
In the 1980s , swaths of the city with bad reputations were diced up into tiny parcels and rechristened with aristocratic - sounding names or cute acronyms .
Rough and tumble Flatbush — a massive neighborhood , with a large non-English speaking community — was parceled off .
The resulting pieces were christened Kensington and Windsor Terrace without a trace of irony .
Byrnes says he never even heard the term , “ Kensington , ” until he was a teenager .
Stressing his consonants for emphasis he says , “ It was always Flatbush , until one year this little phone book came around that said we were in Kensington . ”
These layers of misinformation and spin would be low comedy if so much hard earned money were n’t at stake .
According to Trulia.com , a real estate price index for consumers , the median sale price for a cozy piece of Kensington is well over 500 grand .
Not exactly cheap , but it represents a 25 % decrease — or 175 grand worth — in median price dip since last year .
But here ’s the kicker : Kensington property listings have only budged 1 % on average — staying at the dreamy amount of $ 352 K .
Kensington is one of only three neighborhoods in Brooklyn with such a discrepancy between average list price and median sale price .
( List prices are usually much higher . )
One of the three is its sister nabe , Windsor Terrace .
On Saturday , the flaks at kensingtonbrooklynblog.com were jumping up and down about a one - bedroom — for $ 289 K .
“ This is probably the best Home for sale in Kensington today [ sic ] . ”
You do n’t need to be an undersecretary of HUD to figure out something is rotten in this formulation .
When I was trolling around for yuppies , I bumped into a symbol of the broken Kensington dream ; A chubby nebbish coming home from the city with his wife and young child .
They emerged from the Church Avenue F entrance into a sea of Bengals wrapped in white robes and taqiyya .
Seeing my notebook he was anxious to talk .
He volunteered , “ You want to know if Kensington is the next Park Slope ? ”
Just minutes before , speakers mounted on nearby shops were buzzing with afternoon Islamic prayers , so it was n’t exactly foremost on my mind .
After going back and forth with the comparative merits , he decided ruefully that it was n’t , saying : “ The concept does n’t feel like a perfect fit . ”
Mark has a reason to give the bunk idea due diligence though .
Six years ago he fled from the Slope and bought a condo here , hoping real estate prices would rise .
Here he is with a kid now , living in what looks like South Asia — through the deep recession .
Mark explains the ethnic make - up of the Church Avenue away with a wan smile : “ stores are lagging behind as the neighborhood population shifts . ”
Right across from where we chat , an Albanian Pizzeria has changed over to a Bengal cafeteria , which is having its grand opening .
I do n’t think that ’s what the man means .
The Wisconsin Attorney General recently said in a legal memorandum that state law permits residents to openly carry a weapon in public , but the Police Chief in Milwaukee does n’t care what the law says :
[ S ] ome law enforcement officials are preparing to face more open - carry situations , and some are clear the memo wo n’t change their approach .
Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said he ’ll continue to tell officers they can’t assume people are carrying guns legally in a city that has seen nearly 200 homicides in the past two years .
“ My message to my troops is if you see anybody carrying a gun on the streets of Milwaukee , we ’ll put them on the ground , take the gun away and then decide whether you have a right to carry it , ” Flynn said .
“ Maybe I ’ll end up with a protest of cowboys .
In the meantime , I ’ve got serious offenders with access to handguns .
It ’s irresponsible to send a message to them that if they just carry it openly no one can bother them . ”
So , in Flynn ’s world , the mere fact that you ’re doing something that you ’re authorized to do under the law is reason enough for the police to forcibly detain you on suspicion that you might be a criminal .
Can anyone say police state ?
Glenn Reynolds wonders if Flynn would appreciate his own logic being applied to him :
[ I ] f you see Police Chief Ed Flynn , put him on the ground , take his wallet away , and then decide whether he ’s accepted any bribes that day .
If , after doing that , you think the money ’s his , give his wallet back .
Who cares what the law says ?
It ’s the Milwaukee Way !
Apparently .

I have been translating a lot of Japanese books lately , such as the Asian Salads and Asian Noodles ones I mentioned previously .
This is the latest one to come out , called The Real Japanese Izakaya Cookbook , by Wataru Yokota ( Tuttle Publishing ) .
I did n't just translate it ; I also wrote the introduction ( which is why my name is on the cover ) , as well the detailed explanations of all the Japanese ingredients that readers may not be familiar with .

ARLINGTON , Texas -- Los Angeles Angels right - hander John Lackey was activated from the disabled list Saturday to make his season debut , but was ejected after throwing only two pitches .
The first pitch thrown by Lackey went behind the head of Texas Rangers second baseman Ian Kinsler , who homered twice Friday night .
The next pitch hit Kinsler in the side of his upper body and home plate umpire Bob Davidson immediately ejected Lackey .
Angels starter John Lackey reacts to being ejected after delivering the second pitch of the game to the Rangers ' Ian Kinsler .

Manager Mike Scioscia argued at length with Davidson and crew chief Tim Tschida to no avail .
Lackey raised his arms on the mound with a look of disbelief on his face .
Lackey is the first starter in the majors to throw only two pitches in a game since Colorado 's Zach Day on Sept. 16 , 2005 .
Day was knocked out of that game at Arizona when a line drive broke his right thumb .
Shane Loux replaced Lackey on the mound .
Loux also pitched Friday night , when he gave up a 460 - foot two - run homer to Josh Hamilton in the eighth inning .
That was the third - longest homer ever hit at Rangers Ballpark and proved to be the difference in the Rangers ' 10 - 8 victory .
Lackey had been sidelined because of a forearm strain , but started the second game of a three - game series against the AL West - leading Rangers .
The right - hander missed the first 41 games last season with a strained triceps .
The Angels optioned third catcher Bobby Wilson to Triple - A Salt Lake .
Scioscia said the demotion of Wilson means the Angels will probably go with two catchers the rest of the season .
They also have Mike Napoli and Jeff Mathis .

Can we get just one more post out of Miss California Carrie Prejean ?
Yep , you bet we can !
On the heels of the “ values ” beauty contestant popping up in a sultry Bl!sss Magazine photospread , we ’re hearing there are — wait for it , wait for it — nude photos of her on the way !
In a tease , website TheDirty.com posted this backside shot of Prejean , which is likely only the beginning .
Remember those photos of Vanessa Williams that got her crown stripped ?
Looks like Miss California is en route to the same .
Normally , we would n’t give two shits about Prejean appearing semi-naked .
But once you start touting your “ traditional values ” and spit up anti-gay bile from the Bible , you deserve to be outed for your hypocrisy .
UPDATE : A second nude photo of Carrie Prejean hits .
You ’ve probably heard that Bush - Cheney and Rumsfeld - Wolfowitz had already developed plans to invade and occupy Iraq , months before the Saudi terrorists attacked the Pentagon and brought down the World Trade Center Twin Towers .
These conspirators immediately set out to justify their impending war of aggression on your fear that Islamic terrorists might well strike again , this time with " weapons of mass destruction . "
War of aggression ?
But did n’t Congress authorize Bush to use " military force " against Iraq in October 2002 ?
Well , no , and thereby hangs a tale .
On her show this week , Rachel Maddow first provided documentary film evidence of both Bush and Cheney repeatedly alleging that Saddam Hussein was not only " connected " to the Islamic terrorist organization al - Qaeda – believed to have been responsible for both the 1993 and 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center Twin Towers – but had actually trained and provided support to the terrorists .
Then Maddow astonishingly got Charles Duelfer – chief of the Iraq Survey Group , sent into Iraq by then - CIA director George Tenet , while the invasion was still in progress , primarily to discover and secure the weapons of mass destruction that the on - the - ground United Nations inspectors had already determined were nonexistent – to amplify upon his report written back in 2003 that " someone " ( not in the CIA ) " in Washington " had suggested he use waterboarding on a high - level Iraqi military intelligence official then being questioned by Duelfer , in order to obtain confirmation of the Bush - Cheney allegations about Saddam and al - Qaeda .
Next , Maddow got Bob Windrem , senior research fellow at NYU and former NBC executive producer , to amplify upon his report earlier that day that Duelfer ’s " someone " was in Cheney ’s office .
Now , back in early 2003 , Duelfer had already reported to Tenet that the Iraqis were cooperating totally and that the CIA had obviously got it completely wrong ( and that the UN inspectors had got it right ) about WMDs in Iraq .
So Duelfer could n’t understand why " someone " would " suggest " he use torture to get Iraqis to confirm allegations of Saddam ’s association with al - Qaeda – allegations that seemed to Duelfer , in Iraq , to be absolutely absurd .
So this week , Maddow proceeded to explain it all to Duelfer and the rest of us .
Bush - Cheney had been using torture since shortly after the 2001 attacks in so - far unsuccessful attempts to get anyone they could lay their hands on in Afghanistan or Pakistan to " admit " that Saddam had long had a close association with al - Qaeda .
Trouble was , Bush - Cheney could n’t even get someone they waterboarded six times a day for a month to " admit " that their allegations about Saddam and terrorists were true .
Why was getting those " admissions " so important to Bush - Cheney ?
Well , scroll back to September 2002 .
Bush ’s chief of staff , Andrew Card , had just created the White House Iraq Group , whose mission it was to convince Congress and the American people that Saddam Hussein was an existential threat .
In October , Tenet hastily prepared for WHIG a " slam - dunk " National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iraq ’s " Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction , " which included this zinger :
" Saddam , if sufficiently desperate , might decide that only an organization such as al - Qaeda – with worldwide reach and extensive terrorist infrastructure , and already engaged in a life - or - death struggle against the United States – could perpetrate the type of terrorist attack that he would hope to conduct .
" In such circumstances , he might decide that the extreme step of assisting the Islamist terrorists in conducting a CBW attack against the United States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him . "
That " slam - dunk " NIE was also presented to Congress and was the basis for the drafting by the Bush - Cheney White House of a congressional resolution [ . pdf ] authorizing the use of U.S. armed forces against Iraq , which passed several days later , with only one important modification .
Congress made that authorization conditional !
To wit :
“ In connection with the exercise of the authority granted in subsection ( a ) to use force the president shall , prior to such exercise or as soon thereafter as may be feasible , but no later than 48 hours after exercising such authority , make available to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president pro tempore of the Senate his determination that
( 1 ) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either
( A ) will not adequately protect the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq or ( B ) is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq ; and
( 2 ) acting pursuant to this joint resolution is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorist and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations , or persons who planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 . ”
Now , on Nov. 8 , Bush did get the UN Security Council to pass UNSCR 1441 , which required Saddam to immediately provide UN inspectors " unimpeded , unconditional , and unrestricted access to any and all " Iraqi facilities and officials .
But , to the absolute astonishment of Bush - Cheney , Saddam agreed to fully comply , and by March 2003 , it was obvious to the whole world , as a result of numerous reports by the UN chief inspectors , that no attempts had even been made to reconstitute whatever WMD programs Saddam may have once had .
Drat !
No Iraqi WMDs !
Saddam in compliance with all UN resolutions !
What to do ?
Well , try Plan B. Claim that it is absolutely necessary to invade and occupy Iraq because of Saddam ’s continuing association with , and assistance to , Osama bin Laden and his band of terrorists who brought down the Twin Towers on their second attempt .
But what about that presidential determination that Congress had required him to make in order to make the use of that congressional authorization legal ?
Well , Bush has yet to provide such a presidential determination !
However , Bush did send Congress a " report " [ . pdf ] on the day he launched his immoral and illegal – even under U.S. law – war of aggression against Iraq , which began by falsely claiming ,
" This report also explains that a determination to use force against Iraq is fully consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations , or persons who planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 . "
So now you know why Bush - Cheney tortured all those Muslims : to get them to " admit " that they were the war - criminals , not Bush - Cheney .
Jason Fortuny
A Seattle newscast reported one man responded with a picture
exposing himself in his cubicle where he worked — Microsoft —
adding " That man got fired . "
but one victim has finally successfully sued an infamous Craigslist prankster who published the private emails received in response to a fake sex ad .
Now for the first time , the court 's " John Doe " has agreed to tell his own side of the story .
" The message is in the fact that a lawsuit is indeed possible based on privacy issues , " says the victim , " and those considering similar behavior as Fortuny are advised to consider that fact .
"
In September of 2006 , Jason Fortuny posted a personal ad on Craigslist pretending to be a woman seeking kinky sex — and then published sexy pictures and complete emails he received , including any names and phone numbers , from over 150 men .
" [ T ] he chorus of blog posts saying ' someone ought to sue him ' gave me some satisfaction to being able to do just that , " says Doe , " on behalf of those who wished for justice in this matter . "
" IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED , " wrote Judge Joan B. Gottschall 30 months later — handing down $ 74,252.56 in legal fines to Fortuny .
Three law firm associates had spent 129.2 hours ( at $ 175 per hour ) litigating his 2006 Craigslist prank , plus another 35 hours by the main attorney billed at $ 275 per hour .
As part of the judge 's award , Fortuny will have to pay all their legal fees — a total of $ 32,365.50 — and he 'll even end up paying the extra costs accrued because he avoided their process servers .
" I hope that it demonstrates that claims ( and attorneys ) do exist that enable victims to pursue those who commit wrongful acts , " says the victim 's lawyer , Charles Mudd .
" Whenever I questioned ' why bother doing this ' , I just re-read the posts where Fortuny was taunting the victims who begged him to remove their information , " says victim John Doe , " and that renewed my resolve . "
In the end , Fortuny 's stubbornness is what led them to court .
" He publicly demonstrated his unwillingness to negotiate with others , so I knew that only a hardball response would be effective and that direct contact with him would be a waste of time and tip him off to my plans .
" Ironically , Fortuny was only fined $ 5,000 for " public disclosure of private facts " and " intrusion upon seclusion . "
The remaining bulk of the award — $ 35,001 — was for violating the plaintiff 's copyright .
" The Copyright Act provides for statutory damages from $ 750 to $ 35,000 per infringed work , " says Mudd , but those damages " can exceed $ 35,000 up to an amount of $ 150,000 per infringed work where the conduct was willful . "
This means that ultimately , it was Fortuny 's own " willful " conduct that increased the price he 'd eventually have to pay , Mudd argues .
" In general , Mr. Fortuny could have limited the amount of damages under the Copyright Act and could have significantly reduced the amount of attorney 's fees throughout the course of this matter .
" He chose not to do so .
" Fortuny initially argued that the suit against him was " abusing the intent of copyright law , stretching the common law terms of privacy , using unverified e-mail as alternative process , and side stepping personal jurisdiction . "
Last summer Fortuny wrote an eight - page letter informing the judge that " I do not have the resources for legal proceedings in another state , much less the exorbitant attorney fees for a Federal copyright case . "
But John
Doe 's lawyer points out that Fortuny did n't have to appear in person , and seemed genuinely surprised by the lackluster fight that Fortuny put up .
Judge Gottschall rejected Fortuny 's only other response — a " motion to dismiss " — writing that " It appears that the defendant filed the documents in the wrong courthouse . "
( The court 's rules also required a " notice of service " which Fortuny failed to provide . )
By the time Fortuny 's motion reached the right court , Judge Gottschall had already entered a default judgment against him .
" My firm and the Plaintiff provided Fortuny every opportunity to vacate the default , " says attorney Mudd , but after several months with no response , the case had moved forward .
"
The foregoing being said , I would have welcomed the opportunity to address the claims on the merits .
" Fortuny 's victim acknowledges that " The judge 's verdict was just a formality based on the rules .
Fortuny lost this on procedural grounds . "
But there 's still a lesson in his legal experience ... Fortuny 's prank became a symbol for unapologetic online " griefing , " and last August , the New York Times wrote Fortuny " might be the closest thing this movement of anonymous provocateurs has to a spokesman . "
Fortuny told the Times he knew two victims had lost their jobs over his prank .
" Am I the bad guy ? "
Fortuny asked rhetorically in the interview .
" Am I the big horrible person who shattered someone ’s life with some information ?
No !
This is life .
Welcome to life .
Everyone goes through it .
I ’ve been through horrible stuff , too .
" But John Doe was determined to fight back .
On that day in 2006 , Doe was alerted to his sexy picture being published online — first via an anonymous tip - off , and then helpful pointers from two of his friends , according to documents filed in the case .
He 'd quickly deleted his photo from the Wiki - like page at Encyclopedia Dramatica — only to see it re-appearing there later ( and with future deletions disabled ) .
" Through legal counsel , Plaintiff requested that Encyclopedia Dramatica remove Plaintiff 's Private Response , Copyrighted Photograph and personal email address from the Fortuny Experiment , " reads the case filing .
It adds that Encyclopedia Dramatica complied with Plaintiff 's request , but then Jason Fortuny himself grabbed the picture , and re-published it on his own site .
It was then that the angry victim sent Fortuny a DMCA notice , arguing that the photograph was copyrighted .
" I initially sought to protect my privacy and leave it at that , " Doe told us this week .
" Fortuny opposed my actions to remove my personal information , and so I was left with no choice but to take additional legal action against him .
" One internet rumor says the plaintiff must 've luckily had a friend who was a lawyer , but that 's not true , says Doe 's attorney .
" Neither I nor anyone at my firm knew of or communicated with the Plaintiff prior to the Craigslist Experiment . "
But he adds that " The case was well researched and on solid legal footing , and we had every reason to expect a favorable ruling on merit .
" Fortuny 's prank may have struck 149 other victims , but John Doe was different .
" I had the personal resources and was at liberty to risk additional publicity , " Doe says , " unlike apparently all the other victims .
Fortuny miscalculated in that regard as he assumed no one could either afford the legal costs nor take the personal risk to oppose him .
" This was a miscalculation that was perhaps not clear to him until a long time after I began the process .
" Doe 's photo was removed — temporarily — but by the end of the month , the photo was back on Fortuny 's site yet again , along with the text of the original sexy email message .
Fortuny had filed a counter - notification disputing the copyrighted status of the photo .
" The counter notification basically says ' you 're a liar liar pants on fire ' , " Fortuny explained on his blog , " and adds that if you do n't respond within 14 days , I get to put my shit back up .
" The incident occurred back in September of 2006 , and the first summons to Fortuny was issued 18 months later — over a year ago , in February of 2008 .
" For personal reasons I let some time pass before pulling the trigger on the lawsuit , " the victim says , and even then it took more than four months before the executed summons was finally returned .
" We had advised Fortuny that we reserved the right to take this up again at our convenience , and I suppose he mistook that for a bluff . "
The lawsuit acknowledged that after nearly two years , the photo and email were still displayed on Fortuny 's site .
And to this day , nearly 100 of the original photos , remain online at Encyclopedia Dramatica .
( Caution : link is not safe for work . ) This was n't Fortuny 's first brush with the courts .
One of our readers contacted us with a list of Fortuny 's other past legal skirmishes — including three municipal court citations for " no driver 's license on person " in 1999 , 2001 , and 2002 , as well as a 2004 citation for driving without proof of insurance .
But looking at the judge 's decision today , Doe sees a larger message .
" Beyond the goal of protecting my own privacy , there was a broader ' civic ' aspect to this case , " he notes , " which was motivating for me and of particular note motivating for my attorney .
Fortuny maliciously harmed a lot of people by his actions , and he made the point of bragging about how he was toying with the efforts of those who attempted to deal with him directly .
" It was sad to watch this happen , and it furthered my resolve to act as the ' adult on the playground ' and respond to this bully on behalf of all his victims in spirit anyway .
" But there 's another lesson in the incident — and ironically , it comes from the Craigslist sex troll himself — via the lawyer who prosecuted the case against him .
" I believe Fortuny himself sent the message for users of the Internet through the Craigslist Experiment — beware what you read online , " says Charles Mudd , " and think several times before communicating personal information through electronic mail to anyone .
" Especially someone you have never met . "
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
It was early one Sunday morning when the killer rang at a front door that was decorated with a wreath for Christmas .
When his victim answered , he fired four fatal shots , ran off and disappeared .
Police hope the new fingerprinting technique could detectives find new clues on murder weapons .
The unsolved murder of Marianne Wilkinson , 68 , in a town near Dallas , Texas , in December 2007 has left investigators with few clues and few leads .
They recovered the gun used in the crime a few months later , but the gunman 's identity -- and his motive -- remain a mystery .
Now , a groundbreaking technique developed across the Atlantic Ocean in Britain may help Texas police and others to crack cold cases like this .
The technique enables scientists to detect fingerprints on spent bullets and shell casings , even when the print had been wiped off .
It works by detecting the minute corrosion of metal caused by sweat , which corrodes the metal in the shape of the fingerprint .
" That sweat is in the pattern of the original fingerprint that was deposited , " said John Bond , a forensic scientist for England 's Northamptonshire Police and a researcher at the University of Leicester , who developed the technique .
The corrosion is often impossible to see with the naked eye because it 's so small -- as small as a micron , which is a millionth of a meter , Bond said .
His method involves dusting the metal with a fine black powder that adheres to the corroded areas , allowing scientists to see the fingerprint .
A detective from the police department in North Richland Hills , Texas , where Wilkinson lived in a gabled home with her husband , went to meet Bond late last year , Bond and the department said .
Bond was able to obtain a print from the shell casings in the Wilkinson case , meaning police could be able to discern who loaded the gun , if they can find a match , North Richland Hills Police Investigator Larry Irving told CNN .
Police are optimistic
Bond 's technique will bring them another step closer to solving the case .
" Prior to ( the detective ) coming over , and one of the reasons he came over , is they had little or no forensic evidence for this murder , " Bond said .
" So my own feeling would be that finding fingerprints would be significant . "
Investigators believe Wilkinson may have been the victim of mistaken identity , according to a profile of the case posted on the Web site for the television show " America 's Most Wanted , " which featured the case .
A neighbor whose address is very similar to Wilkinson 's told police she had recently gone through a bitter divorce , and that she and her ex-husband had an ongoing business dispute , according to the Web site .
Large amounts of money were at stake , the show said , and the woman believed she was the intended target .
Investigators traced the gun 's history to a man who is now deceased and , authorities believe , had no connection to the slaying , according to the television show 's Web site .
Police believe the gun has changed hands several times since then and are still seeking information on its latest owners .
The bullet fingerprinting technique wo n't necessarily solve crimes like the Wilkinson case but could unearth new clues , Bond said .
" It 's helping police get evidence they did n't have before , " he said .
" It 's simply a new line of inquiry and can be especially valuable with cold cases . "
In September , Bond found fingerprints on a shell casing from another murder case -- a 1999 double homicide in Kingsland , Georgia .
In that case , the suspect or suspects entered a Title Pawn business downtown , shot and killed the two employees and stole a small amount of money , said Kingsland police lieutenant Todd Tetterton .
Police assigned a full - time cold case detective , Christopher King , to the case because of " some things that had changed . "
The department read about Bond 's technique in a magazine article and contacted him to see if he could help , he said .
" We were interested in trying anything we could , " Tetterton said .
Four shell casings had been found at the crime scene , but fingerprint testing using traditional techniques did n't reveal anything of use .
Bond was able to find fingerprint ridges on three of the four casings , and one of them yielded enough ridge detail to possibly provide an identification , a University of Leicester statement said , quoting King .
Tetterton would only say that more than one shell casing was found at the scene , and said Bond was able to get results for detectives .
He declined to say more , citing the ongoing investigation .
" The results are surprising , " the university statement quoted King as saying .
" I feel very optimistic .
These results are better than I had expected and better than I hoped for . "
Bond does n't advertise his services , which he performs free of charge .
" All of the inquiries we 've had from the U.S. police forces have all been initiated by them , " he told CNN .
" We never say no , so anybody who says , ' I 've got some shell casings , we have some over 30 years old ' -- we always say send them and we 'll have a look . "
Bond says he tries to know as little about a case as possible before he looks for fingerprints , so no one can accuse him later of looking for something specific .
In one case , he said , he found a partial print on a shell casing sent in by police in Boulder , Colorado .
The detective told him it was a fingerprint they expected him to find .
" That was confirmation for me " that the technique worked , Bond said .
The technique wo n't work , however , if a person has just washed their hands or put on gloves before loading a gun .
But Bond said that 's not too much of a concern .
" Because of the nature of who these people are and the nature of what they 're committing , personal hygiene is not foremost in their mind when they 're doing this , " Bond said .
" It 's also the heat of the moment .
They might be sweating , perspiring , because you know you 're going to go out and break the law . "

Update -
Some changes over the last few hours
Update2 - Anthony Watts has contacted Lindzen for clarification
Update 3 on bottom
Science is an evolving process .
Data , models , and methods all evolve in time , correcting errors along the way , and building more questions or robust conclusions in the process .
It is necessary for people with expertise in a particular area to keep up with the data and any changes that may be made to it , as well as the underlying problems that may exist within the data .
In some unfortunate cases , people lose objectivity and will use only a particular dataset ( or version of that dataset ) that re-inforced some point they are trying to make .
In presenting information , not telling people outside of their field what the possible caveats are in a dataset , or explaining revisions that were made to data they show is not generally taken well in academic setting .
So it is with a recent example .
Richard Lindzen has made his presence felt at Anthony Watts blog in “ Lindzen on Negative Climate Feedback ” .
Accuweather also has a recent blog post on it .
In the comments , it is being hailed as the new found gospel truth of negative climate feedbacks and low sensitivity .
Unfortunately , the problem with most skeptical arguments is not what we are told , but rather what we are not told .
So what are n’t we told ?
Lindzen ’s method is easy to understand .
You can read it at Watts ’ blog .
The image of emphasis is ,
Lindzen ’s emphasis is on the outgoing LW flux at the top - of - the - atmosphere , and the fact it is large compared to models .
This is inferred to mean less of a “ blanketing ” effect from greenhouse gases , and therefore feedbacks which are less positive than models suggest ( or negative in this case ) .
At “ RealClimate ” , gavin pointed out a fixed graph that appeared in Science after a comment by Kevin Trenberth .
The changed figure is ,
However , there have been major revisions to this data since 2002 .
Specifically , there was a significant correction for changing satellite altitude in the computer code that was not turned on which led to erroneous results in the earlier work ( Bruce Wielicki , personal correspondence ) .
In many other cases , this kind of thing would be something WUWT would be on top of , so it is unfortunate that it is not mentioned .
There is an inverse square dependence on the amount of energy received at the Nonscanner WFOV instrument and the distance from the planet ’s center ; improperly accounting for altitude change led to spurious results for the TOA longwave and shortwave fluxes .
This has been documented in Wong et al 2006 , Journal of Climate , a paper not even mentioned by Lindzen .
ERBE S10N_WFOV ERBS Edition3 Data Quality Summary is available to cover further issues .
They state
Algorithm Changes between New Edition3 and Previous Edition2 Release
The main difference between new Edition3 and previous Edition2 release is in the treatment of TOA radiative fluxes resulting from changes in the ERBE nonscanner processing algorithm to account for decay in satellite altitude over the data period .
During an instrument performance study , Lee et al. ( 2003 ) discovered that the ERBE nonscanner inversion algorithm did not correctly account for the decay in the ERBS altitude over its mission lifetime ; this can have a small but significant effect on the reported decadal changes of nonscanner TOA fluxes .
The ERBE nonscanner inversion algorithm is used to convert nonscanner measurements at satellite altitude ( approximately 611 km at the start of the mission ) to TOA measurements at a reference altitude of 30 km .
While these altitude changes over the 15 - year period are small ( on the order of 25 km ) and do not affect the overall quality of the large regional fluxes , they do , however , have significant effect on the smaller changes associated with the observed large scale decadal changes in Earth radiation budget ( Wong et al. , 2005 ) .
This satellite altitude related problem is unique to the ERBS nonscanner instrument and does not affect the quality of the ERBS scanner data product .
The nonscanner is a hemispheric instrument which views the entire Earth disk along with the small portion of the deep space surrounding the Earth itself .
As the satellite altitude dropped over its mission , the small portion of the deep space partially viewed by the nonscanner began to be filled in by the Earth view itself , resulting in more energy being recorded by the nonscanner instrument .
Since the original and the Edition2 release data did not account for these subtle altitude changes , there is a small effect of artificially increasing the reported longwave , shortwave , and net fluxes over the mission lifetime .
Specifically , the overall effect of this altitude change is a small increase ( ~0.6 % ) in both longwave and shortwave radiation over the 15 - year period .
To minimize errors in the ERBS nonscanner data product , an altitude correction algorithm to the Edition2 data was developed and applied to the entire Edition2 data set .
The result is the new Edition3 data set .
Actual ERBS Edition 3 data is available at Nasa langley .
I will leave readers to explore further details .
Assuming he was familiar with these updates , Lindzen should have at least told his readers why he felt the older version was better for his analysis .
The experts working on it apparently do not think so .
An examination reveals that these corrections eliminate most of the signal that Richard Lindzen was using ( see figure 5 ) .
Section 5 of the 2006 paper also does comparison with ocean heat storage data , where the two agree within the uncertainty of the ocean data sampling .
This is pretty neat given the independent nature of the ERB data and ocean heat content measurements , an example of robustness that distinguishes results appearing in peer - reviewed documents vs. those in blog protocol .
In short , Lindzen ’s analysis is based on outdated data that has been revised since 2002 , and these revisions are not exactly recent , so he should have been aware of them .
Using the more recent data would not allow him to make his argument as presented as WUWT .
It would be nice to see an update at WUWT reflecting these changes .
I ’ve said quite a bit about feedbacks lately and it ’s a little old now , but many WUWT commenters still seem confused about how postive feedbacks relate to an unstable system .
Lindzen has recently been using the “ gas pedal ” analogy ( not only in Watts ’ post , but at the skeptic conference ) in which positive feedbacks are supposed to be analogous to someone changing the gas and brake pads in your car .
If you want to slow down , you actually speed up .
Apparently it follows that climate does not act this way .
Actually feedbacks do n’t really act this way either .
If we let the moving car roll on a flat , frictionless surface ( with no influence from the tires or air resistance ) in the absence of any net force change , it will roll forever by Newton ’s laws .
Think of this as some equilibrium condition , with the climate analog being radiative balance .
Pushing your gas or brake is more like the “ radiative forcing ” on the car which essentially puts it off of its current course .
Positive feedbacks simply let the planet equilibriate at a higher temperature than the sensitivity from CO2 alone , but the same principle that balance is acheived still applies .
Feedbacks go up like a converging power series and therefore never get strong enough to override the fourth power dependence of thermal radiation and trigger a “ runaway . ”
In short , positive feedbacks can be stable and do n’t require any runaway scenarios .
Update 3 – Lindzen has responded to Anthony Watts at his blog post .
I wish that more was to address , but to me he did n’t really say anything meaningful , but that is for readers to make judgments on .
Essentially Lindzen has set up the usual attacks that adjustments are always made to favor “ alarmism ” ( which is incorrect , if he bothers to read the standard literature from HadCRUT , GISS , etc on their methods ; perhaps if his claim was more specific , he knows it would be that much easier to invalidate ) .
A reduction in the LW flux at the TOA can be interpreted in other ways as well , some might argue for less overall warming in the 20th century for instance .
Lindzen once again claims that the changes still imply negative feedbacks , which is a rather dubious claim , given the discussion and comparisons with models in Wong et al .
I also do not believe the full range of sensitivity can be evaluated from these results , but even so , the justification for strong negative feedbacks has vanished .
The wheels are coming off the Tony Blair Faith Foundation following his demands for wholesale changes in Catholic belief and practice .
He , his wife Cherie and the foundation were firmly rebuffed in Rome this month at a meeting of the Pontifical Academy for Social Sciences where he was compared to Cromwell and his good faith was impugned .
As architect , with George Bush Junior , of the invasion of Iraq and the consequent death of more than a million Iraqis , the man unwilling to condemn the Israelis ' invasion of Lebanon in 2006 and the destruction wreaked in Gaza this year , he has lost credibility among Arabs .
He is under attack for failure to achieve progress on Middle Eastern peace as representative of the UN , the EU , the US and Russia .
" He is – at best – a total irrelevancy " , says Jerusalem - born Dr Ghada Karmi of Exeter University .
Now his newly created foundation has confirmed it is losing its director of policy .
William Chapman , a 57 - year - old Anglican who worked in Number 10 on appointments in the Church of England , is leaving to become secretary to Ian Luder , the Lord Mayor of London .
The Tablet , a Catholic weekly , quoted Stephen Pound , Labour MP for Ealing North and himself a Catholic , correctly forecasting Blair 's hubristic attitude would damage him among Catholics , Muslim and Jews .
" It is extremely counterproductive .
Entrance to the Vatican is only gained through a series of iron - clad , hermetically sealed , heavily padlocked and bolted doors , and I can hear them creaking shut as we speak . "
Pound warned Blair against " dictating to the pope through the media " .
Much worse news came this month from the Vatican where the couple came under sustained fire at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences , a group of scholars which includes the economist and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Hans Tietmeyer , former head of the German central bank .
The meeting ( pdf ) , convened by the pope , was organised by Roland Minnerath , once Vatican diplomat , now archbishop of Dijon .
The attack was spearheaded by Professor Michel Schooyans of the Catholic University of Louvain , a specialist in anthropology and political philosophy .
Speaking uncompromisingly , Schooyans accused Blair and his wife of supporting a messianic US plan for world domination .
One of the aims of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation will be that of remaking the major religions , just as his colleague Barack Obama will remake global society .
With this purpose , the foundation in question will try to expand the ' new rights ' , using the world religions for this end and adapting these for their new duties .
The religions will have to be reduced to the same common denominator , which means stripping them of their identity ...
This project threatens to set us back to an age in which political power was ascribed the mission of promoting a religious confession , or of changing it .
In the case of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation , this is also a matter of promoting one and only one religious confession , which a universal , global political power would impose on the entire world .
The Belgian all but ridiculed the former prime minister .
" The fresh ' convert ' does not hesitate to explain to the pope not only what he must do , but also what he must believe !
Is he a Catholic ? ...
So now we are back in the time of Hobbes , if not of Cromwell : it 's civil power that defines what one must believe . "
Given the hostility expressed towards Blair in Rome he will be lucky to recruit the outgoing archbishop of Westminster , Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor , to the foundation as he promised .
The hostility – and ridicule – that the Blairs and their associates stir up mean he is increasingly unlikely to achieve his ambition of becoming president of the EU .
PROVO , Utah , April 7 ( UPI ) --
The newspaper of Utah's Brigham Young University said papers had to be reprinted after a front page typo used " apostates " in the place of " apostles . "
Rich Evans , editorial manager for The Daily Universe , said newspaper employees retrieved as many of the 18,500 copies of Monday 's paper they could find and reprinted them to correct the typo , The Salt Lake Tribune reported Tuesday .

Evans said the mistake was in a caption on the photo of this week 's Latter Day Saints General Conference .
The caption mistakenly had the word " apostates " in the place of " apostles , " Evans said .
" Members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostates and other general authorities raise their hands in a sustaining vote Saturday morning , " the uncorrected caption read .
The reprinted newspaper included the correction as well as an apology to the apostles .
" It was the worst possible mistake , " Evans said .
" It would have been worse if it were done intentionally , as some have thought , " Evans said .
" But after talking to the people , we found it was an innocent mistake . "
Evans said the mistake occurred when the newspaper 's spell checking software noticed " apostles " was misspelled and offered the closest word it could find , " apostates . "
Even as early as last year , anyone trying to compare the circumstances of the United States with the lost decade in Japan appeared to be out of line with mainstream economist and the media .
Yet if this financial crisis has taught us anything , it is that the experts can be wrong by a wide margin .
Given our recent economic circumstances , Japan style stagnation is looking more and more likely .
Even the media is now using the phrase “ zombie banks ” in reference to banks that were kept artificially alive during the Japanese lost decade .
Noble Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman had this to say recently in Beijing :
“ ( Telegraph ) We ’re doing half - measures that help the economy limp along without fully recovering , and we ’re having measures that help the banks survive without really thriving .
We ’re doing what the Japanese did in the nineties . ”
Mr Krugman said that the recent stress test results had bought the Obama administration some time , but that questions remained as to whether banks have enough capital to fulfill their role in the wider economy . ”
So why is Japan suddenly being used as a comparison ?
First , it is important to understand what happened in Japan in the first place .
Japan like the U.S. has been fond of boom and bust markets .
First , let us take a look at some of these bubbles :
The 1980s witnessed an enormous boom for Japan .
The Nikkei boomed and so did real estate .
If anything , they had a double bubble just like we did with the 1990s technology bubble followed by the 2000s real estate bubble .
Japan ’s bubble was fueled by euphoria that current prices were justified because of future earnings potential but of course , the pace was completely unrelated to fundamentals and like all bubbles , burst .
This is where we follow Japan down the same path .
Japan ’s banking system made enormous amounts of bad loans on over priced real estate .
Instead of taking over banks temporarily , wiping out shareholders , giving bondholders a haircut , and finding a true value of the assets the government decided to zombify the banking system .
That is , it did n’t take banks into receivership and take the painful short - term medicine but kept pumping money into them hoping that someday , they would come back .
What occurred ?
Two lost decades .
As you can see from the chart above , both asset prices and stock prices have been steadily collapsing for nearly 20 years .
The Nikkei peaked at 38,915 on December 29 , 1989 .
Today it stands at 9,324 , a drop of 76 % over 20 years :
It is important to note that Japan not only injected money into their failing banking system , but spent trillions in fiscal stimulus .
Of course , much of this was largely fueled by cheap money through dropping interest rates :
Japan took rates to zero and was the first country to experiment with quantitative easing which clearly did not work .
That is why with all this market volatility , it is surprising to see the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve repeat the same mistakes .
If you look at the above chart , and expand it out keeping rates low , it does not necessitate a healthy economy in the end .
What it does is protects the elite of the banking system .
And that is the irony , the overall banking sector has done horribly in Japan even with all the handouts but like our system , banking executives in Japan also did well during this time :
It is amazing that the S&P 500 ran up nearly 40 % in two months given all the current news .
First , we need to remember that nearly 25,000,000 Americans are either unemployed or underemployed .
That is a significant drain to the health of our economy .
And the recent optimism in the banking sector is completely unfounded .
The American banking system by technical definition is insolvent .
The only reason they are turning any kind of profit is because of artificial injections of money through massive bailouts .
The current banking model is designed for high flying real estate and fast trading of toxic securities and derivatives .
With that model shutting down , banks really have no sustainable model .
Japan faced similar issues .
That is why if you look at the above chart , for nearly 20 years Japanese banks have been struggling to find their footing .
Aside from the current misplaced optimism , banks are still in horrible shape .
What has occurred is our current policy is right out of Japan ’s playbook .
If history is any guide , let us count the similarities :
(1) Stock market bubble – pops
(2) Real estate bubble – pops
(3) Massive injections of capital into banks – no nationalization
(4) Enormous fiscal stimulus
(5) Banks keep toxic assets on books
(6) Record low interest rates – ca n’t go lower than 0 can you ?
The parallels are unmistakable .
Another important similarity is giving money to banks does not mean they will lend :
This chart sums it up .
There is an increase in M2 yet bank lending steadily declines for over a decade .
Of course , the Japanese banking officials came out to the public stating that injecting capital into banks would cause lending but the above proves otherwise .
And this is happening in the U.S. :
We can take the above chart to the 1950s and you will not see banks holding any excess reserves that will show up on the chart .
All of a sudden the chart pops , banks are hoarding money .
Why ?
They are flat broke !
You would think that with trillions injected into banks , they would start lending to the public .
Well if we just look at Japan , we already know that lending is not going to happen :
What is occurring is failed banks are being subsidized by the taxpayer .
The bailouts will stagnate our economy for at least a decade while we keep feeding the Hungry , Hungry Hippo banks .
Oh , and another thing that I forgot is we are seeing a fall in general prices :
Exhibit A : Japan
Exhibit B : U.S .
Now we are looking at the prospect of deflation .
Looking at this data and reasons it seems like we are doing everything Japan did .
I saw someone argue that the Japanese had more savings and that is the difference .
Well , yes .
In fact , that only makes it worse for us since we have less of a buffer .

Introduction
Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication between clients and servers .
When a server and client communicate , TLS ensures that no third party may eavesdrop or tamper with any message .
TLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) .
This enables any user on the system to exchange files in a secure manner , as long as their counterpart offers this extension as well .
You might wonder if you already have a secure file transfer protocol , or FTP , ( sftp ) which comes with openSSH , why would you opt for a new way of securing the FTP ?
While it may seem that using secure FTP only and no secure telnet might not be most desirable , this method is in fact a sensible alternative for environments where you are not able to use OpenSSH .
For example , if your most trusted systems run on a dedicated and segregated network , it makes perfect sense to use telnet for remote access within that very network zone ( or working from the console ) .
But even in such scenarios , you might very well have the need to transfer data from or to this secure zone , which can be accomplished now using secure FTP .
Another scenario could be that you are using OpenSSH already but you still have to exchange data with outside systems that do not support any form of SSH ( thus neither scp nor sftp ) .
Most often , such ( legacy ) systems offer “ FTP via SSL ” ( often called ftps ) instead .
Requirements for secure FTP
TLS relies on Secure Socket Layer , which needs OpenSSL to be installed on the AIX system ( ftps depends on the libssl . a and libcrypto .a libraries ) .
The latest version of IBM - supported OpenSSL can be obtained from https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=aixbp .
The secure communication between the FTP client and server makes use of the certificates , a combination of a public - private key pair .
Hence , the creation of certificates in - house or the import of certificates from commercial certifying authorities is the second requirement for setting up FTP over SSL .
Setting up FTP between AIX and Windows
There are four steps to set up FTP between AIX and Windows :
The article looks into each of these activities separately .
Creation of certificates
As stated previously , certificates need to be created for negotiation between the FTP server and the client if there is not already a commercial certificate .
First , install OpenSSL on the Windows machine if certificates are created at this machine .
If not , the commercial certificates just need to be brought into this machine .
Create a root - level private key and root - level certificate request ( holding the public key ) .
Listing 1 . Root - level certificate request
c:\>cd c:\openssl\bin\ openssl req - newkey rsa:2048 - sha1 - keyout root_key.pem - out root_req.pem
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key ...................................+++ ....+++ writing new private key to ' root_key.pem '
Enter PEM pass phrase : Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase : -----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request .
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN .
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value , If you enter '.' , the field will be left blank .

Now you will create an RSA key for the Windows FTP server without a PEM passphrase ; hence , you will use a different command than the one used previously .
It is important not to use any passphrases on such server keys .
Otherwise , it would be required to input that passphrase every time the key gets used ( which is impossible to accomplish when ftpd is using it ) .

Copy the above key content into a file named server_key .pem .
Next , create a certificate request for the key you just created ( including its public key ) :
Listing 5 . Certificate request for the created key
openssl req - new - key server_key.pem - out server_req.pem
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request .
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN .

In order to make server configurations easier as well as the distribution of certified key files , it is handy to have the server key , the server certificate , and the root certificate in one single file ( OpenSSL supports this ) .
So combine all three files into one file .
This file should be protected with respective file permissions .
Listing 7 .

Copy the contents of server_key .pem server_cert.pem root_cert.pem into the file server.pem

Export the server certificate into the .pfx format .

Now you have the server certificate in the .pfx format , which Windows accepts .
It is very important that you add this certificate to the Microsoft® Management console ’s trusted certificate repository .
Failure to do so will result in making the certificate untrusted during the usage .
The Microsoft Management Console ( MMC ) can be accessed by Start ->
Run -& type mmc .
The MMC has an option to add the certificates as snap-ins .
Figure 1 . Microsoft Management Console
Figure 2 . Adding snap-ins
Once the Snap - in “ certificate ” is added to the console , you get the certificate categories as listed below .
Select the trusted root certificate or any other certificate category accordingly and import the server certificate that you had created into it .
Figure 3 . Importing the certificate
The import of the certificate will open up the Certificate Import Wizard , following which the import of certificate becomes successful .
Figure 4 . Certificate Import Wizard
You have now changed the OpenSSL certificate for the FTP purpose into a trusted certificate in the Windows machine .
Figure 5 . Certificate added successfully to the snap - in
Now open up the Internet Information Services ( IIS ) manager and add this trusted certificate as a part of the the ISS server certificate database and now it can be used for the different services of IIS , which includes secure FTP .
Figure 6 . Server Ceriticate repository
Figure 7 . Import into Server Certificate repository
Importing the server certificate into this repository makes it usable for the secure FTP service .
Also , note that the certificate is OK and is trusted .
After the certificate is successfully added , you have to ‘ apply ’ the changes in the IIS Manager for the changes to take effect .
Figure 8 . Imported certificate
Setting up FTP services on a Windows server
To set up FTP on the Windows side , you have to open the console for Internet Information server ( IIS ) .
IIS can be accessed through Start -> Administrative Tools -> Internet Information Services ( IIS ) Manager .
Figure 9 . Internet Information services ( IIS ) Manager
Create a new site for this purpose and the work area will create the FTP - specific services .
In this case , create a site called ssl_ftp_site .
Figure 10 .
Adding an FTP site
You can assign specific IP address and ports for which this FTP server needs to be associated .
In this step , there is an option that asks you to specify the certificate .
If the certificate is created and ready for usage , it can be specified now or could be left for later configuration .
Figure 11 .
Binding and SSL settings
This step configures the FTP servers authentication mode and the users who are allowed , along with their read / write permissions and completes the configuration of the FTP site in the IIS .
Figure 12 .
Authentication and authorization information
The panel at the right side under the “ Manage FTP Site ” section helps you to either stop or run the service .
It is always important to stop the server and restart it for any changes to take effect .
Figure 13 .
Site ready for use
Now you must set the FTP SSL settings for the site , which is available on the workspace of the FTP site home .
Figure 14 .
FTP SSL settings
Again , do not forget to stop the server and restart it for the changes to take effect .
Configuration of FTP at the AIX client
There is one further step of security that can be established with such self - signed certificates :
The rootCA ’s certificate needs to be copied to every client and referred to in their ~/. ftpcnf files of any user wishing to use encrypted and authenticated FTP sessions .
Adjust the user ’s . ftpcnf file to point to the CA certificate by only changing this one line :
CA_PATH ./root_cert.pem

Data transfer using secure FTP
You can use /usr / bin / ftp to connect to the FTP daemon on any remote system , whether this target host is TLS - enabled or not .
Once you have completed the TLS setup on your server , in order to transfer files to or from that server , you can issue the following command .
# ftp -s –M remote_host Show more Show more icon
This will establish an encrypted session without any modifications needed on the client side .
If the certificate , however , is self - signed , the client has to blindly trust the server , so the FTP command will display the most important data of the certificate it received during the TLS handshake to leave the decision up to the user whether he wants to connect or not .
The command ftp –s remote_host will work only for AIX - to - AIX machines .
One has to use the ftp –s –M remote_host option to get the secure FTP working between AIX and non-AIX machines .
Conclusion
This article covered the various aspects of the secure FTP setup , which includes the FTP service configuration on the Windows server side and the FTP configuration on the client side .
This feature adds a very important security capability to the AIX operating system and helps it to harness the similar functionality available with other operating systems , tthus helping the customer to have a secure file transfer in a heterogenous environment .
$ 99.3 billionNo surprise here : The New York - based insurance company that spawned an out - of - control London derivatives dealership is now a $ 170 billion ( and counting ) headache for the American taxpayer .
The bulk of the losses came from the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of contracts created by AIG Financial Products to pay off holders of mortgage - backed securities if the home loans that backed them defaulted .
As housing prices collapsed last year , the epicenter of the crisis quickly moved to the London offices of the previously little - known AIGFP .
When AIG said in September it could n't make good on the huge sums it owed AIGFP counterparties like Goldman Sachs , the U.S. Treasury Department took an 80 % stake in the company rather than watch those contracts unravel disastrously .
Pope John Paul II was buried on 8 April 2005 .
In the nine days between his funeral and the sealing of the conclave to elect his successor , the critics and enemies of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger worked feverishly to prevent his being chosen pope .
The Sunday Times went trolling for stories contrasting Ratzinger - the - Hitler - Youth with heroic Karol Wojtyla , Polish resistance fighter against Nazism and communism .
La Repubblica , the flagship daily of the Italian Left , spun fanciful tales about a “ German - American coalition ” capable of blocking Ratzinger ’s election , not least by appealing to Third World cardinals whose dioceses depended on German financial support .
These at times risible media efforts at electoral preemption had at least the tacit support , and in some cases the encouragement , of progressive Catholic activists , intellectuals and prelates for whom the idea of “ God ’s Rottweiler ” as pope was the nightmare that dared not speak its name .
Ironically , Joseph Ratzinger spent part of those same nine days in a parallel effort to forestall his own election .
A modest man , he nonetheless knew that his brilliant performance as Dean of the College of Cardinals – leading the cardinals in their deliberations after John Paul ’s death and leading the world in prayer at his funeral – had made him the odds - on favourite to be the 264th successor to St Peter .
And he wanted none of it .
He had planned to submit his resignation to the new pope and to demand its acceptance .
Thrice before he had retreated when he had tried to resign and John Paul had asked him to stay .
Now he was determined to return to his native Bavaria to take up housekeeping with his older brother , a priest and distinguished choirmaster .
He would turn 78 two days before the conclave was immured .
It was time to go home and pick up the threads of the scholarly life he had sacrificed on becoming archbishop of Munich and Freising in 1977 .
How does a papal frontrunner work against his own election , particularly if he actually means it and is not simply making an outward show of humility or diffidence ?
Ratzinger ’s case against Ratzinger was simply put : “ I am not a man of governo , of governance , ” he said , in each of the half - dozen languages he speaks fluently .
Do n’t do this to me ; do n’t do this to yourselves .
Those who were forwarding his candidacy – men like George Pell of Sydney , Christoph Schönborn of Vienna and Angelo Scola of Venice , three of the Catholic Church ’s most impressive younger leaders – replied , in so many words , “ Why do n’t you let God have his say ?
Do n’t prejudge the work of the Holy Spirit . ”
As things turned out , the actual voting was close to a formality , as Ratzinger was elected on the fourth ballot in one of the shortest conclaves in history .
Yet there were , evidently , lingering questions among both his supporters and opponents as to whether he would accept the burden he had tried to avoid : in their post - conclave press conference , the German cardinals ( who included both supporters and opponents ) told reporters that there was a “ great collective sigh of relief ” when Cardinal Ratzinger accepted his election .
That the newly - chosen Benedict XVI remained acutely aware of his own limitations , however , was made unmistakably clear on the morning after the election .
Celebrating Mass with the College of Cardinals in the Sistine Chapel , Benedict asked , in his homily , “ Do not deny me your counsel . ”
In the four years since the 265th Bishop of Rome stepped out on to the loggia of St Peter ’s to be presented urbi et orbi , “ to the city and the world ” , Pope Benedict XVI has systematically dismantled the media cartoon of “ God ’s Rottweiler ” that had dogged him for decades .
A few months after his election , while vacationing at the papal summer villa , Castel Gandolfo , he invited his old theological adversary , the Swiss dissident Hans Küng , to stop by for a conversation and a beer or two .
Confounding the critics who claimed he could never compete with “ John Paul Superstar ” for the affections of the young , he has presided over two successful World Youth Days , in Cologne and Sydney .
He displayed a well - honed pastoral sensibility in his May 2008 Washington meeting with the victims of clerical sexual abuse , as he did in reaching out to the relatives of those who had died on 9/11 after his silent prayer over the ruins of the Twin Towers in New York .
His September 2006 Regensburg Lecture on faith and reason is still deplored by uncomprehending reporters and soi-disant Vatican insiders as a major diplomatic “ gaffe ” .
The truth of the matter is that Benedict sent such salutary shock waves throughout the worlds - within - world of Islam that more robust patterns of interreligious dialogue are slowly emerging .
Issues once considered untouchable – religious freedom as a fundamental human right that can be known by reason , and the necessary separation of religious and political authority in a just state – are now , at Benedict ’s insistence , at the forefront of the dialogue between Catholicism and Islam .
His address to the United Nations General Assembly in April 2008 was a powerful and compelling argument that the exercise of freedom must be guided by moral truths , and that those moral truths are accessible to men and women of good will who take the risk of thinking seriously .
Regularly defying the nay - sayers who argued that Ratzinger would be simply unpresentable in public , Benedict ’s weekly audiences in Rome continue to draw large crowds , many of them larger than those drawn by John Paul II .
In his first two encyclicals , Deus Caritas Est [ God Is Love ] and Spe Salvi [ Saved in Hope ] , he has displayed a striking ability to elucidate the basics of Christian faith in a way that takes full account of postmodern scepticism .
In these letters , the once - dreaded “ enforcer of orthodoxy ” responds to unbelief or weak belief in a spirit of conversation , not condemnation .
His international bestseller , Jesus of Nazareth , sympathetically explored an American rabbi’s imaginary conversation with Jesus , even as Benedict reminded all Christians of the debt that Christianity owes to its parent , Judaism .
And the thumbscrews and rack have remained locked in the basement of the office Ratzinger once headed , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which ( as the world media never cease to remind us ) “ was once known as the Inquisition ” .
Yet for all these impressive accomplishments , the fifth year of his pontificate is opening under storm clouds of crisis .
The Pope ’s January effort to extend a hand of reconciliation to the ultra- traditionalist followers of the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre ignited a worldwide uproar .
One of the four Lefebvrist bishops whose excommunications were lifted , an ex-Anglican named Richard Williamson , turned out to be a Holocaust denier – a point of which the Pope and his senior advisers were evidently unaware , although bloggers and other internet literates from the Antipodes to Zimbabwe had the full , nasty story .
The Lefebvrist fiasco and the chaos it caused in Catholic - Jewish relations were just settling down when Austria erupted .
The issue in this case was the appointment of a new auxiliary bishop of Linz , who turned out to have interesting ideas about the relationship between divine providence and meteorology : Hurricane Katrina ’s ravaging of New Orleans , the nominee once claimed , was God ’s punishment for decades of debauchery in the Big Easy .
The bishop - elect eventually asked the Pope to withdraw his nomination , and Benedict agreed .
Some wondered whether a new round of Josephinism – the Enlightenment - era Austrian resistance to papal authority in the nomination of bishops – was at hand .
As this Alpine ecclesiastical earthquake rumbled across Europe , the Roman Curia proved itself incapable of frankly and expeditiously handling another disaster – the revelations that Father Marcial Maciel , founder of the priestly order of the Legion of Christ and the lay movement Regnum Christi , had led a life of sexual dissolution and financial irregularity , even as the order and the lay movement provided some of the most vibrant young priests and lay activists in the Church .
While that slow - motion train - wreck headed towards the abyss , the best of the Vaticanisti , Sandro Magister of the weekly L’espresso , reported that the Vatican Secretariat of State may have badly misread the character and qualifications of Joseph Li Shan , the new bishop of Beijing , who has , Magister argued , been far too cosy with the Chinese communist regime and the regime - supported Patriotic Catholic Association .
Benedict XVI did take advantage of a February meeting demanded by the pro-abortion Catholic Speaker of the US House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , to deliver a firm reminder of one of those moral truths that can be known by reason – that innocent human life deserves the protection of the laws in any just society .
Speaker Pelosi was also denied the photo - op she obviously craved , a sign that the Vatican had not completely lost its capacity to control its own agenda and the Pope ’s role in advancing that agenda .
Yet , for Benedict ’s supporters , the Pelosi reprimand was a brief moment of sun through the darkening clouds .
Had Ratzinger been right in April 2005 ?
Was he really not a man of governo ?
And what did that portend for the future of his papacy which , despite his age , could stretch well into the next decade ?
The Lefebvrist fiasco was a microcosm of the complex set of administrative and managerial problems that Benedict must confront and resolve , if his intellectual lucidity and pastoral good sense are not to be obscured by the incapacities and incompetence of the Curia , the reform of which he was expected to undertake by those who elected him in 2005 .
The Curia exists for one reason : to give effect to the will of the Bishop of Rome , who is the source of both legislative authority and policy initiative in the universal Church .
As Canon 360 of the Code of Canon Law puts it , “ The Supreme Pontiff usually conducts the business of the universal Church through the Roman Curia , which acts in his name and with his authority for the good and for the service of the [ local ] Churches . ”
As in all governmental bureaucracies , of course , stated rationale and actual performance are not always aligned .
For the Curia not infrequently mimics the behaviour of every other bureaucratised power structure on the planet .
It staples a salute to the leader to its collective forehead even as it pursues its own interests and intrigues , all the while attempting to bring the leader around to “ the way we do things here ” .
It is often thought that popes have a unique freedom of action .
The fact is that the exercise of papal governance is deeply affected , for good or ill , by the competence of the Curia and its senior officials .
Contemporary popes can and do go over or around the Curia to shape the international debate , as John Paul II and Benedict XVI have shown .
Yet there is no governing the Catholic Church over or around the Curia .
So a great deal depends on how successful a given pope is in selecting the Curia ’s leaders and guiding their work .
Most of what the world thinks it knows about the Curia is , in fact , mistaken .
It is , for example , a remarkably small operation , given that it is the administrative centre of a human community with 1.2 billion members living in every corner of the globe .
Among its 3,000 or so employees , perhaps 40 at the most have real operational or decision - making roles .
The rest are worker - bees – often very able , polyglot worker - bees with advanced degrees – whose task is to serve what are known in Curia - speak as “ the superiors ” : the two or three heads of each of the curial “ dicasteries ” , which are the rough equivalents of cabinet departments .
Despite its international character , Italian remains the Curia ’s lingua franca , and an inability to speak the language well is usually an insuperable impediment to serious influence – unlike the inability to speak English , the now - universal language of commerce , science and diplomacy .
The Curia also remains Italianate , which is to say laid - back , in its work culture : while the Curia does not acknowledge that staple of modern temporality known as the “ weekend ” and its offices are open for business on Saturday mornings , those same offices are only open in the afternoon on Tuesdays and Fridays ( the days , Curial wags note , that Catholic piety traditionally assigns to the Sorrowful Mysteries of the rosary ) .
An Italianate approach to crisis management – or , better , crisis non-management – is also pervasive , rooted in the sense that “ we ’ve seen it all before , so there ’s no reason to get into a flap ” .
That “ thinking in centuries ” approach has its undeniable advantages in a world in which everyone is supposed to have an opinion on , or answer to , everything , 24/7 : it allows for situations to mature , for calm to be restored and for rational decision - making to take place .
It can also result in a pope getting blindsided by events to the detriment of his authority , as Benedict XVI has learned to his regret and John Paul II learned before him .
In April 2002 , for example , John Paul was learning things about the American crisis of clerical sexual abuse that he should have known four months earlier .
Once he knew he acted , and acted decisively .
But he should have known earlier , and the Curia ’s entrenched scepticism about media - driven crises was one reason he did n’t .
John Paul II was acutely aware that the election of the first non-Italian pope in 455 years , as well as his own free - wheeling personal style , unsettled the traditional managers of popes .
Moreover , he was not a man who took much satisfaction from shuffling and reshuffling the boxes on an organisational chart .
So rather than undertaking a wholesale re-examination of how the Curia ought to function in the 21st century , he left the basic Curial structure created by Pope Paul VI in 1967 intact , while running his own foreign policy out of the papal apartment – much to the chagrin of the papal Secretariat of State , some of whose senior members imagined that they knew more about , say , Poland , than the Polish pope .
John Paul ’s most important Curial innovation was to jettison the tradition of the pope ’s spokesman being a Curial priest by installing the Spanish layman Joaquin Navarro - Valls , an accomplished journalist , as head of the Holy See Press Office .
It was often said that Dr Navarro - Valls ( who liked to joke that his early professional experience as a psychiatrist had prepared him well for dealing with the Vatican press corps ) brought the Holy See ’s press operation “ into the 20th century ” .
To which the proper response was , “ Yes , the first half of the 20th century . ”
That was no mean accomplishment , given Curial resentments over a layman who was spokesman , confidant and private diplomatic agent of the pope .
But Navarro - Valls ’s personal accomplishments were mistaken by many as a sign that the Curia had entered the world of 21st - century communications .
It has n’t , as the first day of the Lefebvrist crisis made painfully clear : Fr Federico Lombardi SJ , Navarro - Valls ’s successor , was sadly unprepared for the informal press briefing he gave the day the story broke , because he had n’t been brought into whatever deliberations there had been about lifting the Lefebvrist excommunications .
Thus the false impression was immediately created , and just as immediately hardened into “ fact ” , that the Lefebvrist bishops had been restored to the full communion of the Church , which had n’t happened .
That misimpression , the result of inept communications and bureaucratic blundering , intensified the outrage over Bishop Williamson ’s Holocaust denial .
American Catholic black humour at this incompetence turned to memories of the legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel , who once asked of his woefully inept 1962 New York Mets , “ Ca n’t anybody here play this game ? ”
Every ecumenical council in the history of the Church was prompted by turmoil , conducted in turmoil or resulted in turmoil .
The Second Vatican Council , which brought two young central Europeans named Karol Wojtyla and Joseph Ratzinger to prominence on the world Catholic stage , was no exception .
The post - conciliar turmoil following Vatican II is generally thought to have taken place on the port side of Catholic life , with liberal and progressive theologians publicly dissenting from authoritative Catholic teaching while attempting to stretch the boundaries of acceptable Catholic thought and practice with the aid of acquiescent bishops and religious superiors .
Yet the only schism following Vatican II – the only formal , legal break in the unity of the Church – did not come on the Catholic Left ( which knew that its magnetic attraction for the world media required staying formally inside the tent ) .
It came on the far reaches of the Catholic Right .
Its protagonist was a French archbishop with extensive missionary experience in Africa , Marcel Lefebvre .
Throughout the world , Lefebvrists and other traditionalist Catholics are known for their preference for the older forms of Catholic worship , particularly the Mass celebrated in Latin according to the missal established by the Council of Trent and revised by Pope John XXIII in 1962 .
Yet the gravamen of the hardcore Lefebvrists ’ rejection of Vatican II involved , not liturgy , but politics , and specifically Catholic church - state theory .
Vatican II ’s definition of religious freedom as an inalienable human right – carrying the implication that religious establishments of the ancien régime type were no longer the preferred arrangement – was , in fact , a development of Catholic social doctrine .
To the Lefebvrists , however , it was heresy , and the opening wedge to a fatal Catholic accommodation with modernity .
Archbishop Lefebvre ’s war , in other words , was not simply against modern liturgy – it was against modernity .
To those who took the trouble to look , there was no surprise here , for the ideological sensibilities of the Lefebvrist movement sprang from the same French political - cultural sources that gave rise to the anti-Dreyfusards of the late 19th century and the Petainists of the mid-20th century .
Paul VI , a Francophile who knew Lefebvre ’s politics and detested them , was nonetheless patient with the French intransigent , fearing a formal schism like that of the Old Catholics after the First Vatican Council .
Yet the often indecisive Paul finally suspended Lefebvre from the public exercise of his priestly and episcopal functions in 1976 , although he and his followers remained in tenuous communion with the Church .
Popes are duty - bound to try to prevent schisms and to repair breaches in the unity of the Church .
Thus John Paul II and then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger made every effort , over a long decade , to reconcile Archbishop Lefebvre and his followers – which would have meant allowing them the use of the pre-conciliar liturgy while securing their agreement that Vatican II had been an authentic expression of Catholic faith .
But Lefebvre , as Ratzinger once said , was a “ very difficult man ” , and he eventually reneged on a deal he had struck with Ratzinger , who was acting as John Paul II ’s agent .
Moreover , having reneged , he proceeded to commit what is perhaps the ultimate offence for a Catholic bishop – in 1988 , he ordained other bishops without the mandate of the pope .
Those bishops ( including Richard Williamson ) and Lefebvre himself were immediately excommunicated .
The Lefebvrist movement , the Society of St Pius X ( named after the pope who instigated the “ anti-Modernist oath ” as a precondition to priestly ordination ) , went into formal schism .
From Rome ’s point of view , Lefebvre ’s ordinations triggered the worst of worst - case scenarios – for the Church considered the episcopal orders of the men Lefebvre had ordained to be sacramentally valid ( although illicit ) , which meant that the Society of St Pius X now had the capacity to perpetuate its schism indefinitely , through further illicit but valid ordinations of bishops .
In secular terms , this was treason , sedition and rebellion in one lethal package .
On the same day that Lefebvre and his four co-conspirators were excommunicated , John Paul II established a new Curial office , the Ecclesia Dei Commission , to bring back into the full communion of the Church those Lefebvrist priests and lay people who could not stomach a formal break with Rome .
Over time , Ecclesia Dei became the Curial interlocutor , not only with Lefebvrists who wanted to return to Rome , but with the Lefebvrist movement ( typically known as the SSPX ) itself .
The problem , which became glaringly apparent in January , was that the Ecclesia Dei Commission was a Curial free agent – a loose cannon , rolling around the deck of the Barque of Peter , accountable to no other Curial office .
The current head of the commission is a Colombian , Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos , a brave man who once confronted the cocaine kingpin , Pablo Escobar , by posing as a milkman .
On gaining entry to Escobar ’s home , the doughty Castrillón demanded that the notorious drug lord confess his sins .
Cardinal Castillón is also , alas , remembered for having given the worst Curia press conference in living memory .
It was 2002 , and his task was to present John Paul II ’s annual Holy Thursday letter to the world ’s priests .
When reporters raised the inevitable questions about the clerical sexual abuse scandal in the US , Castrillón brushed them aside and said that the pope had far more important things to worry about , like peace in the Middle East .
It was not a persuasive argument , and it ill - served the pope .
Castrillón will turn 80 in July , and it seems that he had become determined to pull off a career - capping spectacular : the reconciliation of the Lefebvrist schism .
That cause was also close to the pastoral heart of Benedict XVI , who knew that the majority of Lefebvrist faithful cared little for church - state theory but simply wanted to worship according to the old Latin rite .
Thus Benedict , again defying media stereotypes of the papal rottweiler , was prepared to make the opening , public gesture by lifting the excommunications of the four bishops whom Lefebvre ( who died in 1991 ) had illicitly ordained , the assumption presumably being that a similar graceful gesture would come from the Lefebvrist leadership .
It did not .
On the contrary , Bishop Bernard Fellay , Lefebvre ’s successor as head of the SSPX , issued a letter to the faithful , in which he crowed that “ the Tradition is no longer excommunicate ” – an astonishingly arrogant formulation that seemed to imply that it was the rest of the Catholic Church , not the minuscule sect of Lefebvrists , that was in schism .
Moreover , Fellay indicated that the SSPX still had grave difficulties reconciling the teaching of Vatican II with “ the Tradition ” ( always capitalised ) , as the SSPX understood it .
Whatever negotiations Cardinal Castrillón had conducted had not , evidently , received agreement on that crucial point .
And that , rather than the media circus over the Holocaust denial of an internationally - known crank like Richard Williamson , cut to the heart of the matter .
For it opened up the possibility that , just as the “ cafeteria Catholicism ” of the progressives was dying of its own intellectual and pastoral sterility , a new cafeteria was being opened in the fever swamps of the Catholic Right .
As the media uproar faded , Jewish groups outraged over Williamson ’s antics were reassured of what they already knew : Benedict XVI was a philo - Semite who would defend living Judaism with his life , and would do so for the strongest of reasons - because he believes , as Vatican II affirmed , that God does not break his covenantal promises .
That understanding , and the Church ’s commitment to religious freedom , was what was being put in jeopardy by a dangerously ill - prepared and likely premature reconciliation with the SSPX .
Cardinal Castrillón was not , of course , the only senior Curia official who did not Google “ Richard Williamson ” and who did not check the fine print of the negotiations with the SSPX – who did not protect the pope he lived to serve .
It is no secret in Roman clerical , diplomatic and media circles that Benedict XVI ’s choice as Cardinal Secretary of State , the Salesian Tarcisio Bertone ( who had been Ratzinger ’s deputy at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ) , has not developed a firm grip on the machinery of Curia governance .
Bertone , whose personal loyalty to Benedict XVI is unquestioned , is much given to travelling .
Some of his travels have become embarrassments , as in his fulsome embrace of Cuba ’s Raúl Castro as a reformer , or his glowing description of Belarussian dictator Alexander Lukashenko as a possible bridge between East and West .
Happily for Cardinal Bertone , those gaffes ( far worse than anything Benedict XVI was alleged to have done at Regensburg ) drew little press attention outside the Italian hothouse .
Yet to Vatican veterans , they reflected the mistakes of a man who does not do sufficient homework , who does not know how to use the Curial bureaucracy and who has not bent the Curia to the pope ’s will , but in fact has allowed it to reset its institutional default positions to those in place at the time of John Paul II ’s election .
In the Curial system devised by Paul VI , the Cardinal Secretary of State functions like a prime minister in political life .
If he is not firmly in charge , and known to be in charge , the system will relapse into forms of stasis that ill - serve the pope and his purposes .
Thus senior American churchmen complain , privately , that much of today ’s Curia is dysfunctional , including such key dicasteries as the Congregation for the Clergy , the Congregation for Catholic Education and the Congregation for Institutes of Religious Life .
The administrative challenges of this pontificate do not stop with the Curia .
Benedict XVI has also been poorly served by some of his nuncios , those ambassadors who represent the Holy See to national governments and local churches .
Where the Church ’s legal position is insecure , or there is covert or open persecution , the nuncio can be an invaluable lifeline for hard - pressed Catholics , connecting them to the papal megaphone in Rome and its capacity to focus world attention on the depredations of tyrants .
Where the Church ’s legal position is stable ( which is , happily , more often the case ) , the nuncio ’s principal task is to recommend the appointment of new bishops to Rome .
There , the decision on a nomination is ultimately the pope’s .
Making such calls is one of the gravest responsibilities of the modern papacy .
Yet in December 2006 , despite warnings from Poles and others that potential Polish episcopal appointments ought to be quietly vetted with Poland ’s Institute of National Memory in order to avoid the nomination of men who had collaborated in egregious ways with the secret police during the communist period , the nuncio in Poland pushed through the nomination as archbishop of Warsaw of an otherwise impressive candidate , Stanislaw Wielgus , who turned out to have had an unfortunate record of collaboration with the secret police at one point in his career .
The ensuing firestorm of criticism , which led to Wielgus ’s withdrawal from the Warsaw appointment , was a deep embarrassment to Benedict XVI , who had already made a successful pilgrimage to Poland and whose stock there was very high .
Notwithstanding that fiasco , the nuncio who ought to have known and to have protected the pope but did n’t remains in place .
In the US , episcopal sees have remained vacant for as long as two years , thanks to inferior work at the nunciature in Washington .
The relevant “ superiors ” in Rome know this , yet the situation remains unaddressed , because of a combination of Curial politics and the regnant Curial inability to rectify mistakes quickly .
What could turn out to be a botched appointment in Beijing has already been mentioned – it , too , was probably the result of Curial foolishness , in this case the willingness of the Curial China Lobby to bend over backwards in order to establish formal diplomatic relations with the Chinese communist regime .
Benedict XVI has been generally supportive of the tougher line taken by the feisty cardinal of Hong Kong , Joseph Zen .
But it seems likely that the pope was not sufficiently briefed before he made the Beijing episcopal appointment because the Curia had n’t done its homework adequately .
By contrast , when a nuncio knows his job , speaks the local language , consults intelligently and has a strategic vision , Benedict has shown a willingness to initiate bold and effective change .
The Anglophone hierarchy of Canada , for example , has been remade according to the John Paul II / Benedict XVI model of dynamic orthodoxy in a relatively brief period of time .
It is unlikely that Joseph Ratzinger accepted his election thinking of himself as another Leo XIII , who created the modern papacy and died in 1903 , after a 25 - year reign , at the ripe old age of 93 .
Always conscious of his health , Benedict XVI in all likelihood imagined his as a short pontificate .
Thus the question of Curial reform could be deferred until he was gone , for several reasons .
He knew that bold administrative restructuring was not his forte .
And given the assumption of a short papacy , he probably thought it papal bad manners to saddle his successor with a long bench of youngish , senior Curial officials just getting adjusted to a new system .
So he would find someone he had worked with comfortably in the past – Cardinal Bertone – to keep the machinery running , while he would concentrate on the work he knew he did well – the compelling proclamation of Christian truth to both the Church and the world .
Yet as the events of recent months have made painfully clear , Curial incapacity can impede and even damage the evangelical mission of the most intelligent pope .
It was nothing short of a tragedy that a world - class Catholic theologian like Ratzinger , who had spent 50 years explaining Christianity ’s debt to Judaism to his Christian co-believers , should find himself saddled with the charge that he had reconciled a Holocaust denier to the Church .
Yet that is what happened , because no one in whom Benedict XVI reposed trust had the sense to find out about Richard Williamson , and because the Curial culture of the day did not encourage those who did know the facts to warn the superiors .
The entire Lefebvrist mess was preventable : if the pope had insisted throughout his pontificate on competence and had taken forceful measures to rectify incompetence ; if those whose sole purpose is to give effect to the pope ’s will had done their jobs better ; or if Benedict had reached outside the apostolic palace to take private soundings as to the likely effects of his gesture of reconciliation .
The world , not simply the Church , needs a Benedict XVI working at the top of his form and being enabled to do so by his closest associates .
Whether the question is challenging Europe to pull out of the demographic death - spiral caused by its debonair nihilism , or inviting Muslim leaders to seek an Islamically – faithful rapprochement with political modernity , or defending the dignity of human life against the dangers of a brave new world of bio-technically manufactured humanity , there is no substitute for the combination of insight and institutional authority that Pope Benedict brings to the world table .
Yet he now faces a crisis in his papacy , for the wisdom of his voice is being muted by the decline in his authority attendant on the managerial incompetence of the Curia .
The Rottweiler Brigade has taken advantage of this crisis to rekindle its assault on Ratzinger ’s character , through stories retailed to credulous journalists about the pope ’s “ distant , regal style ” .
The must ludicrous of these calumnies came from Robert Fisk , who is “ beginning to suspect ” that Benedict XVI “ might be a very nasty piece of work ” .
The seriousness with which Fisk ’s judgments are to be taken may be measured by one phrase in his screed in the Independent , in which he claims that Benedict had shown his odious colours by his attitude towards “ the pro-Palestinian Angelo Cardinal Sidaro [ he means Sodano ] , John XXIII ’s secretary of state ” [ he means John Paul II ’s secretary of state ] , from whom Benedict has been “ distancing himself ” [ Benedict allowed Sodano to stay in his Curial office until he was long past the normal retirement age , ratified Sodano ’s election as Dean of the College of Cardinals , and has permitted Sodano to stay in that post beyond age 80 , at which point several previous deans have had the courtesy to resign , having lost their votes in any future conclave ] .
If his article were a paper in Vaticanology 101 , Fisk would receive a grade of “ F ” .
Such stories are not only ill - informed and cruel ; they get the problem backwards .
For Benedict XVI has been reluctant to seek help and to enforce discipline , not because of ego or vanity , but because of his shyness , his respect for others and his unwillingness to add to their burdens , and his profound reluctance to cause pain .
These are the qualities of the man that account for the administrative and managerial difficulties of his pontificate , not some bizarre notion of himself as a Theologian - Sun King .
The pope ’s March 10 letter to the world ’s bishops – explaining his motives in the SSPX affair , deploring the temporary rift in Catholic - Jewish relations , and promising a more effective curial use of modern communications – underscored Benedict XVI ’s intelligence , decency and humility .
But no pope can govern successfully with an ineffectual Curia whose gaffes undercut the papal message and erode its authority .
Both pope and senior churchmen must find new ways to work together if the promise of this papacy is to be fulfilled .

Economist Jeffrey Miron says legalizing drugs would greatly reduce violence .
CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
Over the past two years , drug violence in Mexico has become a fixture of the daily news .
Some of this violence pits drug cartels against one another ; some involves confrontations between law enforcement and traffickers .
Recent estimates suggest thousands have lost their lives in this " war on drugs . "
The U.S. and Mexican responses to this violence have been predictable : more troops and police , greater border controls and expanded enforcement of every kind .
Escalation is the wrong response , however ; drug prohibition is the cause of the violence .
Prohibition creates violence because it drives the drug market underground .
This means buyers and sellers cannot resolve their disputes with lawsuits , arbitration or advertising , so they resort to violence instead .
Violence was common in the alcohol industry when it was banned during Prohibition , but not before or after .
Violence is the norm in illicit gambling markets but not in legal ones .
Violence is routine when prostitution is banned but not when it 's permitted .
Violence results from policies that create black markets , not from the characteristics of the good or activity in question .
The only way to reduce violence , therefore , is to legalize drugs .
Fortuitously , legalization is the right policy for a slew of other reasons .
Prohibition of drugs corrupts politicians and law enforcement by putting police , prosecutors , judges and politicians in the position to threaten the profits of an illicit trade .
This is why bribery , threats and kidnapping are common for prohibited industries but rare otherwise .
Mexico 's recent history illustrates this dramatically .
Prohibition erodes protections against unreasonable search and seizure because neither party to a drug transaction has an incentive to report the activity to the police .
Thus , enforcement requires intrusive tactics such as warrantless searches or undercover buys .
The victimless nature of this so - called crime also encourages police to engage in racial profiling .
Prohibition has disastrous implications for national security .
By eradicating coca plants in Colombia or poppy fields in Afghanistan , prohibition breeds resentment of the United States .
By enriching those who produce and supply drugs , prohibition supports terrorists who sell protection services to drug traffickers .
Prohibition harms the public health .
Patients suffering from cancer , glaucoma and other conditions cannot use marijuana under the laws of most states or the federal government despite abundant evidence of its efficacy .
Terminally ill patients cannot always get adequate pain medication because doctors may fear prosecution by the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Drug users face restrictions on clean syringes that cause them to share contaminated needles , thereby spreading HIV , hepatitis and other blood - borne diseases .
Prohibitions breed disrespect for the law because despite draconian penalties and extensive enforcement , huge numbers of people still violate prohibition .
This means those who break the law , and those who do not , learn that obeying laws is for suckers .
Prohibition is a drain on the public purse .
Federal , state and local governments spend roughly $ 44 billion per year to enforce drug prohibition .
These same governments forego roughly $ 33 billion per year in tax revenue they could collect from legalized drugs , assuming these were taxed at rates similar to those on alcohol and tobacco .
Under prohibition , these revenues accrue to traffickers as increased profits .
The right policy , therefore , is to legalize drugs while using regulation and taxation to dampen irresponsible behavior related to drug use , such as driving under the influence .
This makes more sense than prohibition because it avoids creation of a black market .
This approach also allows those who believe they benefit from drug use to do so , as long as they do not harm others .
iReport.com :
Do you think it 's time to legalize marijuana ?
Legalization is desirable for all drugs , not just marijuana .
The health risks of marijuana are lower than those of many other drugs , but that is not the crucial issue .
Much of the traffic from Mexico or Colombia is for cocaine , heroin and other drugs , while marijuana production is increasingly domestic .
Legalizing only marijuana would therefore fail to achieve many benefits of broader legalization .
It is impossible to reconcile respect for individual liberty with drug prohibition .
The U.S. has been at the forefront of this puritanical policy for almost a century , with disastrous consequences at home and abroad .
The U.S. repealed Prohibition of alcohol at the height of the Great Depression , in part because of increasing violence and in part because of diminishing tax revenues .
Similar concerns apply today , and Attorney General Eric Holder 's recent announcement that the Drug Enforcement Administration will not raid medical marijuana distributors in California suggests an openness in the Obama administration to rethinking current practice .
Perhaps history will repeat itself , and the U.S. will abandon one of its most disastrous policy experiments .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron .

It was probably only a matter of time : Dell -- a company that 's been churning out some pretty wildly ( and attractively ) designed laptops of late -- has just rolled out a new website especially for the ladies .
Called " Della , " the site presents a shopping experience that is presumably less manish and annoying than good ole '

The site looks pretty slick , and while we can't really take issue with that , we do find it a bit disconcerting that they mention " finding recipes , " " counting calories , " and blissing out to " guided meditations " on the Tech Tips page .

In 1981 Labour MPs opposed to Michael Foot 's leadership - led by the " Gang of Four " which included David Owen and Roy Jenkins - defected from Labour to set up the SDP .
Lord Ashdown told the paper : " What happens if Labour loses ?
Very senior people have told me there will be a heart and soul battle .
" If there is a real fight , the ingredients will be ripe for a repeat of what happened prior to 1983 .
" There are signs that certain constituency parties are growing really Left - wing , such as in Leeds .
Senior Labour figures have said to me ' if that happens , I 'm off ' . "
The Telegraph said there have already been " tentative " discussions between Liberal Democrat leaders and disillusioned Labour MPs and peers .
Lord Ashdown 's comments come after another turbulent week for Mr Brown and the Labour Party .
On Wednesday a vote on Gurkha settlement rights saw 27 rebel Labour MPs join with the Tories and the Liberal Democrats to inflict Mr Brown 's first Commons defeat since becoming Prime Minister .
The next day , ministers were forced to abandon a Commons motion on the reform of the the controversial second home allowance for MPs amid signs that Mr Brown was heading for a politically damaging second defeat within as many days .

These have led to continuing rumblings within the Labour ranks about the party 's prospects at the next election .
Former home secretary David Blunkett said the Government needed to avoid any more " self - inflicted wounds " , while fellow party heavyweight , Charles Clarke , said that recent events had made him " ashamed " to be a Labour MP .
Deepening gloom on the Labour backbenches was also reflected by veteran left - winger Bob Marshall - Andrews , who said that defeat at the next General Election was " inevitable " .
Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman last night warned the party it must stick together .
In a speech delivered last night in Lanark in Scotland , she said that the Government 's fate now depended on its ability to maintain party unity .
" Our future as a Government , and as a party , depends on Labour 's team - the whole team - in the trade unions , the party members , our MSPs , MEPs , councillors , MPs and ministers , " she warned .
" We must all work together to map out our way forward and ensure that we keep Labour in government and keep the Tories out .
And unity is vital . "
The Mexican swine flu , a genetic chimera probably conceived in the faecal mire of an industrial pigsty , suddenly threatens to give the whole world a fever .
The initial outbreaks across North America reveal an infection already travelling at higher velocity than did the last official pandemic strain , the 1968 Hong Kong flu .
Stealing the limelight from our officially appointed assassin , H5N1 , this porcine virus is a threat of unknown magnitude .
It seems less lethal than Sars in 2003 , but as an influenza it may be more durable than Sars .
Given that domesticated seasonal type - A influenzas kill as many one million people a year , even a modest increment of virulence , especially if combined with high incidence , could produce carnage equivalent to a major war .
Meanwhile , one of its first victims has been the consoling faith , long preached by the World Health Organisation , that pandemics can be contained by the rapid responses of medical bureaucracies , independent of the quality of local public health .
Since the initial H5N1 deaths in Hong Kong in 1997 , the WHO , with the support of most national health services , has promoted a strategy focused on the identification and isolation of a pandemic strain within its local radius of outbreak , followed by a thorough dousing of the population with antivirals and ( if available ) vaccine .
An army of sceptics has contested this viral counter - insurgency approach , pointing out that microbes can now fly around the world ( quite literally in the case of avian flu ) faster than WHO or local officials can react to the original outbreak .
They also pointed to the primitive , often non-existent surveillance of the interface between human and animal diseases .
But the mythology of bold , preemptive ( and cheap ) intervention against avian flu has been invaluable to the cause of rich countries , like the US and UK , who prefer to invest in their own biological Maginot lines rather than dramatically increasing aid to epidemic frontlines overseas , as well as to big pharma , which has battled developing - world demands for the generic , public manufacture of critical antivirals like Roche 's Tamiflu .
The swine flu may prove that the WHO / Centres for Disease Control version of pandemic preparedness – without massive new investment in surveillance , scientific and regulatory infrastructure , basic public health , and global access to lifeline drugs – belongs to the same class of Ponzified risk management as Madoff securities .
It is not so much that the pandemic warning system has failed as it simply does n't exist , even in North America and the EU .
Perhaps it is not surprising that Mexico lacks both capacity and political will to monitor livestock diseases , but the situation is hardly better north of the border , where surveillance is a failed patchwork of state jurisdictions , and corporate livestock producers treat health regulations with the same contempt with which they deal with workers and animals .
Similarly , a decade of urgent warnings by scientists has failed to ensure the transfer of sophisticated viral assay technology to the countries in the direct path of likely pandemics .
Mexico has world - famous disease experts , but it had to send swabs to a Winnipeg lab in order to ID the strain 's genome .
Almost a week was lost as a consequence .
But no one was less alert than the disease controllers in Atlanta .
According to the Washington Post , the CDC did not learn about the outbreak until six days after Mexico had begun to impose emergency measures .
There should be no excuses .
The paradox of this swine flu panic is that , while totally unexpected , it was accurately predicted .
Six years ago , Science dedicated a major story to evidence that " after years of stability , the North American swine flu virus has jumped onto an evolutionary fasttrack " .
Since its identification during the Great Depression , H1N1 swine flu had only drifted slightly from its original genome .
Then in 1998 a highly pathogenic strain began to decimate sows on a farm in North Carolina and new , more virulent versions began to appear almost yearly , including a variant of H1N1 that contained the internal genes of H3N2 ( the other type - A flu circulating among humans ) .
Researchers interviewed by Science worried that one of these hybrids might become a human flu ( both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics are believed to have originated from the mixing of bird and human viruses inside pigs ) , and urged the creation of an official surveillance system for swine flu : an admonition , of course , that went unheeded in a Washington prepared to throw away billions on bioterrorism fantasies .
But what caused this acceleration of swine flu evolution ?
Virologists have long believed that the intensive agricultural system of southern China is the principal engine of influenza mutation : both seasonal " drift " and episodic genomic " shift " .
But the corporate industrialisation of livestock production has broken China 's natural monopoly on influenza evolution .
Animal husbandry in recent decades has been transformed into something that more closely resembles the petrochemical industry than the happy family farm depicted in school readers .
In 1965 , for instance , there were 53 m US hogs on more than 1 m farms ; today , 65 m hogs are concentrated in 65,000 facilities .
This has been a transition from old - fashioned pig pens to vast excremental hells , containing tens of thousands of animals with weakened immune systems suffocating in heat and manure while exchanging pathogens at blinding velocity with their fellow inmates .
Last year a commission convened by the Pew Research Center issued a report on " industrial farm animal production " that underscored the acute danger that " the continual cycling of viruses … in large herds or flocks [ will ] increase opportunities for the generation of novel virus through mutation or recombinant events that could result in more efficient human to human transmission . "
The commission also warned that promiscuous antibiotic use in hog factories ( cheaper than humane environments ) was sponsoring the rise of resistant staph infections , while sewage spills were producing outbreaks of E coli and pfiesteria ( the protozoan that has killed 1bn fish in Carolina estuaries and made ill dozens of fishermen ) .
Any amelioration of this new pathogen ecology would have to confront the monstrous power of livestock conglomerates such as Smithfield Farms ( pork and beef ) and Tyson ( chickens ) .
The commission reported systemic obstruction of their investigation by corporations , including blatant threats to withhold funding from cooperative researchers .
This is a highly globalised industry with global political clout .
Just as Bangkok - based chicken giant Charoen Pokphand was able to suppress enquiries into its role in the spread of bird flu in southeast Asia , so it is likely that the forensic epidemiology of the swine flu outbreak will pound its head against the corporate stonewall of the pork industry .
This is not to say that a smoking gun will never be found : there is already gossip in the Mexican press about an influenza epicentre around a huge Smithfield subsidiary in Veracruz state .
But what matters more ( especially given the continued threat of H5N1 ) is the larger configuration : the WHO 's failed pandemic strategy , the further decline of world public health , the stranglehold of big pharma over lifeline medicines , and the planetary catastrophe of industrialised and ecologically unhinged livestock production .
Holy cow , Facebook is worth $ 10 billion ?
That may be how the social networking Web site would like the world to interpret its latest capital infusion .
But do n’t be fooled .
While that may represent a target valuation for Facebook , the actual worth , today , of Mark Zuckerberg ’s dorm room creation may be much lower .
That ’s not to completely dismiss the headline figure .
Under terms announced Tuesday , the Russian Internet investment group Digital Sky Technologies is plugging $ 200 million into the company for about a 2 percent stake .
By that arithmetic , Facebook would indeed be worth $ 10 billion .
For a company that , by its own admission , wo n’t generate positive cash flow until sometime next year , that ’s an impressive figure to bandy about .
True , Facebook ’s last capital - raising 18 months ago , which brought Microsoft and the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing in as investors , put a $ 15 billion price tag on the company .
But considering the trajectory of financial markets since then , the valuation attached to Digital Sky ’s trade actually looks even more robust .
Shares in the technology bellwethers Microsoft and Google have plunged about 45 percent since November 2007 .
Assume a similar decline in Facebook ’s value and , on a market - adjusted basis , Digital Sky is arguably paying at least a 20 percent premium to Microsoft ’s entry price , ignoring growth in Facebook ’s business in the meantime .
Quantum entanglement , which Einstein dubbed “ spooky action at a distance ” , would be the perfect way to communicate data – if technical hurdles could be overcome .
The method involves linking the quantum properties of two objects such that a change to one is instantly reflected in the other – offering a whole new way to transmit information from opposite sides of the globe .
Entanglement has already been exploited as a way to securely share pass phrases for secret communications , but only over distances of less than 200 kilometres .
The inability of the gas - based quantum computer memory used to hold onto information for more than a fraction of a second is to blame .
Now a way to have that memory store quantum information for longer opens up the possibility of entangled communication over 1000 kilometres .

Short memory
While regular computer DRAM memory – which stores information as 1s and 0s , or digital bits – is also short lived , it is repeatedly rewritten every 9 to 70 nanoseconds to keep the data fresh .
But quantum information , stored in quantum bits called qubits , cannot be simply refreshed .
The rules of quantum mechanics mean that reading out the state of a qubit changes that state .
This means you cannot recreate the previous piece of data because you do n’t know what it was .
Holding onto a memory even for a fraction of a second is difficult for qubits , says Stewart Jenkins at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
That limits the distance over which entanglement can be used because it requires the state of one qubit to be copied to another , distant qubit .
The message is carried by photons which , although they travel at light speed , still take time to get there .
If the first qubit has forgotten the quantum state it transmitted by the time the photons reach their destination , entanglement cannot happen .
The first qubit must be able to hold onto its memory long enough for the second to match it .
Magnetic shield
Jenkins and colleagues have now succeeded in creating quantum memories that last for 7.2 microseconds – more than two orders of magnitude longer than previously reported , and time enough to transmit quantum information over 1000 kilometres .
While qubits made in other ways can hold memories for longer , they struggle to transfer them to photons .
The team ’s qubits are stored in gas atoms , encoded into a magnetic property known as “ spin ” .
The key to lengthening the attention span of gas qubits is to shield them from magnetic fields that can distort their spin and dissolve the stored state .
Jenkins ’ team has done just that by encoding the spin information into particular energy levels within the atoms that are relatively immune to magnetic disturbances .
However , there are still “ several technical hurdles to jump ” before quantum communication over 1000 km is possible , says Jenkins .
Solid rival
John Morton , a quantum information researcher at Oxford University in the UK agrees .
Currently , Jenkins ’ qubits do not transfer memory well between atoms and photons , he says .
“ The efficiency is still of the order of 10 % , so that ’s going to affect the quality of the quantum entanglement , ” says Morton .
Although that is still better than solid - state systems like those he works on , Morton thinks that technology will ultimately catch up .
“ Things are harder in the solid state , but technology companies do become a lot more interested when they can imagine the technology as solid state , ” says Morton .
For example , recent work shows defects inside diamonds can help transfer data to photons , he says ( Nature , DOI : 10.1038/455606a ) .

Panama Cricket Booty Mystery Revealed .
FAKE !
In a sad ending to the beautiful Panamanian booty mystery , the REAL pics have been uncovered , proving the previously displayed pics to be photo shopped .
So with that being said , we would like to say to the artist responsible for them , can you get us any more ?
It is unfortunate that our dreams have to be dashed like this , but I think we all knew from the start that it was too good to be true .
And now looking at the originals , I do n’t know what to think .
After seeing what could have been , is the reality of the situation all that bad ?
Not really , but my what a disappointment it still is .
Oh , and there is one more correction that needs to be made .
The sport being played was n’t cricket , it was polo ( that would be the one with the guys on horses hitting the ball with mallets ) .
That would help explain the boots .

Great video of a Hawker Hunter flying over famous landmarks on the Swiss alps .
From The Recorder ( Central Connecticut State University ) :
On October 3 , 2008 , [ John ]
Wahlberg and two other classmates prepared to give an oral presentation for a Communication 140 class that was required to discuss a " relevant issue in the media " .
Wahlberg and his group chose to discuss school violence due to recent events such as the Virginia Tech shootings that occurred in 2007 .
Shortly after his professor , Paula Anderson , filed a complaint with the CCSU Police against her student .
During the presentation Wahlberg made the point that if students were permitted to conceal carry guns on campus , the violence could have been stopped earlier in many of these cases .
He also touched on the controversial idea of free gun zones on college campuses .
That night at work , Wahlberg received a message stating that the campus police " requested his presence " .
Upon entering the police station , the officers began to list off firearms that were registered under his name , and questioned him about where he kept them .
They told Wahlberg that they had received a complaint from his professor that his presentation was making students feel " scared and uncomfortable " ....
Professor Anderson refused to comment directly on the situation and deferred further comment .
" It is also my responsibility as a teacher to protect the well being of our students , and the campus community at all times , " she wrote in a statement submitted to The Recorder .
" As such , when deemed necessary because of any perceived risks , I seek guidance and consultation from the Chair of my Department , the Dean and any relevant University officials . " ...
( Another would - be member , Dave Powers , submitted a résumé , on which he bragged about indoctrinating his son in the Way of the Burger ; perfecting his palate over 15 years in Washington , D.C. , Iowa and Charlottesville , Va. ; and , back in the late 1970 ’s , beating Eric Vopova at a middle school contest by eating “ 16 sliders in 5 minutes under the bleachers ” without getting sick .
Mr. Powers was accepted but quit when he moved to Oregon . )
BOTM began in the summer of 2005 , when Adam Beckerman , 32 , called up Brett Weiss and said , “ Let ’s go eat the world ’s biggest burger . ”
“ Adam , when we were younger and he was still single , used to call me all the time and be like , ‘ Let ’s do ... ’ and he did n’t have to finish the sentence because I ’d say yes , ” Mr. Weiss explained .
At the time , the world ’s biggest burger was a 15 - pounder on offer at Denny ’s Beer Barrel Pub in Clearfield , Pa. , about a four - hour drive from New York .
Mr. Beckerman and Mr. Weiss grabbed two other hungry guys , found a raggedy golf course nearby and made a day of it :
They even printed commemorative “ Best Day Ever ” golf balls with a burger and a golf tee .
Then they came home and started eating half - pounders .
Members take turns picking burger destinations , which must be accessible by subway .
Most do online research as well as a taste test , since a bad pick can bring humiliation .
Once each has picked , whoever picked the group ’s favorites gets to pick a second time  this is known as the playoffs  and the best of those wins the year .
( The 2008 crown is in dispute : Primehouse had the year ’s top burger , but it was picked by Brett Weiss , who some believe back - doored his way into the playoffs upon Mr. Powers ’s departure . )
At first , each member rated each place - 2 to +4 on each of 13 factors , including cheese , bun , manageability , fries , shake , service and décor .
That got replaced by an A - F report card - style scale in eight categories , including taste , value and returnability .
By the end of the first year , the group had scratched all that and just ranked each burger against all the other burgers , constantly refining their individual and collective lists , which Brett Weiss meticulously compiles .

turned down Cannes ’ non-competing slot , but his latest “ ” will open Directors ’ Fortnight program at Cannes Film Festival .
We ’ve got today the first official trailer for “ Tetro ” which stars newcomeras Bennie andas his brother Tetro .
The movie is both written and directed by Academy Award winning Coppola .
Bennie ( Ehrenreich ) travels to Buenos Aires to find his long - missing older brother Tetro ( Gallo ) , a once - promising writer who is now a remnant of his former self .
Bennie ’s discovery of his brother ’s near - finished play might hold the answer to understanding their shared past and renewing their bond .
“ Tetro ” was shot in Argentina last year and is being released independently by Coppola ’s own American Zoetrope and is set to debut in very limited theaters in the US starting on June 11th 2009 .
You can also visit “ Tetro ” official site U.S. directors have a stronger presence in the Fortnight than in this year ’s Cannes ’ Competition .
Including “ Tetro ” the U.S. selection also includes “ , ” directed byandwhich starsand ; lowbudget comedy “ , ” written and directed by ’s “ ” and immigrant indie dramedy “ ” directed by U.S. - born Palestinian / Jordanian “ A melodramatic family drama set in a Buenos Aires where even innocent passers - by seem consumed by jealousy and passion , Tetro offers glimpses of a golden - age Francis Ford Coppola in his first original script since The Conversation ( 1974 ) .
Although it feels at times like a vanity project , some strong performances – most notably by Spanish actress Maribel Verdu ( Y tu mama tambien ) , but also Vincent Gallo in the title role and newcomer Alden Ehrenreich – save all but Tetro ’s most cringeworthy lines .
Ultimately , Tetro looks likely to become what the French call a succes d’estime in the international marketplace ( although audiences in Argentina may react poorly to the film ’s tourist trip through their complex social and cultural drives ) … ” ScreenDaily “ Tetro ” looks like the work of a film school grad , his head swimming with the classic black - and - white European films of the ’50s and ’60s and his mind unable to shake his struggles with his family .
And yet , its author is Francis Ford Coppola , making a mostly triumphant return to his earlier filmmaking days and to Cannes itself , where he has picked up a couple of Palme d’Ors .
… As a critic , it feels good to write positively about one of the American cinema ’s lost directors .
Once so dazzling in his ambition and audacity , Coppola was forced by financial woes to make other people ’s movies for so many years that when he returned to indie filmmaking with 2007 ’s “ Youth Without Youth , ” the result was a confusing , pretentious work that found favor with few …
“ Tetro ” represents a collision of genres — the coming - of - age tale ( Bennie ) and the Oedipal conflict in a son who wishes to kill his father ( Tetro ) .
In the end , it ’s about family , about the rivalries , conflicts and healing .
It ’s also about Coppola leaving the U.S. for a bohemian , Italian - influenced district of Buenos Aires to rediscover his art and love for film … ”
Hollywood Reporter “ Neither complete misfire nor triumphant return to form , Francis Ford Coppola ’s “ Tetro ” works as a competent family drama right up until the messy final act .
If a first - time filmmaker had directed this stylish black - and - white - and - sometimes - color melodrama , it might gain some notice for suggesting great things to come .
Instead , on its own terms , the movie is only a mildly interesting entry in Coppola ’s thirty - plus years of work .
At the same time , the plot resonates in context …
An autobiographical reading of “ Tetro ” certainly has merits , but wo n’t change the movie ’s fairly average appeal .
Gorgeous , high contrast imagery and exquisite mise - en - scene show that Coppola can still establish a distinctive mood ( the contributions of his longtime editor , the legendary Walter Murch , also come in handy ) … ” IndieWire “ Although markedly better than his previous small - scaled , self - financed film , “ Youth Without Youth , ” Francis Ford Coppola ’s “ Tetro ” is still a work of modest ambition and appeal .
Gloriously shot in mostly black - and - white widescreen in Buenos Aires , Coppola ’s first original screenplay since 1974 ’s “ The Conversation ” hinges on the tension between two long - separated brothers dominated by an artistic genius father .
The angst - ridden treatment of Oedipal issues makes the picture play out like a passably talented imitation of O’Neill , Williams , Miller and Inge , and thus it feels like the pale product of an over - tilled field .
Coppola will release the film himself Stateside , doubtless to marginal returns , and in the long run , “ Tetro ” likely will be most remembered for introducing a highly promising young actor , Alden Ehrenreich … ” Variety Check out the complete list of the this year ’s Directors ’

A funky , psychedelic fish that bounces on the ocean floor like a rubber ball has been classified as a new species , a scientific journal reported .
The frogfish which has a swirl of tan and peach zebra stripes that extend from its aqua eyes to its tail was initially discovered by scuba diving instructors working for a tour operator a year ago in shallow waters off Ambon island in eastern Indonesia .
The operator contacted Ted Pietsch , lead author of a paper published in this month 's edition of Copeia , the journal of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists , who submitted DNA work identifying it as a new species .
The fish which the University of Washington professor has named " psychedelica " is a member of the antennariid genus , Histiophryne , and like other frogfish , has fins on both sides of its body that have evolved to be leg - like .
But it has several behavioural traits not previously known to the others , Pietsch wrote .
Each time the fish strike the seabed , for instance , they push off with their fins and expel water from tiny gill openings to jet themselves forward .
That , and an off - centered tail , causes them to bounce around in a bizarre , chaotic manner .
Mark Erdman , a senior adviser to the Conservation International 's marine programme , said yesterday it was an exciting discovery .
" I think people thought frogfishes were relatively well known and to get a new one like this is really quiet spectacular .
...
It 's a stunning animal , " he said , adding that the fish 's stripes were probably intended to mimic coral .
" It also speaks to the tremendous diversity in this region and to fact that there are still a lot of unknowns here in Indonesia and in the Coral Triangle in general . "
The fish , which has a gelatinous fist - sized body covered with thick folds of skin that protect it from sharp - edged corals , also has a flat face with eyes directed forward , like humans , and a huge , yawning mouth
Humanitarian Intervention
" Motives behind humanitarian interventions are almost invariably mixed .
Looking for parsimony in motives does not really advance the discussion , because not all political motives are evil .
If only altruism without significant interests had to be present , there would rarely be sufficient motivation to get involved in the first place or to stay the course - the feeble international military involvement in Darfur and the US withdrawal from Somalia after losing 18 Rangers in October 1993 are illustrations .

Turning to nature for inspiration is the key to constructing a lot of things , from very tall buildings , shaped after bamboo , to , apparently , sunscreen , which now researchers believe can be successfully made from hippo sweat .
While this may disgust some , it could , indeed , prove to be the best protection anyone could hope for .
The bulky animals seldom stay in the shadow , and spend most of their day submerged in water or in mud , but with their backs exposed to the Sun .
If their skin had been as soft as ours and without any secretions , then their backs would have looked like burgers within a matter of hours .
Yet , they have managed to spend not one day , but many years with the same life style , an accomplishment that has made researchers wonder as to how the animal does it .
The answer has been found in a reddish glandular secretion , which seems to contain a compound capable of scattering light in all directions , thus keeping the hefty animal 's skin absolutely intact .
Christopher Viney , University of California in Merced ( UCM ) School of Engineering professor and the co-author of a new study detailing the interesting find , told Discovery News that the sweat of the hippopotamus could also be “ scavenged ” for other useful compounds as well .
“ It would be nice to also try and replicate the antiseptic and insect - repellent characteristics of the sweat , to obtain a four - in - one product : sunscreen , sunblock , antiseptic , [ and ] insect repellent .
Just so long as the stuff does n't smell like hippo , ” he added .
After analyzing the hippo sweat under a microscope , the researcher found that there were two types of crystaline structures in it – banded and non-banded .
He pinpointed that the banded ones were “ characterized by concentric dark rings , ” which seemed to be the key to the liquid 's amazing properties .
“ The rings are the result of a structural periodicity that occurs on a scale comparable to the wavelengths of visible light .
This means that the sweat is an effective scatterer of light , so that it combines both sun-blocking and sun-screening properties , ” Viney stated .
This find only goes to show again the true extent of nature 's power , as well as the perfection of evolution , which has endowed this animal with the unique abilities it needs in order to survive in its relatively - sedentary and Sun-exposed life style , over millions of years .

Music reporter , BBC News
Bangalore - based Swarathma were one of four bands picked by John Leckie Radiohead and Stone Roses producer John Leckie is championing India 's emerging alternative music scene after a quest to find the country 's best new bands .
Leckie has recorded an album with four groups he discovered there , and says the music scene could soon take off .
" It only takes one artist to cross over , to get big and get international recognition , for the whole thing to explode in India , " the producer says .
" There 's an awful lot happening .
India has great potential for young bands . "
Leckie , one of the UK's leading producers , was at the controls for The Stone Roses ' seminal debut album and Radiohead 's second release The Bends , as well as Muse 's first two albums .
The Indian music scene , meanwhile , has been an offshoot of the Bollywood film industry , with actors being the most famous singers and film soundtracks accounting for 72 % of music sales .
Alternative music is still underground and reliant on US and British acts for inspiration .
But some groups are starting to find their own voices and could find appeal across the world , Leckie believes .
The producer went to Delhi , Bangalore and Mumbai with the British Council , where he auditioned 36 bands for the India SoundPad album .
Leckie has worked with the likes of John Lennon and Pink Floyd " A lot of bands were copying western influences , like always singing in English , electric guitars , a lot of Guns ' N Roses copyists , " he says .
" So the four bands I chose were unique .
" I was looking for an Indian flavour to everything and unfortunately a lot of the bands had deliberately lost their Indian - ness because the only way they could get acceptance in Mumbai or Delhi was to be totally western , with guitars and their appearance and always singing in English . "
Of the selected acts , Swarathma , who sing in Hindi , and eight - piece Advaita , fuse traditional instruments , influences and outlooks with guitars , keyboards and drums .
The other two are Indigo Children , who Leckie likens to a young Supergrass , and Medusa , who have a contemporary electronic direction .
The quartet appeared at the Great Escape music festival in Brighton at the weekend , and are just finishing a mini UK tour .
Leckie , who started his career working at London 's famous Abbey Road studios with the likes of John Lennon , Pink Floyd and Sir Paul McCartney , predicted that alternative music would not remain in the margins in India .
Now the Indian music industry has evolved to a space where it 's trying to break out of Bollywood
Jishnu Dasgupta
Swarathma " Because of the size and the number of people , you can only imagine that all these young bands are going to come forward and have their own distinct style , " he says .
" It can never stay a niche thing .
" What is stimulating to a lot of young Indian people is to make music without having that Bollywood influence . "
Indian bands are also slowly moving out of the shadows of American and British legends , according to Jishnu Dasgupta , bassist with Swarathma .
" When I was growing up , all Indian bands would ever do was cover western rock bands .
You were actually measured by how accurately you could play Highway Star [ by Deep Purple ] , or an AC / DC .
" But those days are over now .
Now , if you 're not doing your own music , you 're no - one .
And that 's the way it should be .
That 's happened over the last five to 10 years .
Medusa , pictured , have been on a UK tour with the other three bands " Now the Indian music industry has evolved to a space where it 's trying to break out of Bollywood and the stranglehold that Indian movies have over music consumption , and we 're ready to look at different kinds of music . "
But many Indian rock fans still look to the west because no Indian groups have captured the same spirit of rebellion , he says .
" There is an undercurrent of rebelliousness that has n't really manifested itself in its natural form in India .
There are n't any rebellious musicians in India .
" So it 's easy to identify with Rage Against the Machine because there is n't really an equivalent in India .
Not because there 's any lack of angst .
But there are some bands who have started doing it now .
That 's only started now . "
Advaita 's guitarist Abhishek Mathur describes his group 's sound as " the Indian classical spiritual meditative approach combining with psychedelic rock " .
" All the commercial avenues - radio , TV , print media - only cater to the mainstream , which is Bollywood , " he says .
" There is some space for bands and it 's slowly opening up .
All the college kids want to have bands coming to their college to play .
It 's a young market that people want to tap into .
But it 's still very far away from the mainstream .
" It 's getting better and better .
But there 's never been anything like the SoundPad project to give it a boost . "

Perl is cool , much more so than Python .
But I prefer writing Python .
Perl is fun to read about .
It has an endless stream of features to discover .
Python by comparison is kinda dull .
But the aspects of a language that make it fun to read about do not necessarily make it pleasant to use .
I wrote Perl off and on for several years before trying Python .
People would tell me I should try Python and every six months or so I ’d skim through a Python book .
My impression was that Python was prosaic .
It did n’t seem to offer any advantage over Perl , so I stuck with Perl .
( Not that I was ever very good at Perl . )
Then I read an article by Bruce Eckel saying that he liked Python because he could remember the syntax .
He said that despite teaching Java and writing books on Java , he could never remember the syntax for opening a file in Java , for example .
But he could remember the corresponding Python syntax .
I would never have picked up on that by skimming books .
You ’ve got to actually use a language a while to know how memorable the syntax is .
But I had used Perl enough to know that I could not remember its syntax without frequent use .
Memorable syntax increases productivity .
You do n’t have to break your train of thought as often to reach for a reference book .
I stand by my initial impression that Python is plain , but I now think that ’s a strength .
It just gets out of my way and lets me get my work done .
I ’m sure Perl gurus can be extremely productive in Perl .
I tried being a Perl guru , and I never made it .
I would n’t say I ’m a Python guru , but I also do n’t feel the need to be a guru to use Python .
Python code is not cool in a line - by - line sense , not in the way that an awesomely powerful Perl one - liner is cool .
Python is cool in more subtle ways .

On Thursday , it was Liechtenstein and Andorra .
On Friday , Austria , Luxembourg and Switzerland likewise decided to change their banking laws to allow for more cross - border cooperation .
The days of European tax havens are numbered .
For years , the federal government has struggled to find a way to operate the massive hydropower system on the Columbia and Snake rivers in the Pacific Northwest -- and also try to recover the endangered salmon that are all - too - frequently slaughtered at the massive dams as they make their way up and down the river .
One option for saving the fish has never really been on the table : breaching the four dams on the lower Snake River that stand between the salmon and millions of acres of pristine habitat in central Idaho and northeastern Oregon .
President George W. Bush made it clear it would never be an option on his watch .
The dams , after all , are generating enough electricity to power Seattle , and provide Lewiston , Idaho , with a port for barging valuable cargoes of grain 140 miles down the river .
But it 's a new watch .
And a federal judge in Oregon has signaled that breaching the Snake River dams needs to be considered , at least as a contingency plan , if other options for bringing back salmon fail to do the job .
In a letter to parties in the long - running litigation , U.S. District Judge James A. Redden made it clear he is ready to find substantial shortcomings in the biological opinion for salmon recovery laid out by the Bush administration last year .
" Federal defendants have spent the better part of the last decade treading water , and avoiding their obligations under the Endangered Species Act .
Only recently have they begun to commit the kind of financial and political capital necessary to save these threatened and endangered species , some of which are on the brink of extinction .
We simply cannot afford to waste another decade , " the judge wrote .
The Great Deleveraging Continues

“ The financial crisis is not over yet , ” Chris Mayer assures us .
“ The banks still need capital .
And more credit losses are on the way — from commercial real estate to credit cards and everything in between .
The great deleveraging is still under way , and that ’s one reason — among many — that gold should do well .
“ The ripple effects of the financial crisis have been felt in all sectors , though .
In the world of oil and gas , we see lots of production cutbacks and projects shuttered or delayed .
Getting financing is tough .
About the only people spending money are the Chinese .
“ In general , I think we are in an age in which political risk is high .
Increasingly , we ’ll have to take into account what governments are doing .
Most of them are broke .
Most of them seem intent on bailing out banks and other failing businesses in favored industries .
So that would mean the printing presses will run amok .
That ’s good for gold and commodities generally , which ought to preserve their purchasing power as paper currencies lose theirs . ”
WASHINGTON 
The acknowledged masters of bank rescues say the Obama administration plan for saving the U.S. banking industry may be doomed .
While the U.S. has funneled tens of billions of dollars to embattled banks such as Citigroup , Sweden temporarily took over two banks late last year and then sold them back to private investors at a roughly 50 % profit three months later , says Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg .
U.S. officials should confront the financial industry 's political power and seize temporary ownership of troubled banks , Borg says .
Otherwise , error - prone bankers will be bailed out at taxpayer expense .
" We can't let them get away with the fact that they 've been reckless , " Borg told a group of economists while attending the recent International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings here .
During a crisis in the early 1990s , Sweden successfully rehabilitated its banking system via temporary nationalization .
The government divided the industry into healthy banks and troubled institutions .
It pumped capital into the healthy ones , while punishing their shareholders , and held onto the troubled assets until their values recovered .
Borg says that approach better protected taxpayers than the current U.S. strategy .
The Treasury Department 's " public private investment program , " unveiled last month , seeks to tempt private investors to buy toxic assets by protecting investors against heavy losses and giving them access to public funds .
" Trying to create a phony market " will prove less effective than taking ownership stakes , Borg says .
The ponytailed Swedish finance chief , who quotes free - market guru Milton Friedman , suggests ideological blinders are hindering the U.S.
" This is not about the market economy , " he says .
" We do n't believe in the state running the banking sector . "
Both the Bush and Obama administrations have rejected Swedish - style nationalization .
In February , President Obama said that the complexity and number of U.S. banks , as well as the country 's market traditions , made the Swedish plan inappropriate .
" Sweden looks like a good model , " Obama told ABC News .
" Here 's the problem : Sweden had , like , five banks .
We 've got thousands of banks . "
Douglas Elliott , a former JPMorgan investment banker , says nationalization would be costly , difficult and perhaps unnecessary unless the economy gets much worse .
With some additional public money , and the continuation of recent strong profits , U.S. banks will rebuild their depleted capital base over time , says Elliott , now at the Brookings Institution .
Borg says trying the asset purchase plan first may only raise the cost of an eventual government takeover .
" I 'm not certain it will work , " he says .
" It might be the case you 'll do the same as we . "

Official support for Office 2004 for Mac will end in October of this year , Microsoft said today .
The company 's Mac BU said that it plans to put its full focus on Office 2008 , as well as the next version of Office for the Mac .
" In line with Microsoft 's standard Support Lifecycle policy , Office 2004 for Mac Mainstream Support will be retired October 13 , 2009 , " Microsoft said in a statement to Macworld .
" The MacBU is continuing to work on updates for Office 2008 for Mac and is hard at work on the next version of Office for Mac . "
Because Microsoft has a standard policy of retiring its software approximately five years and three months after introduction , Office 2008 has until April of 2013 before it heads to the grave .
Indeed , Office 2004 has been around for a while ( well , since July of 2004 ) , though there are still a number of Mac users who are stuck on that version of the software .
Come October , however , they 'll either have to keep truckin ' without any further security or compatibility updates , or be forced to upgrade .
I must admit — if I was n't forced to upgrade a couple of months ago in order to edit some Ars-related documents , I would still be one of those users myself .
Now 's a better time than ever to check out that new Office 2008 trial , huh ?

The Reason Kevin Smith is Still the Coolest Motherf ** ker in Hollywood
By Dustin Rowles | Industry | March 25 , 2009 |
I caught the below video over on Slashfilm earlier today — a ten- minute segment of Lee Stanhan ’s interview with Kevin Smith .
In it , Smith speaks candidly about the disappointment he felt when Zack and Miri Make a Porno did n’t open in line with what he , and most box - office forecasters , expected .
But mostly , Smith talks about his feelings about the Internet .
For those of you who follow Kevin Smith closely , you probably know he ’s a guy who ’s always closely followed his coverage online , and he ’s one of the few directors who respects the opinions of Internet writers as much as the print critics ( it ’s how we managed to get an interview with him , while a certain other large - chinned cult movie star rejected us .
Ahem . )
Unfortunately , there is a double - edged sword there :
Once you validate the opinions of Internet critics ( and blog commenters .
Ahem . ) , then you ’re also more vulnerable to their criticisms .
In the interview below , Smith explains why — right before Zack and Miri came out — he basically gave up his obsession with online criticism and why .
Somehow , the man managed to make me both respect him even more than I already do and make me feel a little ashamed for however we may have contributed to the mean - spirited atmosphere .
That ’s not to say I ’m not proud when we rip the head off a bad cinematic experience and shit down its neck , but to the extent that we ( and our commenters .
Ahem . ) occasionally attack the filmmakers personally … well , it ’s uncalled for .
Unless they directed a Movie Movie , in which case I have no regrets .
Anyway , check out the video .
It ’s solid .

99 Movies That Will Kill You Dead
A friend of mine is thinking of breaking up with her boyfriend .
He forgot their one - year anniversary last week .
He also kicked her dog and insulted her sister .
Utterly mediocre , she calls the relationship .
But break - ups are painful .
She wonders if she could bear it .
Should she keep him or cut him loose ?
The answer is cut , if you take to heart a popular study led by researcher Paul Eastwick and his colleagues at Northwestern and Carnegie Mellon Universities .
The psychologists recruited undergrad couples and asked them about the strength of their relationships , how they think they ’d deal with a break - up , and for how long they think they ’d be upset .
Not surprisingly , many lovers thought they ’d be crushed .
But the heart is a fickle thing .
By the end of the nine - month study , about one - third of the love affairs crashed and burned .
And as the lovelorn healed , Eastwick and team evaluated how they coped .
What the psychologists discovered is this :
The heart is hardier than you imagine .
Newly single men and women were significantly happier than they predicted in the days , weeks , and months after their break - up .
This was even true of lovebirds who did n’t think they ’d rebound so quickly .
Sure , there were tears and pain .
But they all recovered quickly and more easily than they thought they would .
The people who were most inaccurate at predicting their feelings — and were happily surprised by their own recovery — were those who said they had been very much in love and had not initiated the break - up .
Granted , it ’s possible that breaking up is easier for people in their twenties .
Healing from multi- year relationships likely takes a lot longer than a few months .
But there ’s a lesson here for us all , according to the researchers .
Facing the prospect of a loss , we overestimate our future distress .
Psychologists call this an “ impact bias . ”
Impact bias research , popularized by Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon and Princeton , has been gaining a lot of traction in the last few years .
According to these experts , we ’re all terrible at predicting the emotional consequences of things that happen to us .
Like fools , we ’re too often shocked when it turns out that good things — winning the lottery , buying a dream house , or getting the trophy wife — are n’t as good as we think they ’ll be , at least not in the long - term .
But bad things — breaking up , getting laid off , or advancing into a recession — are n’t as bad as we think either .
After the initial trauma , we snap back to our emotional baselines faster than we think .
Applied to our love lives , the big break - up blowout seems worse than a slow attenuation of affection .
But the truth is that we often overestimate the pain of blowouts and underestimate the pain of drawn - outs .
That ’s why , for some of us , it takes years to break up — even when a relationship is abusive or too tired or troubled to fix .
As discussed in BLONDES , the impact bias is a self - protection measure .
From an evolutionary perspective ,
It gives us hope and drive .
It helps us value what we have , and can prevent us from being impetuous and destructive .
( As a result , we ’ll probably take love - preserving drugs in the future . )
The downside is that we sometimes stymie and sabotage ourselves out of fear of losing something that has less value than we think .
( A plausible argument for fall - out - of - love drugs . )
Tapping into this wisdom , I told my friend that in the long - term she wo n’t regret leaving a man she does n’t love enough .
Do n’t settle for suboptimal .
Like removing a band - aid , a break - up may be more painful when done slowly than quickly .
And healing , however broken the heart , may happen faster than you think .

These magnificent birds are a favored option when it comes to a pet bird .
And they are not even new on the pet scene .
They have made their way through history as far back as during the ancient Egyptians ’ time , which is about over 4000 years ago .
Even kings keep them .
And if you are planning to keep one as a pet , you need to know how to build or find the best cage for an African Grey .
Facts Firsts on African Grey Parrots
Many adore these birds for their outstanding features .
It ’s interesting plumage blend well with its overall look .
Add to this is the fact that they possess very flexible mouths and vocal chords .
Most of these impressive birds start to imitate the words and sounds that they hear once they turn six months old .
There are still a few that do so only until they reach two years old , however .
As its name suggests , this medium - sized parrot has a mottled grey colored feather , a large black bill and white mask that encloses its yellow eyes .
It also has a noticeable red vent and tail .
They are also noted to be monogamous and are often depicted to be nesting atop a tree with a hole for her hatchlings .
Another interesting thing about these parrots is the fact that they can outlive their owners .
With an average lifespan of more than 60 years , these fragile looking creatures may just actually outlive you .
It may even get to experience life with your son ’s or daughter ’s son and / or daughter .
If provided with appropriate care , these birds may just stay with you for years to come .
There are two species of these birds that are of interest to breeders .
These are the Timneh Parrot and the Congo African Parrot .
The former is smaller and has a deeper hue than the latter .
Breeding African grey parrots can be challenging , especially if you are not well aware of everything that it requires to remain healthy and well .
As these birds have specific requirements , you need to make sure to meet all these needs to ensure their overall health and behavior .
How to Build the Best Cage for an African Grey
One of the things that you need to provide for your feathered friend is an appropriate housing .
It will need one that will provide enough wing space where it could fly up and about without feeling restricted .
It should also be a place that will be safe at all times .
Any object placed inside the cage should be one that will make it properly stimulated and rested .
Nothing placed inside the housing that would endanger the life of your dear parrot .
No sharp , dented , or loose edges that may cause harm to your pet bird should be anywhere in or near the cage .
When building or choosing a cage for African Grey parrot , one that can offer more space is always a better option .
A lot of space will make your parrot feel at ease while inside its new home .
It is also a good thing to have a bird cage that is built with an opening at the top of it and one that allows your feathered friend to scale from one level or perch to another .
This will give your bird more chances to exercise its wings , feet and grip .
Of all the available options for a bird cage , you should never consider one with a round shape as it has been noted that a cage with this design to have caused psychological problems to the parrot .
These birds are said to be temperamental in nature , and having them kept in a round shaped bird cages wo n’t help with their mood swings .

Four states have felt the joy of housing appreciation and the agony of the housing bust in a very deep and extreme way .
Without a doubt , this economic crisis is touching every corner of the global economy but four states have seen the multifaceted punishment of this housing and credit bust .
Those states are California , Florida , Nevada , and Arizona and these past days I was able to see first hand three of the states .
Spending time in these few states and contributing my own economic stimulus to these economies , I realize that the housing downturn still has further to go .
These states are ground zero for the coming Alt - A and pay Option ARM wave that will be crashing down on us later in the year .
Driving through these states and the vast subdivisions hugging the desert you can quickly put a face to the economic devastation .
How many of these homes sit empty ?
Will these homes ever have occupants ?
How much money has been lost in this pursuit of endless housing wealth ?
You also witness the countless commercial real estate developments that encircle these areas with your typical chain fast food restaurants and your mega shopping center .
Some do n’t realize that these commercial real estate developments are usually brought out 12 to 18 months after the construction of the new subdivisions .
That is , the commercial real estate bust is the next big thing to watch since these stores were developed to service a population that is n’t moving in .
Let us first take a quick look at the numbers :
These four states make up 56 % of all U.S. foreclosure filings .
And this trend does not show any signs of abating given that these states also hold a disproportionate amount of Alt - A loans which are tied to some of the more toxic recast type mortgages that I have discussed .
So how many Alt - A loans reside in these states ?
Let us break down those numbers further :
Again , what you will find is that these four states hold a disproportionately high amount of Alt - A loans .
To be precise , these four states hold 46 percent of all active Alt - A mortgages .
Now why would this be so problematic ?
A large portion of these loans have yet to face a serious recast .
Forget about the resets that are tied to LIBOR for example , with rates at historically low levels .
This is n’t the issue .
The problem with the recast is the massive jump in payments that can easily double the monthly payment as I have discussed in detail in a previous article .
The major concern is these four states have seen there large metropolitan areas face some of the deepest year over year price drops in history .
Take a look at the Case - Shiller price drops for the largest MSA data series for each state :
Florida and California have multiple MSA data points in the Case - Shiller monthly reports but I used Miami and Los Angeles as samples for the two states .
For Nevada and Arizona I used the Las Vegas and Phoenix MSA data which is the largest for each state .
And herein lies the coming tsunami .
The L.A. MSA is doing the best out of the four and that is now down 40.4 % from the peak reached in September of 2006 .
Arizona with Phoenix is being slammed with a 50.8 % drop in housing prices .
In fact , the 111 mark assigned to this MSA now puts us back in 2001 price territory .
These markets are flooded with inventory .
So when the recasts hit with those Alt - A mortgages they will be hitting a market that is extremely depressed .
Keep in mind that many of these Alt - A products have negative amortization which allowed the principal balance to actually increase .
This has created a time bomb with these mortgages .
They will be going off in the most depressed markets possible .
The endgame is a flood of foreclosures in markets that already have a flood of foreclosures .
Someone sent me over this must watch video called Lost Vegas from Vanguard :
The video highlights the troubles faced by Las Vegas .
In the episode , you will see a story that is all too common where a would - be investor bought a property and “ forgot ” to tell the renters that he was being foreclosed on .
You will also see projects stalled since growth has halted given the current economy .
We also see a former mortgage company worker who is now an exotic dancer and calls it a “ big step up ” from her previous job .
It is definitely worth watching .
These states are facing the double whammy of the debt bubble .
A fall from grace is always painful .
States that did not see major housing bubbles are still having difficulties but these four states went from perma - growth and never ending housing appreciation to an absolute bust .
It would appear that financial prudence is now going mainstream and I saw this funny clip from a show being aired on ABC this Friday called Un - Broke .
In this one clip , Seth Green highlights a Real Home of Genius here in California :
You have to watch the clip , it is hilarious .
But aside from the humor , I could n’t believe that I was getting better financial advice in two minutes from Seth Green rather than on CNBC , a supposedly self labeled financial network .
In this little clip , we are told about living within your means , driving a paid off car , and not buying a McMansion .
Living prudently has now gone mainstream in a big way .
Yet going back to our four states , living within your means is something that has been foreign for over a decade .
The massive McMansions that I saw in three states is a sad reminder to the perma - debt growth model .
In this model , you could n’t have enough fast food chains or auto dealers and forget about the mega department stores .
If we were to study this as an ecological environment , you would think that humans as a species only had one purpose in life .
That purpose was to eat junk food , buy gigantic cars , and upgrade every countertop in the globe to granite .
Yet there is a finite number of what we can consume and we hit it .
The empty subdivisions are a testament to this over building and over consuming era .
And that is a large reason I do not see a second half recovery .
Because to recover , we have to assume we are going back to the ways of old .
Do you see that happening ?
Do you see us once again going back to buying massive gas guzzling highway tanks and buying 3,000 square foot McManions again in a mega way ?
I do n’t and that was a large contributor to our growth .
Let us not even talk about the ancillary crony banking system and lenders that fed on this bubble for their life .
The two biggest purchase items for Americans are homes and cars .
How are those two industries doing ?
So looking at these four states , I ’m not sure I see a second half recovery .
We are still heading directly into the Alt - A and pay Option ARM tsunami and these four states are hurting in a big way .
Need we examine the California budget boondoggle ?
If these four states are any indication , we wo n’t be out of this mess in 6 months .
The clock starts next week .

Credit ... George Ruhe for The New York Times
Mr. Rallins says he hopes to win a job with PICO , a national faith - based organization .
He is applying for a position in Brockton , Mass. , an industrial city battered by the state ’s highest foreclosure rate , the loss of most of its major manufacturing jobs and dwindling state resources .
Starting annual salary is about $ 35,000 .
Self - healing concrete works because it can bend .
When it 's strained , many microcracks form instead of one large crack that causes it to fail .
Here , a specimen is bending as a force of five percent tensile strain is being applied .
Regular concrete would fail at .01 percent tensile strain .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A concrete material developed at the University of Michigan can heal itself when it cracks .
No human intervention is necessary -- just water and carbon dioxide .
A handful of drizzly days would be enough to mend a damaged bridge made of the new substance .
Self - healing is possible because the material is designed to bend and crack in narrow hairlines rather than break and split in wide gaps , as traditional concrete behaves .
“ It ’s like if you get a small cut on your hand , your body can heal itself .
But if you have a large wound , your body needs help .
You might need stitches .
We ’ve created a material with such tiny crack widths that it takes care of the healing by itself .
Even if you overload it , the cracks stay small , ” said Victor Li , the E. Benjamin Wylie Collegiate Professor of Civil Engineering and a professor of Materials Science and Engineering .
Watch professor Victor Li's bendable self - healing concrete in action .
A researcher shows how this material compares with regular concrete .
A paper about the material is published online in Cement and Concrete Research .
It will be printed in a forthcoming edition of the journal .
In Li’s lab , self - healed specimens recovered most if not all of their original strength after researchers subjected them to a 3 percent tensile strain .
That means they stretched the specimens to 3 percent beyond their initial size .
It ’s the equivalent of stretching a 100 - foot piece an extra three feet — enough strain to severely deform metal or catastrophically fracture traditional concrete .
“ We found , to our happy surprise , that when we load it again after it heals , it behaves just like new , with practically the same stiffness and strength , ” Li said .
“ Self - healing of crack damage recovers any stiffness lost when the material was damaged and returns it to its pristine state .
The material can be damaged and still remain safe to load . ”
The engineers found that cracks must be kept below 150 micrometers , and preferably below 50 , for full healing .
To accomplish this , Li and his team improved the bendable engineered cement composite , or ECC , they ’ve been developing for the past 15 years .
More flexible than traditional concrete , ECC acts more like metal than glass .
Traditional concrete is considered a ceramic .
Brittle and rigid , it can suffer catastrophic failure when strained in an earthquake or by routine overuse , Li said .
But flexible ECC bends without breaking .
It is studded with specially - coated reinforcing fibers that hold it together .
ECC remains intact and safe to use at tensile strains up to 5 percent .
Traditional concrete fractures and can’t carry a load at .01 percent tensile strain .
The average crack width in Li ’s self - healing concrete is below 60 micrometers .
That ’s about half the width of a human hair .
His recipe ensures that extra dry cement in the concrete exposed on the crack surfaces can react with water and carbon dioxide to heal and form a thin white scar of calcium carbonate .
Calcium carbonate is a strong compound found naturally in seashells .
In the lab , the material requires between one and five cycles of wetting and drying to heal .
To test the healed concrete , the researchers used resonant frequency measurements to determine the stiffness and strength before and after inducing the cracks .
These tests send sound waves through the material to detect changes in its structure .
Today , builders reinforce concrete structures with steel bars to keep cracks as small as possible .
But they ’re not small enough to heal , so water and deicing salts can penetrate to the steel , causing corrosion that further weakens the structure .
Li ’s self - healing concrete needs no steel reinforcement to keep crack width tight , so it eliminates corrosion .
The professor says this new substance could make infrastructure safer and more durable .
By reversing the typical deterioration process , the concrete could reduce the cost and environmental impacts of making new structures .
And repairs would last longer .
The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave the country ’s roads , bridges , water systems and other infrastructure a “ D ” grade for health .
The federal stimulus package includes more than $ 100 billion for public works projects .
“ Our hope is that when we rebuild our roads and bridges , we do it right , so that this transportation infrastructure does not have to undergo the expensive repair and rebuilding process again in another five to 10 years , ” Li said .
“ Also , rebuilding with self - healing bendable concrete would allow a more harmonious relationship between the built and natural environments by reducing the energy and carbon footprints of these infrastructure .
As civil and environmental engineers , we are stewards of these mega-systems .
Advanced materials technology is one means to keep them healthy . ”
The paper is called “ Autogenous healing of engineered cementitous composites under wet - dry cycles . ”
This research is funded by the National Science Foundation and a China National Scholarship .
Li will give a keynote address on self - healing concrete at the International Conference on Self - Healing Materials in Chicago in June 2009 .
The University is pursuing patent protection for the intellectual property , and is seeking commercialization partners to help bring the technology to market .

Netanyahu : “ What the hell do they want from me ? ”
Last night , shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told journalists that the Obama administration " wants to see a stop to settlements — not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions , " Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a confidant .
Referring to Clinton ’s call for a settlement freeze , Netanyahu groused , " What the hell do they want from me ? " according to his associate , who added , " I gathered that he heard some bad vibes in his meetings with [ U.S. ] congressional delegations this week . "
In the 10 days since Netanyahu and President Barack Obama held a meeting at the White House , the Obama administration has made clear in public and private meetings with Israeli officials that it intends to hold a firm line on Obama ’s call to stop Israeli settlements .
According to many observers in Washington and Israel , the Israeli prime minister , looking for loopholes and hidden agreements that have often existed in the past with Washington , has been flummoxed by an unusually united line that has come not just from the Obama White House and the secretary of state , but also from pro-Israel congressmen and women who have come through Israel for meetings with him over Memorial Day recess .
To Netanyahu ’s dismay , Obama does n’t appear to have a hidden policy .
It is what he said it was .
" This is a sea change for Netanyahu , " a former senior Clinton administration official who worked on Middle East issues said .
The official said that the basis of the Obama White House ’s resolve is the conviction that it is in the United States ’ as well as Israel ’s interest to end the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
" We have significant , existential threats that Israel faces from Iran and that the U.S. faces from this region .
It is in our mutual interest to end this conflict , and to begin to build new regional alliances . "
Netanyahu needed to engage Obama directly , the former official said .
" Now that he has done so , and also sent a team of advisors to meet [ special envoy to the Middle East George ]
Mitchell , he has very clearly received a message : ‘ I meant what I said on settlements .
No natural growth .
No elasticity .
There will be a clear settlement freeze . ’ "
( Netanyahu sent a team of advisors including minister for intelligence Dan Meridor for meetings with Mitchell in London Monday . )
" Over the past 15 years , settlements have gone from being seen in Washington as an irritant , to the dominant issue , " says Georgetown University Middle East expert Daniel Byman .
He pointed out that key figures in the Obama administration — Mitchell , who headed the Mitchell Commission , which recommended a halt to settlements ; national security advisor Gen.
Jim Jones — see the Jewish settlements in the West Bank , home to some 290,000 people , as a key obstacle to getting a peace settlement .
" I do n’t think the logic is hidden , " Byman said .
It ’s not just the administration that ’s delivering Netanyahu that message , however .
Whereas in the past Israeli leaders have sometimes eased pressure from Washington on the settlements issue by going to members of Congress , this time , observers in Washington and Israel say , key pro-Israel allies in Congress have been largely reinforcing the Obama team ’s message to Netanyahu .
What changed ?
" Members of Congress have more willing to follow the leadership of the administration … because [ they ] believe it is in our national security interest to move toward ending the conflict and that it is not a zero sum for Israel , " the former senior Clinton administration official said .
" Netanyahu and [ Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor ]
Lieberman are probing , looking for areas they can get space gratis from the United States , " says Hussein Ibish , a senior fellow at the American Task Force for Palestine .
" And they are not finding it . "
" We ’ve been watching the move in Congress , especially among certain high profile Jewish American members — people like Representative Gary Ackerman , Representative Robert Wexler , and Representative Howard Berman , " Ibish said .
" What has occurred — and this has been greatly intensified by the election of Obama :
There has been a growing sense of members of Congress who are well - informed on foreign policy … that peace is essential to the American national interest and the Israeli national interest .
And there ’s been a growing sense that the possibility of a two - state agreement is time - limited and that things like the settlements are incompatible with the goal of creating two states . "
The changed dynamic in Washington has impressed Palestinian audiences .
At a breakfast yesterday morning with Palestinian American policy hands near Pentagon City , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that he was extremely impressed with the Obama administration ’s resolve on policies that it sees as crucial for getting out of the current status quo — after years of drift that have seen Jewish settlements expand to almost 300,000 people on land the Palestinians envision as part of a future Palestinian state .
Abbas had a private meeting with Obama at the White House this afternoon , followed by an expanded meeting in the Oval Office with Obama , White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , Clinton , and other U.S. officials .
" We are a stalwart ally of Israel and it is in our interests to assure that Israel is safe and secure , " Obama said in a joint press conference with Abbas after the meeting .
" It is our belief that the best way to achieve that is to create the conditions on the ground and set the stage for a Palestinian state as well .
" And so what I told Prime Minister Netanyahu was that each party has obligations under the road map , " Obama continued .
" On the Israeli side those obligations include stopping settlements .
They include making sure that there is a viable potential Palestinian state .
On the Palestinian side it ’s going to be important and necessary to continue to take the security steps on the West Bank that President Abbas has already begun to take , working with General Dayton .
We ’ve seen great progress in terms of security in the West Bank .
Those security steps need to continue because Israel has to have some confidence that security in the West Bank is in place in order for us to advance this process . "
Even one veteran Washington peacemaker who had grown skeptical that Washington can overcome obstacles to get substantive progress on Middle East peace admitted to being impressed by the Obama team ’s resolve .
" What I ’m beginning to see is that the Obama administration may be less concerned with actually getting to negotiations and an agreement and more interested in setting new rules and rearranging the furniture , " said Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson Institute .
" They may have concluded that they ca n’t get to a real two state solution with this prime minister [ Netanyahu ] .
Maybe they want a new one ?
And the best way to raise the odds of that is to demonstrate that he can’t manage Israel ’s most important relationship : with the U.S. "
Echoing language from the Bush administration ’s debate about policy to Iran , behavior change vs. regime change , Miller said the Obama administration ’s stance demanded " behavior change for sure " on the settlements issue .
" If they keep pushing as the Secretary [ Clinton ] was last night , who knows about the other , " he said .
" The danger of course is that they raise the level on the settlements issue and then back off , leaving the emperor ( ess ) with no clothes .
And this would make America look really bad . "
In the midst of a global recession , businesses struggle to find the value in buying powerful new computers .
It is a situation that continues to prove torturous for Dell and seems to have paralyzed parts of the company ’s turnaround efforts .
Dell , based in Round Rock , Tex. , depends on selling computers to businesses and government bodies more than any of the other major computer makers .
About three - quarters of its products go to such customers , while consumers make up the remainder .
As businesses appear to be recovering more slowly than consumers , Dell is looking quite far ahead to find signs of optimism in the PC industry .
“ We are preparing for what we believe will be a powerful replacement cycle , ” said Michael S. Dell , the company ’s founder and chief executive , during a conference call on Thursday to discuss the company ’s first - quarter results .
Mr. Dell expects sales to pick up in 2010 , when customers may buy new computers to run Microsoft ’s next operating system , Windows 7 .
For now , Dell continues to struggle .
In its first quarter , ended May 1 , net income fell 63 percent , to $ 290 million , or 15 cents a share , from $ 784 million , or 38 cents a share , in the same period last year .
Excluding restructuring and real estate charges , Dell earned 24 cents a share , beating analysts ’ estimates by a penny .
Ten and Six is an indie pop / art rock band from Cleveland , OH .
Influenced by acts such as Sunset Rubdown and Dungen , their 2009 self - titled , debut EP reveals the eclectic and engaging range of sounds at the disposal of singer , songwriter , and multi-instrumentalist Evan Moran .
The album successfully conveys the young band 's desire to marry melodic pop and rock tendencies with ambient , lo - fi , folk , and progressive stylistic leanings .

After being in Italy for a week and a half and with eight days of racing completed here at the Giro , I ’ve noticed a thing or two .
In fact , based on this list I ’ve compiled , I ’ve noticed at least ten things .
1 . I ’ve noticed that the final kilometer of each stage is usually hair - raisingly narrow .
Presumably this makes for great live spectating as well as entertaining television coverage , but we have gone through some sections in the final thousand meters where if two people put their arms out straight , they would easily cut off the entire road .
And to further complicate matters , I ’ve noticed the final K is usually chalk full of roundabouts , turns , cobbles , or whatever other bits of obstacles they can find .
Heads up !
2 . There are these big banners displaying the distance to the finish ; there ’s 35 km to go , 30 , 25 , etc , as well as each of the final ten kilometers counting down to zero .
After racing both mountaintop finishes as well as ripping fast descending finishes , I ’ve noticed that these final ten kilometers seem to tick by significantly faster when we ’re going downhill than when we finish uphill .
Go figure .
3 . I ’ve noticed the following things refuse to get old :
- Massage .
Sometimes they ’re painful , sometimes all you want to do is head down to dinner or grab a nap , but no matter what , being told you need a massage after each stage will not get old .
- The reach - around - tap .
This coy maneuver occurs when rider A approaches their friend , rider B , A then taps B on the opposite hip from where A is located , causing B to turn their head away from A , yet no one is there !
Joke complete .
Honestly I see this a half dozen times per day and it ’s always at least mildly entertaining .
- The finish line .
Day after day after day , crossing the finish line does not get old .
- Support from around the globe .
Every day I receive dozens of emails , Tweets , texts , and messages of support from friends , family , acquaintances , fans , neighbors , and people whom I ’ve never met .
I unfortunately do n’t have time to reply to them all , but they ’re enormously helpful in keeping the morale and spirits high .
Thank you .
4 . I ’ve noticed that pink is a great color !
5 . I ’ve noticed that my fellow VeloNews contributer , Michael Barry , spends more time with his nose selflessly in the wind than any other rider .
Teammate is in the leader ’s jersey ?
Michael ’s on the front .
Teammate caught out of position ?
Michael ’s riding him back up the side of the peloton .
Time to get water bottles ?
Michael ’s going back to the cars and then forward through the wind to get bottles .
Time for a leadout ?
Michael ’s on the front .
Split in the field ?
Michael ’s pulling it back .
Friends , Michael Barry is crazy strong … and a super nice guy to boot !
6 . Italy is enchantingly beautiful .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever used the word enchantingly in my life , but if there ’s ever an applicable use for it , it ’s for describing Italia .
From the sky - scraping mountains entrenched in snow , sunshine , or fog , to the beautifully antiquated villages overflowing with enthusiastic tifosi , to the sinuous roads no more than ten feet wide through dense forests , Italy is really one of a kind .
7 . I ’ve noticed that as soon as “ Groupetto ! ” is shouted in the peloton , motivation generally goes the way of my subsequent speed : down .
Now it ’s worth pointing out that I ’m under strict orders from captain Carlos here to conserve , conserve , conserve !
This is my debut grand tour and to help him out in weeks two and three , as well as for me to make it to Rome , I need to save energy whenever possible .
There have been plenty of days that the legs have felt strong enough , but for the sake of conserving a bit of strength I ’m pulling the plug early and soft pedaling in .
8 . I ’ve noticed that while John Denver may have alienated his North American fan base in doing so , it would have been equally apt if he had sung “ Dolamite Mountain High . ”
Although I ’ll admit that “ Rocky Mountain High ” has a smoother ring to it .
9 . Much to my dismay , I ’ve noticed that the start village does not have a hairdresser .
Thankfully our chief mechanic , Alejandro , has a set of hairclippers so I took care of my growing frock of hair .
That said , the start village is still quite the site to behold .
10 . I ’ve noticed that three weeks is a long time .
Ready , set , go !
Start your watch ’s stopwatch feature .
Make a list of everything you do in the next 504 hours .
It ’s probably a lot .
One day at a time !
- Ciao ,
Ted

It ’s one thing if , as former Vice President Dick Cheney keeps saying , the United States brutally interrogated people to keep our kids safe from another strike by Osama bin Laden .
If folks got tortured to provide a rationale for going to war with Iraq , though , that ’s a whole different story .
Recent news reports have suggested the possibility that the Bush administration might have endorsed torture to prove an Iraq - al Qaida link .
And a recent report from the Senate Armed Services Committee shows that months after then - President Bush had declared Mission Accomplished in Iraq , an Army general working hand in glove with top administration officials tried , albeit unsuccessfully , to convince a unit charged with finding weapons of mass destruction to get tough on its prisoners .
In August and early September of 2003 , Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller , the man in charge of the Pentagon ’s torture laboratory at Guantanamo Bay , was dispatched to Iraq , allegedly to Gitmoize operations there .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
It seems to have worked , at least in one place .
Soon after Miller visited with officials in charge of Abu Ghraib , guards there began to use working dogs , stress positions , extremely lengthy interrogations , isolation , yelling and nudity in order to try to wring information from prisoners — all techniques that had been used at Guantanamo and that the world would later see in photos released from an investigation in to what had gone on at the prison .
But according to the Senate committee ’s report , before Miller met with the Abu Ghraib officials , he first made a little - known visit to the Iraq Survey Group , which was in charge of the hunt for WMDs in Iraq after the invasion .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Miller told the ISG they were “ running a country club ” by not getting tough on detainees , Chief Warrant Officer Brian Searcy , the ISG interrogation chief , told the Senate committee .
Searcy said Miller suggested shackling detainees and forcing them to walk on gravel .
Mike Kamin , another ISG official , told committee investigators that Miller recommended temperature manipulation and sleep deprivation .

A canine castaway lost at sea has been reunited with her owners after spending more than four months living off goats on a Queensland island .
Owner Jan Griffith said her family were devastated when their cattle dog , Sophie Tucker , fell off the side of their boat in choppy waters off the Mackay coast in north Queensland in late November .
Sophie ... learned to live wild after swimming to island .
But unbeknown to them , their hardy hound swam five nautical miles to St Bees Island , where she survived until last week by hunting baby goats .
She was last week returned to her family after rangers captured what they believed was a wild dog .
We appreciate Microsoft 's system is a solid machine with an excellent range of games .
We like games and although we have our preferences ( obviously ) our job is n't to judge which system is best , more help you to get the most out of your system ( which we 're hoping is the Playstation 3 if you 're on this site ) .
Having said that , we do keep note of what our favourite companies are saying about each other , and we can't help but notice a trend that allows Microsoft to get away with anything ; and Sony nothing .
Take for example Microsoft 's latest Japanese promotion - a piece of propaganda that calls the Playstation 3 inferior at every turn .
The cover reads : " Xbox 360 over PS3 if you are picking multi- platform games " .
No exclusives to talk of this year Microsoft ?
The content is filled with quips such as " XBOX Live Arcade system - cheaper than the PS3 " .
In fact it even goes on to justify reasons why the , now inferior version of Tales Of Vesperia is , erm , " superior " .
Now we know it 's only marketing , and that 's fine , but here 's our point : the gaming community holds such a double standard towards
Sony these days that we 're 101 % convinced if Sony had released this pamphlet we'd be sifting through hundreds upon hundreds of : " ZOMG Sony should focus on their own system not the competition , they should shut up , make some games , Sony sucks " comments .
You 've read the ones .
We have n't come across a single comment suggesting the same about Microsoft 's tactics .
Interesting eh ?
The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity is running an advertisement at the Washington Post and The Hill websites which makes the following claim : 72 % of opinion leaders support coal electricity .
The ACCCE touts this claim repeatedly at their various websites , but there is so little information available about the study that produced this claim that it ’s literally impossible to verify .
However , given the number of inconsistencies in what little information is available , we can make an educated guess as to the accuracy of the 72 % claim .
If you click on the “ America ’s Power ” advertisement ( screen shots shown at right ) , you ’re taken to this page , where the ACCCE claims “ it ’s easy to see why 72 percent of American opinion leaders support the use of coal . ”
On this page , however , there are four links on the page that all go to the same press release that describes the ACCCE study that produced this 72 % number .
The Election Day press release makes a number of claims about an earlier survey that are inconsistent based exclusively on the information presented in the press release .
The claims all rest on the study ’s definition , provided at the bottom of the press release , of “ opinion leaders , ” aka “ opinion elites . ”
They are defined as follows :
The poll interviewed 600 opinion elites nationwide .
Elites are defined as adults with $ 80,000 or more in household income and a four - year college degree or more and a professional or managerial job title or a business owner and a high degree of involvement in politics and policy matters .
According to the Census Bureau economic data , there were 116.8 million households in the U.S. in 2007 ( the latest year for which there ’s complete data ) , of which only 34.1 million meet the income requirement described for an “ opinion elite ” above .
That ’s just 29 % of all households .
According to the Census Bureau educational attainment data , there are approximately 60.5 million people in the U.S. with four - year college degrees more more .
That ’s just under 28 % of the estimated population of the U.S. in 2007 that was at least 18 years old .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , if we take all occupations in management , legal , computers and mathematics , architecture and engineering , healthcare providers and technicians , and business and finance as individuals who might qualify as “ opinion elites ” by profession , that ’s a total of approximately 26.1 million people out of a total of approximately 253 million people employed in 2007 .
That ’s only about 10 % of the workforce .
Finally , we ’ll have to make an educated guess about how someone was defined as having “ a high degree of involvement in politics and policy matters . ”
It ’s probably fair to say that the nation ’s 65,000 legislators and 15,000 lobbyists in 2007 qualified , but they are certainly not alone ( and they ’re already counted in the workforce numbers just described ) .
If we assume that there are about 20 x more people in the U.S. who meet the survey ’s political participation threshold than there is legislators and registered lobbyists , then that ’s approximately 1.6 million people who meet this criteria as well .
That ’s only about 0.4 % of the population .
As you can see , there ’s a significant problem with this definition – it applies to such a small number of individuals in the U.S. that it ’s difficult to generalize the results .
At best there ’s between 1 and 2 million people who meet all the requirements .
In reality , however , the number of “ opinion elites ” will be much smaller given the number of people who meet most but not all of the criteria of the definition .
Unfortunately , without more information , we ca n’t know how much smaller , except that there are at least 600 “ opinion elites ” in the U.S. – that ’s how many were surveyed , after all .
So much for the available survey methodology notes – on to the survey ’s results .
The first claim based on the definition of “ opinion elite ” is that the survey “ found that 72 percent of opinion leaders nationwide support the use of coal for generating electricity . ”
Right away this claim raises an important question : what is the margin of error in this number ?
The press release does n’t say .
The second claim is that the 72 % represented “ a significant increase over the past year and the highest level of support since the group began polling almost 10 years ago . ”
How is this possible when the ACCCE did n’t exist 10 years ago – it was founded in 2008 .
Is the press release talking about the polling organizations , AmericanPublic.us and RT Strategies , or one of the ACCCE ’s precursor organizations ?
The third claim is that “ the poll shows that Americans are very optimistic about the future for coal .
When asked the question ‘ do you believe coal is a fuel for America ’s future ? ’ — 69 % of Americans agreed ( compared to only 26 % who disagreed ) . ”
This claim is an outright lie .
According to the survey ’s own methodology , they polled only 600 people who qualified as “ opinion elites . ”
It is not possible to generalize the results of a survey from a tiny selected minority out to the entire population at large .
It would be like polling just my immediate family about our car buying habits and then trying to apply that to my entire community .
The last two claims related only to “ those surveyed , ” and you can always draw conclusions about the survey ’s respondents from their answers .
But without a statistical method to correlate your data with the wider population , you cannot draw any conclusions for the wider population .
And there ’s no suggestion in these last two claims that there is any correlation to all American or even just to all “ opinion elites . ”
In summary , the survey as its described in the ACCCE press release suffers from a number of critical problems : an amazingly tight definition of the survey ’s population , no defined margins of error for any of the questions individually or for the survey in its entirety , an unexplained discrepancy regarding how many years the poll has been taken , and an outright lie .
I requested a copy of the survey ’s methodology last week and did not receive any response .
So what can we surmise about the survey and the related web advertisement from these survey claims ?
Since we do n’t have the actual survey as a reference , we have to make educated guesses from what information we do have .
First , we can probably say that the participants of this survey were either a ) selected by the polling organizations or b ) self - selected their own participation in the survey .
We can make this educated guess because of the lack of any margins of error and because of the phrase “ those surveyed ” for the last two claims .
Selected polls are only valid for the individuals selected and so statistics cannot be used to extrapolate the poll data to the rest of the target population .
Second , we can probably say that this press release is an attempt to manipulate people , and for more reasons than “ that ’s what press releases exist for . ”
There ’s one blatant lie , possibly a second ( the “ 10 years ” claim ) , and a huge number of unanswered questions .
In addition , the page that the advertisement links to has four different links on it – that all go to the exact same survey press release .
This suggests that the ACCCE online communications expert wanted to make that first page look like there was more research supporting for the ACCCE advertisement than there really was .
And third , given the first two educated guesses , it ’s almost certainly accurate to say that the ACCCE advertisement is unsupported bunk .
In 1980 , computer engineering was based on starting with clearly - defined things ( primitives or small programs ) and using them to build larger things that ended up being clearly - defined .
Composition of these fragments was the name of the game .
However , nowadays , a real engineer is given a big software library , with a 300 - page manual that ’s full of errors .
He ’s also given a robot , whose exact behavior is extremely hard to characterize ( what happens when a wheel slips ? ) .
The engineer must learn to perform scientific experiments to find out how the software and hardware actually work , at least enough to accomplish the job at hand .
Gerry pointed out that we may not like it this way ( ” because we ’re old fogies ” ) , but that ’s the way it is , and M.I.T. has to take that into account .
Jerry Sussman has taught the last class ever of 6.001 , Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs , the introductory computing course at MIT .
Here 's a summary of the reasoning , taken from Dan Weinreb
My own take on this is that you need both .
Yes , one of the great advances of modern times is that we have large systems with large libraries , and students must learn to work with that .
But , no , that does n't mean that fundamental skills taught in SICP are any less relevant .
As Joel Spolsky points out in The Perils of JavaSchools , it is vital that schools of computing continue to explode the minds of incoming undergraduates by exposing them to Scheme ( or Haskell or Erlang or Prolog or anything else far from the mainstream ) .
If I were to affix an epigraph to my space on this blog , it would be this , courtesy of Princeton University health economist and raconteur Uwe Reinhardt :
" Every Dollar Health Spending = Someone 's Health - Care Income "
Reinhardt calls this the " Alfred E. Neuman 's Cosmic Health Care Equation " ( which is probably some sort of Princetonian inside joke ) .
Is it a little obvious ?
Maybe , but only in the sense that the obvious is frequently taken for granted and carelessly forgotten .
Every would - be health reformer from the Cato Institute 's free - marketeers to Physicians for a National Health Program 's socialized - medicine agitators agrees on one thing :
Health care costs too much , so we should find ways to pay less for it .
This is a laudable goal from a consumer standpoint and good fiscal policy to boot .
What gets lost in the shuffle , Reinhardt reminds us , is that all of that " overspending " ends up in somebody 's pocket .
And that somebody ardently wants to keep it there while they go about collecting more .
It 's a natural instinct .
It 's also what 's going to drive millions of dollars of lobbying on health reform by the businesses on the right side of Reinhardt 's equation .
When the average person hears politicians , academics , activists , etc. , talk about health reform , they ask themselves , " How is this going to affect me ? "

On top of everything , I 'm not going to have my child degraded , " said the Mississauga resident .
The " everything " she refers to includes being sent to an Adult Learning Centre when she arrived , even though English is her first language , and getting passed over for a college spot in favour of a white friend .
" I 've never understood people who believe they are superior .
It 's based on idiotic ideologies .
And it 's not just white European people . "
Kirunda and her son , Canadian citizens who emigrated from Kenya six years ago , face exactly the sort of walls a major study of multiculturalism and society pinpoints .
Crunching thousands of numbers from 41,666 people interviewed in nine languages , the just - published study found skin colour – not religion , not income – was the biggest barrier to immigrants feeling they belonged here .
And the darker the skin , the greater the alienation .
" We were surprised that religion did n't have more effect , " said lead author Jeffrey Reitz .
" It came down to race , with Asian people reporting some and with young black males the most stigmatized .
The data is consistent with that .
" We tend to believe racism is a minor problem in Canada , of little consequence .
Someone looked at them funny .
Or that many immigrants are doing well , so it must be their fault if they are n't .
There is a reluctance to investigate the issue . "
The University of Toronto professor of ethnic , immigration and pluralism studies added that a lack of trust was also higher among the successful , Canadian - born , Canadian - educated children of visible minority immigrants .
The problem is n't multiculturalism , spawned in 1971 by then - prime minister Pierre Trudeau , the study concluded .
" A lot of people in Canada revel in diversity .
They were happy to say goodbye to liver and onions , hello stir - fries and samosas , " said Reitz .
But the original idea of multiculturalism saw integration as the marker of success :
A second generation equally accepted in the mainstream and in the ethnic community .
The study found :
The more discrimination someone faced , the more they were likely to identify with their ethnic group , rather than as Canadian .
Visible minorities identified themselves much more strongly by their ethnic origin through the second , third and fourth generations .
While 65 per cent of recent black immigrants , 70 per cent of South Asians and 52 per cent of Chinese felt they belonged in Canada , those numbers dropped to 37 per cent , 50 per cent and 44 per cent in the second generation .
A third of Chinese , South Asians , Filipino and Southeast Asians reported discrimination ; half of blacks did and 40 per cent of Koreans and Japanese did .
In fact , a schoolyard fight in Keswick that made national news involved a Korean boy retaliating for a racial slur .

Discrimination was most common in applying for jobs and at work ; a store , bank or restaurant were the next most frequent .
" We need to address these feelings of isolation , " said Reitz .
" Among minorities born in Canada , blacks have the lowest sense of belonging , the lowest level of trust in others and the weakest sense of Canadian identity .
They are the least likely to vote , " Reitz and Ryerson University assistant professor Rupa Banerjee wrote in the book Multiculturalism and Social Cohesion .
" Among recent immigrants , blacks have high levels of volunteers but among the second generation this has disappeared . "
Should we worry ?
Reitz pointed out that the first wave of migration of blacks from the south in the United States were embraced for their culture and differences in the north , creating places such as the prosperous , dynamic Harlem in New York City .
A few generations later , Harlem was a ghetto that exploded into race riots .
" I 'm not saying that is going to happen here .
But we have indications of social problems in communities .
There is the perception of a crime problem .
Some children of immigrants have high dropout rates .
We ought to be asking why . "
The study used data from Statistics Canada 's 2002 Ethnic Diversity Survey .
In the last seven years , said Reitz , " attitudes have improved in race relations .
But they are n't reflected in reduced discrimination .
Better is not good enough . "
Kirunda , a registered nurse who is taking graduate nursing courses at Ryerson University , would agree .
" I'm a single black mum with a black boy .
In Canada , there is more compassion for that than in the States .
Here , I knew I was going to be supported . "
She pauses .
" If I did most of the hard work . "

Graham Hawkes said once underwater , the craft could cover a 20 km area
The oceans of the world remain one of the great mysteries but one man believes his latest invention will change all that .
Graham Hawkes has built a state of the art submersible that offers " exotic new capabilities to explore one of the least understood parts of the planet " .
His Deep Flight Super Falcon has been dubbed the Lear jet of the oceans .
Mr Hawkes said that , unlike other submersibles , his deep sea craft could actually " fly underwater " .
" Normal submersibles have ballast systems and are nothing more than sinkers .
They just treat the ocean as a vertical elevator and they typically work on the bottom on a small footprint .
Blueprint of the original Deep Flight submersible " This one , instead of being a crab you drop to the bottom , is like a dolphin .
It will fly off and move through the ocean with grace .
It looks like a big animal moving and can do barrel rolls with whales , " explained Mr Hawkes .
' Underwater adventuring '
The Super Falcon is the culmination of 20 years of work and four generations of experimental prototype winged submersibles .
The creators plan to let members of the public take part in " flight school " and fly underwater in the submersible later this year .
The cost of going where few have gone before ranges from $ 5,000 ( £ 3,300 ) to $ 15,000 ( £ 9,900 ) .
An earlier version of the sub , called the Challenger , was made for the adventurer Steve Fossett , who was best known for being the first person to fly solo nonstop around the world in a balloon .
Mr Fossett broke his own record for distance in a balloon in August 1998 Mr Fossett had planned to dive to a record breaking 37,000 feet in the Challenger before his death in an air accident over the Nevada desert in 2007 .
Mr Hawkes has already built and sold a Super Falcon to the American billionaire Tom Perkins , who made his fortune as a venture capitalist backing companies like Google , Symantec and Genentech .
" When I was looking for a submersible , I wanted a fighter jet , not a blimp , " said Mr Perkins .
" I believe the Super Falcon is the future for underwater adventuring . "
The inventor 's own Super Falcon craft was unveiled to the public at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco where Mr Hawkes declared it " the most beautiful machine ever built " .
" This is the machine I always wanted to build for myself , " he told the BBC .
" It will set a new tone for access in the ocean and hopefully we can connect people to that part of the world like never before . "
Under the hood The Super Falcon can reach depths of 1,500 feet and speed through the ocean at six knots , which is nearly seven miles per hour and much faster than conventional submersibles .
One of the vessel 's aims is to help connect people with the ocean Mr Hawkes 's design is said to be the first to operate on the same principles as flight through air , using downward " lift " on the wings to fly down to depth .
It weighs a 10th of its traditional rivals thanks to lowering the internal volume of the pressure hull .
The vessel is powered by a set of lithium polymer batteries .
While a typical dive is around three to five hours , the Super Falcon has life support for 24 hours .
And there is no issue with crew or passengers suffering from the " bends " or other pressure - related illnesses because the cabin pressure remains at one atmosphere .
And if there is an accident and the 4,000 - pound vessel loses power , Mr Hawkes said it wouild " naturally glide back up to the surface " .
It costs $ 1.5 m ( £ 993,400 ) to buy , which the inventor said was around the same price as a light jet .
" Obnoxious factor " Despite being an engineer at heart , Mr Hawkes said he was also on a mission to turn his Super Falcon into an " ambassador of the seas " .
" We live on a blue planet .
Earth is a silly name , " he said .
" We have mastered airspace with all kinds of aircraft .
We have mastered near space with all kinds of spacecraft .
We need to master underwater flight because the ocean is a three - dimensional space .
" It is not just deep , it 's long and so this machine can go down and run with the whales , do barrel rolls and present marine life like it has never been seen before . "
Mr Chiau said " flying " the Super Falcon was like a dream come true Crucial to this task is keeping what Mr Hawkes described as the " obnoxious factor " to a minimum .
He explained that this meant the vessel was non-invasive .
That was down to the fact it had a " low noise signature , low magnetic signature , low electrical signature and low light signature " , said Mr Hawkes .
The latter he sees as particularly crucial because so much of marine life is sensitive to light and often scurries away from deep sea craft because they are emitting so much .
" We know for example that sharks are sensitive to electrical leakage so you put 1,000 volts down there and you have a nuclear reactor underwater with animals running away .
" There is not much point in flying in this space if everybody gets out of your way , " said Mr Hawkes .
Charles Chiau , who is the chief electronics officer for Hawkes Ocean Technologies , has taken the Super Falcon out to depths of 500 feet .
" Imagine you are in a place no - one has gone before .
You are able to do things no - one else has been able to do .
You are able to flip .
You can do barrel rolls and follow animals .
" I personally encountered three manta rays and flew through a school of sharks .
That was just amazing .
I felt like an old fashioned explorer , " said Mr Chiau .
' Other space '
The first people to get a taste of life underwater will be those invited to take part on what has been called VIP in the sea .
The programme , which will visit national marine sanctuaries , is aimed at policy makers , communicators , politicians , educators and artists .
" These are incredible areas of the ocean but people can't see them .
They can't experience them because they are so deep , " Maria Brown , a superintendent at the Gulf of Faralloness National Marine Sanctuary told BBC News .
" We need these people to experience these sanctuaries at first hand so they can spread the message of why they are important and help up protect them . "
One of the first communicators to fly around the ocean will be John Markoff , a senior writer with the New York Times who had his name pulled out of a lucky draw during the event at the Academy .
" I love the idea and confess I have n't thought of this notion about this other space we are not able to reach .
" I do n't even know what to expect but I am excited about it and also a little scared .
After all there are creatures down there that can eat you , " joked Mr Markoff .

In a recent study ( that yielded some exceptionally interesting results ) , catalytic RNA molecules were used in order to advance the understanding of Darwinian evolution .
Researchers Dr. Sarah Voytek and Professor Gerald Joyce of the Scripps Research Kellogg School of Science and Technology , choose RNA molecules because they evolve rapidly and self - replicating RNA molecules are hypothesized to be the first organic “ life forms ” on earth .
With a trillion molecules in a test tube replicating every few minutes , such an approach permits evolution to occur over the course of just a few days .
Observing an evolutionary process in action is n’t always possible considering that in order for novel adaptations to emerge and become fixed within a population typically requires long periods of time .
This is especially true in more complex organisms , however in a laboratory environment , populations of bacteria , viruses and complex molecules have been used to demonstrate evolutionary principles since their generation times are much shorter and therefore observing an immediate physical change directly is possible .
For several years , Dr. Joyce has been experimenting with a particular type of enzymatic RNA molecule ( single - stranded nucleic acid which catalyzes its own replication ) that is able to continuously evolve in a test tube setting .
Evolution happens when the RNA molecule replicates — there is a chance the molecule will mutate ( approximately once per round of replication ) and acquire new traits over time .
The RNA enzymes require a specific substrate ( food source ) in order for replication to occur .
These characteristics make RNA enzymes the molecular equivalent of a single specie organismal population , while their substrate represents an environmental resource necessary for the specie to survive and reproduce .
The logistic model of population growth predicts that when two species that require the same limited resources coexist in the same community ( interspecific competition ) , one population will ultimately die out or will evolve dependency on another resource .
Collectively , this occurrence is referred to as the competitive exclusion principle .
The competitive exclusion principle scenario is n’t readily observed in nature considering , as stated , the competing specie has already gone extinct or has adapted to a new ecological niche .
What we observe in present ecological relationships is the result of past competitions .
Evidence for competitive exclusion includes observable resource partitioning trends — coexisting similar species are typically adapted to different niches within a community .
Ecological relationships are wildly complex with countless variables , so any trend observed in a natural setting is most certainly a strong case for a good biological “ rule of thumb . ”
Furthermore , to replicate the same evolutionary process in a laboratory setting solidifies the hypothesis — the Scripps researchers did just that , and their work will undoubtedly become a classic experiment that future textbooks will cite .
Two RNA enzyme “ species , ” CL1 and DSL , were used in the study and both are capable of continual evolution upon substrate provission .
The aim of the researchers was to study coadaptation to an environment consisting of only enzyme substrates .
In the first experiment , CL1 and DSL were placed in the same environment and forced to compete for the same limited food source .
The outcome was that the “ les fit ” enzyme would ultimately disappear .
Researchers repeated this experiment for several different substrates and although the outcome of one RNA specie outcompeting the other was consistent , the RNA specie that “ won ” or “ lost ” depended on the actual substrate itself .
For the second part of the experiment , CL1 and DSL were challenged to undergo continuous evolution in an environment consisting of five different substrates .
The different substrates provided the opportunity for each RNA specie to undergo the process of niche partitioning ( adpatation to one substrate only ) .
At the beginning of the experiment , each RNA could utilize all five substrates , however , not very efficiently .
After hundreds of generations of evolution , the two molecules each became independently adapted to a particular substrate .
Furthermore , their ability to utilize the resource became more efficient and they shunned the other RNA molecule ’s food source , therefore avoiding competition .
Upon analysis of the two evolved enzymes , there were observable differences in their kinetics as a result of their differing adaptive strategies .
In ecological theory , an organism that experiences selective pressures will evolve to be either an “ r ” or “ K ” species in regards to reproductive strategy .
In general , r-selected species are better suited for fluctuating environments and are characterized by short generation time and high reproductive output .
On the other hand , K - selected species are more successful in stable environments , take full advantage of their resources , and are characterized by low mortality and less progeny .
Biological characterization of the DSL and CL1 enzymes revealed that r/K adpatation occurred in this experiment :
I n broad terms , the evolved CL1 enzyme is a K - strategist that generates fewer copies per round of replication compared with DSL but more effectively utilizes the available substrate because of its very rapid rate of catalysis .
The evolved DSL enzyme , in contrast , is an r-strategist that generates 2.5 - fold more copies per round of replication compared with CL1 ...
The CL1 enzyme evolved to have an extraordinary rate of reaction made possible by fully utilizing its substrate and in turn , almost every CL1 molecule was able to give rise to progeny .
Whereas DSL evolved to be an r-strategist that has a lower rate of reaction but compensates by yielding a higher number of progeny per parent molecule .
When it comes to finding products to sell online , your profit margins are amplified by how low you can drive your sourcing costs down .
For example , the typical retail markup for an online store is 4X .
As a result , for every dollar it costs you to source an item , you need to charge 4 dollars !
On the flip side if you can shave a dollar off your costs , then you can potentially mark down your prices by 4 dollars or pocket the extra profit !

How To Find China Wholesale Suppliers – A Video Overview
Canton Fair
One of the best ways to find Chinese vendors is by attending the Canton Import And Export Fair .
The Canton Fair is held in GuangZhou , China twice a year ( Usually during the end of May and the beginning of November ) and is one of the largest sourcing shows ( if not the biggest ) in the world .
It easily trumps any trade show in the US and it ’s so large that they have to split it into 3 phases .
The first phase covers electronics , the second phase covers consumer goods , gifts and home decor and the third phase covers textiles , garments , shoes and office supplies .
To give you an idea of the magnitude of the fairgrounds , the Canton Fair is equivalent in size to 218 football fields .
Crazy right ?
Now if you ’ve ever tried to find a Chinese vendor or factory using an online directory like Alibaba , you probably know how time consuming it can be .
There are many companies to go through and it ’s hard to gauge product quality by just looking at photos online .
In addition , language and cultural barriers can make communication challenging over email and text .
The best part about the Canton Fair is that it ’s a place where suppliers and factory owners from all over Asia congregate and you can easily find a vendor that either carries what you want to sell or can make what you want to sell .
In addition , all of the vendors bring in samples of what they make so you can touch and feel all of the merchandise first hand before committing to a purchase .
Most of the suppliers at the fair are used to dealing with American and European companies so they have the experience and infrastructure to export products to wherever you live .
The other good news is that a good number of these vendors speak English … not good English mind you , but enough to communicate at a basic level .
If you require an interpreter , you can easily hire one for a very reasonable price ( 100 yuan = 15 bucks for the day ) .
Going to the Canton Fair sounds intimidating but it ’s actually not that bad and it does n’t cost nearly as much as you think .
First off , the Canton Fair is free to attend and the cost of living is much lower in China than in the US .
Second of all , I ’ve published my full itinerary and a complete guide to the Canton Fair below .
If you plan on going , you can simply copy my travel plans .
Here ’s a podcast that I recorded about my last trip to the Canton Fair
Global Sources Tradeshow
Similar to the Canton Fair , the Global Sources Tradeshow is another gigantic fair where factory owners from all over the world congregate twice per year .
What ’s nice about the Global Sources Tradeshow is that it takes place just BEFORE the Canton Fair in Hong Kong so you can easily hit both shows during the same trip !
While the Global Sources show is not as large as the Canton Fair , there are a few key differences that make the Global Sources show a must attend event .
First off , while there is some overlap with the Canton Fair in terms of suppliers , many of the vendors that attend the Global Sources tradeshow are unique .
Because Global Sources is a search engine for Chinese vendors like Alibaba , they also have a gigantic searchable database of manufacturers that you can establish contact with prior to attending the event .
In addition , Global Sources contains a much larger contingent of suppliers in certain key categories such as electronics and fashion accessories .
So if you plan on selling anything electronic , Global Sources is the best show to attend .
The other key difference is that Global Sources provides a strong focus on education .
During their show , they simulaneously run a conference that teaches you how to run a successful importing business .
The content of the event is fantastic and they invite successful ecommerce entrepreneurs from all over the world to speak .
But perhaps the best part about the Global Sources trade show is that there ’s a very low language barrier !
Unlike China , everyone speaks English in Hong Kong and it ’s generally much easier to get around as a result .
My advice if you decide to travel all the way to Asia is to attend both the Global Sources show and the Canton Fair during the same trip .
Canton is only a 2 hour train ride away and it costs $ 30 .
Below is an interview that I conducted with the CIO of Global Sources
Yiwu Wholesale Marketplace
The Yiwu wholesale market is one of the largest wholesale markets in China where you can find a variety of different products at really low prices .
Unlike China wholesale tradeshows like the Canton Fair or Global Sources which only occur twice per year , the Yiwu market is open everyday of the year except for certain Chinese holidays .
What ’s also different is that the Yiwu marketplace is literally a place where you can physically walk away with goods that are ready to sell or have them shipped directly to your warehouse in bulk .
In other words , many of the goods are off the shelf and ready for sale .
In terms of products , you can find a bunch of suppliers that sell everyday goods like handbags , textiles , accessories , watches … basically commodity products that can complement goods that you already carry in your shop at really low prices .
It ’s also important to note that the wholesalers at the Yiwu market are not manufacturers .
Instead , most merchants in the market are trading companies or small retailers .
One thing that you have to be aware of is that you may find fake or knock - off brands at the Yiwu market so you have to be careful .
In general , none of the products at Yiwu will have a brand and any “ well known brand name ” that you see there will likely be inauthentic .
Overall , the products at Yiwu tend to be cheap , commonplace items that you can use as upsells or cross sells for your existing portfolio .
They also make great items for a free plus ship offer or a giveaway .
What To Expect When Communicating With Asian Suppliers At A Tradeshow
Running our online wedding linens business for the past 10 years has required me to deal with many vendors across China , India and other parts of Asia .
And I ’ve discovered that working with Asians is a lot different than working with Americans or Europeans : )
Here ’s a short list of what you need to be aware of when dealing with Asian suppliers .
Expect A Language Barrier
The key thing to keep in mind when communicating with Chinese suppliers is that they probably studied English in school .
They might not be able to speak or understand English that well , but they can probably read it much better than they can listen .
So when you are visiting your vendors , it helps to have everything written down or typed in English .
If you go in there and start blabbing away , chances are that the vendor will only be able to pick up bits and pieces of the conversation .
They might nod and go “ uh huh ” , but in reality they probably have no clue what you are talking about .
The same goes for taxi drivers and directions .
Have someone write everything down in Chinese if possible and if you have to speak , speak slowly and enunciate every word .
Expect Cultural Differences
One of the main cultural differences between the US and China is that Chinese people tend to be non-confrontational .
For example , Chinese vendors will rarely correct you , interrupt you , or let you know that they do n’t completely understand you .
It is part of their culture to be polite and accepting .
But if you are not careful , this one simple cultural difference can cause you a ton of grief when placing orders .
The biggest obstacle to overcome is that you might think you are communicating when in fact you are not .
For example , I could be discussing something with my vendor and they might be nodding and acknowledging everything that I ’m saying but then turn around and do the complete opposite once the conversation is done .
The key is to ask direct questions and make sure that there is no misunderstanding .
Ask , clarify and reiterate all of your points as many times as necessary and be sure to write everything down as well .
The important thing to realize is that your vendor is just trying to be polite so you can never assume that anything is clear unless it has been thoroughly discussed .
Contracts Are Not Final
In the United States , contracts are considered final .
After a series of negotiations , the final contract is supposed to represent an agreement and acknowledgment of terms .
In Asia however , a contract is almost meaningless .
When I deal with Chinese vendors , drafting an official agreement can often seem like a waste of time .
We might spend a day negotiating and agreeing on terms and pricing only to have everything change the very next day .
For example , one time we drafted a written agreement for a large handkerchief order only to have the supplier contact us a week later to tell us that they could n’t manufacture some of the items we requested .
On another occasion , a supplier tried to raise prices on us after the fact even though we agreed on pricing long ago .
The key takeaway here is that the definition of a contract is different in Asia than it is in the US .
Do n’t expect a written document to be the end all and be all of your negotiations .
In fact , I would argue that drafting an agreement is just the beginning .
Do n’t Make Assumptions – Be Specific
Here ’s a general rule of thumb that needs to be ingrained into your head when importing from China .
Never assume that the vendor knows what you want .
If it ’s not spelled out in a document , then your vendor will get it wrong or cut corners .
For example , we import plain white handkerchiefs and you would think that it would be straightforward to describe .
After all , it ’s just a piece of fabric right ?
But one time we negotiated a lower price and the vendor sent us handkerchiefs with paper thin fabric .
Because we did n’t specify the exact thickness of the material , the vendor met our price by cutting corners on the fabric .
Bottom line , go through your samples and specify every last detail of what you want .
Assume that any aspect that is not explicitly spelled out will be made incorrectly .
The Main Benefit Of Going To A Live Tradeshow
Cultural differences aside , the key benefit of going to a trade show like the Canton Fair or Global Sources is that it allows you to make face to face contact with a large number of vendors and establish real relationships .
This is invaluable !
By going to the fair , you can easily meet hundreds of factory owners in just a few days .
In fact , your relationship with your vendor is one of the key components to your success and face to face contact is essential .
For example when my wife and I first started our business , we communicated with our suppliers solely through email .
And many of these vendors did n’t give us the time of day until we physically visited them in their home country .
The difference was night and day and the overall demeanor of our suppliers changed once we met them in person .
Miraculously , our product quality improved and they became eager to help us out with special requests and designs .
The other thing to keep in mind is that most of the vendors who attend the tradeshows do not have a web presence so it ’s next to impossible to find them otherwise .
While it can be intimidating to travel to China and attend the fair , it ’s well worth your time .
If you plan on going , then check out my itinerary !
China Wholesale Directories – Alibaba And Global Sources
If you are unable to travel to China or Hong Kong to attend the tradeshows , the next best way to find Chinese vendors is to use an online directory like Alibaba or GlobalSources.com .
Alibaba and GlobalSources are search engines for Chinese suppliers and you can instantly have access to tens of thousands of vendors at your fingertips .
Here ’s an example of how easy it is to find a vendor using Alibaba .
Simply type in what you are looking for in the search bar and Alibaba will return a bunch of suppliers , prices and minimum order quantities .
By clicking a button , you can then send the vendor a message and establish contact .
Here ’s an example script that I use when contacting suppliers for the first time .
Hi “ vendor name ” , My name is “ name ” and I ’m a buyer for “ store name ” , a store in “ your country ” that sells “ the products you want to carry ” .
We are interested in carrying many of the items that you have to offer .
Specifically , I would like to get pricing and availability for the following items “ list the items … provide photos if you have them ” “ list the items … provide photos if you have them ” “ list the items … provide photos if you have them ”
If you could send us more info as well as your product catalogs and MOQ requirements we would greatly appreciate it .
Thank you ,
“ your name ”
Once you ’ve established contact , you can ask for samples , place orders etc …
In addition , Alibaba offers a service called trade assurance which acts like an escrow service so you do n’t ever get scammed .
Sounds easy right ?
So what ’s the catch ?
The biggest caveat is that this process can take a while and communicating back and forth with suppliers requires patience .
For example , the time it takes from initial contact to obtaining samples can easily take weeks .
In addition , the language barrier can make communication challenging because you must describe exactly what you want to manufacture via email and live chat .
The other key difference between using a directory like Alibaba versus going to a tradeshow is that services like Alibaba tend to contain a lot of middlemen .
Because there is such a low signal to noise ratio for vendors on Alibaba , many of the higher quality suppliers do n’t list themselves in the directories .
For example , none of our primary vendors advertise on Alibaba or Global Sources .
But that being said , as long you can make a profit with your suppliers , then that ’s all that matters !
The Main Difference Between Alibaba And Global Sources
The two biggest online directories for Chinese suppliers are Alibaba and Global Sources .
But there are some key differences between the two .
First off , Alibaba has many more supplier listings than Global Sources but it comes at the cost of quality .
In my experience , there ’s a lot more noise on Alibaba .
In general , Global Sources has a more involved vetting process which allows them to attract higher quality vendors .
In addition , I ’ve found that the MOQs ( minimum order quantities ) for Global Sources vendors tend to be much higher than Alibaba as well .
But bottom line , your mileage will vary depending on what you want to sell .
Give both services a try and see where it takes you !
1688.com
1688.com is a China wholesale supplier directory that is owned by Alibaba Group .
In fact , 1688.com is almost exactly the same as Alibaba.com except that 1688.com primarily caters to Chinese businesses .
In fact , the entire website is in Chinese and you have to use Google translate or find someone who can read Chinese to help you find suppliers on their website .
Now why am I showing you a website that is completely in Chinese ?
The reason is because sometimes Chinese vendors have inherent biases towards Americans , Europeans and other foreigners when they provide their price quotes on Alibaba .
In other words , sometimes identical vendors that you find on Alibaba and 1688.com will offer higher prices to foreign businesses .
Here ’s what you can do to make sure that you are getting the lowest price .
Whenever you are done negotiating on price for a vendor on Alibaba , you should also contact that same vendor via 1688.com with a different email address to see if the quote is any different .
If the prices are similar , then it ’s all good .
But if the pricing is drastically different , then you should find out exactly why there is a discrepancy .
Overall , you can use a site like 1688.com in conjunction with Alibaba to help you get the lowest price .
China Wholesale Marketplaces – DHGate And AliExpress
While you should generally stick to Alibaba.com and GlobalSources.com for your China wholesale sourcing needs , I have been asked about both DHGate and AliExpress in the past so here ’s my take on these 2 marketplaces .
Both DHGate and AliExpress are marketplaces of Chinese wholesalers and dropshippers and the closest comparison I can think of in the US is Ebay .
Basically when you make a purchase through DHGate or AliExpress , they handle the transaction and the seller ships the item .
Both DHGate and AliExpress offer a refund guarantee on all purchases .
In terms of product sourcing , the prices that you ’ll find on AliExpress and DHGate will tend to be higher than what you ’ll find when sourcing direct from a manufacturer .
But the main advantage is that the MOQ will be much lower .
In fact , you can often buy products in single unit quantities which makes these marketplaces ideal for testing out new markets before committing to a bulk purchase .
Panjiva And Import Genius
Most people are not aware of this but every single shipment imported by sea is documented on the public record .
And if you search this public record , you can easily find out where companies are sourcing their products from .
There are two main companies that allow you to conduct import searches for a monthly fee , Panjiva and Import Genius .
By typing in a business name , Panjiva will tell you every single sea shipment that company has made , where the shipment originated from and the manufacturer .
For example , here ’s a sample bill of lading from The North Face that I obtained from Panjiva for free .
Crazy right ?
So if you see a product online and you want to make something similar , you can easily find out where it was made and reach out to the exact same manufacturer !
Jungle Scout Supplier Database
While Panjiva and Import Genius were the first companies to offer the ability to search the US import database , Jungle Scout now allows you to search the public record at a far cheaper price .
What ’s nice about the Jungle Scout Supplier Database is that with a few clicks of the mouse , you can easily figure out where your Amazon competitors are sourcing their products from .
In addition , you can see exactly what they are importing and at what quantity as well .
Below is a video that I created which provides a demo on how to use the Jungle Scout Web App .

What To Expect When Importing And Manufacturing Your Goods In China
While importing your goods from overseas is the best way to obtain quality products at rock bottom prices , there are several logistical issues you have to work out in order to be successful .
Below is a brief overview of what to expect when importing goods from overseas along with some tips on getting your goods to your warehouse .
First off , here ’s what you should expect …
Long Lead Times
Most overseas vendors wo n’t even begin making your products until you actually place an order and put down a small down payment to cover the cost of materials .
Depending on the nature of your items , expect to wait anywhere from one to four months to get your products manufactured .
Very rarely will a vendor carry inventory and most goods are made to order so you must plan ahead .
When we order linens for our online store , the lead times are typically 3 months long so we always have to predict our demand way in advance .
A Large Minimum Order
If you are ordering products to be manufactured overseas , expect to place a fairly large minimum order .
Every manufacturer will have their own MOQs ( minimum order quantity ) but do n’t be embarrassed to ask before ordering .
If you are just starting out , make sure that you obtain samples first and validate that your product will actually sell BEFORE you place a large order .
These days , I rarely purchase less than 300 pieces of any new product but you can often negotiate lower minimum order quantities if the vendor believes that you are a serious customer .
Be sure to check out my free guide on how to negotiate MOQ with your supplier .
Payment Terms
Most manufacturers expect to be paid by wire transfer .
Also , you usually have to put down some money upfront ( usually 30 % ) to cover the initial costs and then pay the balance once the items are ready to be shipped .
If you are worried about fraud , there are escrow services like Alibaba trade assurance that will facilitate the exchange of goods and services .
But in general , transactions go much faster when there ’s mutual trust between you and your vendor .
For example , we pay for all of our orders via wire transfer and our vendors do n’t make us put up the initial 30 % down payment .
However if you are just starting out , do n’t be afraid of wire transfers .
If you are apprehensive about sending your money overseas , consider asking to pay by Paypal instead .
Some vendors will accept Paypal if you cover all the fees but do n’t count on it .
Quality Control
Quality control will often be an issue and you have to be very specific in telling the vendor EXACTLY what you want .
In general , it ALWAYS pays to hire an inspector to inspect your goods at the factory .
After all , once your products get shipped to you , there ’s not much you can do if you receive defective merchandise .
For the price of around $ 300 , you can get a statistical sampling of your shipment directly at the factory and know what percentage of your goods are defective .
Catching manufacturing issues at the source will save you lots of headaches .
It also keeps your vendors honest .
Below are some of the more popular inspection companies .
Language Barriers
Many vendors in Asia do not speak English very well .
But as long as you restrict your communication to email and live chat , things will go much smoother .
Most vendors are able to read English much better than they can understand the spoken language .
As a result , ask to communicate with your supplier via WeChat and Skype .
Preparing For Your Shipment
Once you ’ve ordered your products and they are ready to be shipped , there are two main ways to get your goods into your home country , by air and by sea .
But before you initiate your shipment , make sure you ask for the following documents from your vendor .
These will be required in order to clear customs .
A Commercial Invoice –
The declared value of the items
– The declared value of the items A Packing List – What you are importing
– What you are importing A Detail Sheet – Outlines how the products are manufactured so customs can determine the duty classification
– Outlines how the products are manufactured so customs can determine the duty classification Bill of Lading – A legal document between the shipper of goods and the carrier detailing the type , quantity and destination of the goods being carried .

Shipping By Air
Shipping your items by air is by far the easiest option but also the most expensive .
Expect to pay between 5 - 6 x more to ship by air versus shipping by sea .
Personally , we use DHL for all of our international air shipments .
Our vendors all have accounts with DHL and shipping with them is a breeze because they take care of everything .
Basically , the vendor provides DHL with all of the materials mentioned above and then DHL transports all of your goods directly to the address that you specify .
You do NOT need a customs agent !
If this is your first time importing goods from overseas , you will be contacted by customs to provide your social security card or a company id number .
Have this information handy once your goods have shipped and you are all set .
DHL will also send you a customs bill so that you can pay any and all duties associated with your imported goods .
Shipping By Sea
Shipping by sea is a much bigger headache but totally worth it if you are importing a large volume of goods .
As mentioned before you can easily save between 5 - 6 x compared to shipping by air .
The key to accepting shipments by sea is to hire a good customs agent .
This is absolutely required especially if this is your first time importing by sea .
Do not try and do things on your own unless you know exactly what you are doing .
This is what the customs agent will take care of for you .
Customs Documentation –
They will take care of any and all documentation required in the entire process
– They will take care of any and all documentation required in the entire process Customs Entry –
They will take care of getting your goods from the port directly to your office
– They will take care of getting your goods from the port directly to your office Customs Duty –
They will take care of calculating and billing you for any duties associated with your goods .
– They will take care of calculating and billing you for any duties associated with your goods .
Customs Entry Bond –
You are required to buy a bond that acts as insurance with Customs in the event you should default on the customs duties .
Your customs agent will take care of this for you .
Of course all of these services come at a cost .
Right now , we are using a company called Toll Forwarding as our freight forwarder and customs agent .
For our last sea shipment , we paid about 1800 dollars to transport over 6100 pounds worth of goods to our warehouse and the whole process took about 3 weeks .
To give you an idea of the difference in price , shipping a 35 pound box via air courier costs about $ 170 which makes it cost prohibitive for large shipments .
In general , it makes sense to ship your products by sea if your shipment exceeds 200 lbs in weight .
The tradeoff of course is time .
Whereas sea shipments can take over 3 weeks to arrive , shipping by air typically takes 3 - 5 days .
Conclusion
Because the cost of manpower is so much cheaper in developing countries like China , Thailand and Vietnam , it makes sense to source most goods from Asia .
Any product that requires a lot of labor to assemble like textiles and electronics can often be purchased at a fraction of the price .
As a result , you should definitely consider importing from China as a sourcing strategy .
With higher margins , you can focus more of your dollars towards marketing and customer service .

By Amarnath Tewary in Nalanda , Bihar
They tried to prevent me using all sorts of pressure but I just ran out to the booth and cast my ballot
Tinish Kumar
Although the Indian government roped in famous Bollywood stars to appeal to the electorate to exercise their right to vote , the experience of one young voter in the eastern state of Bihar suggests the icons of the silver screen still have some work to do .
The man was first threatened , then ostracised and finally fined when he mustered the courage to cast his ballot .
It happened soon after villagers of Dharhara - in the Nalanda constituency - suddenly announced a poll boycott in protest over the lack of development in their village .
As a result , none of the 900 or so voters in Dharhara turned up to cast ballots in the village 's primary school building .
' Under pressure ' Tinish Kumar , 26 , defied the ban .
The row in Dharhara is over village development ( All pics : Prashant Ravi )
At the end of the day he was counted as the lone voter in his village , even though protesting villagers gathered near the polling booth and tried physically to force him from doing so .
" They tried to prevent me using all sorts of pressure but I just ran out to the booth and cast my ballot , " an unfazed Mr Kumar told the BBC .
" I wanted to vote because of the development our chief minister , Nitish Kumar , has done in the state , even if it has not come to our village yet . "
Tinish is currently studying a business course by correspondence .
He drove his motorbike for three hours from the state capital , Patna , to reach his village to vote on 7 May .
His mother , Usha Sinha , is a member of the village committee and his father , Kaushal Kumar , is an agriculturist .
They did not cast votes " under pressure from villagers " .
My son has not committed a crime .
I feel proud of him for daring to cast his vote
Usha Sinha
Crime and caste in Bihar politics " A group of them invaded our house in the evening and abused us and threatened us with dire consequences for our son if he dared cast his vote , " Usha Sinha said .
She told the villagers that her son had done nothing wrong .
Fearful of a backlash , she telephoned local legislator Sharvan Kumar and the police for help - but it did not come .
Ms Sinha said : " I 'll go and try to meet the Bihar chief minister at his weekly people 's court and tell him about what has happened on his own home turf .
" Casting a vote is an individual right and exercising it is everybody 's prerogative . "
Soon after the first incident of intimidation , a man appeared beating a drum .
He called on the villagers to attend an urgent meeting in the village .
Most went , but Tinish Kumar and his family wisely avoided it .
" Later we heard that they have decided to ostracise us from our caste community and imposed a fine of 15,000 rupees ( $ 301 ) as a penalty but no - one has ever approached us for this cash , " said Tinish 's father , Kaushal Kumar .
Village head Uma Kant Sinha did not vote - along with her husband Vijay Paswan - and left the village on polling day " to avoid an unnecessary confrontation with the villagers " .
" But what Tinish Kumar has done by casting his vote is amazing .
We all should vote and we 'll do it next time , " Uma Kant Sinha told the BBC .
Retired professor of maths Kumar Awadhendra Narayan - a neighbour of Tinish Kumar in the village - also supported what Tinish Kumar had done .
Tinish Kumar and his family say that an important principle is at stake However , the villagers who boycotted the poll stood by their action .
" The boycott call was taken not for individual benefit but for the development of the village as a whole .
You can see yourself the village has no drainage system , no road , no electricity and no primary health centre , " said Vinod Kumar .
Villager Mohammed Mahtab and Mohammed Mustaq nodded in agreement .
Usha Sinha remains unruffled .
" Why should I fear and succumb to their social pressure ?
My son has not committed a crime .
I feel proud of him for daring to cast his vote , " said Usha Sinha .
But Tinish Kumar 's stand for democracy was not replicated by all in Bihar .
In Nalanda , the turnout was an abysmally low 39 % .

While this is obvious , birds and humans took a very different evolutionary path a few million years ago .
But what 's weird is that studying bird genetics can even now yield insight into our very own genetic traits .
This is exactly what a group of researchers from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York , the US , did , in their investigations of a group of finches .
Their study yielded unexpected and very surprising results , which may shed some light on how we , as a society , came to be .
It 's common knowledge that male finches get their beautiful mating songs from their fathers and uncles , when they are in the wild .
But this knowledge brings about a philosophical question that has no answer , a query similar to the egg - and - chicken dilemma .
If babies learn from fathers , who did the fathers learn from ?
That is to say , who taught the first males of the species ?
In an attempt to understand this mystery , the researchers hypothesized that the birds had this type of mating behavior inscribed in their genes , and set out to demonstrate this .
They created soundproof enclosures , in which they bred a number of finches , deprived of their fathers ' and uncles ' musical influences .
Naturally , the songs they developed were very wrong , as far as beats and the rise or fall of pitch went .
These are the main things that attract females to a male , and so these males would n't have stood a chance to procreate in the wild .
The experiment was allowed to go on , and the birds mated and brought forth offspring .
Surprisingly , their offspring seemed to sing a lot better than their fathers , although not even close to the kind of music that finches created in the wild .
In the end , after the fourth generation of birds bred in soundproof enclosures , the offspring began to sing in a manner that was very similar , and at times almost identical , to the songs that finches sang after learning from their fathers .
The find amazed scientists – in just four generations , the influence of genes made its presence felt with a very high intensity .
“ It all happened so fast , and there was so little difference between the colony and in the one - to - one tutoring environment .
So the process is pretty much hardwired .
And the interesting thing was also that they could only get so close in a single generation , so the three to four generations were necessary for the phenotype to emerge , ” City College of New York expert Olga Feher , who was also the lead author of a new study detailing the finds , explained .
The paper appears in the May 3rd online edition of the journal Nature , Wired reports .
“ Social learning is shared between the two , and songbirds are a well - understood and experimentally tractable system .
These biologically - grounded studies will lead us beyond the tired ‘ nature versus nurture ’ or ‘ biology versus culture ’ dichotomies , which dominate the social sciences today , ” Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory expert Partha Mitra concluded .
3D Realms , developer of Duke Nukem Forever , has been shut down , according to a report by Shacknews .
The gaming site said Wednesday evening that a " very reliable source close to the developer " has confirmed that the studio has been shut down , and employees let go , due to " funding issues . "
Shacknews has not yet received a statement from 3D Realms , but got a statement from Apogee Software and Deep Silver , developers of the upcoming *
Duke Nukem * handheld games , that said they were " not affected by the situation at 3D Realms . "
This , of course , confirms that there is indeed a situation .
__Update : __Duke publisher Take - Two has commented on the situation , saying that its relationship with 3d Realms " did not include ongoing funds for development of the title . "
( Note the past tense . )
Finally , 3d Realms webmaster Joe Siegler said on the company 's forums : " It 's not a marketing thing .
It 's true .
I have nothing further to say at this time . "
In development since 1997 , Duke Nukem Forever has become the game industry 's longest - running piece of vaporware by a good country mile , winning many Wired.com Vaporware Awards .
Could this be , at last , the death of Duke ?

For Americans headed to Montreal or Canadians visiting Michigan 's Mackinac Island , those trips get a little more complex this summer .
As enhanced border crossing requirements loom , more states and provinces are putting in place the tools needed to make it easier for people to go between the U.S. and Canada .
There are still a few loose ends , but officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection say they will be ready June 1 , the day the United States fully implements the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative .
The initiative strengthens documentation requirements for everyone entering the country , calling for passports or special driver 's licenses .
The requirements will be in effect along the entire U.S. border with Canada .
The initiative does not affect Mexican nationals , who are already required to present a passport and visa to come into the U.S .
Vermont , New York , Michigan and Washington state and the province of Quebec are the only places issuing enhanced driver 's licenses , according to the customs agency .
The license is designed for travel into the U.S. by land or sea .
Extra documentation and an interview is generally required to get the special licenses , which are considered secure .
Homeland Security delayed full implementation of the travel initiative after howls of complaints from officials in border states .
U.S. Sen . Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , helped pass the legislation that delayed full implementation .
" The extra time has helped avert a major mess at the border , " Leahy said .
" That would have been an economic shock wave that would have hurt Vermont and other border states .
Federal agencies today are better prepared , and more Canadian visitors are aware that the change is coming . "
Over the past year , customs officials have installed scanners at most of Vermont 's border crossings that can read chips in enhanced driver 's licenses .
The scanners reduce the time every person spends at the border , said James McMillan , the customs agency 's port director for Highgate Springs , at the north end of Interstate 89 .
Over several hours , the time savings can be significant , said John Makolin , the CBP area port director for Vermont and New Hampshire .
" It does add up and it may seem incidental , but as time goes on and the document gets out there , it 's quicker , quicker , quicker , " Makolin said .
The new border policy will quickly be tested .
The Quebec holiday of St. Jean Baptiste Day is in late June and Canada Day is in early July , both of which traditionally bring Canadian travelers into the United States .

Is European Union ' buying democracy ' in Moldova for 1 billion Euros ?
Added by GordonAten on Jun 02 , 2009 | Visited by 8339 | Voted by 78 persons
According to opposition leaders in the Republic of Moldova , the EU representatives are exerting pressure on them in order to convince them to find a peaceful compromise with the communist majority in the newly elected Parliament .
The official reason is that Moldova is on the verge of an economic collapse and that the country wo n't sustain another runoff elections demanded by the opposition , which got lots of evidence that those elections had been rigged by the communist authorities .
The opposition also demands a full investigation of the post-election events in Kishinev on April 7 - 8 , which led to loss of human lives , awful abuses of the police forces and damages to official buildings reaching hundreds of millions of Moldovan Leis .
More than that , the leader of the Liberal Party of Moldova , young Mayor of Kishinev Mr.Dorin Chirtoaca , has publicly declared that the EU representatives have promised to provide all the necessary assistance to Moldova in getting 1 billion Euros of financial aid in case the opposition comes to an arrangement in the new Parliament in view of electing a new President and a new Government ( both obviously communist ) .
Putting aside the political correctness of this disclosure by Mr.Chirtoaca , such a statement however raises some unpleasant questions for the EU politicians :
This amount of money is huge , and to promise it means that it has been somehow pre-approved by top decision makers .
In this case , it would be interesting to know how did it surface before the official conclusions of the European Parliament on tragic events in Moldova ?
And what was the sense then of the European delegation to Moldova , headed by Marianne Mikko , who said at the end of the mission that she was shocked about the facts discovered in Moldova ?
For what merits the EU would support another communist administration in Moldova , which for last 8 years in power has failed to ensure firm democratic governance in the country and failed to build up a sustainable economic model , having turned Moldova into the poorest country in Europe ?
Does EU realize that with an extreme level of uncontrollable corruption in the country , absence of viable democratic system of checks and balances , probably one - third of those money would be used to prolong the survival of an autocratic ill state , or washed away into off - shores ?
How consistent such an approach of ' buying democracy ' is with the European democratic principles and morals ?
Would such appeasement bring the desired results and would it be lasting ?
Taking into account that the current Moldovan Government also asked Moscow for a 1 billion Euros assistance , does EU realize that this is just an obvious double game ?
Would n't it be more civilized for EU to support and truly monitor another elections , which would eliminate any doubts over the credibility of the new administration and only then provide assistance under some very strict conditions of real systemic changes in Moldova ?
BELMONT — How does Larry Ellison Elementary School sound ?
Or Electronic Arts Elementary ?
Does Max Keech School have a ring to it ?
Those are names being bandied about for the new campus being built in Redwood Shores .
Last week , the Belmont - Redwood Shores School District board agreed to have the superintendent contact Ellison , EA and Keech to see if they are interested in having a campus named after them .
But trustees remain open to other names , board President Karen Clancy said Monday : “ The idea is to have a process where the community has input , too . ”
A final list of possible names is still several months away , she said .
Ellison is the chief executive officer of software giant Oracle Corp , EA is a leading video - game company , and Keech is the developer of a residential project called The Preserve where the new school will be located .
All three are based in Redwood Shores .
“ I ’d be proud to have my name on that school , ” Keech said .
“ I ’m proud of The Preserve and the school as part of the larger project . ”
As for his name being among the three that have surfaced so far , he said , “ that ’s pretty good company . ”
The three names came up last month when the New Shores School Advisory Committee discussed naming the school after a business or individual willing to provide a donation for that honor .
Clancy is not aware of any school named after Ellison , she said .
But Nesbit Elementary School in Belmont has the Electronic Arts Community Learning Center , which was funded by a $ 250,000 grant from EA .
An Oracle representative could not be reached Monday for comment .
Among the current criteria , the board can name a school or building after an individual who has made important contributions , locally or beyond , or after the geographic area where the campus is located .
The new school is being built near Shearwater Parkway and Monaco Drive .
It is being funded by a $ 25 million bond measure voters approved in 2005 and is expected to open in August 2010 .

Half - Minute Hero PSP
For centuries , an epic battle between humans and evil lords has been raging and destroying everything in its path .
The civilized world is under attack by the relentless evil lord and all that remains are ruins of castles and the bodies of faithful knights who once proudly protected them .
Throughout time , heroes and legends have risen above the chaos , only to eventually disappear into the ashes .
As the last wandering sage and final hope for humanity , it is up to the protagonist to somehow transcend time and death to unite these legends and their unique powers in one last battle against the Ultimate Evil Lord .
An unorthodox approach to traditional RPGs , Half - Minute Hero combines adventure , an epic storyline , legendary characters and a punishing countdown clock to destruction , to create an adrenaline pumping experience that will blow past conventional fantasy games .
Choose between four modes of accelerated gameplay , each complete with original quests , enemies and attacks .
Hero Mode consists of random battles with classic RPG leveling - up elements , Evil Lord Mode involves a high degree of strategy to summon the appropriate monsters against the varying oncoming enemies , Princess Mode involves fast - paced shooting action as you guide the princess safely to and from her castle , and Knight Mode challenges the player to protect the sage in any way possible , including carrying the sage away from danger , clinging to monsters to halt their movement , or even throwing yourself at enemies to cause physical damage .
Each of the gameplay modes contains 30 stages in which players have 30 seconds , or a half - minute , to complete their tasks .
Retaining the charm inherent in classic RPGs , Half - Minute
Hero is a breakneck foray into an ancient land of monsters and magic , 30 seconds at a time .
XSEED Games partnered with Marvelous Entertainment USA to secure the North American rights to publish and distribute Half - Minute Hero .
This title is being developed by Opus Studio and is scheduled to be released Fall 2009 exclusively for the PSP .

Banks are using a little - known tactic to help pay bonuses , deferred pay and pensions they owe executives :
They 're holding life - insurance policies on hundreds of thousands of their workers , with themselves as the beneficiaries .
Banks took out much of this life insurance during the mortgage bubble , when executives ' pay -- and the IOUs for their deferred compensation -- surged , and banking regulators affirmed the use of life insurance as a way to finance executive pay and benefits .

A controversial French bill which will disconnect people caught downloading content illegally three times has been given final approval .
The legislation , backed by President Nicolas Sarkozy , was surprisingly voted down by the Assembly last month .
The bill sets a tough global precedent in cracking down on internet piracy , and is being closely watched by other governments as a potential deterrent .
The global music industry has been calling for tougher anti-piracy laws .
The Creation and Internet bill was passed by a vote of 296 to 233 by the lower house on Tuesday and has now been given final approval by the Senate .
Opposition Socialist and Communist senators did not take part in the vote on the bill , which was passed by 189 votes to 14 .
Industry backing
The new legislation operates under a three - stage system .
A new state agency would first send illegal file - sharers a warning e-mail , then a letter , and finally cut off their connection for a year if they were caught a third time .
It has been backed by both the film and record industries .
But some consumer groups have warned that the wrong people might be punished , should hackers hijack their computers ' identity , and that the scheme amounted to state surveillance .
The socialist parliamentarian Patrick Bloche said the bill was " dangerous , useless , inefficient , and very risky for us citizens " .
John Kennedy , chairman of the IFPI , which represents the global music industry , has described the bill as " an effective and proportionate way of tackling online copyright infringement and migrating users to the wide variety of legal music services in France " .
For those who have been wondering why former Vice President Dick Cheney does n’t just go gently into the night -- or at least park himself at that undisclosed location for a while -- now comes the answer .
Apparently he really cares .
Liz Cheney , the vice presidential daughter who got a plum job at the State Department during George W. Bush ’s administration , has taken to the airwaves to defend her father ’s rants .
Ever since President Obama started initiating new policies -- closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison , ending harsh interrogation techniques -- Dick Cheney has made the oft - repeated and truly incendiary assertion that Obama ’s policies are making the country less safe from terrorism .
On Tuesday on MSNBC ’s “ Morning Joe , ” Liz Cheney said her father would “ rather be fishing in Wyoming ” but felt compelled to tear down the Obama administration .

Her basic argument : Waterboarding was not only effective , it was legal , since the Bush administration had the legal documents that said so -- despite international conventions to the contrary .
Liz Cheney also accused the media of a double standard in criticizing her father over his outspoken views , noting that the media embraces former Vice President Al Gore when he speaks about global climate change .
“ You want [ Cheney ] to shut up because you disagree with what he ’s saying , ” she told the Washington Post ’s Eugene Robinson , whose column called Cheney “ an Old Faithful of self - serving nonsense . ”
The Post ’s Pulitzer Prize - winning columnist also asked this question : Ca n’t we send Dick Cheney back to Wyoming ?
Should n’t we chip in and buy him a home where the buffalo roam and there ’s always room for one more crazy old coot down at the general store ?

Others in key policy roles in the Bush administration -- former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , former CIA Director George Tenet , even former President George W. Bush -- have maintained a respectful silence during the recent debate over whether the “ enhanced interrogation ” methods they approved crossed the line into torture .
Not so Cheney , who has become a familiar face on the Sunday talk shows , spewing his critiques about the Obama administration , urging Republicans to recover politically by embracing the very Bush conservatism that cost them control of the White House , the Senate and the House of Representatives .
Asked about Cheney ’s recent comment that he would rather see the future of the Republican Party in the hands of conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh than the more centrist Colin L. Powell , former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and former Secretary of state , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called it “ an illuminating answer . ”
The former vice president , Gibbs added , keeps floating ideas that “ in many ways the last election was about and the last election rejected .
They ’re essentially going forward by looking backward . ”

“ If the vice president believes that ’s a way of growing and expanding the Republican Party , then we ’re happy to leave him to those devices . ”

At CeBit this year , NVIDIA demonstrated a new class of mobile GPU the company is billing as the perfect solution for future mobile solutions .
The new Asus K-series of laptops will offer the G102 M in its 14 " notebook ( the 15 " and 17 " systems will be powered by the upcoming 32 SP G120M .
According to NVIDIA 's copy , the G102 M carries 16 SPs , and up to 512MB of dedicated GPU memory , 1080 p decoding and what the company refers to as " casual games " are all supported .
Way to define " casual . "
NVIDIA does n't currently have a G102 M listed on its official product pages but there 's plenty of information on the G105 M — a part we can assume is a kissing cousin to this new chip .
Interestingly , the G105 M is listed as an eight - core processor on NVIDIA 's own spec sheet while the G102 M is supposedly a 16 - core lower - power part .
The implication here is that NVIDIA 's new effort is running in parallel but at very low speed .
In terms of features , the G102 M is standard for a part at this end of the market — HD decoding is supported ( it 's not clear if this implementation is identical to the PureVideo engine offered on higher - end GPUs ) .
If you 're wondering how these new monikers translate back into NVIDIA 's standard nomenclature , the company has a helpful conversion table available here .
The GeForce 9400 M + Ion we 've heard so much about , for example , is a GeForce G110M .
Currently , the GeForce 9100MG is holding the value segment , but whatever the G102M is , it does n't appear to be a respin of that part .
Best guess at this point is that these new G102M GPUs will be 9400 M - class parts that have been binned for low power consumption .
Mix in a little additional power reduction logic , yank the core clock down to minimum , and voila — one G102M .
Or maybe not .
We 'll tell you as soon as news is available .
Personally , I 'm hoping the G102 M is some sort of new product for NVIDIA rather than another refresh of G80 technology .
Unfortunately , such parts may be at least a year away .
LEGO Puzzles
Checkered Pentominoes
The task , of course , is to place all of the pentominoes into the tray .
Furthermore , when completed , a perfect checkboard pattern should result .
It was quite fun to build these pieces , but an experienced LEGO builder will realize that constructing the pieces so that the cubes of the pieces are strictly alternating black and white is not as easy as it would immediately seem .
Even if you do n't have enough pieces to build a complete set , I would challenge one to build just a single piece ( say the ' cross or X ' shaped piece ) .
How to make the black and white cubes join to form the pieces as a whole ?
The question is left as an exercise for the reader .
Six Piece Burr
There are many , many variations on this puzzle , some involving more than six pieces .
A wonderful webpage at IBM is a good starting place to investigate this type of puzzle further .
Polycubes
Got that ?
Maybe it 's easier seen that read , so below are some pictures of a set of polycubes I have built .
The set consists of all monocubes , duocubes ( there is only one of each ) , tricubes , tetracubes , and pentacubes , plus a single long hexacube ( the ' 1x1x6 ' straight piece ) .
Each piece is unique and ' reflections ' are also built ( meaning some are symmetric to each other ) .
The first picture shows all of the white polycubes laid out .
I also constructed a LEGO box of dimensions 4 - by - 6 - by - 8 cubes .
The pieces can be arranged so that they fit perfectly into this black box with no spaces inside .
That , of course , is the puzzle .
The solution is not unique ... there are many ways to fit all of the pieces inside the box , and , in fact , if a certain strategy is used , the task is not terribly difficult .
Note that 4x6x8 yields a total volume of 192 cubes .
This number is factorable in many ways , so one might wonder whether the pieces can be fit into different sized boxes .
They can .
I have , for example , built a red box of dimensions 3x8x8 ( also equals to 192 volume ) and placed all the pieces within .
I have done a 4x4x12 configuration as well , but have not constructed a box yet .
Tower
Now , each of the four ' levels ' of the tower rotates about a central axis .
Furthermore , one space where a ( red ) section should go is left blank .
This allows one to slide rooms up or down into the empty space ( and moving the space to a new location ) .
The object of the puzzle is to arrange the sections so that each column is all of one color and when stacked from bottom to top the sections are : Arch , Window , Window , Window with Roof ( except for the red column which is missing one Window section , so it is just : Arch , Window , Roof ) .
The pictures below show the various interactions with the puzzle , and finally a solved tower .
Sliding Maze
To solve , the user must configure the tiles so that a continuous , connected path of white is formed .
The solution is shown in the last photo below .
This puzzle has 48 tiles ( a 7 - by - 7 board with on space empty ) .
Soma Cube
The thumbnail picture to the right shows the final construction laid out ( click on picture to enlarge ) .
Other pictures are viewable with these links :
Cubic Dissection
Note that 6 - cubed equals 5 - cubed plus 4 - cubed plus 3 - cubed ( 216 = 125 + 64 + 27 ) .
The picture to the right ( which may be clicked to enlarge ) shows three cubes made of LEGO bricks so that their proportions are 5 , 4 , and 3 ( the black 3x3x3 cube is a little hard to see ) .
Obviously , if each cube were made of individual unit cube pieces , one could disassemble the three cubes and reform a single larger cube of size 6x6x6 ( it would be made of 216 little unit cubes ) .
But what is the fewest number of pieces that can be used to create both a set of three cubes as pictured as well as a single 6x6x6 cube ?
As Brian stated in his email to me , " For example , you can remove a 3x3x3 section from the larger cube intact as one piece , and two 4x2x4 pieces to make the other cube , but then you 're left with a mess to try and assemble the 5x5x5 cube using the least pieces . "
After a couple of hours of building and rebuilding , I managed to fashion 9 pieces which build the three cubes pictured at right and will also form a single 6x6x6 cube .
Can you do the same ?
Can you do better than 9 pieces ?
I 'm still trying to improve my result ( though , I think it may be impossible sticking to polycube shaped pieces ) .
Similar questions can be posed with other cube sizes ( 9 - cubed equals 8 - cubed plus 6 - cubed plus 1 - cubed , for example ) .
If you need a hints , I have a couple of pictures of the large cube constructed of the white , red , and black pieces : Angle # 1 , Angle # 2 .
If you have tired of this topic already , you may just want to look at my blurry picture of all the pieces lying about ( now it should be fairly easy to build the 6 - cube ) .
If you have not yet tired of this topic , you should be aware that geometry dissections are a topic in mathematics that has been active for many , many years .
Both amateur and professional mathematicians have made many contributions in dissections of 2 , 3 , and more - dimensional shapes .
This example uses pieces that are formed from smaller cubes ( or blocks ) , but , in general , dissections of various shapes can result in very peculiarly shaped pieces .
One web - resource on this topic is MathWorld .
Another is The Geometry Junkyard .
UPDATE : Shortly after posting the above paragraphs , a certain Don Reble correspoded with me and alerted me to Martin Gardener 's book " Knotted Doughtnuts and Other Mathermatical Entertainments " ( 1986 ) which details a solution to the above dissection problem by E. H. Wheeler .
That solution required only 8 polycubic pieces .
Don provided me with a slightly altered solution as the one as printed in Gardener 's book was slighted flawed .
Anyway , using red , white , and blue LEGO bricks I constructed the pieces and assembled the three cubes as well as the single large ( 6x6x6 ) cube .
I also have a picture of the 8 pieces without assembly .
If you are unable to reproduce the pieces from that picture , below is an ASCII representation of the assembled 6x6x6 cube , layer by layer , with each of the 8 pieces enumerated :
112222 112222 662222 662222 666668 666668 112222 112222 662222 662222 666668 666668 332222 332222 332222 666222 666668 666668 332222 332222 332222 777222 777555 777555 333334 333555 333555 777555 777555 777555 333334 333555 333555 777555 777555 777555
Thanks ,
Don , for the additional solution .

The KOffice team is extremely pleased to finally announce version 2.0.0 of KOffice .
This release marks the end of more than 3 years of work to port KOffice to Qt 4 and the KDE 4 libraries and , in some cases , totally rewrite the engine of the KOffice applications .
Over the last few years , the KOffice team has reworked the framework into an agile and flexible codebase .
Our intention was to increase integration between the components of KOffice , decrease duplication of functionality and ease maintenance and development of new features .
Furthermore , new approaches to UI design and interacting with the user have been implemented to support the new capabilities .
This is the first release -- we call it a " Platform Release " -- of a long series , much like KDE 4.0 laid the groundwork for what is now a fully mature desktop environment .
The developers have so far concentrated on creating a flexible and powerful foundation that we can build on for a long time .
Targeted Audience
Our goal for now is to release a first preview of what we have accomplished .
This release is mainly aimed at developers , testers and early adopters .
It is not aimed at end users , and we do not recommend Linux distributions to package it as the default office suite yet .
KOffice 2.0 will be useful for some users , but since it is the first release in a long series it is likely to contain bugs and incompatibilities .
It is noteworthy that KOffice 2.0 does not have all the features that KOffice 1.6 had .
These features will return in the upcoming versions 2.1 and 2.2 , in most cases better implemented and more efficient .
Also , not all applications which were part of KOffice 1.6 made it into KOffice 2.0 .
The missing applications will return in 2.1 or possible 2.2 .
Components
The release team has decided that the following applications are mature enough to be part of 2.0 :
KWord - Word processor
KSpread - Spreadsheet calculator
KPresenter - Presentation manager
KPlato - Project management software
Karbon - Vector graphics editor
Krita - Raster graphics editor
The chart application KChart is available as a shape plugin , which means that charts are available in all the KOffice applications in an integrated manner .
The desktop database creator Kexi and the formula shape are aimed to be available in version 2.1 .
Kivio , the flowchart editor , is currently without maintainer and it is not certain when or if it will be released .
Highlights of KOffice 2
KOffice 2 is a much more flexible application suite than KOffice 1 ever was .
The integration between the components is much stronger , with the revolutionary Flake Shapes as the central concept .
A Flake Shape can be as simple as a square or a circle or as complex as a chart or a music score .
With Flake , any KOffice application can handle any shape .
For instance , KWord can embed bitmap graphics , Krita can embed vector graphics and Karbon can embed charts .
This flexibility does not only give KOffice unprecedented integration , but also allows new applications to be created very easily .
Such applications can e.g. target special user groups like kids or certain professions .
Unified Look and Feel
All the applications of KOffice has a new GUI layout better suited to today 's wider screens .
The GUI consists of a workspace and a sidebar where tools can dock .
Any tool can be ripped off to create its own window and later be redocked fo full flexibility .
The users setup preferences are of course saved and reused the next time that KOffice is started .
Native Support for OpenDocument
The OASIS OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) is the ISO standard for office document interchange .
ODF has been selected as the national standard for many countries around the world , and continues to grow stronger every month .
KOffice uses the OpenDocument Format as its native format .
This will guarantee interoperability with many other Office packages such as OpenOffice.org and MS Office .
The KOffice team has representatives on the OASIS technical committee for ODF and has been a strong participant in the process of shaping ODF since
its inception .
Platform Independence
All of KOffice is available on Linux with KDE or GNOME , Windows and Macintosh .
Solaris will follow shortly and we expect builds for other Unix versions to become available soon after the final release .
It is possible that the release of binaries for Windows and Macintosh will occur after some time if other packages that KOffice depend on need more time .
Since KOffice builds on Qt and the KDE libraries , all applications integrate well with the respective platforms and will take on the native look and feel .
New Website
At the same time as the KOffice team releases its new version , there is also a new website designed by Alexandra Leisse .
It features a new look , and is built on Wordpress .
We hope that it will attract more people who are not developers so that we can build up a library of templates , add - ons , and user - generated documentation and tips - and - tricks .
Uefa has rejected Manchester United 's appeal against Darren Fletcher 's red card in the Champions League semi-final against Arsenal .
Fletcher was given a straight red for a professional foul on Arsenal 's Cesc Fábregas in the penalty area , but television replays have subsequently suggested that he got a clean touch on the ball .
Uefa also rejected Barcelona 's appeals against Eric Abidal 's dismissal and Dani Alves ' caution against Chelsea and all three will miss the Rome final on 27 May .
A statement from European football 's ruling body said : " Even if they had been admitted they would have been rejected as unfounded as there were no grounds for contesting the referees ' original decisions . "
Sir Alex Ferguson had not been confident about overturning the decision .
" We have to do it for Darren and sometimes in these situations , you never know , " he said .
" The referee made an honest decision . "
The committee 's decision can be appealed within three days but any such appeal would appear destined to fail .

There 's no need to describe the full purpose of the changes or how they work together .
If you think that a change calls for explanation , you 're probably right .
Please do explain it — but please put the explanation in comments in the code , where people will see it whenever they see the code .
For example , “ New function ” is enough for the change log when you add a function , because there should be a comment before the function definition to explain what it does .

I 've recently been watching GCC and GDB development , and every time I have reason to go looking through their commits , the total lack of useful information in the commit messages really strikes me .
Take this commit message for example , reproduced below for your convenience :
Okay , so quick quiz : what does this change do ?
Does it fix a bug ?
Add a feature ?
Cantell from this message ?
If you get lost in the useless meaningless text , well , me too .
What if instead of showing you that , I showed you this email and this email about an earlier part of the same change .
Is n't that much better ?
Would n't it be nice if I 'd shown you that to begin with ?
Before you think I 'm just picking on the maintainers of gdb , let me now point you to the GNU coding standards changelog guidelines , which they 're faithfully following .
Let 's think about this ... gdb ( and all the rest of the GNU projects ) are using a version control system .
Even one as poor as CVS can tell me that a function is new , when it was added , and who did it .
So exactly what value is putting " ( new_tty_postfork ) : New function . " in the changelog ?
Absolutely none .
Did I really need the author to tell me that a newfile was being included now ?
No , of course not , even if that might be interesting for some reason , it 's utterly obvious from the diff .
The GNU coding standard is being actively harmful here , by recommending that people put useless junk in the change message , instead of an explanation of the change .
It 's really rather unfortunate .
What do I want to see in a commit message ?
Well , it seems to me that basically everyone except the GNU project has this well figured out already , but :
At a high level : what does the change ( implementation ) , and what is it ( reason ) .
Include both a one - line summary of the change , and then some prose describing it in more detail .
Try to keep it high level : in most cases , the details about each individual thing you touched in your change is n't necessary .
I should be able to get that from the diff directly .
3D Realms , independent developer of theaction franchise , is closing its doors and its employees being let go , according to multiple industry sources .
News of the closure was first reported by Shacknews , with Gamasutra obtaining separate confirmation .
Sources told Gamasutra the studio will be fully shut down by the end of the week .
Formed over twenty years ago as Apogee Software and located in Garland , Texas , 3D Realms was privately owned and run by Scott Miller and George Broussard .
It served as developer of the three maingames and as publisher of many more .
For more than a decade , 3D Realms has notoriously been working on various iterations of , its sequel to the classic FPSwas announced in 1997 , and saw repeated delays .
In the last few years , news about the game began to emerge more frequently , and small screenshots and development tidbits were occasionally released .
Recently , 3D Realms also produced the twogames by Remedy Entertainment , published Human Head Studios ' , and broughtto Xbox Live Arcade .
Gamasutra has received a statement from Deep Silver and Apogee Software , the label recently resurrected by 3D Realms for its retro-flavored offerings .
The companies state that development of , a Nintendo DS and PSP platformer compilation of , is unaffected by today 's news .
Development of the trilogy is being handled by Frontline Studios .
In addition , Take - Two has released a statement to outlets including Shacknews , as follows : " We can confirm that our relationship with 3D Realms forwas a publishing arrangement , which did not include ongoing funds for development of the title .

Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner says he is prepared to oust the senior management and directors at banks that require extensive aid from the federal government .
“ If in the future , banks need exceptional assistance in order to get through this , then we will make sure that assistance comes , ” while ensuring that taxpayers are protected , Mr. Geithner said Sunday in an interview on “ Face the Nation ” on CBS .
“ Where that requires a change in management and the board , then we will do that . ”
Mr. Geithner said the chief executives of the American International Group , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been removed after it became clear the companies could not survive without government rescues .
The Treasury is reviewing how much capital the biggest financial companies would need to endure a severe economic downturn .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
In a year of fabulous frauds , the one that glitzy Manhattan attorney Marc Dreier has been charged with is in some ways the most fabulous of all .
Not the biggest , of course .
The biggest fraud of 2008 was metaphorical : the nation 's economy itself , which had been built upon house - of - cards financial products .
The most tragic fraud of the year was Bernie Madoff 's decades - long Ponzi scheme , which gulled charities , widows , and orphans out of tens of billions of dollars while whistleblowers blew themselves hoarse before deaf and dumb regulators .
Yet Dreier 's comparatively modest , alleged $ 700 million fraud , which left victims with $ 400 million in losses , was sui generis .
What differentiated it from the pack was that it was just so much more - well , we do n't want to use the precise word that comes to mind , but " brazen , " " cheeky , " and " cocky " begin to capture it .
While Madoff did his dirty work in seclusion behind locked doors , Dreier allegedly duped his victims with the theatrical , improvisational daring of a high - wire aerialist .
Despite the pain his crimes have wrought , a dark side in each of us cannot but admire the sheer nerve of the man .
( Think of Leonardo DiCaprio 's heroic impostor in the film " Catch Me If You Can . " )
According to prosecutors , for more than four years Dreier sold hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of bogus debt obligations to nearly 40 investment funds run by 13 of the nation 's most sophisticated asset managers , including the likes of Fortress Investment Group , Elliott Associates , and hedge funds later acquired by Perella Weinberg Partners and Blackstone Group .
Throughout its existence the scheme could have collapsed at any instant , if just one of dozens of duped hedge fund officials had ever run into real estate developer Sheldon Solow - the head of the duped company supposedly issuing most of the notes - at a cocktail party .
As Dreier dug himself ever deeper into criminality and debt , he resorted to ever more desperate measures to postpone the day of reckoning .
He and his accomplices talked their way past receptionists of companies they were n't affiliated with ; plopped themselves down in empty conference rooms ; and then hosted meetings at which they pretended to be people they were n't .
The scam succeeded for as long as it did because none of his victims could conceive that anyone of Dreier 's stature would act with such monumental recklessness , selfishness , and self - destructiveness .
Almost as an afterthought , Dreier is alleged to have filched about $ 40 million from his clients ' escrow accounts - including $ 10 million that he stole after his arrest before authorities could get a receiver appointed to seize control of his law firm and ambulance it into bankruptcy .
To the 260 innocent attorneys who toiled for him at Dreier LLP 's tony offices in Manhattan , Albany , N.Y. , Los Angeles , Pittsburgh , Santa Monica , and Stamford , Conn. , Dreier bequeathed unpaid salary checks , unreimbursed expenses , lapsed malpractice and health insurance policies , potential civil liability , and untold damage to reputations .
An attorney 's stock in trade is sound judgment and wise counsel .
" To have hitched one 's star to a thief , " as a lawyer for one of Dreier 's former partners puts it , is a stain that wo n't easily wash out .
Most of Dreier 's betrayed former colleagues did not return calls or e-mails , and all but one of those who did asked not to be identified .
Dreier is now under house arrest at his terraced condominium in Midtown Manhattan while awaiting disposition of federal wire fraud , securities fraud , and money - laundering charges that , according to federal prosecutors , merit a prison term of 30 years to life under sentencing guidelines .
Though Dreier has pleaded not guilty , he has filed affidavits in court that admit major portions of the accusations against him .
His heavy - duty criminal - defense attorney , Gerald Shargel - whose previous clients include bosses of four of New York 's five Mafia families - has acknowledged in court that he expects Dreier 's case to be " resolved " without trial within a month or two .
Dreier 's $ 40 million art collection ; his sleek , 121 - foot Heesen motor yacht ; his waterfront Hamptons mansion ; his Aston Martin , BMW , two Mercedes , four Yamaha WaveRunners , and every other gilded trophy he once flaunted are now frozen by court order , awaiting either forfeiture to the government or distribution among creditors .
Dreier appears to have only two remaining possessions of value , and it's unclear whether New York 's Son of Sam laws let him exploit them :
They are the book and movie rights to the unbelievable yarn that was his life until his arrest on Dec. 2 .
***
In March 2007 a Dreier LLP partner wanted to recruit matrimonial attorney Heidi Opinsky to join the firm .
So he took her to meet Marc Dreier at the firm 's New York City headquarters .
" You came into a very opulent , private entrance , " Opinsky recalls .
" Separate elevator bank , separate concierge .
It was like walking into a museum of modern art .
I 've never been in a law office that was like this .
It made you feel wonderful . "
Then things went downhill .
" All his little helpers escorted " her into Dreier 's office , she says , but Dreier himself she found to be outlandishly distracted and self - absorbed .
" He showed that kind of lack of interest where you can tell they 're in another world .
They 're not really hearing what you 're saying . "
When Opinsky got home , she says , she told her husband it had been like " going in to see the Wizard of Oz .
I got a feeling of smoke and mirrors .
I could n't put a handle on it . "
Opinsky did not join the firm .
Though others reacted to Dreier more positively , their accounts set the same harmonic overtones vibrating .
" I liked him , " says Joe Pastore , who headed Dreier 's Stamford office .
" He was kind and warm .
A very affable , capable , intelligent , charming guy .
Impeccably dressed . "
But Pastore adds sadly , " There was a distance I could never pierce through .
He 'd invite you to his house , but he would not come to your house and sit with your kids at a barbecue .
He had little interest in my life . "
Some days , like it or not , you need a lawyer .
For most business purposes , picking the right law firm is n’t usually that big of a deal .
Chances are you already have at least an idea of how to find a contract lawyer , a tax law specialist or a real - estate attorney .
But what if your programmers are using open - source code that ’s licensed under two different licenses ?
What if you ’re concerned with how a patent might affect open - source software your company is already using ?
Or let ’s say a company based in Utah decides that you ’ve put its proprietary code into Linux , who do you turn to then ?
Now , what should you be looking for in a law firm ?
Darn good question .
Here are some of the answers you ’ll need if you find yourself in a spot where you need someone who knows both IP ( intellectual property ) law and FOSS ( free and open source ) licensing .
John Ferrell , a founding partner of Silicon Valley IP law firm Carr & Ferrell , suggests that “ Finding a good lawyer is like finding any good professional .
Getting a referral is the tried and true , most reliable path to finding good help . ”
But what if you do n’t know anyone who can help ?
In that case , Daniel B. Ravicher of the SFLC ( Software Freedom Law Center ) and the the law firm of Moglen Ravicher admits that “ there are no pat answers .
As with choosing any service provider , clients should investigate their options , do background reviews , interview the potential service provider and then ultimately go with who they think is best for them . ”
“ Frequently , ” Ravicher added , “ issues like cost and location matter , as well as other idiosyncratic needs or wants of a particular client , so what might be the best choice for one is not necessarily going to be the best choice for another . ”
Ferrell agreed .
“ It ’s especially important to find the right individual to work with , not necessarily a specific firm , when working in a highly specialized area .
Find someone who fits your chemistry , and who has the time and interest to give you the level of service you need , ” he said .
Ferrell also recommended that you “ Look for domain expertise ; find a lawyer who represents other open - source companies like yours .
A background in computer science or engineering is often very helpful , but there are many good software experts who do not have formal programming training or experience .
Patent attorneys who practice in the computer area are very likely to have GPL experience and expertise . ”
Noted open - source lawyer Larry Rosen , a partner in the law firm Rosenlaw & Einschlag , also suggests that “ there is no way that a small firm can provide the wide range of services that are available at large firms .
But that ’s why some of us prefer being in small firms .
We can focus .
We can pay attention to details .
We can get intimate with our clients .
And we do n’t have to pay for large , paneled offices that clients do n’t want to visit anyway . ”
If a small firm ca n’t handle your particular problem on its own , that ’s no reason not to use it , said Rosen .
“ Those of us who specialize in intellectual property issues will generally be able to handle most legal problems related to copyrights , patents , trademarks and trade secrets–and the business matters that arise in those contexts–but for big cases or special things , we ’ll associate .
Just as in open - source communities , there are open - source lawyers who work together and help each other out in ways that can give clients the feel and security of a bigger firm without the overhead . ”
Pamela Jones , editor of the IP law news site Groklaw , notes that “ law is a specialty field .
By that I mean if you want to litigate you hire a litigator .
If you want to understand licenses , you find someone who does that .
They may or may not coincide .
The SFLC is Eben Moglen and Dan Ravicher , and he ’s been doing the litigating for SFLC recently over the GPL , and he ’s prevailed so far 100 percent .
So they have both . ”
“ If I was looking for a lawyer elsewhere , ” continued Jones , “ the first question to ask yourself is what kind of a problem is it ?
If it ’s trademark , for example , you need a different guy than if its patents .
Then I ’d research them as to their records .
Look for conflicts with what you care about .
Also look for how often they win / lose and what they specialize in within their specialty .
You can do that on Findlaw , among other places .
Google is your friend .
Local newspapers ’ archives can help you , too .
Word of mouth is a good way to find a lawyer , of course , too . ”
Patents are something of a special case according to Mark Webbink , former Red Hat general counsel and now the Executive Director , Center for Patent Innovations at New York Law School .
“ As I often tell folks while I am talking about open source , patents do n’t care what your licensing model is [ open source or binary - only ] , they only care whether they are infringed , ” said Webbink .
If the charge being leveled against you that one of your products has infringed a patent , “ It is not necessary , for trial purposes , that such legal counsel have any particular expertise in open source .
Most such trial counsel will be sufficiently familiar with open source to be able to assess whether there are any special damages issues raised because the code is open source [ e.g. , if the threatened party has been redistributing the open - source code , they may have exposure for downstream infringement ] , ” said Webbink .
“ Where open - source counsel becomes more important is in any settlement / licensing discussions with the plaintiff , ” continued Webbink .
“ Depending on the open - source license covering the allegedly infringing software , settlement may be more or less challenging .
Non-restrictive open - source licenses , such as BSD and MIT , will not pose any particular problem .
Others , such as the Common Public License or Mozilla Public License expressly address patents , including third - party patents .
The toughest area will be software licensed under the GPL or LGPL , regardless of what version of those licenses .
In those instances , defendants will want to avail themselves of legal services well versed in those licenses to make sure that any settlement they reach will not cause them to be out of compliance with the license .
Of course , if they are not redistributing the GPL or LGPL software , this is not a major issue . ”
Finally , Ferrell recommends that , “ Once you identify a candidate lawyer , ask simple questions about your issues .
For example , ‘ What are some of the pitfalls of using open - source software in my product development ? ’
Or , ‘ How will the GPL affect IP rights I might wish to claim in my own proprietary development ? ’
Or my favorite , ‘ What ’s GNU with you ? ' ”

Hooray !
The banking crisis is over !
Let ’s party !
O.K. , maybe not .
In the end , the actual release of the much - hyped bank stress tests on Thursday came as an anticlimax .
Everyone knew more or less what the results would say : some big players need to raise more capital , but over all , the kids , I mean the banks , are all right .
Even before the results were announced , Tim Geithner , the Treasury secretary , told us they would be “ reassuring . ”
But whether you actually should feel reassured depends on who you are : a banker , or someone trying to make a living in another profession .
I wo n’t weigh in on the debate over the quality of the stress tests themselves , except to repeat what many observers have noted : the regulators did n’t have the resources to make a really careful assessment of the banks ’ assets , and in any case they allowed the banks to bargain over what the results would say .
A rigorous audit it was n’t .
But focusing on the process can distract from the larger picture .
What we ’re really seeing here is a decision on the part of President Obama and his officials to muddle through the financial crisis , hoping that the banks can earn their way back to health .
By Bob Beckel - May 19 , 2009
Did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi step into a political quagmire during her press conference on the Bush Administration 's torture tactics ?
Yes .
Will President Obama 's agenda lose momentum now that this " who said what and when " drama will suck oxygen out of the presidents tailwind ?
Almost certainly .
Will there now be some type of independent commission established to investigate the treatment of war prisoners during the Bush / Cheney reign ?
Count on it .
Who will suffer the greatest political damage from all this ?
Without question the Republican Party .
Watching Republicans rush to the microphones after the Pelosi press conference last Thursday to salivate over the speaker 's performance , I was reminded of the somber parade of GOP House members as they made the walk from the House to the Senate carrying the Articles of Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton .
In their hands they held what they surely believed to be a weapon that would doom the Clinton Presidency and insure election year victories solidifying Republican majorities .
More from RCP - In Depth : Top 10 Most Corrupt Politicians in U.S. History
More from RCP - In Depth : 10 Senators Who Snagged the Most Pork in This Year 's Spending
That was 1998 .
What unfolded that year was ; the exoneration of Clinton in the Senate ; a massive public revulsion against Republicans for pursuing such a ridiculous pogrom ; the loss of GOP seats in the House and Senate ; and the ouster of House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
Will Republicans never learn ?
Do they really believe that Middle America cares about what Nancy Pelosi knew and when she knew it ?
If so they will be in for a stunning lesson in the old " be careful what you ask for " school of dumb desires .
For those few Republicans who do understand the potential for blow back from such an investigation and do n't want it , the issue is settled .
There will be an investigative body established by an act of Congress .
But it will be the majority Democrats who will define the parameters of the investigation .
Of necessity that will include Pelosi 's involvement but the scope will be much , much broader if for no other reason than to dilute the impact of the Speaker 's exposure .
The mandate will insure that everything from secret CIA prisons in foreign countries , to the tortured legal rational by Bush / Cheney lawyers on the dubious legality of waterboarding ; to Dick Cheney 's public statements about an Iraqi nuclear program and Iraqi involvement in 9/11 ; to Bush Administration members who will testify that no WMD were in Iraq before the war ; to the FBI 's insistence that what helpful intelligence did come from captured terrorists was in hand before waterboarding and enhanced investigation tactics were employed ; and much more .
By the time this investigation is concluded ( probably as campaign 2010 heats up ) Nancy Pelosi 's briefing history will be a footnote to a scathing report on the Bush / Cheney attempts at fabricating or creating intelligence to justify the war in Iraq .
What 's more , for the length of the investigation the most public figure will not be Nancy Pelosi but rather Dick Cheney , arguably the most unpopular politician in America .
His presence will only remind Americans of the Bush Administration , indisputably the most unpopular Administration in the past fifty years .
What Pelosi knew and when she knew it is only interesting to the base of the Republican Party .
That base has already shrunk to a dangerously low percentage of voters ( between 20 and 25 percent according to some polls ) .
With numbers that small Republicans could qualify for Affirmative Action Grants under civil rights law .
There 's no reason to assume , however , that the Republicans will shy away from this suicide course .
The Clinton impeachment was only one example of the Republican penchant for self inflicted political wounds .
Their pursuit of Pelosi now has the potential to exact even more pain on an already wounded GOP .
History tells us that the party out of power picks up Congressional seats in midterm elections .
The Republican desire to revisit the Bush years may well insure history , in this case , does not repeat itself .
Instead of acting like a minority party and raising policy alternatives to President Obama 's far reaching initiatives , the GOP has decided that opening the wounds of the Bush Administration to topple Speaker Pelosi is somehow smart politics .
Certainly there will be some damage done to the Obama agenda simply because an investigation of this magnitude could well push Obama 's initiatives off the front pages but only for a brief time .
Most Republicans on the Hill believe pursuing Pelosi is smart politics .
It 's not , and it may well be political suicide .
In the end Nancy Pelosi might get a black eye from all of this , but the Republicans will end up in the intensive care unit on their continuing journey toward political flat lining .

A new president 's first months should be a showcase for his own policies .
But as Barack Obama nears completion next week of his first 100 days in office , the headlines are dominated by a controversy entirely of his predecessor 's making : the Bush administration 's use of what the rest of the Western world regards as torture against detainees in the " war on terror " .
The argument came to the boil last week as Mr Obama ordered the release of secret Justice Department memos setting out the methods used against al - Qa'ida suspects in the minutest detail .
This week new developments raised the temperature further .
It now emerges that waterboarding , the technique almost universally deemed to be torture , far from being employed extremely rarely , had in fact been applied no less than 266 times to two leading al - Qa'ida detainees .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Meanwhile , the Senate Armed Services Committee released a report indicating that the previous administration explicitly approved the harsh tactics used by military interrogators at Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo Bay , as well as those employed by the CIA at its " ghost camps " and elsewhere .
The report also suggests that the Pentagon and the CIA were readying these new " torture " techniques months before the memos that gave them their blessing .
Now Mr Obama himself is at the centre of the crossfire .
Liberals , human rights groups , not to mention the overwhelming majority of Democrats in Congress demand a full reckoning .
But the right accuses him of indulging what the Wall Street Journal 's editorial pages – that daily bible of conservatives – call " the liberal mob " bent on score settling , and refusing to recognise how harsh interrogation had kept the country safe since 9/11 .
Only last weekend Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , was re-iterating what his boss was saying even before he was inaugurated .
A new administration meant a new beginning .
It was time to " move on " and , Mr Emanuel indicated , the former White House and Justice Department officials who formulated the policy , as well as the CIA operatives who had carried them out , should not be prosecuted .
But on Tuesday Mr Obama seemed to shift his position .
After a meeting in the Oval Office , he confirmed that agency staff who had conducted the " enhanced interrogation " sessions should not face charges .
But he left open the possibility that the lawyers who drew up the justificatory memos might be punished .
The final word , he indicated , would rest with Eric Holder , the Attorney - General .
If so , that would not be good news for Steven Bradbury , John Yoo , and Jay Bybee , the three senior former Justice Department officials who were prime architects of the so - called legal " new paradigm " allowing techniques akin to torture , and whose signatures appear on the memos .
Mr Holder has been uncompromising in the belief that those responsible for torture be brought to account .
But their criminal prosecution would create a new thicket of legal issues .
Evidence has emerged that some of the memos were written after the tough new methods had started to be used – in other words raising the question of whether the lawyers were trying to justify practices that they knew were illegal .
In which case , human rights advocates ask , why should not the topmost figures in that administration – ex-vice president Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , defence secretary until 2006 , and the former CIA chief George Tenet for instance – face criminal action as well ?

This would meet one of the main criticisms of the Bush response to Abu Ghraib – how a few small fry had been punished while those in high places , who had given the green light to the brutal treatment of inmates , had escaped scot - free .
At the very least , exhaustive further investigation of the torture issue is inevitable .
One possibility is a bipartisan commission , modelled on the 9/11 Commission which delivered a comprehensive report on the September 2001 terrorist attacks .
Another is a US equivalent of South Africa 's post - apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission , to which victims would testify , as well as those responsible for the alleged torture , under promise of immunity from prosecution .
Whatever happens , the controversy will not quickly fade .
Mr Obama himself once opposed a formal inquiry on the grounds it would generate more heat than light .
Now , however , he supports one .
At the same time , Dianne Feinstein , Democratic head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , is planning a lengthy and " unvarnished " closed - door inquiry that may take six months or more .
And more revelations are almost certain , perhaps throwing light on the great unanswered question : do such " enhanced interrogation " techniques actually work ?
Dennis Blair , Mr Obama 's new intelligence chief , said in a statement released on Tuesday that " in some instances " they had generated " valuable " leads .
But , he added , it was impossible to know whether the information might have been produced by more standard methods .
Beyond doubt , moreover , any benefits had been outweighed by the damage to the country 's international image , he said .
Now none other than Mr Cheney , dark eminence of the Bush administration and its most strenuous advocate of secrecy , is urging the publication of intelligence gleaned .
" There are reports showing specifically what we gained as a result of these activities , " he told the conservative - leaning Fox News .
They had not been declassified but now they should be , he said , to set the record straight .
Pressed on Mr Cheney 's remarks at a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday , Hillary Clinton , the Secretary of State , described Mr Cheney as " not a particularly reliable source of information " .
But " we ought to get to the bottom of this matter , " she said , without committing herself to publishing the documents , as suggested by the former vice - president .
Under interrogation : Obama 's sticky wicket
April 08
Asked about an inquiry into Bush officials who may have approved torture , candidate Obama says he would ask his new Attorney General to " immediately review the information that 's already there " .
August 08 " If crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , " Obama says , adding : " I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we 've got too many problems to solve . "
January 09
After one day in office , President Obama bans " enhanced " interrogation techniques , but talks about the " need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards " .
16 April 09 Obama announces release of memos but says " those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice ... will not be subject to prosecution " .
21 April 09 Door opens to prosecution of Bush officials .
" I would say that that is going to be more of a decision for the Attorney General ... and I do n't want to prejudge that . "

Overhearing their neighbours in the next flat plotting to hold up a group of out - of - their - depth drug growers , our heros decide to stitch up the robbers in turn .
In a way the confusion really starts when a pair of antique double - barrelled shotguns go missing in a completely different scam .

May 9th was observed as " Victory Day " in Russia and ( to varying degrees ) many former Eastern Bloc countries .
Commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany 64 years ago , in 1945 , Victory Day is both a day of remembrance and recently , for the Russian government , an opportunity to revive the nation 's armed forces and global clout .
Upwards of 27 million Soviets , both military and civilian , lost their lives in World War II , between 1941 and 1945 , and the impact of that conflict still reverberates strongly .
Collected here are photos of the recent Victory Day Parade in Moscow , and several other observances in former Eastern Bloc countries .

The continuing saga of AIG 's taxpayer funded bonuses may be eclipsed by another company 's incompetence ; Merrill Lynch is ready and willing according to the New York Times :
Merrill Lynch 's $ 3.6 billion bonus pool has been among the most controversial payouts on Wall Street .
But most of those bonuses , which included some 700 awards of over $ 1 million , would not be affected by a new bonus tax being considered in Congress .
The tax , which passed in the House on Thursday , would affect only bonuses paid during 2009 .
Typically , Merrill 's bonuses are paid in January , along with the rest of Wall Street's .
But the investment bank pushed $ 2.5 billion of the bonuses out the door in December in advance of its merger with Bank of America .
Source : New York Times
Without making any judgment with regard to the ethical payout of these bonuses , the legal argument is clearly supportive of Merrill 's intentions .
The creation of new law will be required to prevent , or inhibit the payout of these contractually obligated bonuses ; but the creation of these new laws could establish dangerous precedents .
The new administration has clearly stated their intent to limit these bonus , and it may possible for the President to directly intervene without Congress ' assistance .
Based upon our Friday article , it is still possible for Obama to abuse his Executive power to detain any person who " substantially supported " terrorists ; the term used by the Bush Administration was " Enemy Combatant . "
Using the evidence presented by Bush 's Government in the Rapp Declaration it becomes clear that the term " Enemy Combatant " encompassed financial terrorism ; this nomenclature would then translate to " substantially supported " financial terrorists under the Obama Administration 's new characterization .
Before we continue , it is important to understand what the term " terrorist " actually encompasses ; as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary :
[ a. F. terroriste , f. L. terror TERROR : see - IST . ]
1 . As a political term : a . Applied to the Jacobins and their agents and partisans in the French Revolution , esp. to those connected with the Revolutionary tribunals during the " Reign of Terror " .
b.
Any one who attempts to further his views by a system of coercive intimidation .
In early use also applied spec. to members of one of the extreme revolutionary societies in Russia .
The term now usually refers to a member of a clandestine or expatriate organization aiming to coerce an established government by acts of violence against it or its subjects .
2 . Dyslogistically : One who entertains , professes , or tries to awaken or spread a feeling of terror or alarm ; an alarmist , a scaremonger .
3 . attrib .
Hence terro'ristic , -' ristical adjs . , characterized by or practising terrorism ; also terro'ristically .
Source : Oxford English Dictionary
Using the above bolded , definition one could argue that the large institutional banks coerced the Government into providing large payouts in an attempt to remedy the terror invoked as a result of selfish financial management .
If the Obama Administration is serious about recouping the taxpayer funded bonuses , Obama , as President , could declare any recipient of these taxpayer funded bonuses an accomplice to financial terrorists .
While I doubt my previous train of thought passes legal muster , a move of that magnitude may finally force TARP funded bonus recipients , and their respective companies , to realize that the entire financial scenario is " not a fucking game . "
If the individual agrees to return the bonus money , Obama could simply repeal or pardon his detention order .
the skeptic ’s checklist of internet woo
Do n't you wish there was a handy checklist to quickly and easily detect junk science online ?
Well , you 're in luck ...
One of the best things about the web is how easily and quickly it can disseminate good information to almost every corner of the world .
As long as you have electricity , a phone line and a computer , you have access to an enormous wealth of great science and sound facts .
But the same ability to educate and inform can be used to promote pseudoscience , quackery and wild conspiracy theories .
Without the power of the web , the panic over December 21 , 2012 would be far more subdued and the anti-vaccination movement would n’t be able to get as many followers as easily as it did .
And this means that today , when you ’re trying to research something on the web , being able to tell legitimate information from woo published by countless cranks is a must have skill .
Unfortunately , pinpointing pseudoscience can sometimes be more of an art than well … a science , especially when you ’re not an expert on the topic and the woo is carefully wrapped in scientific terms .
So when a reader jokingly mentioned using an internet kook checklist of sorts , I thought it may be useful to propose an actual checklist that can be used to identify bad science and internet cranks , regardless of how well they try to seem like legitimate researchers or subject matter experts .
So next time you come across a website you ’re just not sure what to make of , check if you can see two or more of the following telltale signs …
appeals to conspiracy
The author is n’t just making bold claims about alternative medicine or UFOs .
He really would show you all the evidence you could ever want but sadly , this “ disruptive knowledge ” is being suppressed by drug companies , the government or the Illuminati .
And if the evidence is out there but just does n’t seem to add up , it ’s because the same cover - up is manufacturing fake studies to discredit the author ’s thesis .
pretending to challenge a “ scientific orthodoxy ”
If you ’re reading a sensational claim about chemistry , physics or biology and wonder why it ’s not backed up by studies in peer reviewed scientific journals or has n’t even been submitted to one , it ’s because the findings are too threatening to the current scientific orthodoxy and would be doomed in review as cabals of evil scientists bury it in order to keep the status quo .
The fact that scientists make their careers and win Nobel Prizes on the sort of research that challenges the established mainstream consensus is discarded in the world of woo .
using lots of technobabble
A good way to cover up pseudoscience is with lots and lots of jargon or words that sound as if they ’re scientific terms , which is why a lot of cranks use this method to seem like experts .
If they really understand the concept , they should be able to explain it in plain language rather than send you scrambling for a dictionary or looking up terminology that does n’t seem to exist outside of the site in question .
Of course , sometimes , a concept is so advanced , it ca n’t be explained in everyday terms so look for a reference or independent confirmation .
appeals to a spiritual authority
When a theory involves magic or angels or gods , it ’s not really a theory .
There ’s a reason why scientists do n’t draw a circle and light candles during the vernal equinox while chanting incantations over their experiments .
liberally applying reductionism
There are questions science can’t answer yet and if you ask why or how long enough , you ’ll eventually hit one of those questions .
And therein comes the difference between scientists and cranks .
Scientists will try to find out the truth .
Cranks will make something up and state it as fact .
using vague or misleading quotes
You can try this at home with your friends or loved ones .
Make up a wild claim , find a scientific study which has a sentence that ’s vague enough to sound supportive of your claim while taken out of context , and after reciting the wild claim , throw in the reference .
The fact that the study might be talking about something completely and totally opposite or that the sentence was an example of a hypothesis its authors considered flawed , should n’t bother you .
You can claim a reference from a peer reviewed journal and that ’s that .
Congratulations , you have just passed Woo Citing 201 and know how some Young Earth Creationists have references to such journals as Nature , Science and Astrophysics for some of their most outlandish arguments .
appealing to personal experience
Your experience is great for certain things .
It helps you do your job faster and more efficiently .
It gives you a leg up on someone who does n’t know what you already do .
It can even earn you respect .
But is it a substitute for a thorough , meticulous application of the scientific method , especially in a field where you lack credentials ?
No .
So next time you feel like browsing the web and come across something suspicious , feel free to use this little checklist and grade the level of woo you find .
If you find a website which shows all seven signs , please give a link because I ’d like to know what a truly clinical case looks like …

I 've been experimenting a bit with CouchDB recently .
I 've been really impressed with how quickly it lets you get started ; interacting with it always feels obvious .
I 've spent enough time doing web apps to get tired of how everyone always jumps straight to the unholy combination of a relational database system and object - relational mapper whenever they need any persistence .
( When all you have is a hammer ... )
So using CouchDB with a functional language is a breath of fresh air .
Putting together a CouchDB adapter in Clojure is really a matter of no more than a page worth of code once you 've got an HTTP client , so it 's left as an exercise to the reader .
Since functional languages encourage working closer to your core data types ( which have clear mappings to JSON ) there 's very little cognitive overhead when it comes to using Couch for persistence .
Last week while I was in Portland I put together a client written in Elisp called relax.el .
This lets you browse Couch databases from the comfort of Emacs .
It also lets you edit documents straight from an Emacs buffer , which is much more convenient than using the browser 's text tools from Futon .
There are a few quirks with regard to pagination , ( just press g if it gets messed up ) but it 's pretty useful as it is .
It should be in ELPA soon , so M-x knock - yourself - out .

In the April issue of Playboy Magazine , Shia LaBeouf shares the story of when he lost his virginity four years ago at the age of 18 in a hotel in Montreal , Canada .
He says :
“ For some reason , I was trying to portray myself as a man who had done it ( had sex ) many times in the past .
I did n’t tell the girl I was a virgin .
I was all , ‘ Do n’t worry , babe .
I ’m gonna handle it tonight . ’
And meanwhile I was shaking in my boots .
Getting naked was very strange .
It was the first time I ’d been naked in the light , in front of a girl , with no hiding place .
It became apparent pretty quickly that I did n’t know what the fuck I was doing .
Somewhere in her mind she had to know .
I remember laying her on the bed and putting a pillow underneath her because I had seen that in a porn movie …
( It ) put her at a weird angle , where I could n’t get in correctly .
I ’m not extremely well - endowed … and clearly this was n’t the move to do . ”
Gangsters in Blue
In an earlier weekly commentary piece , I argued that the enormous sums of black market money created by the drug war led to the proliferation of gangs — and turned local police forces into just another kind of gang fighting to control the drug money .
Anyone suspecting me of hyperbole only need read the news .
One need n’t go far for examples of thuggish , ganglike police behavior .
Police lie and plant evidence to cover up their lawlessness , to manufacture “ probable cause ” for fishing expeditions against those they “ know ” are guilty , or to justify civil forfeiture of goodies they covet .
Witness police attempts to plant drugs in the home of Katherine Johnson , an elderly woman murdered by a SWAT raid gone bad , in order to cover their tracks .
The LAPD Ramparts Division routinely engaged in unprovoked beatings and shootings , stole narotics and dealt them themselves , and planted evidence to conceal their crimes .
The Philadelphia police engaged in similar evidence planting .
A simple Google search finds allegations of systematic planting of evidence in Huntington Beach , Atlanta , New York , Omaha , and St. Louis–all on the first page of the search results .
Police , like other gangs , terrorize the populations under their jurisdiction in order to secure obedience and maintain unquestioned rule over their “ turf . ”
A Cato Institute study on police militarization quoted urban police on deliberate shows of force in inner cities to intimidate the local population : “ We send out two , two - to - four - men cars , we look for minor violations and do jump - outs , either on people on the street or automobiles .
After we jump - out the second car provides periphery cover with an ostentatious display of weaponry .
We ’re sending a clear message : if the shootings do n’t stop , we ’ll shoot someone . ”
Recently Homer , La. Police Chief Russell Mills was quoted as saying : “ If I see three or four young black men walking down the street , I have to stop them and check their names .
I want them to be afraid every time they see the police that they might get arrested . ”
Police , like other gangs , use terror to intimidate “ snitches . ”
A Queens bar owner , Eduardo Espinosa , suffers police harassment because he implicated police for framing suspects in a fake sting operation : “ Every two to three weeks , there ’s cops in here , searching the bar .
If there ’s no violation , they ’ll make it up .
I lost all my clients — everybody ’s scared to come in my place right now . ”
Police in Pickerington , Ohio organized a public pressure campaign to intimidate a character witness , high school principal Scott Reeves , who vouched for the character of a man who shot at a SWAT team he mistook for armed robbers .
The “ Rate - My - Cop ” website was created as a national public database , compiling publicly available records to enable people to compare the performance of police forces and individual police officers across the country when it came to such issues as police brutality , corruption , etc .
So naturally police unions across the country began screaming to have the site shut down .
During Police Week in 2007 , a D.C. resident collected 48 hours of footage of police misconduct , including public drunkenness and disorder , public urination , throwing empty liquor bottles on church property , and driving segways with open containers of alcohol .
Naturally , D.C. police stood by and watched it all happen , and refused to respond to complaints .
And when the heroic citizen posted the footage to YouTube , naturally he received numerous anonymous death threats from people who identified themselves as police .
Police , like other gangs , prey upon those living on their “ turf . ”
Consider , for example , the recent story of Philadelphia police cutting the lines to surveillance cameras in immigrant - owned shops , and then helping themselves to snacks , alcohol , and cigarettes — not to mention cash from the till .
Fellow C4SS commentator Thomas Knapp recently cited Aaron Russo ’s litmus test for whether we live in a police state .
Imagine yourself driving normally , under the speed limit , when a cop pulls in behind you and begins to tail you through several turns .
Are you reassured that you ’re being protected and served , and gratified to know that your city ’s finest are on the job ?
Or do you get nervous and start wondering what you did wrong , overcome with dread that you ’re about to get pulled over for some unknown offense ?
If your reaction is the latter , you ’re living in a police state .

Dramatically backlit dust in giant galaxy
A new Hubble image highlights striking swirling dust lanes and glittering globular clusters in oddball galaxy NGC 7049 .
The NASA / ESA 's Hubble Space Telescope has captured this image of NGC 7049 , a mysterious looking galaxy on the border between spiral and elliptical galaxies .
NGC 7049 is found in the constellation of Indus , and is the brightest of a cluster of galaxies , a so - called Brightest Cluster Galaxy ( BCG ) .
Typical BCGs are some of the oldest and most massive galaxies .
They provide excellent opportunities for astronomers to study the elusive globular clusters lurking within .
The globular clusters in NGC 7049 are seen as the sprinkling of small faint points of light in the galaxy ’s halo .
The halo – the ghostly region of diffuse light surrounding the galaxy – is composed of myriads of individual stars and provides a luminous background to the remarkable swirling ring of dust lanes surrounding NGC 7049 's core .
Globular clusters are very dense and compact groupings of a few hundreds of thousands of stars bound together by gravity .
They contain some of the first stars to be produced in a galaxy .
NGC 7049 has far fewer such clusters than other similar giant galaxies in very big , rich groups .
This indicates to astronomers how the surrounding environment influenced the formation of galaxy halos in the early Universe .
The image was taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble , which is optimised to hunt for galaxies and galaxy clusters in the remote and ancient Universe , at a time when our cosmos was very young .
The constellation of Indus , or the Indian , is one of the least conspicuous in the southern sky .
It was named in the 16th century by Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from observations made by Dutch navigator Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Dutch explorer Frederick de Houtman .

The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA .

Donald Trump to Decide Carrie Prejean 's Fate Trump to announce Tuesday whether Carrie Prejean can keep her crown .
May 11 , 2009  --
Like past beauty queens , B - list celebrities and would - be business moguls , the fate of Miss California Carrie Prejean rests in the hands of Donald Trump .
At a press conference Monday , Shanna Moakler and Keith Lewis , co-directors of Miss California USA , said Trump , the co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization , will make the call on whether the scandal - scarred beauty queen gets to keep her crown .
Lewis and Moakler also unveiled a new PSA promoting the Miss California USA organization and appointed the pageant 's first runner up , Tami Farrell , the organization 's ambassador , effectively negating Prejean 's role as the face of Miss California USA .
Lewis asserted he wants to move on from Prejean and " get back to the business of beauty . "
Trump is scheduled to hold a press conference regarding Prejean in New York Tuesday .
" If Miss California is unavailable , or if it would be unwise to put her in a specific appearance , we now have an ambassador to represent us , " Lewis said , explaining his reasons for appointing Farrell ambassador .
" We 've been hijacked at the moment ; we 've been unable to do the work at hand . "
Lewis and Moakler added that Prejean has missed Miss California USA appearances since participating in the Miss USA 2009 pageant , despite the fact that she 's found time to travel the country talking about her views on marriage .
Prejean , 21 , started a media sensation when she spoke out against " opposite marraige " at the 2009 Miss USA pageant in April .
Prejean came under further scrutiny last week after semi-nude photos of her purportedly taken when she was a teenager emerged .
Her contract contains a clause that asks participants whether they have conducted themselves " in accordance with the highest ethical and moral standards . "
For example , it asks if they have ever been photographed nude or partially nude .
The beauty queen may also have violated her contract by working for a group that opposes gay marriage and making publicly speaking out against it .
Last week , pageant officials said they were looking into whether Prejean violated the 12 - page contract all contestants are required to sign before the November state contest .
The document prohibits whoever holds the title of Miss California from making personal appearances , granting interviews or making commercials without permission from pageant officials and gives the pageant 's directors the right to revoke her crown for breaching any of the document 's provisions .
Since being chosen runner - up at the Miss USA 2009 pageant , Prejean has made televised appearances at her San Diego church and on behalf of the National Organization for Marriage , a group that is opposed to same - sex marriage .
An advertisement the group created based on Prejean 's controversial answer at the Miss USA pageant about whether she supported gay marriage remains on the NOM Web site , despite a written request from the Miss Universe Organization , which owns the Miss USA pageant , to remove it .
It 's not the first time Trump will have to make the call on whether a scandalized beauty queen gets to keep her title .
He faced a similar situation in 2006 , when Miss USA Tara Conner came under scrutiny for reports of underage drinking and inappropriate behavior at bars .
Trump ended up letting her keep her crown provided she go to rehab .
Prejean Attempts to Defend Herself
In April , when Prejean was in Washington to announce her support for the new ad , Keith Lewis , co-director of the California contest , expressed concern to The Associated Press .
" There is a contract that all participants sign that is very involved and very intricate and limits a lot of their activities , " Lewis told the news agency .
Prejean 's spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the possible breach of contract .
On Tuesday , Prejean said in a statement obtained by The Associated Press that the Web site which posted the semi-nude photo and claims to have others is trying to belittle her religion .
She says the photos , which were taken of her as a teenager , had been released " surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith . "
In the statement , Prejean also says the attacks on her and others who " speak in defense of traditional marriage " are intolerant and offensive .
She also defended the photos : " I am a Christian , and I am a model .
Models pose for pictures , including lingerie and swimwear photos . "
NOM President Maggie Gallagher also defended Prejean and said the picture did not disqualify her as a traditional marriage advocate .
" Of course Carrie is not perfect , " Gallagher said in a statement Tuesday to the AP .
" On a personal note , as a former unwed mother , I want to say to Americans :
You do n't have to be a perfect person to have the right to stand up for marriage . "
Trump also came to Prejean 's defense last week .
Appearing on ABC's " The View " last Tuesday , he said her answer to the question of gay marriage posed during the televised pageant was not so far off base .
" That 's the belief of 70 percent of the people , so it was n't a horrible answer , " he told the women on " The View . "
" That was her belief and she 's taken hard hits .
She 's more famous because of it .
No one is talking about the young woman who won .
Nobody knows who she is . "
Trump also said , contrary to popular belief , Prejean 's answer did not cost her the title .
" We went back and added up the scores , " he said , " and she would not have won anyway .
So that makes me feel better because it was a tough question . "
Miss California's New Role
In April , Prejean told NBC's " Today " show that she was going to Washington to work with the National Organization for Marriage , saying the union between a man and a woman is " something that is very dear to my heart . "
While Prejean was talking about her values , others were dropping bombshells about her body .
Moakler , co-executive director of the Miss California Organization , confirmed to " Access Hollywood " that the group paid for Prejean 's breast implants weeks before she competed in the 2009 Miss USA pageant .
" It was something that we all spoke about together , " Moakler said referring to herself , Carrie Prejean and Keith Lewis , who also serves as co-executive director for the organization .
" It was an option and she wanted it .
And we supported that decision . "
The beauty queen 's family voiced their support for her following the Miss USA pageant .
" Considering what she was going through , the circumstances of being put on the spot , given such a short amount of time to think and respond … she said what she felt in her heart would be the best answer , " Christina Prejean , Carrie 's 22 - year - old sister , told ABCNews.com .
" She and I have talked about this subject ; we both respect each other 's views .
I support civil unions that would give same sex couples equal , legal rights and privileges . "
At the pageant , Prejean seemed initially tongue - tied answering to judge Perez Hilton 's question before saying that marriage should be between a man and a woman , drawing a mixed reaction from the audience and a look of thinly veiled disgust from Hilton .
In the days afterward , Prejean attempted to quell criticism of her marriage views by saying that her sister is a gay activist .
" My sister is a second lieutenant in the Air Force and she is a gay rights activist , " Prejean told " Access Hollywood " last week , adding that Christina is not gay .
" She supports gay people , she supports gay marriage .
My beliefs have nothing to do with my sister or my mom , or whatever . "
Christina Prejean admitted she was surprised to hear the beauty queen call her a gay activist .
" I have never even given myself that title .
I was kind of surprised that she mentioned it , but I think she wanted to get the point across that our family is tolerant , " Christina Prejean said , adding that she only recently got involved in gay rights activism .
" A couple weeks back , I attended a public forum in Idaho about protecting the LGBT community against discrimination , " she continued .
" That was the very first thing I attended , and I told her about it on the night of the pageant , after she said she felt bad that people might be offended by her response . …
But that 's obviously such a hot topic that either way , someone was going to be offended . "
While we argue that tossing the “ gay ” label onto historical figure is problematic , this does n’t mean that the gay identity was a solely 20th Century invention , or that gay history starts with Stonewall .
Meet some of the gay and lesbian forebearers who fought for your rights .
Karl Heinrich Ulrichs
Possibly the very first person to “ come out , ” in 1867 Hanoverian Karl Heinrich Ulrichs went before the Congress of German Jurists in Munich asking for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws .
He was shouted down , but spent the rest of his life writing about and advocating for gay rights ( though his preferred term was “ Urning ” derived from Plato ’s Symposium ) .
It ’s fascinating to look back at the arguments he makes , for they are the same as the ones we make today .
Take this small bit from 1870 ’s Araxes : A Call to Free the Nature of the Urning from the Penal Law :
“ The prohibition of the expression of the sex drive , i.e. , between consenting adults in private , lies outside the legal sphere .
All grounds for legal prosecution are lacking in this case .
Legislators are hindered from doing this by human rights and the principle of the constitutional state .
The legislator is hindered by the laws of justice , which forbid applying a double standard .
As long as the Urning respects guidelines [ against the seduction of male minors , violation of civil rights ( by force , threat , abuse of unconscious people , etc. ) , and public indecency ) , the legislator may not prohibit him from following the rightful law of nature to which he is subject . ”
George Cecil Ives
Presaging Act Up ! by more then a century , Englishman George Cecil Ives fought for “ The Cause ” of homosexual rights and , believing that they could never be achieved in open society formed the secret Order of Chaeronea , named after the battle where the Sacred Band of Thebes , made up of homosexual lovers , was finally annihilated .
When not engaging in pseudo - Masonic fun and calling Walt Whitman “ The Prophet , ” Ives used the society , which grew to worldwide proportions to present papers arguing for the rights of gays and lesbians .
He fastidiously studied and collected gay imprisonments , trials , treatments and the day ’s discussions on sex and gender .
Magnus Hirschfeld
In 1897 , Hirschfeld founded the Scientific Humanitarian Committee to repeal Germany ’s Paragraph 175 , which criminalized homosexuality .
His arguments would today be considered homophobic ( he advocated compassion for gays in the same manner that “ cripples ” deserved fairness ) , and some members left the organization over his characterization of gays as being inherently deficient .
However , Hischfield made achieving gay and lesbian equality his life ’s work and would out closeted gay member ’s of the Reichstag who did n’t support his repeal .
Hirschfeld ’s work in Germany came to an end with the Nazis ’ rise to power , but he escaped and spent the rest of his life publishing papers and speaking out for gay rights .
Mae West
While West was not gay , she is an indisputable early gay rights activist .
In 1927 , she had become a prolific playwright as well as actor and her play , The Drag , which dealt frankly with homosexuality ( and which referenced the works of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs ) was a hit in Connecticut and New Jersey , though the Society for the Prevention of Vice prevented it from playing on Broadway .
West used her plays to talk about sex , gender and identity and treated the question of sexuality as a basic fundamental human right .
Though always scandalous ,
West used her ability to excite the mind as much as the lower parts the body .
Last time , we have seen the magnificent watermelon carving arts .
Those have been cut by skilled knife users but now we will see arts done by a laser beam .
I believe everybody knows what Laser Beam is , or at least familiarize with the term .
Below are the pictures of eggshells which were cut with a high intensity precision Laser Beam .
Do n’t they look like they jumped right off paintings or Christmas Cards ?
Yeah you are right , it is hard to believe that the eggshells can be cut like that .
Science is sometimes wonderful , and it ’s still on the frontier of gaining new knowledge .
From science , arts can be done with an eggshells and a laser beam .
Enjoy !
‘ A true friend is someone who knows you ’re a good egg even if you ’re a little cracked . ’

Yesterday , I blogged about the release of Popular Science columnist Theo Gray 's new book , MAD SCIENCE .
In today 's episode of Boing Boing Video , a collaboration with PopSci , we debut the world - premiere of the first video documenting the sort of experiments you 'll find in this book — in which Theo cuts steel with bacon .
It 's a FLAMING BACON LANCE OF DEATH .
Yes , that 's right , using nothing but bacon — okay , prosciutto — and an air hose , Mr. Gray constructs a high performance thermic lance that seriously cuts sheet metal .
In this video , you 'll also see a purely VEGAN THERMIC LANCE built from one cucumber and several dozen thin vegetable - oil coated breadsticks .
( Tip : the performance is all about the oil ) .
This hotrod burns fast and furious , but does not last long enough to initiate a cut in steel sheet .
The flame front travels towards the back of the cucumber and endangers the operator when it reaches the rubber connector .
Theo also built a CUCUMBER - BEEFSTICK LANCE .
A high - performance thermic lance constructed from seven beefsticks and a cucumber .
Later versions used Pup - Peroni brand dog treats , which are exactly like beef sticks only cheaper .
In some ways this device out - performed the Bacon Lance , and it 's much easier to build .
But it 's not made of bacon .
Theo tells Boing Boing ,
" Cucumber is an * excellent * base for these things because it 's air - tight , moist ( to resist fire ) , easy to core , and has a rubbery skin that makes an air tight seal .
About the only thing wrong with cucumbers is that they are not made of bacon .
( I have a thing called a " fruit coring tool " which is like a very small round cookie cutter on a stick .
You drill it down the middle of the cucumber until it comes out the other end , then stuff the cucumber with the chosen fuel . ) "
Here are Theo 's columns at PopSci.com .
And more on the flaming bacon of death at PopSci.com .
These devices were created by Theodore Gray .

How they could spend the money in Ireland
A top -secret meeting of the world ’s richest people to discuss the global financial crisis was held in New York on May 5 , IrishCentral.com has learned exclusively .
The mysterious , media - blackout meeting was called by Warren Buffett , CEO of Berkshire - Hathaway ; Bill Gates , co founder of Microsoft ; and David Rockefeller Jr. , chairman of Rockefeller Financial Services .
In addition to Gates , Buffett and Rockefeller , the attendees included Oprah Winfrey , George Soros , Ted Turner , and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , among others .
It was held in the President 's Room at Rockefeller University In New York at 3 p.m. on that Tuesday afternoon .
How so many giant figures in American life managed to interrupt and coordinate their schedules on such short notice , and meet in total secrecy in the world ’s media capital remains a mystery -- as does the ultimate outcome of the billionaires ' conference .
In their letter of invitation , Gates , Buffett and Rockefeller cited the worldwide recession and the urgent need to plan for the future .
They said they wanted to hear the views of a broad range of key leaders in the financial and philanthropic fields .
Each attendee was given 15 minutes to deliver a presentation on how they saw the future global economic climate , the future priorities for philanthropy , and what they felt the elite group should do .
According to one of the attendees , Gates was the most - impressive speaker of the day , with Turner the most - outspoken and Warren Buffet the most - insistent on his agenda for change .
Winfrey was said to be in a “ listening mode . "
Gates was worth an estimated $ 57B in 2008 ; more recently , Buffett clocked in at an estimated $ 37B -- making them the richest Americans .
Winfrey was once the world ’s only black billionaire , and has extensive holdings in the entertainment and publishing industries , as well as being a leading philanthropist .
Turner , founder of CNN , once donated $ 1B to the United Nations .
Soros has a personal fortune estimated at $ 11B , while Bloomberg is listed as the eighth - richest American with a net worth of $ 20B .
Other invitees included Eli and Edythe Broad , whose current fortune is estimated at $ 5.2B by Forbes Magazine ; John Morgridge , former CEO of Cisco and his wife Tashia ; Peter Peterson , senior chairman of the Blackstone Group ; Julian Robertson , founder of Tiger Management Corp . ; and Patty Stonesifer , former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
" They were all there , the great and the good , " a participant told IrishCentral.com .

On March 31 , Baitullah Mehsud , commander of the Tehrik - i- Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , called The Associated Press and Reuters to claim responsibility for the March 29 attack against a Pakistani police academy in Manawan , which is near the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore and the Indian border .
The attack had been previously claimed by a little - known group , Fedayeen al - Islam ( FI ) , which also took responsibility for the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in September 2008 .
Mehsud has also released an Urdu- language audio message claiming responsibility for the Manawan attack as well as a failed March 23 attack on the headquarters of the Police Special Branch in Islamabad .
Mehsud , who authorities claim was behind the March 3 attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore , also warned that there would be additional attacks all across the country in retaliation for U.S. drone strikes in the Federally Administered Tribal Area .
He even threatened to launch attacks in Washington , D.C.
It is not clear at this point if the two claims of responsibility for the Manawan attack are indeed contradictory .
If FI is an independent group , it is possible that it was working with Mehsud in the assault on the police academy .
However , it is also quite possible that FI is either part of the larger TTP ( which is an umbrella group with many factions ) or perhaps just a nom de guerre used by the TTP to claim certain attacks .
When a reporter asked about the FI claim , Mehsud refused to comment .
Two things can be ascertained from this : that Mehsud 's organization has the ability to conduct these attacks , and that a major jihadist figure like Mehsud has no real need to claim the attacks of others to bolster his reputation .
In fact , lying about such a thing would hurt his well - established reputation .
It is a good bet , therefore , that the TTP was in fact involved in the Manawan attack .
The odds are even greater when one considers the intelligence reports from a few days prior to the attack : that Mehsud had dispatched a group of 22 operatives from his base in South Waziristan , through the town of Mianwali in southwestern Punjab , to conduct attacks in Lahore and Rawalpindi .
Pakistani authorities were actively searching for those operatives when the attack occurred in Manawan .
While STRATFOR has already published a political assessment of the Manawan attack , we believe it might also be interesting to look at the incident from a protective intelligence standpoint and examine the tactical aspects of the operation in more detail .
The attack on the police academy in Manawan happened at approximately 7:20 a.m. on March 29 as more than 800 unarmed police cadets were on the parade field for their regularly scheduled morning training .
Witness reports suggest that there were 10 attackers who scaled the back wall of the academy and began to attack the cadets .
Part of the attack team reportedly was dressed in police uniforms , while the rest reportedly wore shalwar kameez ( traditional Pakistani dress ) .
Several members of the team also wore suicide belts , and at least some of them carried large duffle bags ( similar to those carried by the assailants in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks and the March 3 attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore ) .
The gunmen reportedly engaged the cadets with hand grenades and fire from assault rifles .
As the gunmen raked the parade ground , many of the cadets reportedly fled the compound or barricaded themselves in various rooms inside the facility .
Because the bulk of the people at the academy were cadets and not trained police , they were not issued firearms .
The armed guards at the academy were able to offer some resistance , but the attack team was able to make its way across the parade ground and into the barracks , where the attackers established defensive positions , apparently with the hope of initiating a prolonged hostage situation .
Reports are conflicting as to how many hostages they were actually able to seize and control inside the barracks .
The Pakistani police and military responded aggressively to the attack .
Within about 30 minutes , officers from the Elite Force — a highly trained branch of the Punjab Police responsible for counterterrorism — reportedly had surrounded the barracks building .
By 9 a.m. , paramilitary Pakistan Rangers and Pakistani army troops began to arrive .
Many of the wounded cadets were evacuated from the parade ground using armored personnel carriers ( APCs ) to protect them from the attackers ' fire .
The attackers apparently attempted to use grenades to attack the APCs , but were met with heavy suppressive fire from the security forces .
Pakistani forces also apparently used tear gas against the attackers , as well as APCs and helicopter gunships .
Eventually , the Elite Force went room to room to clear the barracks building of attackers .
By 4 p.m. , the siege had ended , with six of the attackers captured and four killed .
( Three of the four reportedly killed themselves using suicide belts . )
Despite initial reports of high casualties , it now appears that only eight police officers or cadets were killed in the attack , with more than 90 others wounded .
While armed assaults against paramilitary forces , convoys and other targets are common along the border with Afghanistan , this attack was only the second such attack in Lahore .
Terrorist attacks in Pakistan have more commonly been committed by suicide bombers , and it appears that Mehsud 's group may have embraced a change in tactics , perhaps influenced by the success of Mumbai .
( However , as we will discuss below , this latest attack , like the attack on the cricket team , was far from a spectacular success . )
First , it must be recognized that jihadist attacks on police recruits are not uncommon .
We have seen attacks on police training and recruiting centers in Iraq and Afghanistan , among other countries , and we have also seen them before in Pakistan .
On July 15 , 2007 , a suicide bomber attacked a police recruitment center in Dera Ismail Khan , killing 26 people and wounding 35 .
The victims were at the center to take medical and written tests for entering the police force .
A training center like the one in Manawan provides an unusually large concentration of targets .
The more than 800 cadets at the academy were a far larger group of police than is normally found in the police stations scattered throughout the country .
The training center was also a far softer target than a traditional police station , where all the officers are armed .
From media reports , it appears that there were only seven armed guards on duty at the academy at the time of the attack .
The instructors allegedly were armed only with lathis ( long canes commonly used by police in India and Pakistan ) .
The academy 's rigid training schedule also provided a highly predictable target , as the attackers knew the cadets would be on the parade field from 7 - 8 a.m. every day .
With so many potential targets on the parade field and in the barracks , and with so many attackers , it is amazing that there were only eight people killed in this attack ( one - fourth the death toll of the April 2007 Virginia Tech shooting ) .
This is an indication that the Manawan attackers were not nearly as well trained in marksmanship as the assault team that conducted the November Mumbai attacks , in which 10 gunmen killed 173 people .
The 10 heavily armed Manawan assailants did not even succeed in killing one victim each in a situation akin to shooting fish in a barrel .
From a military standpoint , such a formation of massed people in the open would have been far more effectively targeted using mortars and crew - served machine guns , so it can also be argued that the attack was poorly planned and the attackers improperly equipped to inflict maximum casualties .
Even so , it is quite amazing to us that attackers armed with assault rifles and grenades did not kill one victim apiece .
Of course , one thing that helped contain the carnage was the response of Pakistani security personnel and their efforts to evacuate the wounded under fire .
While not exactly practicing what are known in the United States as " active shooter procedures " , the Elite Force officers did quickly engage the attackers and pin them down until more firepower could be brought to bear .
The Elite Force also did a fairly efficient job of clearing the barracks of attackers .
The Pakistani response ensured that the incident did not drag on like the Mumbai attacks did .
The Elite Force went in hard and fast , and seemingly with little regard for the hostages being held , yet their decisive action proved to be very effective , and the result was that a minimum number of hostages were killed .
There were some significant differences from the situation in Mumbai .
First , there was only one crime scene to deal with , and the Pakistani authorities could focus all their attention and resources there .
Second , the barracks building was far smaller and simpler than the hotels occupied in the Mumbai attacks .
Third , Manawan is far smaller and more isolated than Mumbai , and it is easier to pin the attackers down in a city of that size than in a larger , more densely populated city such as Mumbai .
Finally , there were no foreign citizens involved in the hostage situation , so the Pakistani authorities did not have to worry about international sensibilities or killing a foreign citizen with friendly fire .
They were able to act aggressively and not worry about distractions — or the media circus that Mumbai became .
Perhaps the most important thing to watch going forward will be the response of the Pakistani people to these attacks .
In his claim of responsibility , Mehsud said the Manawan attack was in direct response to the expanding U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) campaign in Pakistan .
Mehsud threatened that there would be more militant attacks in Pakistan and the United States if the UAV attacks did not stop .
Clearly , Mehsud is feeling the heat from these attacks , and although he claims he is ready to be martyred , his bravado is belied by the fact that he is taking such extraordinary measures to try to halt the UAV campaign .
He obviously fears the UAV strikes , not only for what they can do to him , but for what they can do to degrade his organization .
When the Elite Force completed the clearing of the barracks , several officers came out on the roof of the building , shouted " God is great " and fired celebratory shots into the air ( something that is anathema to Western police and military forces ) .
Many of the people gathered outside the academy joined in the shouting and loudly cheered the Elite Force .
This sentiment was widely echoed in the Pakistani media .
Although the Manawan attack was intended to demoralize Pakistani security forces , it may have just the opposite effect .
The bravery and dedication exhibited by the Pakistani police and soldiers who responded to the attack may instead serve to steel their will and instill professional pride .
Mehsud 's recent threats , along with the militant attacks , may also work to alienate him from people who had been supportive of — or at least ambivalent toward — him and the jihadists .
Up until 2003 , the Saudi public , and many in the government , pretty much turned a blind eye to the actions of jihadists in Saudi Arabia as long as the jihadists were concentrating their attacks on targets outside the kingdom .
But when the jihadists declared war on the Saudi royal family and began to conduct attacks against targets inside the kingdom that resulted in the deaths of ordinary Saudis , the tide of public opinion turned against them and the Saudi government reacted aggressively , smashing the jihadists .
Similarly , it was the brutality of al Qaeda in Iraq that helped turn many Iraqi Sunnis against the jihadists there .
Indeed , an insurgency cannot survive long without the support of the people .
In the case of Pakistan , that also goes for the support of Inter - Services Intelligence and the army .
The TTP , al Qaeda and their Kashmiri militant allies simply cannot sustain themselves without at least the tacit support of Pakistan 's intelligence apparatus and army .
If these two powerful establishments ever turn against them , the groups will be in serious peril .
Pakistan has long been able to control the TTP and al Qaeda more than it has .
The country has simply lacked the will , for a host of reasons .
It will be interesting to watch and see if Mehsud 's campaign serves to give the Pakistani people , and the authorities , the will they need to finally take more serious steps to tackle the jihadist problem .
Having long battled deep currents of jihadist thought within the country , the Pakistani government continues to face serious challenges .
But if the tide of public support begins to turn against the jihadists , those challenges will become far more manageable .
If you 're a U.S. Air Marshal patrolling the friendly skies , you 'll want to communicate discreetly with fellow on - board marshals , airport ground crew , cockpit crew and flight attendants if you need to thwart an attack .
You might also want to tap into the plane 's digital system to know where you are at any time , how far the nearest airport is and how much fuel you have left on the plane .
To do this , you 'll want something like the Federal Air Marshal Service Communication System ( FAMSCOM ) , an application that runs on any off - the - shelf wireless PDA .
Here 's how the web site of Honeywell , maker of the FAMSCOM , describes it :
These integrated technologies allow the officer to roam anywhere in the aircraft cabin , communicating securely and covertly with FAMS ground operations , cockpit crew , other onboard air marshals and airline cabin crew as well as digital aircraft systems .
While the value of communicating with crew or ground personnel may be obvious , the ability to access onboard aircraft systems is also a significant advantage .
For example , knowing the distance and time to the nearest airport or time - based fuel remaining could be invaluable in planning a response to an onboard attack With FAMSCOM , an officer can coordinate a response and it ’s timing with other officers or cabin crewmembers , greatly increasing the probability of success .
. . .
To meet these needs for global and onboard connectivity , the cabin wireless network is interconnected with the existing Communications Management Unit and ACARS digital air - ground datalink .
. . .
The Honeywell Secure ACARS technology protects the privacy and integrity of ACARS message exchanges and authenticates the identities of the communicating parties .
Now let 's take a look at what kind of communication runs through ACARS .
Again , from Honeywell :
The Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System ( ACARS ) is the air - ground data link necessary for global communication of vital information , like AOC and ATC messages for commercial airlines and Global Air Traffic Management ( GATM ) / Mobility 21 ( M21 ) information for military applications .
ACARS messages are exchanged via VHF , HF , or SATCOM links with Data link Service Providers ( DSP ) operating terrestrial communication networks , which uplink and downlink ACARS messages to and from aircraft and provide routing to and from terrestrial Command and Control ( C2 ) systems .
And , finally , let 's see who is allowed to become an air marshal .
From an investigation done last year by the nonprofit journalism group ProPublica :
Shawn Nguyen bragged that he could sneak anything past airport security using his top - secret clearance as a federal air marshal .
And for months , he smuggled cocaine and drug money onto flights across the country , boasting to an FBI informant that he was " the man with the golden badge . "
Michael McGowan used his position as an air marshal to lure a young boy to his hotel room , where he showed him child porn , took pictures of him naked and sexually abused him .
And when Brian " Cooter " Phelps wanted his ex-wife to disappear , he called a fellow air marshal and tried to hire a hit man nicknamed " the Crucifixer . "
Since 9/11 , more than three dozen federal air marshals have been charged with crimes , and hundreds more have been accused of misconduct , an investigation by ProPublica has found .
Cases range from drunken driving and domestic violence to aiding a human trafficking ring and trying to smuggle explosives from Afghanistan .
The Federal Air Marshal Service presents the image of an elite undercover force charged with making split - second decisions that could mean the difference between stopping a terrorist and shooting an innocent passenger .
But an examination of police reports , court records , government reports , memos and e-mails shows that 18 air marshals have been charged with felonies , including at least three who were hired despite prior criminal records or being fired from law enforcement jobs .
A fourth air marshal was hired while under FBI investigation .
Another stayed on the job despite alarming a flight attendant with his behavior .
UPDATE : A spokesman for the U.S. Air Marshal program says that air marshals are not using this Honeywell product , and they 've asked Honeywell to remove the web page .
Spokesman Nelson Minerly said that Honeywell developed and pitched the product to the marshals program , but the program rejected it .

1 Longleat Hedge Maze ( UK )
Made up of more than 16,000 english yews , Longleat ’s spectacular hedge maze – the world ’s longest– was first laid out in 1975 by designer Greg Bright .
The Maze covers an area of around 1.48 acres ( 0.6 hectares ) with a total pathway length of 1.69 miles ( 2.72 kilometres ) .
Unlike most other conventional mazes , it ’s actually three - dimensional , with six wooden bridges offering tantalizing glimpses towards the elusive centre of the maze , which is marked by an observation tower for visitors who manage to find it .
2 Reignac - sur - Indre Maze ( France )
In 1996 , the year this plant maze – the world ’s largest– was created at Reignac - sur - Indre in Touraine , 85,000 visitors came to admire and lose themselves in the middle of its 4 - hectare ( 10 - acre ) expanse .
Each year , a maze of corn or sunflowers emerges from the ground over the summer , is harvested in the autumn , and then reappears the following year in a different form , thanks to a well - proven technique of sowing and marking out .
3 York Maze , a Star Trek tribute ( UK )
Containing 1.5 million individual plants , this maze –just outside York– covers 32 acres , the equivalent of 15 football pitches , and was designed using satellite technology , which meant the paths could be cut to an accuracy of half a metre .
The huge maze was created by Tom Pearcy as a tribute to the 40th anniversary of Star Trek .
4 Ashcombe Maze ( Australia )
Ashcombe Maze is Australia ’s oldest and most famous traditional hedge maze , located at Shoreham on the east of the Mornington Peninsula , Victoria .
Measuring three meters high by two meters wide , the gardens also boast the world ’s oldest rose maze , which blooms 217 varieties of roses on 1,200 bushes .
5 Pineapple Garden Maze ( Hawaii )
World ’s largest maze , according to the Guinness Book of Records 2001 , the Pineapple Garden Maze offers over three miles of paths on three acres .
Instead of a traditional English hedge , it is planted with 14,000 colorful Hawaiian plants , including hibiscus , croton , panax , pineapple and heliconia .
It is located in Wahiawa , Hawaii at Dole Plantation and certainly looks scary from the air .
6 Snake Maze ( UK )
Michael Blee , 62 , spent several months creating this six - acre maze at Gore Farm in Upchurch , near Rochester , Kent .
Its hedges stand 9ft tall .
This is the 10th and the most complicated maze Mr. Blee has ever done .
He is hoping his giant game makes it into the Guinness Book of Records .
7 Il Labirinto ( Italy )
Created in the early 1700s , Il Labirinto is said to be one of the most complicated labyrinths in the world .
Located in the town of Stra , just outside Venice on the grounds of Villa Pisani , the legend says Napoleon got “ lost ” in it around 1807 .
8 Peace Maze ( Ireland )
This Irish maze was officially opened in 2001 .
The largest permanent hedge maze in the world , it covers an area of 11,000 m2 – 2.7 acres , or , 1.1 hectares .
The path length is 3147 m ( 2 miles or 3443 yards ) .
The hedge is constructed from 6000 yew trees , many of which were planted during December 2000 by people from all over Northern Ireland .
9 Hampton Court Maze ( UK )
The Maze at Hampton Court , the royal palace on the Thames to the west of London , is probably UK ’s most famous one .
Planted as part of the gardens laid out for William of Orange between 1689 and 1695 by George London and Henry Wise , it covers an area of a third of an acre ( about 1350 sq meters ) , with paths of over half a mile ( 0.8 km ) long .
It was described with great wit in Jerome K. Jerome ’s novel ‘ Three Men in a Boat . ’
Hampton Court Maze continues to attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year .
10 Davis’ Mega Maze ( USA )
Davis ’ Mega Maze in Sterling , Massachusetts , has been a popular seasonal attraction since 1998 .
Davis ’ Farmland , a seventh - generation family - owned farm , holds this unique maze that changes completely from year to year .
Designed in Dorset , England , by maze designer Adrian Fisher who is often credited with creating the modern maize maze craze , the Mega Maze takes more than 12,800 labor hours to be created each year .

Advertisement Sri Lankan troops will no longer use heavy weapons or air strikes in fighting against Tamil Tiger rebels in the north - east , the government says .
The statement said the army would focus on trying to rescue civilians .
Concern has been rising over civilian deaths .
The rebels are boxed in to a shrinking patch of land which they share with thousands of civilians .
On Sunday the government dismissed a Tamil Tiger ceasefire offer as a " joke " and said the rebels were near defeat .
Pre -dawn attack
The statement from the office of the president said combat operations in the civil war between the military and Tamil Tiger rebels had " reached their conclusion " .
See a map of the region " Our security forces have been instructed to end the use of heavy calibre guns , combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian casualties , " the statement said .
" Our security forces will confine their attempts to rescuing civilians who are held hostage and give foremost priority to saving civilians . "
However , the Tigers ' political head , B Nadesan , told the BBC Sinhala service that government artillery and jet bomber attacks were continuing to target civilians .
He repeated a call for international powers to put pressure on the Sri Lankan government to observe a ceasefire .

The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says until now the military and the government have said that they were not using any heavy weapons in this current stage of the fighting and had caused no civilian casualties .
This new statement , however , does appear to acknowledge that civilians have been harmed as aid agencies and the UN have been saying , our correspondent says .
He says the declaration may signal a radical change of tactics by government forces in the small war zone to try to avoid such casualties .
It may also mean that they feel their final military victory has been achieved , or nearly achieved .
Earlier on Monday , Sri Lankan troops launched a pre-dawn attack on Tamil Tiger - held areas in the north - east , a pro-rebel website reported .
Troops were firing from all sides and more than 10,000 civilians were at immediate risk , TamilNet said .
A military spokesman confirmed that troops were firing , but said they were doing so in self - defence .
No confirmation of the reports is possible as independent journalists are not allowed into the war zone .
' Disappointed '
On Monday the Chief Minister of India 's Tamil Nadu state , M Karunanidhi , 85 , went on indefinite hunger strike to demand a ceasefire in Sri Lanka .
He called it off after the latest news from Sri Lanka .
John Holmes wants more UN access to the war zone Sri Lanka 's minority Tamil community has close cultural , religious and business ties with more than 50 m Tamils in Tamil Nadu .
Meanwhile , the UN's top humanitarian official , John Holmes , has been in Sri Lanka for a number of days .
On Monday he said he thought there was little prospect of a ceasefire soon but that there should be more access to civilians affected by the fighting .
The UN says some 50,000 civilians remain trapped in a government - designated no - fire zone , but the army puts the number at 15,000 .
Mr Holmes said he was " disappointed " President Mahinda Rajapakse had not agreed to allow a humanitarian mission into the war zone .
The rebels have been beaten back to a 12 sq km ( 5 sq m ) area .
The Tamil Tigers have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority since 1983 .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the war , but that figure could now be far higher because of intensified fighting in recent weeks .

I. One Big Market
It is remarkable that the prospect of One Big Marketplanetary , inescapable , open all hoursraises no questions for libertarians , who scorn the idea of One Big Cartel ( communism ) or One Big State ( world government ) .
This seems an interesting case of social blindness .
If One Big Cartel is impossible or not worth the trouble its creation entails , [ 1 ] why should One Big Market be different ?
And what if something very like One Big State is needed to build One Big Market ?
Yet libertarians allergic to the very word society  can expatiate endlessly on unexplained markets  and that reified entity ,  the market . 
In a world where free trade amounts to American - led globalization ,  such views are gospel in libertarian think tanks .
For Leftists , globalization entails terrible evils .
The Leftists are not exactly wrong , and the damage done under neo-liberal slogans strengthens their case .
Marxs famous remarks on the sheer destructiveness of the process bear repeating .
Neo-liberals take the destruction as a necessary step to some distant but better future .
This is not new .
Early liberals thought trade was good and more was better .
But there was frequently mercantilism in their madness the desire to force trade into particular channels .
From the 16th century onward , mercantilism suited rulers keen to get revenue from overseas empire , and early liberal theorists helpfully proclaimed that foreigners  refusal to trade justified war and invasion .
Here , Vitoria is found on much the same page as Thomas Friedman ; and early international law begins to resemble a general European agreement on rules for receiving property stolen overseas . [ 2 ]
One hears much of British  free trade ,  a.k.a. British  free trade imperialism . [ 3 ]
But was the trade or the adjective British the key to the alleged benefits ?
John
Nye writes that because  Britain had an empire and relatively free trade ,  a whole school of thought sees international free trade [ as ] a pubic good requiring a powerful leader , or hegemon . . . [ 4 ]
Yet the freedom in British trade is much exaggerated .
Many economists still endorse violent institution of spontaneous orders , if covertly , along the following lines : first , impose an order meant to be largely self - regulating , once established a machine that will go of itself . 
Having redistributed property titles and reformed institutions , we are done .
Henceforth , we may concentrate on flexible price movements within the system , or fret about the downward rigidity of wages after 1929 .
II .
History before Theory
England
A short historical excursion may help .
Debating English enclosures , liberal optimists  argue that millions would have perished absent industrialization , and ( therefore ) , absent preceding ( and parallel ) enclosures .
Socialist and Tory pessimists  stressed smallholders  dispossession , loss of commons and traditional values .
Such cases as Ireland , India , and South Africa leave much room for doubting that English elites ever cared deeply about lesser persons properties .
And even if estimates involving increased rents could prove that English agriculture was more productive after enclosure , they do not exactly demonstrate that actually - occurring enclosures were the only possible path to more food for the population .
It seems odd indeed that only ex-feudal rent - seekers ( and some sturdy yeomen ) clothed with re-jiggered property titles , could clear the paths of disembodied incentives , rational choices , and the like .
There were improving landlords ,  to be sure , but they mostly improved their own incomes . [ 5 ]
Much classical liberal history simply equates English practices with political and economic liberalism .
 Whig economics  buttresses Whig History with pie - in - the - sky about the best possible  outcomes under the circumstances while abstracting from the circumstances .
Peasants and copyholders were evidently economic  collateral damage .
( Compare Condi Rices  generational sacrifice of present Iraqis to future , happier Iraqis ) .
But as  Eric Dalton wrote in 1966 ,  The fact that a future generation may be better off because of a forced rate of growth during the previous generations excuses nothing .  [ 6 ]
Lesson : forced savings , expropriations , and even famines are benign under capitalism , but very wicked under socialism .
As in practice , so too in theory : Michael Perelman gives much evidence that classical economists were unwilling to trust market forces to determine the social division of labor ,  and therefore enlisted the state to force independent producers into unwanted waged labor . [ 7 ]
America
In America , interested parties set comparable processes in motion under less promising conditions .
Here small commodity production was feasible and had to be suppressed .
In the South , coastal planters pushed would - be independents into frontier zones , as Andrew Lytle complained . [ 8 ]
Some decades later , the Northern coalition gathered around Lincoln , copper - riveted its idea of proper market mechanisms on the whole federation .
The later 19th century witnessed a Great Barbecue of continuous state - assisted capital accumulation . [ 9 ]
Subsequent American history served up a partially centralized state increasingly dedicated to securing foreign markets ( the Open Door ) and poised to interfere with everything else , as needed .
During the Great Depression , many nations adopted corporatism , tariffs , and inflation , disrupting the old international division of labor .
New Dealers turned to export markets and war and then , as Cold War liberals , opened the doors further , imposing embedded liberalism  a coordinated corporatism [ 10 ] to revive world trade .
For two generations , anti-communism supplied the rationale .
Now neo - fascism ,  terrorism , and state roguery  fill the bill .
After the Cold War , embeddedness abides , scholars praise American provision of global public goods ,  and U.S. functionaries press all countries to adopt the rule of law ,  elections , effective bureaucracies , and transparency . [ 11 ]
By sustaining existing corporatism and managed trade , these items will produce universal  free - market democracy . 
Meanwhile , conservatives in power have cut disfavored programs while their strong state grows fat on others .
Under a slightly different agenda , government remains an economic savior . [ 12 ]
The central state withering away  it seems under Republican management still presides over engrossment of foreign markets ; a military - industrial complex ; state - sponsored R&D ; state - funded education ; currency and credit ( = overproduction of money ) ; transportation subsidies ; global patents and copyright ( a second enclosure movement ) ; communications subsidies ( whence TV , Internet , and global surveillance ) ; a police - lawyer - prison - industrial complex , d.b.a. as a War on Drugs ; and more . [ 13 ]
No free - market utopia looms .
Hilaire Belloc argued that reforms of capitalism along socialist lines would yield a third thing the Servile State .
Today , we see that alleged reforms of existing Servile States along  free - market  lines produce , in practice , novel and interesting forms of the Servile State .
III .
The Imperialism of Economic Theory
With so much at stake , some skepticism about reigning economic truisms seems warranted .
Emma Rothschild has questioned early economists  synoptic vision and reverence for the all - seeing theorist .
She quotes Lionel Robbins on the  the highly artificial environment . . . necessary if [ the market ] is to function properly . . .
Betting the farm on unproven probabilities , economists assert that  the swerving moleculae of the universe of commerce tend to become more orderly . . . as the size of the universe increases .  [ 14 ]
( Here indeed is a Madisonian moment . )
Individualist Foundations
Still , liberalism and economics display tender feelings for individuals .
Jump - starting their theories , Hobbes , Locke , and Rousseau fielded individuals  uniting their wills  in some absurd  contract ,  and then rudely swept them off stage .
Hegel , too , noticed individuals just before eradicating them in favor of Historys cunning .
In neoclassical circles , mere ciphers ( politely called individuals ) knock around with fixed tastes on indifference curves , thereby facilitating mathematical equilibrium analysis .
Practitioners of individualist methodologies insert routine warnings that terms like market are merely short - hand for complex interactions ultimately reducible to strictly individual actions .
Soon enough , they , like other social scientists , lose track of the level of abstraction and the reified market emerges as a single supra-human actor .
With so many abstracted atoms randomly colliding , nominalism begets institutionalism , because any common rule that exists must be imposed upon those objects .
Hence the Thatcher - Reagan program of free market and strong state . [ 15 ]
Two - Person Follies
From individuals , economists turn to two - person barter analogies .
These can be quite misleading .
Two parties value two goods differently and exchange results ; this model now expands to explain everything , but its utility seems marginal . [ 16 ]
Similarly , two - person cases explain war , taken as a fight between two giant individuals ,  and undergird the Democratic Peace said to prevail between pairs of nice states . [ 17 ]
Bad analogies go far .
Two - party tall - tales bring us to free trade and comparative advantage .
For Ricardo , Portugal and Britain seem to trade one - to - one , although of course specific organizations and persons made exchanges , mediated by state policies .
We might expect the mediation to have compromised whatever advantages really arise from two - party trades .
Theory nods and , anyway , in historically given  free trade ,  the comparative advantage was very often military .
Doubts about Says Law
Says
Law held that goods exchange ( ultimately ) for other goods , with money only the neutral medium of exchange .
Production and consumption will balance , mostly .
General overproduction is impossible .
Say has not lacked critics .
John Hobson thought Say wrongly presupposed  that the power to consume and the desire to consume necessarily co-exist in the same persons .
Joseph Schumpeter said the law states a tendency correctly  but is impeded by certain important facts  that inspired Keynesian theory .
Henry Hazlitt defended Says Law with so many qualifications that the law seemed headed for serious real - world trouble .
Recently , Stephan Hopp finds no law - like proposition in Says treatment of markets . [ 18 ]
Steve Keen observes that capitalists do not personally bestow any use - value ( utility  ) on their wares .
Instead , goods are produced and sold for money as a means to other goods , reinvestment , power , or whatever .
This is not , perhaps , disastrous , but it is not very good for neoclassical theorems grounded on an analogy with two - person exchanges of actual goods traded for their use - value .
With money in the picture , Marx writes ,  the exchange is separated into two actions which are independent of each other both temporally and spatially .  [ 19 ]
Here is ample room for exceptions to Says law .
As a two - sided construct , arrived at by aggregating two - party exchanges , Says law yields overall balance .
But as Marx comments , Say has asserted a Hegelian unity of opposites , just where that philosopher is little help . [ 20 ]
Modern corporations armed with state - like legal advantages play a major role in undercutting Says hoped - for balance .
Corporate managers control not just other peoples money , but other peoples property as well .
As Rothbard says , it is the controller who is the real owner . . .
Carl Kaysen remarks the great discretionary authority  of management , secured by large absolute size , barriers to entry , patents , control over scarce raw materials , or government limitation of competition .
This discretionary power allows managers to adopt a longer time - horizon and ignore likely short - period losses . 
Gardiner Means believed that , in labor markets , administered prices endemic to the corporate economy could equate demand and supply only by chance .
Finally ( pace Mises ) , corporate bureaucracy increasingly resembles state bureaucracy .
Now the problem of economic calculation under corporatism appears alongside the more famous one under socialism . [ 21 ]
Finally , modern competition does not necessarily take place within a given industry , where their actual products might matter to producers , but can run across all profitable endeavors in the attempt to engross as much as possible of the One Big Pile of Money that artificially large markets and fractional - reserve banking create .
There is more .
Recall that for Hazlitt , there must always be some preceding disturbing factor standing athwart Says law . [ 22 ]
But , what if the disturbing factors fractional - reserve banking , immortal corporations , and many others are permanently institutionalized ?
The rulers have learned how to stave off a reckoning indefinitely through exported inflation [ 23 ] and other mechanisms , and we find ourselves living with regularly recurring ( but smaller ) business cycles kept within politically tolerable limits .
John Taylor of Caroline , among others , warned us in detail of the perils of fictitious capital . [ 24 ]
In the end , Says law applies , if anywhere , in ideal free markets , which seldom exist .
Like the Fourth Amendment , it survives ( barely ) as an unenforce able dead letter .
It is ( pace Böhm - Bawerk ) just where the law of gravity is , when other forces ( divine or human ) counteract it . [ 25 ]
Defenders of abstracted markets always counter that any case that might be instanced was not really  a free market ; by definition , nothing bad is endogenous to markets .
Perhaps so , but by now we begin to suspect that an historical approach offers some advantages over Market Platonism .
There is an array of problems endogenous to the market economy as we know it ; that they are not endogenous to the theory of a market economy is cold comfort .
Open Doors and Closed Systems
The classical economists  treatment of economies as closed Newtonian systems entails other problems .
Closed physical systems conserve energy and matter .
Closed - system economics makes do with fictitious equilibrium . [ 26 ]
Thus , foreign trade , which comes in from outside , was already a headache .
Today , many parties would answer , practically and theoretically , that once a single closed system has spread everywhere , the world will be open . 
Naturally , we want to know what this One Big Market is really all about .
It would seem to be about empire .
Here is truly an enclosure movement to enclose the world .
How did we get here ?
Economic liberals sometimes ( rightly ) dispute the concept of market failure .
Yet there are such : markets , left to private transactions , would not provide us with interstate highways or wars in Vietnam and Iraq ( rather benign  failures  here ) .
There is , however , one kind of market failure , in which economic liberals typically believe ; these involve somebodys failure to supply reified , neoclassical markets  that ought to exist .
Here state intervention , including war , may be needed .
The wheel returns to Vitorias ( and occasionally Mises ) notion that refusal to communicate ( and trade ) justifies force to bring absent markets  into being .
IV . Scale Matters
Wendell Berry complains ,  Sentimental capitalism holds in effect that everything small , local , private , personal , natural , good , and beautiful must be sacrificed in the interest of the free market  and the great corporations , which will bring unprecedented security and happiness to  the many in , of course , the future .  [ 27 ]
Alas , such solutions seem incompatible with what some writers call human scale .
Overgrown systems of any kind call to mind Karl Polanyis comment that  Hobbes grotesque vision of the State . . . was dwarfed by the Ricardian construct of the labor market : a flow of human lives the supply of which was regulated by the amount of food put at their disposal .
And as Wilhelm Röpke has written ,  Economism , materialism , and utilitarianism have in our time merged into a cult of productivity , material expansion , and the standard of living ,  revealing  the evil nature of the absolute , the unlimited , and the excessive . 
Compare , again , Polanyi :  Instead of economy being embedded in social relations , social relations are embedded in the economic system .  [ 28 ]
At this rate , there will soon be no social relations worth mentioning , much less conserving .
If the state provides the scale , economies  will follow but not the economies we might have otherwise enjoyed . [ 29 ]
At home , Americans were long since coercively globalized  from sea to shining sea , and key sectors operate well beyond the scale possible if , counterfactually , corporate - state collusion had not taken hold .
Central banking helped integrate local and regional economies into our artificial One Big Market at home , and transportation subsidies have done for the rest .
Internationally , a single powerful state , providing global inflation and wielding an immense ( unproductive ) military machine , might for a time contain and roll back any number of economic laws . 
Its leaders might hope to shape not just short - run outcomes but the very conditions of any markets existence . [ 30 ]
Yet forcing foreigners to trade freely  hardly seems self - evidently moral .
Instead , Rousseaus ancient - republican scheme of forcing men to be free is what comes to mind .
In actual modern life , if we experience any market freedom at all , it is probably on the micro level maybe at the flea market .
On the macro level , we get state - capitalist determinism , arbitrary and episodic .
( Here at least is an interesting basis on which to divide micro from macro studies ) .
Probably , the only genuinely free markets that could arise entirely on their own , would never take in more than a region , leaving aside some specialized long - distance trade in luxuries or raw materials . [ 31 ]
From this angle , the costs of 19th - century Liberal biggism  must be reconsidered ; how German National Liberals , for example , sold out important political freedoms for a unified national market , and dragged small - state particularists along with them .
Similarly , John Kincaid has noted how Quaker conservative Felix Morleys stress on federalism vs. centralization gave way in more recent forms of conservatism to the gospel of monolithic national markets under uniform federal rules as the essence of American freedom . [ 32 ]
Congress , the Supreme Court , and the Unitary Executive shall give us free markets , and the rules shall be legion .
I hold no brief for unfree markets .
We have a lot of those already .
But greater realism and less pie - in - the - sky might be wise .
This is especially true with respect to claims that the outcomes of existing artificially extended markets pretty much approximate those which theory decrees must arise between pairs of trading individuals .
Scale has consequences .
( Here , I have to take my own advice , as I am among those who long took certain under - examined economic propositions as axiomatic . )
There are also problems of context cultural and moral .
As Röpke put it , the market system must find its place in a higher order of things which is not ruled by supply and demand , free prices , and competition .  [ 33 ]
On that view , we might do better to turn to Agrarians and Distributists and indeed anyone with a modest view of what markets are good forrather than take advice from the official friends of markets and freedom .
The latter might be called corporate libertarians ,  [ 34 ] as the heirs of a waning corporate liberalism tottering on the edge of receivership .
Claes Ryn finds room for a free market of goods and services . . . in a decentralized , group - oriented society  where moral and other disciplines persist . [ 35 ]
Small may well be beautiful .
Minus the costsmoral , sanguinary , and monetary of forcibly providing One Big Market , it looks to be cheaper as well .
Can we keep states and allied corporations from forcing us , and others , into markets  ? [ 36 ]
Well , as the economists love to say , the future is uncertain .

Notes
«« First « Previous | Random | Next » Current »»
For today 's random link , start here ; and I bet you can't read just one .
I betcha .
Dan Abrams interviews Bush Attorneys General John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales .
You should read the whole thing .
I should read the whole thing .
But there 's one thing I want to talk about in isolation , because it 's important no matter what else got said in that interview .
Abrams asks about the release of the torture memos , and Gonzales has this to say :
They may be necessary in the future .
And by disclosing it , means you take them off the table and they can never be used again .
They may be necessary in the future .
Let 's unpack that .
Republicans are unapologetic about the use of torture .
We knew that .
Republicans think it might be necessary again in the future .
We probably knew that , too .
But it 's the implications of that statement I think Congress and Democrats in particular are unprepared for .
First , it is a reminder of the fact that while the U.S. is supposedly not currently engaged in such practices , they 've been suspended under executive order .
It is , in short , a reminder that the United States only honors its legal and constitutional prohibitions against torture when the chief executive wills it to be so .
And politically , that appears to mean we only honor those obligations when Democrats are elected to the White House .
In other words , the election of Barack Obama alone has not changed torture 's legal or constitutional status in this country , and it is at best a temporary respite only from what has admittedly become a staple of the Republican theory of governance .
It 's not just that torture has become an acceptable tool to Republicans .
It 's that it is now a tenet of Republican political philosophy that illegal and unconstitutional practices can be sterilized by order of the President .
And as many have found out to their great disappointment , it is apparently also a tenet of Beltway Conventional Wisdom and among some not - insignificant portion of Democrats that future administrations are ( or at least ought to be ) dissuaded from doing anything beyond opting not to adopt the same techniques and / or the rationales behind them .
Torture , it seems , is a " policy difference . "
But worse , the question of whether or not a President may order illegal and unconstitutional actions at his discretion is also a " policy difference . "
Republicans say yes , Democrats say no .
But so far , that 's all Democrats do .
They say no .
The question of whether or not the President shall have unlimited power to order extralegal actions and excuse them by fiat , we are urged to believe , is now one we settle at the ballot box .
Every four years , America shall decide anew whether or not there are any limitations on the power of the federal government .
As tiresome as it can sometimes be to see people frame matters so that it all comes down to one issue and one issue only , I find myself returning to this one again and again .
Whether or not torture is your issue .
Or wiretapping .
Or indefinite detention .
Or signing statements .
Or anything , really -- environment , global warming , abortion , health care , taxes , terrorism , the war .
No matter what your issue is , at heart , you 're dependent on a continuing and consistent respect for the law .
Because without it , none of your work on politics and policy is worth anything the moment the White House falls to someone who 's not you .
You can pass all the environmental laws you like , but if it 's accepted as a legitimate tenet of Republican governing philosophy that all of those laws can be safely ignored or otherwise set aside , you 'll have gained nothing from your work with a friendly Congress and administration .
And if you can set aside all statutory and constitutional law on something like torture , I 'm unsure what barriers you think remain in the way of doing the same on any other issue .
And just to bring this back to Congress -- this was originally posted at Congress Matters , after all -- the responsibility for checking what Republicans claim ought to be considered part of the " gloss on executive power " belongs with the Legislative and Judicial branches .
An investigation into and accounting for the abuses of the Bush " administration " falls to one of these two , and the Legislative is the only branch empowered to bring the issue before itself on of its own volition .
And while it 's politically understandable that Members wait for signs of approval or disapproval from the newly - elected President , it 's a structural error in logic to permit the executive branch to give its yea or nay to another branch 's decision to check the Article II power .
The Congress must be the prime mover of any such inquiry .
There are no two ways about it .
It can , of course , opt not to concern itself with the integrity of the laws it passes .
And all indications are that it lacks the political will to do anything different , lest Members jeopardize their hold on their offices .
But you'd be right to wonder what value is left in a Congress that opts to grant the President the supreme power to negate anything it does .
Worse still , inaction emboldens Republican executive supremacists .
As inquiries into the abuses of the Bush regime are dismissed as " backward looking , " Alberto Gonzales asserts even from the depths of his public disgrace that torture " may be necessary in the future . "
And it appears that people who share his view have little to be concerned about in terms of accountability for it .
Torture -- and more importantly , the insane " unitary executive " theory that underpinned it and a thousand other abuses -- remains a viable and so - far undisputed weapon in the Republican toolkit .
It will return , as surely as the Republican theory of total executive supremacy survived Watergate and Iran -Contra .
Consider the odds .
Beginning with the 1968 election of Richard Nixon , Republicans occupied the White House for 28 of 40 years , reelecting three Presidents to second terms , each of whom -- Nixon , Regan and George W. Bush -- presided over scandalous escalations in the executive supremacy theory .
Democrats have reelected just one during this time .
And he was impeached .
Are the odds that good for Democrats perpetually winning the White House , such that stringing together a series of temporary reprieves from Republican theories of executive supremacy are a reasonable approach to dealing with their abuses ?
I do n't think so .
Consider , also , the history of the Legislative branch during that time .
It 's almost the reverse image .
Twenty - eight years of Democratic dominance versus 12 years of Republican control .
Yet in all that time , Democrats as a party have permitted power to flow nearly unabated from the Legislative to the Executive , even in the face of their relative advantage in holding Congress and relative inability to hold the White House .
Strictly as a political consideration , you 'd think the Democratic interest in reversing this trend would move more Democrats to action .
And even those who do consider action prefer entrusting it to non-partisan , outside commissions -- perhaps even headed by someone of the Republicans ' choosing ( as if to buying political forbearance from the party that believes no rules apply to it when they hold the White House was worth anything ) .
They are telling you they will torture again in the future .
They have already told you that it is their belief -- their interpretation of the four corners of the Constitution -- that they have the right to order it if they can win just one national election ( versus Democrats ' constant scrambling to win 300+ localized contests ) .
There is nothing " backward looking " about giving serious consideration to a live threat that has just been renewed .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico was hit by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake on Monday , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
The USGS said the quake hit 19 miles south - southeast of Tixtla , Guerrero , about 150 miles south of the capital , Mexico City .
It was 25.6 miles deep .
Buildings in the capital shook .
Quakes of this magnitude are classified as strong and are capable of causing severe damage .
The USGS earlier reported the quake measured 5.8 .
Stone Throwing At The Zoo - The Chimp Planned It
Researchers say they have found the first unambiguous evidence that an animal other than humans can make spontaneous plans for future events .
The report in Current Biology highlights a decade of observations of a male chimpanzee calmly collecting stones and fashioning concrete discs that he would later use to hurl at zoo visitors .
While researchers have observed many ape behaviors that could involve planning both in the wild and in captivity , it generally has n't been possible to judge whether they were really meeting a current or future need , he added .
For instance , when a chimp breaks a twig for termite fishing or collects a stone for nut cracking , it can always be argued that they are motivated by immediate rather than future circumstances .
" These observations convincingly show that our fellow apes do consider the future in a very complex way , " said Mathias Osvath of Lund University .
" It implies that they have a highly developed consciousness , including life - like mental simulations of potential events .
They most probably have an ' inner world ' like we have when reviewing past episodes of our lives or thinking of days to come .
When wild chimps collect stones or go out to war , they probably plan this in advance .
I would guess that they plan much of their everyday behavior . "
Fellow apes ?
Osvath 's zoology is a little suspect so let 's hope his neuroscience is a little more comprehensive - though maybe when he writes for apes he refers to them as fellow humans .
What makes the newly described case so special , Osvath said , is that the chimp 's planning behavior is not based on a " current drive state . "
In contrast to the chimp 's extreme agitation when throwing the stones , he was always calm when collecting or manufacturing his ammunition .
Osvath said he thinks wild chimps in general , as well as other animals , probably have the planning ability demonstrated by the individual described in the study .
Indeed , experiments conducted recently with other captive chimpanzees have shown they are capable of making such plans .
( Some have argued , however , that those findings could be the result of experimental artifacts . )
" I think that wild chimpanzees might be even better at planning as they probably rely on it for their daily survival , " Osvath said .
" The environment in a zoo is far less complex than in a forest .
Zoo chimps never have to encounter the dangers in the forest or live through periods of scarce food .
Planning would prove its value in ' real life ' much more than in a zoo . "
The Safari web browser can autofill form fields from your personal address book card .
I ’ve had very good experiences with this feature .
But today I was creeped out a little on my brightkite profile as I saw my birthday even though I had not provided it anywhere .
It took me a moment to realize that Safari had autofilled my birthday .
So I quickly came up with an evil idea .
Would it be possible to abuse that feature to automatically collect birthdays from users on say a signup form ?
And yes , it ’s possible .
Save the following HTML on your disk :
< html > < head > < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> < title > Settings - Profile - brightkite.com </ title > </ head > < body > < form action = " http://localhost/ " method= " get " > < label for =" fullname " >
Full name < / label > < input id =" fullname " name = " fullname " /> < input type =" submit " /> < input id =" street " name = " street " />
< input id =" dob " name = " dob " style= " opacity : 0 " /> </ form > </ body > </html >
It defines a form with the three fields full name , street and birthday .
The birthday field is hidden – so the user has no idea that it will be submitted as well .
The street field is just in there for easy checking if the autocompletion is working .
Then open the form in Safari ( I tried on Version 4 Public Beta 5528.16 ) , enter your full name in the first field and use the tab key to activate the submit button .
If everything worked , you ’ll see the street field autofilled as you ’d expect .
But when you submit , the birthday is submitted as well – if you have it stored in your address book .
Here 's a review I wrote about the book ' Perl Testing : A Developer 's Notebook ' by Ian Langworth & chromatic .
" Excellent overview and introduction to the art of testing Perl programs .
This modestly - sized book covers a wide range of types of testing from the very simple Perl script to the more advanced web application .
It 's not only about writing tests but managing them as well and then making sure that your code can be distributed in a useful manner .
I especially found the chapter about testing untestable code very insightful , where the use of mocking modules and mocking objects is essential .
Have you ever needed to override live code by hacking deeply into their packages ?
Well , this book will help you out with this delicate matter and make you more confident with testing , testing and testing .
Most people have an aversion to testing , but here you can get quickly up to speed and even enjoy the fine are of testing .
There are many references to other CPAN modules which is useful to know about .
Of course , any book authored by chromatic has to be worth the read . "

Here ’s a tip :
If you have an indoor garden , you know they are very time consuming to maintain .
Consider fake grass to help lower the maintenance of your indoor garden but still have it looking as beautiful .
Follow this list and you will be on your way to finding great plants for your home .
Here are the top ten plants that are commonly used in homes .
1. Sansevieria trifasciata
Sansevieria trifasciata is also known as Snake Plant and Mother in Law ’s Tongue .
This is a great option for a low - light area that could use some plant beauty .
The great thing about this plant is that it only requires a little bit of water in the summer months .
During the winter it hardly needs any water .
2. Chinese Evergreen
The real biological name of this indoor plant is Aglaonema .
This plant grows well in low - light conditions .
It needs to be watered occasionally , and the soil needs to be well drained at all times .
3. Dieffenbachia
This popular indoor plant is also popular by other names like Dumb Cane and Leopard Lily .
This is a poisonous plant if eaten so make sure your children or pets can’t reach it .
The leaves are beautiful .
Its soil needs to be kept moist but not soggy .
Lastly , it works best with medium light .
4. Chlorophytum comosum
Other famous names of Chlorophytum comosum are Spider Plant and Airplane Plant .
This is a great plant for an east - facing window .
It removes formaldehyde from the air .
It will survive in any condition , but does best in bright light with regular watering and soil that is well - drained at all times .
5. Golden Pothos ( Epipremnum )
This is also effective at removing formaldehyde .
The vines on this plant have green heart - shaped leaves .
You can neglect this plant and pests will not really bother it .
From time to time you can pinch the tips to make it bushier .
It will thrive best if it is placed by an east - facing window and is watered regularly .
Just do n’t overwater .
6. Dracaena marginata
Also known as Dracaena
There are a lot of varieties of this plant .
Some prefer low light , some medium .
Water requirements depend on their size and shape .
7. English Ivy
There is another name for the English Ivy Houseplant , which is Hedera .
This plant is poisonous but very beautiful .
It will look the best when sitting next to bright , filtered light .
It does well with a little humidity , regular water and draining .
8. Peace Lily ( Spathiphyllum )
Peace lily tolerates low light and low humidity .
The dark green leaves and white flowers look attractive in a plain white or black glossy pot .
This plant grows well in artificial light .
Water this plant regularly .
If you forget , it will start to droop .
9. Schefflera ( Brassaia )
It prefers medium light but will be fuller if you put it in bright light next to a south - or west - facing window .
Also , let the soil dry between watering .
10 . Heart Leaf Philodendron ( Philondendron )
This plant is poisonous , but amazing at cleaning the air .
It requires little light or water and has few pest problems .
But , too much light will burn the leaves .
The FCC claims that its powers to inspect radio equipment in order to catch pirate radio stations means that it can also enter and search any home that has a WiFi access point , a cordless phone , a baby monitor , or a cell phone .
" Anything using RF energy — we have the right to inspect it to make sure it is not causing interference , " says FCC spokesman David Fiske .
That includes devices like Wi-Fi routers that use unlicensed spectrum , Fiske says .
The FCC claims it derives its warrantless search power from the Communications
Act of 1934 , though the constitutionality of the claim has gone untested in the courts .
That 's largely because the FCC had little to do with average citizens for most of the last 75 years , when home transmitters were largely reserved to ham - radio operators and CB - radio aficionados .
But in 2009 , nearly every household in the United States has multiple devices that use radio waves and fall under the FCC 's purview , making the commission 's claimed authority ripe for a court challenge .
" It is a major stretch beyond case law to assert that authority with respect to a private home , which is at the heart of the Fourth Amendment 's protection against unreasonable search and seizure , " says Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyer Lee Tien .
" When it is a private home and when you are talking about an over - powered Wi -Fi antenna — the idea they could just go in is honestly quite bizarre . "
Dear Straight Dope :
In my numerous online debates in various chatrooms , I have learned the following : many Christians seem to think that Adolf Hitler was an atheist ( or at least was n't " Christian " ) .
Of course I and my fellow atheists know better , as Hitler mentions his devotion to Christianity numerous times in his writings .
Can you clear this up for me ?
Was Hitler an " honest to God " Christian , or was he simply using religion as a means of control ?
Carl Stieger
David replies :
The short answer is a definite " maybe " or , more precisely , " probably neither . "
The looooong answer is somewhat more complicated .
You are right that Hitler did mention Christianity many times in his writings .
He paid Christianity a lot of lip service in Mein Kampf , and he claimed to be a Christian .
But Hitler ’s secretary , Martin Bormann , also declared that " National Socialism [ Nazism ] and Christianity are irreconcilable " and Hitler did n’t squawk too much about it .
Similarly , Hermann Rauschning , a Hitler associate , said , " One is either a Christian or a German .
You ca n’t be both . "
In addition , Hitler declared Nazism the state religion and the Bible was replaced by Mein Kampf in the schools .
You really want confusion ?
Randy
Alley , one of my best WWII history sources , noted that the SS were supposedly forbidden to believe in God–yet the military ’s belt buckles said " Gott mit uns " ( " God is with us " ) !
See photo , below .
First , let ’s look at what he said that seems to put him on the anti-Christian side :
According to a press release from Catholic League President , William A. Donohue ( 2/4/99 ) : " Hitler was a neo - pagan terrorist whose conscience was not informed by Christianity , but by pseudo - scientific racist philosophies .
Hitler hated the Catholic Church , made plans to kill the Pope , authorized the murder of thousands of priests and nuns , and did everything he could to suppress the influence of the Church .
In 1933 , Hitler said , ‘ It is through the peasantry that we shall really be able to destroy Christianity because there is in them a true religion rooted in nature and blood . ’"
The Catholic League also quoted Hitler , in a 4/23/99 Op - Ed ad in the New York Times , as saying , " Antiquity was better than modern times , because it did n’t know Christianity and syphilis . "
Ouch !
Unfortunately , the press release had no citations attached and the Catholic League did not include any reference to it in the package they sent when I asked about them .
The syphilis quote is cited as having come from Hitler ’s Third Reich : A Documentary History , by Louis Snyder , but they are quoting Patrick Buchanan quoting this book .
In other words , they may not have actually checked the source themselves ( if they did , why mention Buchanan ? ) .
This makes me a bit worried about the validity of both of these ( I have not been able to find the book to check on my own ) .
While this does n’t necessarily make them untrue , we have to recognize that there are a lot of bogus Hitler quotes floating around , some allegedly coming directly from Mein Kampf , for example .
The problem is that people who have actually read Mein Kampf find that they are n’t in there anywhere !
I ’m not saying these quotes fall into that category , but just a note to be wary of lots of the unsourced " quotes " that are around .
( I did my best to check out the various Mein Kampf quotes that I use here , including referencing a friend who actually plowed through the whole thing . )
That said , we can move on to some other relevant info .
Jehuda Bauer , Professor of Holocaust Studies at Hebrew University in Jerusalem , describes the real " god " of Hitler and the Nazis in his article , " The Trauma of the Holocaust : Some Historical Perspectives , " by saying : " " They wanted to go back to a pagan world , beautiful , naturalistic , where natural hierarchies based on the supremacy of the strong would be established , because strong equaled good , powerful equaled civilized .
The world did have a kind of God , the merciless God of nature , the brutal God of races , the oppressive God of hierarchies . "
In other words , definitely non-Christian .
Historian Paul Johnson wrote that Hitler hated Christianity with a passion , adding that shortly after assuming power in 1933 , Hitler told Hermann Rauschnig that he intended " to stamp out Christianity root and branch . "
As Hitler grew in power , he made other anti-Christian statements .
For example , he was quoted in Hitler : A Study in Tyranny , by Allan Bullock , as saying : " I ’ll make these damned parsons feel the power of the state in a way they would have never believed possible .
For the moment , I am just keeping my eye upon them : if I ever have the slightest suspicion that they are getting dangerous , I will shoot the lot of them .
This filthy reptile raises its head whenever there is a sign of weakness in the State , and therefore it must be stamped on .
We have no sort of use for a fairy story invented by the Jews . "
But in contrast to these quotes , some of Hitler ’s speeches definitely seem to put him in the Christian camp as a fighter against atheism .
For example , he said , on signing the Nazi-Vatican Concordat , April 26 , 1933 : " Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction , and a general moral instruction without religious foundation is built on air ; consequently all character training and religion must be derived from faith . . . "
An Associated Press article from the Lansing State Journal , February 23 , 1933 , is headlined , " Hitler Aims Blow at ‘ Godless ’ Move , " and talks about how Hitler was campaigning against atheist communists and wanted support from Catholic Nazis .
One line in the article specifically says , " Hitler , himself , is a Catholic . "
( You can see the entire article at http://www.infidels.org/library/his torical/unknown/hitler.html .)
In addition , in 1941 , Hitler told General Gerhart Engel : " I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so . "
He never left the church .
He was baptized a Roman Catholic as an infant and was a communicant and altar boy in his youth .
In a speech at Koblenz , August 26 , 1934 , Hitler said : " National Socialism neither opposes the Church nor is it anti-religious , but on the contrary it stands on the ground of a real Christianity . . .
For their interests cannot fail to coincide with ours alike in our fight against the symptoms of degeneracy in the world of today , in our fight against a Bolshevist culture , against atheistic movement , against criminality , and in our struggle for a consciousness of a community in our national life . . .
These are not anti-Christian , these are Christian principles ! "
Related to the above , the " Religion " article in The Oxford Companion to World War II notes that early on in his career , Hitler sponsored something called " practical Christianity , " and that " German Christians emerged who claimed to be able to synthesize the best of National Socialism [ Nazism ] and the best of Christianity .
Many Christians seemed to be able to reconcile themselves to at least certain aspects of anti-Semitic legislation .
Those who could not . . . often ended up in concentration camps . . .
Many anguished Christians serving in the Wehrmacht began to feel a little more comfortable about supporting a war that now included the overthrow of godless communism . "
Getting back to quotes , on October 24 , 1933 , in a speech in Berlin , Hitler said : " We were convinced that the people need and require this faith .
We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement , and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations : we have stamped it out . "
Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf : " I am convinced that I am acting as the agent of our Creator .
By fighting off the Jews .
I am doing the Lord ’s work . "
In 1938 , he quoted those same words in a Reichstag speech .
In a speech delivered April 12 , 1922 , published in " My New Order , " and quoted in Freethought Today ( April 1990 ) , Hitler said :
My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter .
It points me to the man who once in loneliness , surrounded only by a few followers , recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who , God ’s truth !
was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter .
In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders .
How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison .
Today , after two thousand years , with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross .
As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated , but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice . . .
And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly , it is the distress that daily grows .
For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people .
And when I look on my people I see them work and work and toil and labor , and at the end of the week they have only for their wages wretchedness and misery .
When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces , then I believe I would be no Christian , but a very devil , if I felt no pity for them , if I did not , as did our Lord two thousand years ago , turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exploited . " "
I could probably find more speeches in which Hitler claims himself to be a Christian , but I think the point has been made .
He said it .
Now , what did it mean ?
It seems Hitler , like many modern - day politicians , spoke out of both sides of his mouth .
And when he did n’t , his lackeys did .
It may have been political pandering , just like many of our current politicians who invoke God ’s name to gain support .
Also , it seems probable that Hitler , being the great manipulator , knew that he could n’t fight the Christian churches and their members right off the bat .
So he made statements to put the church at ease and may have patronized religion as a way to prevent having to fight the Christian - based church .
In fact , Anton Gil notes in his book , An Honourable Defeat : A History of German Resistance to Hitler , 1933 - 1945 : " For his part , Hitler naturally wanted to bring the church into line with everything else in his scheme of things .
He knew he dare not simply eradicate it : that would not have been possible with such an international organisation , and he would have lost many Christian supporters had he tried to .
His principal aim was to unify the German Evangelical Church under a pro-Nazi banner , and to come to an accommodation with the Catholics . "
In other words , while he was certainly evil , he also usually knew which wars he could win ( at least until 1941 ) and only fought those .
He knew he could beat the Polish , French , and British armies and he allegedly counseled the Japanese against attacking the U.S. ; he also requested that they open up a front against Russia .
He could n’t beat the church in open warfare–so he took control and then attacked them piecemeal while making statements to put them at ease .
Think about it –how many other times did Hitler break his word or ignore a treaty ?
He said whatever would make things easiest , and then ignored it later .
Author Doug Krueger notes that " so many Germans were religious believers that Hitler , if not religious himself , at least had to pretend to be a believer in order to gain support . "
He adds , " If the [ Christian ] message won converts , it would seem that most Nazis were probably [ Christians ] too .
After all , would appeal to divine mandate win more theists or atheists to the cause ? "
He also points out that " Even if Hitler was not a [ Christian ] , he could still have been a theist .
Or a deist " ( www.infidels.org/library /modern/doug_krueger/copin.html ) .
Remember that being a non-Christian is not equal to being an atheist .
When all is said and done , Krueger says that anecdotal evidence from those close to him near the end of his life suggests that he was a at least a deist , if not a theist .
Krueger concludes : " So here ’s what evidence we have .
There is a certain worldview , Nazism .
Its leader , Hitler , professes on many occasions to be religious , and he often states that he ’s doing the will of god .
The majority of his followers are openly religious .
There is no evidence anywhere that this leader ever professed to anyone that he is an atheist .
He and his followers actively campaign against atheism , even to the point of physical force , and this leader allies himself with religious organizations and churches .
This is the evidence .
So where does atheism fit in ? "
As Krueger notes , there seems to be no real evidence that Hitler was an atheist .
On the other hand , since one could never be sure when he was speaking his real thoughts and when he was simply riling up the masses , it ’s difficult to say for certain .
An interesting side note :
Two of my sources , both of whom are well - versed in WWII history , said something to the effect that Hitler acted as if he had a messianic complex and perhaps believed himself to essentially be a god or the messiah .
As one put it , you could certainly make the argument that he was a firm believer in God , if by " God " you mean " Adolf Hitler . "
As for your chat - room experiences , well , my friend and source David Gehrig noted that Hitler still sets the gold standard for " easiest rhetorical cheap shot . "
He related a comment from Usenet that there is an empirical law :
As a Usenet discussion gets longer , the probability that someone in it will compare someone else in it to Hitler asymptotically approaches 1 .
In other words , atheists looking for a quick cheap - shot may claim Hitler was a Christian ; similarly , Christians looking for a quick shot may claim he was an atheist .
Know what ?
Hitler was a vegetarian !
Oooh , those evil vegetarians !
He also recommended that parents give their children milk to drink instead of beer and started the first anti-smoking campaign .
( So by the " reasoning " used in these types of arguments , if you are truly anti-Hitler , you should smoke heavily and only give your baby beer ! )
Better watch out , though he was an oxygen - breather , too !
In other words , does it really matter whether Hitler was an atheist or a Christian or whatever ?
Just because somebody may hold a particular worldview ( along with other views ) does n’t make him a spokesman for that view , or even remotely representative of others who hold that view .
No matter how his madness is painted , he was still evil incarnate .
I have one more quote to share on this topic .
This , again , from David Gehrig : " Let ’s save the rhetorical comparisons to Hitler and Nazis for those who really deserve them –hate groups who proudly assume the Nazi mantle , and ‘ Holocaust revisionists ’ who would fantasize away Hitler ’s genocidal crimes . "

It 's been two weeks since the Pirate Bay trial came to an end - at least for now .
While the judge reviews the arguments presented by both sides , Torrent Freak caught up with Peter Sunde to look forward to the decision and review the tumultuous events of the past weeks .
In previous articles we ’ve covered the Pirate Bay trial in detail .
From the King Kong defense , through website screenshots as evidence , to flowers for the wife of one of the expert witnesses .
Now that things have settled down a little , we took the opportunity to ask one of the defendants some questions of our own .
We spoke with Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde about the trial and the future of the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker .
Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde
TF : Before the trial started , you said that it was going to be a theater – Hollywood style .
Looking back at recent weeks , did your predictions come true ?
Peter : Yeah , some days it was a really weird show outside !
A lot of stuff happened in secret too , and those events will probably come out in the documentary .
It ’s been great theater !
TF : Are you satisfied with how the trial played out ?
Do you still predict an EPIC WIN ?
Peter : Right now , yes .
I ’m very happy about it and I still predict an EPIC WIN for sure .
But you never know .
We expect a win but we ’re prepared for the worst case scenario , so that we do n’t get too beaten up if that happens .
TF : During the trial , the prosecution was heavily criticized for their lack of knowledge about BitTorrent , and how people use it to transfer files .
Would you agree with this ?
Peter : Yeah .
We actually presented our own video ‘ how - to ’ to the court during the final day , to make sure the jurors got the right knowledge on how it works .
The prosecution has tried to show BitTorrent as something bad and suspicious and we wanted to show that it ’s legitimate and has a broader use than just STEALING FILES FROM THE POOR COPYRIGHT LOBBY …
TF : A lot of people are worried about the future of The Pirate Bay .
However , the trial seems to be against four individuals , not against the site / tracker .
Worst case scenario :
Is there a possibility that people will have to do without TPB in the future ?
Peter :
If TPB is not used in the future , it is because there ’s a new technology available that makes TPB obsolete .
TF : Do you think there ’s a future for BitTorrent as it is now , or do you expect that file - sharing will change in the future ?
Peter : I think it will evolve of course , but BitTorrent is on the right path to stay relevant for a while .
The problem with a decentralized tracking system is that there ’s no way ( right now ) to keep spammers and IP - stealers away from the network , which one can do on TPB for instance .
Media Defender was a good example of that , TPB could find their IPs and lock them away rapidly without having to tell the users to update files .
Good solutions like that might appear in the future for end users , but it ’s still a long way off .
BitTorrent as a technology will be used for the actual sharing , or at least the basic concept of BitTorrent .
TF : There has been a lot of trial coverage online , both by traditional press and bloggers .
What are some of the positive and negative surprises ?
Peter : There were no real surprises .
The media coverage of TPB has been somewhat the same over the past years .
There are no secrets surrounding TPB that could come out and harm us , which keeps it easy to maintain a good relationship with the media .
I ’m just happy that people take part in the discussion about the Internet ’s future , which has been promoted to debate by this spectrial .
TF : We ’ve heard rumors that Anakata traveled to Cambodia after the trial .
Is he meeting King Kong there or is there another explanation ?
Peter : I ’m not sure if he ’s in Cambodia – he travels a bit for a customer that he ’s working with .
But , I think he ’s in Asia at least .
And yeah , he ’s probably drinking cider with King Kong one of these days .
TF : Finally , do you have any good advice for the judge while he ’s reviewing the case ?
Peter :
Do n’t trust the prosecution – they do n’t know what they ’re doing .

ANN : Takusen 0.8.4
ANN : Takusen 0.8.4
This is mainly a " get it working with ghc - 6.10 " release .
Changes since 0.8.3 : - ODBC support : some bug fixes , and basic support for Out - parameters .
There is at least one major outstanding bug with Out - parameters , where marshalling a String output bind - variable does n't work correctly ( if it was modified , you still get the String you passed in back , rather than the new String ) .
- Sqlite : bug fix for resource leak : if a command ( like rollback or commit ) raised an error , the prepared - statement handle was not closed .
- cabal : requires cabal 1.6 ( or later ) .
With ghc - 6.6 on Windows you will need a later cabal than 1.6.0.1 , as there is a bug which prevents building ( setup configure fails with " setup : fdGetMode : invalid argument ( Invalid argument ) " ) .
Eric Mertens patch for ODBC on OS x. Greg Leclerq patch for cabal 1.6 .
Thanks also to Austin Siepp and Brian Callendar for their patches .
- ghc - 6.10 : will build with ghc's 6.10 , 6.8 , 6.6 .
Note that Takusen wo n't work with ghc - 6.10.2 out - of - the - box , because the time package is missing .
If you install time manually then it should be OK ( but this is untested ) .
We use the new extensible exceptions , but we have done so by including it within our own source tree .
This will make it easier to use Takusen with older ghc's , and reduces the number of external package dependencies .
We have dropped support for 6.4 .
That 's not to say Takusen is n't usable with 6.4 , just that we no longer test that configuration .
The release bundle : http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/Takusen/0.8.4/Takusen-0.8.4.tar.gz
The latest code : darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/takusen
Docs : http://darcs.haskell.org/takusen/doc/html/index.html
If you have cabal - install , then this command should work : cabal install Takusen -- flags= " sqlite odbc oracle postgres " ... but it does n't ( at least for the version of cabal - install that I have ) because the .tar. gz file I uploaded has a bogus checksum .
A comprehensive description of API usage can be found in the documentation for module Database .
Enumerator ( look for the Usage section ) : http://darcs.haskell.org/takusen/doc/html/Database-Enumerator.html
Note that the haddock docs wo n't build with cabal - 1.6.0.2 or earlier .
This is because our literate - haskell source files need to be properly preprocessed before being passed to haddock .
At the time of writing , you 'll need the cabal HEAD to build the docs .
Future plans : - Output bind - parameters and multiple - result sets for ODBC - support for Blobs and Clobs - FreeTDS backend ( Sybase and MS Sql Server ) ... maybe
For those of you unfamiliar with Takusen , here is our HCAR blurb : Takusen is a DBMS access library .
Like HSQL and HDBC , we support arbitrary SQL statements ( currently strings , extensible to anything that can be converted to a string ) .
Takusen 's ' unique - selling - point ' is safety and efficiency .
We statically ensure all acquired database resources - such as cursors , connection and statement handles - are released , exactly once , at predictable times .
Takusen can avoid loading the whole result set in memory , and so can handle queries returning millions of rows in constant space .
Takusen also supports automatic marshalling and unmarshalling of results and query parameters .
These benefits come from the design of query result processing around a left - fold enumerator .
Currently we fully support ODBC , Oracle , Sqlite , and PostgreSQL .

It ’s mid-March , and the marble - walled hallway of the Dirksen Senate Office Building is scattered with lobbyists and congressional aides who are gathered in huddles of two and three , chatting in hushed tones .
Meetings like this are as much a fixture of Capitol Hill as the famous bean soup in the Senate dining room , but there is something decidedly peculiar going on today .
One of the lobbyists is doing the unthinkable .
She ’s lobbying for more oversight and regulation of lobbying , and she ’s throwing around the T - word ( “ transparency ” ) with abandon .
Her name is Lisa Rosenberg , and she ’s not your average influence peddler .
While most of her colleagues are hustling for corporate clients , Rosenberg , who works for the Sunlight Foundation , one of Washington ’s leading good - government groups , is pushing to keep her K Street compatriots in check .
“ I have no friends , ” the 42 - year - old says with a rueful smile .
“ My lobbyist colleagues are cringing at the things that I do . ”
But Rosenberg wants to be perfectly clear :
She is n’t anti-lobbyist .
On the contrary , she believes lobbying is a critical part of the democratic process , a way that lawmakers and their staffs are brought up to speed on the intricacies of issues they simply do n’t have the time to become expert in .
“ I will defend to the death the right of lobbyists to lobby , ” she says .
Rosenberg , a former aide to Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , just wishes this important work was done in plain view of the American public , who can be forgiven for believing the fix is in when so much of Washington ’s most important work happens behind the scenes .
Currently , lobbyists file reports with the federal government six times a year .
Two of them detail how much campaign cash they donated and to whom .
The other four , filed quarterly , disclose their clients , the amount they ’ve been paid , what bills and topics they ’re focusing on , and whether they lobbied the House , the Senate , or the executive branch .
To Rosenberg and other good - government advocates , it ’s a system that ’s riddled with flaws , allowing lobbyists to reveal the bare minimum about their interactions with lawmakers .
When a lobbyist meets with a government official , Rosenberg believes , he should be required to divulge the name of the employee , where this person works , and a detailed explanation of what was discussed .
And she wants a disclosure report filed every one or two days .
A paperwork - intensive proposition like this is a tough sell , but Rosenberg is convinced the disclosure process can be streamlined to the point that the requisite forms can be filled out on a BlackBerry during the ten - minute cab ride from Capitol Hill to K Street .
The prospect of this level of disclosure makes Dave Wenhold , president of the American League of Lobbyists ( ALL ) , shudder .
“ The thing about sunlight is , it can be great and shine light in corners , ” he says .
“ But it can also burn if you look at it too long .
Or it can give you cancer . ”
He calls the disclosure requirements Rosenberg is pushing “ unworkable ” and “ burdensome , ” lamenting , “ It ’d be kind of like going to your organization and saying , ‘ Tell me what you ’re doing here every two minutes .
I have a right to know . ’
I ’m not quite sure you do . ”
Wenhold believes elected officials bear the responsibility for disclosing whom they meet with , and insists that the Sunlight Foundation and other good - government groups are pushing the burden of disclosure onto lobbyists because they know lawmakers will never agree to do it themselves .
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - N.Y. ) , who was named in January to fill Hillary Clinton ’s vacated Senate seat , is an exception .
While serving in the House , Gillibrand was one of very few members to post her daily schedule online .
This would seem to make her a natural ally for Rosenberg , and when I accompanied the petite lobbyist on a visit to the Hill one day this spring , one of her meetings was with a Gillibrand staffer .
“ The Senator has been great for us , ” she began , referring to Gillibrand ’s self - imposed transparency standards .
“ People can see when she meets with a lobbyist .
We do n’t think that should be voluntary . ”
She launched into her spiel about the inadequacy of lobbying reports .
“ We ’d like to see better reporting . ”
The staffer cocked an eyebrow .
“ Who would report ? ”
“ I would report , you would report , ” Rosenberg responded .
She could see the paperwork piling up behind the staffer ’s eyes .
“ That ’s a long - term goal , ” she said quickly , moving on to other issues .
Rosenberg asked the staffer ( who requested anonymity in exchange for letting me listen in ) if Gillibrand might be interested in joining the Sunlight Foundation ’s campaign to get bills published online three days before Congress debates them , so that the public ( and , yes , lawmakers themselves ) can read them well before they come to a vote .
“ We ’re looking for a champion in the Senate , ” Rosenberg said hopefully .
The staffer nodded and jotted some notes .
Then Rosenberg brought up S. 482 , a bill that requires Senate candidates to file their campaign fundraising reports electronically , like House and presidential candidates .
“ We ’re hoping that your boss can join us as a cosponsor , ” she said .
At some point , the staffer closed her notebook while Rosenberg was mid-sentence , indicating that the meeting had come to an end .
Sitting in Dirksen ’s basement cafeteria later , Rosenberg told me she was pleased with the outcome of the meeting , even though she received no commitments .
“ They ’re never going to commit to anything , ” she said .
“ It could embarrass the boss . ”
She ’ll follow up with a phone call in a few days , perhaps try to schedule another meeting .
In the meantime , Rosenberg will traverse the Hill , reciting her transparency pitch to other congressional staffers in the hopes that her issues will eventually get the ear of a sympathetic lawmaker .
Attempting to reform the long - standing ways of Washington , where furtiveness has become standard operating procedure , is lonely work .
But Rosenberg insists she ’s not out to be K Street ’s party pooper , though her colleagues in the industry may think otherwise .
“ We ’re reining in the party , ” she says .
“ Maybe it ’s not a wild kegger with a live band anymore .
Maybe it ’s a cocktail party with classical music piped in . ”
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia —
On a recent Saturday morning about a hundred Saudis gathered in a hotel conference room , men on one side of a screen and women on the other .
They had convened to measure progress over the past year in tackling a problem new to public discourse in this country : domestic violence against wives and children .
The group comprised judges , policemen , physicians , human rights workers and officials from government departments such as justice , health and social affairs .
Among them was the woman who perhaps has done most to bring domestic violence out of the closet and into the Saudi sunshine : Princess Adela bint Abdullah , a daughter of King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz .
It is not unusual for Saudi royal princesses to lend their support and influence to worthy causes in a low profile manner .
But Princess Adela seems intent on breaking the mold :
She has not only involved herself in a highly controversial issue , she has taken an active public role in raising awareness about the problem .
“ She ’s different in her awareness of the role that royals could play in public life , ” said Fawziah al - Bakr , a women ’s activist and professor at King Saud University .
“ If you hear of any program to help women and children , you will find Princess Adela there . ”
During the workshop , Princess Adela sat with the other women to discuss the progress made since March 2008 , when the country ’s first public debate on domestic abuse was held — with the princess as keynote speaker .
A few hours later , she joined two Saudi physicians active in the battle against domestic abuse to hold a press conference .
It is rare for a female member of the royal family , no less the king ’s daughter , to take questions from the press .
“ The biggest achievement ” of the past year , the princess said , had been the increased coordination of all government ministries “ to stop the phenomenon of family violence .
Now we have partners in all sectors and that is an achievement . ”
But this coordination needs improvement , she added , suggesting the establishment of a new government agency dedicated to family concerns .
In an interview with the Arab News , the princess was more specific .
“ In order to fight violence , ” she said , “ certain things should be taken into account like defining neglect and abuse .
Reporting violence and abuse should be compulsory and there should be a witness protection program .
All that of course has to be done with full regard and consideration for confidentiality . ”
The seminal event for bringing spousal abuse into the open was last year ’s forum .
It was organized by the National Family Safety Program , an agency created by royal decree with the mandate to develop a national strategy for preventing family violence .
Princess Adela serves as the program ’s vice chair .
One of the program ’s goals is to encourage Saudi women to speak out about abuse .
This is increasingly occurring , according to Haifa A. al - Ashaikh , media coordinator of the program .
" Day after day we see lots of ladies here are getting more vocal , " said Ashaikh , adding that this occurred as they realized that " they do have the ability to disagree with whatever they think is unfair to them . "
There are no reliable national statistics on the incidence of domestic violence — either against children or women — in the kingdom , which was identified as a major problem during the recent workshop .
However , in just the area of Riyadh , the program has dealt with 150 family violence cases since 2006 , Ashaikh said .
They included physical abuse ( 40 percent ) , sexual abuse ( 17 percent ) and neglect ( 40 percent ) .
Besides the need for better statistics , workshop attendees also cited other problems , including a lack of shelters for abuse victims , the need for clear definitions of abuse , and more education in schools and the media about the problem .
They also complained about “ misunderstandings ” about what Islamic law , or Shariah , says in regard to family violence .
Maha al - Muneef , a pediatrician who serves as executive director of the program , addressed this issue at the press conference .
“ Unfortunately , there are some wrong understandings of the Shariah , whether it relates to disciplinary beatings ... or the relation between family members , that do n't serve our objective of stopping the problem of family violence , ” she said .
It is crucial that these misunderstandings be corrected , she added .
Many Muslim men , backed by mostly male Islamic religious scholars , contend that Islamic scriptures permit light physical violence against wives and children as a disciplinary measure .
These interpretations are increasingly challenged by other Muslims , especially women .
The 2008 conference on domestic abuse recommended that Saudi religious authorities issue an unequivocal religious opinion , or fatwa , on violence in the family as part of the national campaign to stop abuse .
That has not been forthcoming .
The lack of such a fatwa is a major obstacle to changing social attitudes toward what is acceptable use of physical force within the family .
Those attitudes made headlines recently during a public seminar on the role of courts and police in preventing domestic violence that took place in the far southwest Saudi town of Abha .
In remarks to the forum , a Saudi judge declared that men could slap their wives for certain behavior , such as extravagant shopping .
For example , if a man gives his wife $ 320 and she spends $ 240 on a dress “ and if her husband slaps her on the face as a reaction to her action , she deserves that punishment , ” said Judge Hamad al - Razine , according to the Arab News .
Razine added that women ’s indecent behavior and use of offensive words against their husbands were a reason for rising domestic violence .
And yet , he complained , “ nobody puts even a fraction of blame on ” women , the paper reported .
One of the women listening to the judge was Princess Adela .

The setup is surprisingly complex : A natural gas sensor does the sniffing ; an Arduino does the thinking ; an Squidbee wireless module does the communicating ;
Twitter does the sharing .
It 's a feat , to be sure .

JERUSALEM , May 4 ( UPI ) -- Israeli President Shimon
Peres says the sovereignty of Christian sites in Israel should be turned over to the Vatican , a gesture facing strong opposition .
A spokesman for Interior Minister Eli Yishai said he was not prepared to give up Israeli sovereignty , " even if it is only symbolic , " Haaretz reported Monday .

Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov questioned the proposal from Peres , saying there are no guarantees such a " great gift " would increase tourism by Christian pilgrims , Haaretz reported .
" If we were sure that this great gift to the Christian world would bring millions of Christian pilgrims here , then we would have a good reason to think about ( agreeing to the demand ) , " Misezhnikov said .
" But since we are not certain that this will happen , why should we hand out gifts ? "
The issue has resurfaced as Israel prepares for a visit from Pope Benedict XVI next week .
The Vatican has requested sovereignty over six sites in Israel including the Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth , Mount Tabor and Jerusalem 's Coenaculum on Mount Zion , the reported location of Jesus Christ 's Last Supper .
The Jerusalem Post said the remaining Christian sites in Israel being sought by the Vatican are the Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem and the Church of the Multiplication .

Police in one American city have a new ally in the fight against crime - whether they want it or not .
A self - proclaimed superhero has taken to the streets of Cincinnati .
His bizarre costume may be home - made and he may not be able to leap over tall buildings in a single bound , but ' Shadow Hare ' has warned criminals ' they have nowhere to hide ' .
At just 5ft 7ins tall and weighing in at about 10 stone , the mystery crime fighter wo n't have many law - breakers quaking in their boots .
Which perhaps explains why Shadow Hare arms himself with handcuffs , a taser and pepper spray - all legal in the city - as he patrols the streets .
All that is known about the so - called superhero 's identity is that he is 21 years old and hails from the town of Milford , Ohio .
He also claims to have been abused as a child and to have grown up in foster homes .
'We help enforce the law by doing what we can in legal standards , so we carry handcuffs , pepper spray , all the legal weapons , ' said the crusading vigilante in a distinctive squeaky voice .
'We will do citizen 's arrests .
We will intervene on crimes if there is one happening in front of us .
' Like his comic - book role models , Shadow Hare recognises there are risks that come with the job : two years ago he dislocated his shoulder trying to help a woman who was being attacked .
' My message to Cincinnati is that there is still hope and all we have to do is stand together , ' he added .
Surprisingly , Shadow
Hare is not the only ' superhero ' determined to help out the police .
He claims to head a group of supermen - and one superwoman - who call themselves the ' Allegiance of Heroes ' .
Shadow
Hare said : ' I 've teamed up with " Mr Extreme " in San Diego and we were trying to track down a rapist .
' Perhaps tellingly , the Allegiance of Heroes communicate with each other in online forums .
They often team up to patrol the streets .
Other members include ' Wall Creeper ' in Colorado , ' Master Legend ' in Florida , and ' Aclyptico ' in Pennsylvania .
Four associates recently assembled in front of the press , who filmed them as they went about such duties as feeding Cincinnati 's homeless .
Immediately noticeable was that the Allegiance of Heroes do n't keep themselves in peak - or anywhere near peak - physical condition .
In a posting on his MySpace blog , Shadow Hare writes : ' We have just gotten started , we are nowhere near over yet .
We will fight tooth and nail to make this world a much better place .
'The Allegiance has assembled ... people are starting to know ... criminals and corrupt people will run out of places to hide .
'We are going to give the people the last laugh .
Just wait and see . '
US and China ' vow to avoid rows '
The gestures were warm , but tensions over the naval incident remain
The US and China will work together to avoid more confrontations in the future , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has told reporters .
She was speaking after meeting China 's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi - but the dispute over a weekend confrontation in the South China Sea is rumbling on .
Meanwhile , Mrs Clinton warned North Korea could face " a range of options " if it goes ahead with a missile test .
Mr Yang is in Washington , and will meet US President Barack Obama on Thursday .
" We have each stated our positions , but the important point of agreement coming out of my discussions with Minister Yang is that we must work hard in the future to avoid such incidents and to avoid this particular incident having consequences that are unforeseen , " Mrs Clinton told reporters after her meeting with Mr Yang .

She said his visit was a " very positive " development and that she looked forward to building a " positive , co-operative and comprehensive relationship " .
SOUTH CHINA SEA TENSIONS Territorial claims from China , the Philippines , Taiwan , Brunei , Vietnam and Malaysia overlap in resource - rich sea Hosts some of the world 's busiest shipping lanes China says the US was in its Exclusive Economic Zone - but the two sides disagree on what activities are allowed in an EEZ Earlier , Mr Yang said he was in Washington " to get prepared for our two heads of state 's meeting in London [ for a G20 summit in April ] and to work together to push our relations forward " , according to China 's official news agency Xinhua - but he made no reported mention of the maritime dispute .
Despite the warm words , the dispute over the incident remains unresolved .
The Pentagon says five Chinese ships harassed an unarmed US navy surveillance vessel in a dangerous manner while it was on routine operations in international waters 75 miles ( 120 km ) south of Hainan island .
But China called the US complaint " totally inaccurate " and accused it of breaking international law by operating in its Exclusive Economic Zone ( EEZ ) .
The US ship had behaved " like a spy " and China 's action was " totally within our rights " , state media quoted senior naval officials as saying .
The boundaries of China 's EEZ remain disputed , while Beijing and Washington differ on which activities are permitted by law within a nation 's EEZ .
China has a key submarine base on Hainan island .
North Korea Speaking to reporters , Mrs Clinton also warned that Washington had " a range of options " it could take if North Korea goes ahead with a widely anticipated long - range missile test - including , Reuters reported , action in the UN Security Council .
She said the six - way talks on North Korea 's nuclear programme would not be affected .
Mrs Clinton also expressed disappointment that a US special envoy who 's just visited the region was not invited to Pyongyang .
North Korea insists it is preparing to launch a satellite , not a missile , and has said any attempt to shoot it down will result in war .
North Korea 's nuclear programme , the global recession and the threat of climate change are among the issues likely to be covered in the US - Chinese talks .
Mr Yang was also due to meet Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday , followed by President Obama on Thursday .

ACLU fears Obama Administration may destroy evidence at CIA ' black sites ' Greg Fulton
Published : Wednesday April 15 , 2009
Print This Email This
The Bush Administration 's legacy of torture interrogation may dip further into obscurity if the Obama Administration 's vow to decommission overseas detention black sites means evidence of torture would be destroyed .
That 's the fear the ACLU is voicing in a little - publicized letter this week to preserve any and all evidence relating to the recently - disclosed CIA black sites where terrorism suspects were held .
Days ago , it was reported that Spanish officials would seek indictments against members of the Bush Administration for allegedly authorizing torture , and a Wall Street Journal article claimed that the current administration " is leaning toward keeping secret some graphic details of tactics allowed in Central Intelligence Agency interrogations . "
" Among the details in the still - classified memos is approval for a technique in which a prisoner 's head could be struck against a wall as long as the head was being held and the force of the blow was controlled by the interrogator , according to people familiar with the memos , " the paper reported .
" Another approved tactic was waterboarding , or simulated drowning . "
The ACLU letter specifically wants evidence preserved on behalf of a detainee currently held in Guantanamo , and was sent directly to CIA Director Leon Panetta .
" Although we welcome your decision to cease the secret detention and mistreatment of prisoners of the United States Government , we are concerned that the CIA intends to actually destroy the sites including the buildings and the equipment used to interrogate and torture Mr. Al - Nashiri before Mr. Al - Nashiri has had the opportunity to fully investigate his conditions of confinement , " the civil liberties group wrote in the letter to Panetta , referring to their client , Abd Al - Rahim Hussain Mohammed al - Nashiri , a former detainee .
" We write to avoid the destruction of more evidence namely the actual secret facilities themselves . "
The CIA has admitted waterboarding al - Nashiri during this detention , which lasted from 2002 to 2006 , while he was funneled to multiple black sites .
He has since been held at Guantanamo beginning in September of 2006 .
The agency later admitted they 'd destroyed recordings of his interrogation .
Panetta announced Apr. 9 he would close the secret facilities .
Lawyers say al - Nashiri was housed in three holding sites during four years .
The letter requests that all buildings , interrogation cells , prisoner cells , shackles , water boards " and other equipment " be preserved .
Technically , attorneys say the preservation of torture devices gives al - Nashiri due process to discovery evidence under the U.S. Constitution should he be tried domestically .
" Effectively the CIA ' disappeared ' him for four years while it tortured him at will and beyond the eyes of the world , " states the letter , which is printed in full below .
A native of Saudi Arabia , al - Nashiri was implicated in the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole .
The Bush Administration labeled him a high - value detainee .
Panetta 's office has not commented on the request .
The full text of letter follows .
April 13 , 2009
Leon E. Panetta
Director , Central Intelligence Agency
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington , DC 20505
RE : REQUEST TO PRESERVE CIA DETENTION FACILITIES USED TO DETAIN HIGH -VALUE DETAINEESA.K.A. " BLACK SITES "
Dear Mr. Panetta :
We are counsel for Abd Al - Rahim Hussain Mohammed Al - Nashiri .
Mr. Al - Nashiri is currently detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base .
He has been there since September , 2006 .
From sometime in late 2002 until 2006 he was incarcerated in the secret prison facilities run by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .
Your predecessor , General Michael V. Hayden , has admitted that Mr. Al - Nashiri was subjected to water boarding , which is a form of torture , while in the custody of the CIA .
According to the publicly released report from the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) which was dated February 14 , 2007 , and entitled ICRC Report on the Treatment of Fourteen " High Value Detainees " in CIA Custody , water boarding was only one of the many forms of torture inflicted on Mr. Al - Nashiri while in the custody of the CIA .
According to that report , while in CIA custody , Mr. Al - Nashiri was also forced to stand with his wrists shackled to a bar in the ceiling for prolonged periods of time extending to several days  and was threatened with sodomy and with the rape and arrest of his family members .
Many of the prisoners the ICRC interviewed did not want their names used in the report .
As such , though the ICRC report lists much more cruel , degrading and inhuman treatment , the report is not specific as to what additional treatment was inflicted on Mr. Al - Nashiri while held in the CIA 's " black " sites .
Throughout that time he was not able to communicate with his family , a lawyer or anyone .
Effectively the CIA " disappeared " him for four years while it tortured him at will and beyond the eyes of the world .
The CIA and other government agencies also admitted to the purposeful destruction of at least ninety - two video tapes of interrogations and observations of prisoners in its black sites , specifically including the destruction of video tapes of water boarding and other observations of Mr. Al - Nashiri .
Had Mr. Al - Nashiri known that the CIA possessed these video tapes and intended to destroy them , he would have demanded their preservation .
However , neither he , his lawyers nor the courts learned of the CIA 's plan until after the tapes had been destroyed and now they are forever gone .
In light of the destruction of video taped evidence of the torture inflicted upon Mr. Al - Nashiri and the newly released report from the ICRC describing still more horrific tortures , we noted with interest your message to CIA personnel on April 9 , 2009 , in which you stated that the CIA would be " decommissioning " the CIA secret facilities .
Although we welcome your decision to cease the secret detention and mistreatment of prisoners of the United States Government , we are concerned that the CIA intends to actually destroy the sites including the buildings and the equipment used to interrogate and torture Mr. Al - Nashiri before Mr. Al - Nashiri has had the opportunity to fully investigate his conditions of confinement .
We write to avoid the destruction of more evidence namely the actual secret facilities themselves .
Mr. Al - Nashiri was charged in the Military Commission with offenses that carried the penalty of death .
Although those charges have now been dismissed , we fully expect the government to prosecute Mr. Al - Nashiri and again charge him with offenses that could carry the death penalty .
In fact the government is now actively working to determine in what forum he will be prosecuted .
Regardless of the forum in which Mr. Al - Nashiri is tried , evidence of his conditions of confinement will be relevant in assessing the reliability of any of his statements and any statements of other prisoners similarly held that the government plans to use against him .
This evidence will also be highly relevant during any sentencing proceeding .
It is exculpatory evidence under Brady v. Maryland , 373 U.S. 83 ( 1963 ) , and he will be entitled to it .
The CIA 's secret prison facilities and the inquisition - like treatment meted out to its prisoners were a tragic , immoral and illegal period in our history that we all hope has come to an end .
But its effects are enduring , especially on someone like Mr. Al - Nashiri who , according to the ICRC report , lived through the horror chambers of at least three different secret prisons .
Those buildings , interrogation cells , prisoner cells , shackles , water boards and other equipment must be preserved until such time as we have an adequate opportunity to document it and a court can determine the relevance and materiality of this evidence .
As a criminal defendant , the Fifth , Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution will entitle him to discovery of exculpatory evidence and this is surely exculpatory evidence .
Therefore , we are requesting that you preserve all the secret sites .
By this letter you are now on notice that we will be seeking discovery and inspection of this highly relevant evidence in whatever court Mr. Al - Nashiri finds himself .
We have already lost the video tapes which would have allowed a jury to see what happened to Mr. Al - Nashiri in those secret prisons .
We cannot lose the remaining tangible evidence of the actual prisons themselves and the instruments of torture within them .

Since every party always seems to wind up in the kitchen , it makes sense to have a ready to serve beer tap located there .
So how to accomplish this task ?
Enter the ASKO HomePub and its unique combination of refrigerator , freezer , and draught beer system .
It allows you to experience the convenience and pleasure of draught beer in the comfort of your own home !
An extra storage shelf is designated space for two five - liter kegs and lets you chill an extra keg while you drink the first .
If that ’s not enough , it comes with all the normal bells and whistles , plus an anti-bacterial system , electronic thermostat that guarantees perfect operating performance , and a CO2 cartridge and tap are designed right into the door for maximum refrigerator storage .
All wrapped in a stainless steel package .
In short , its a fridge for a real man .
That is if you can find it .
To my knowledge it has only appeared in Europe .
Here ’s what it looks like in full view :
and here ’s the view of just the inside :
Quaternions are two things : an extension of the complex numbers and a handy way of representing rotations in computer graphics .
I ’m only covering the first one here .
This actually was n’t covered at GDC , probably because you do n’t actually have to understand quaternions to look up the algorithms for using them .
I like being complete .
i2 = - 1
i is the square root of negative one .
They teach that in algebra 1 ( or maybe it ’s algebra 2 ) .
Complex numbers are numbers that have i in them ; they look like a + bi , as if i were a variable .
( 3i ) * ( 4i ) = 12i2 = - 12 .
Quaternions are complex numbers except that they have 3 magic letters instead of 1 ; the familiar i , as well as j and k .
Imaginative , I know .
In quaternions i is n’t the square root of negative one .
It ’s a square root of negative one .
So are j and k .
i2 = j2 = k2 = - 1
There are a couple more rules for Quats , but really not that many :
ij = k ji = -k jk = i kj = - i ki = j ik = -j
Notice that ij != ji .
Multiplication is not commutative ( in fact it ’s anti-commutative ; ab = - ba .
These rules are enough to multiply two quats , via one big distribution :
( a 1 + b 1 i + c 1 j + d 1 k ) ( a 2 + b 2 i + c 2 j + d 2 k)
= a 1 ( a 2 + b 2 i + c 2 j + d 2 k)
+ b 1 i(a 2 + b 2 i + c 2 j + d 2 k)
+ c 1 j(a 2 + b 2 i + c 2 j + d 2 k)
+ d 1 j(a 2 + b 2 i + c 2 j + d 2 k)
= a 1 a 2 + a 1 b 2 i + a 1 c 2 j + a 1 d 2 k
+ b 1 a 2 i + b 1 b 2 i2 + b 1 c 2 ij + b 1 d 2 ik
+ c 1 a 2 j + c 1 b 2 ji + c 1 c 2 j2 + c 1 d 2 jk
+ d 1 a 2 k + d 1 b 2 ki + d 1 c 2 kj + d 1 d 2 k2
= a 1 a 2 + a 1 b 2 i + a 1 c 2 j + a 1 d 2 k
+ b 1 a 2 i - b 1 b 2 + b 1 c 2 k - b 1 d 2 j
+ c 1 a 2 j - c 1 b 2 k - c 1 c 2 + c 1 d 2 i
+ d 1 a 2 k + d 1 b 2 j - d 1 c 2 i - d 1 d 2
= ( a 1 a 2 - b 1 b 2 - c 1 c 2 - d 1 d 2 )
+ ( a 1 b 2 + b 1 a 2 + c 1 d 2 - d 1 c 2 ) i
+ ( a 1 c 2 - b 1 d 2 + c 1 a 2 + d 1 b 2 ) j
+ ( a 1 d 2 + b 1 c 2 - c 1 b 2 + d 1 a 2 )

President Obama 's decision to kick off his first official visit to California with a town hall meeting in Orange County says it all : Change really has come to the hard - core Republican stronghold .
" This ain't your father 's Orange County , " Democratic strategist and former Clinton White House spokesman Roger Salazar said with a laugh about the president 's two - day trip to Southern California , which begins today .
" It shows just how far we 've come in California , just how blue the state has gotten , that Orange County - one of the strongest Republican bastions - is now one of the strongest Democratic bases . "
Obama begins his visit with a 4 p.m. town hall meeting at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa .
In a departure from many political events in the area hosted by former President George W. Bush , tickets were made available to the public .
On Thursday , he will hold another open town hall meeting in Los Angeles to listen to voters ' concerns about economic issues .
Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , campaigning for a slate of budget reform measures on the May 19 special election ballot , also will attend .
The president , underscoring his support of green technologies and environmental issues , also will visit the Edison International Vehicle Electrics Plant , which produces electric cars , in Pomona ( Los Angeles County ) on Thursday .
And then - another departure - he 'll head to Burbank to appear on " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , " marking the first time a sitting president has occupied the guest 's chair on a popular late - night television talk show .
Criticism on economy
Obama 's decision to hit California , the nation 's political ATM and a solidly blue state , comes at a time when the White House is taking intense heat on economic issues - particularly the bonuses paid to executives of bailed - out insurance giant AIG .
He arrives in California with plenty of reminders of the economic problems on the front burner in the state , too , with the jobless rate at 10.1 percent and Southern California particularly hard hit by the foreclosure and housing crisis .
Obama 's decision to premiere his chief executive tour in Orange County , a major economic engine in a troubled state , is a statement of its own , some political observers say .
An essay in Newsweek magazine suggests that the bustling county , once the symbol of California 's business and consumer - driven energy and optimism , has turned the corner culturally and has lost its conservative luster .
" In a slew of popular TV shows - ' The O.C. , ' ' Laguna Beach , ' ' The Real Housewives of Orange County ' - the county was depicted as a haven for America 's empty overclass , " the Newsweek essay noted this week .
" ' Arrested Development ' followed the hapless Bluths , who drink and spend and party even as they squander their fortune .
The idea of Orange County , then , was no longer one of smart conservatism , but the worst kinds of Bush - era excess . "
Cradle of conservatism
Today , some California experts say the region , the birthplace of Republican conservatism and a place where legions of GOP voters gave crucial , early political boosts to candidates such as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan , is morphing into a very different place .
" It 's got a very strong Latino population , a very strong labor presence , " said Salazar .
" And it 's gone from being represented ( in Congress ) by Bob ' B - 1 ' Dornan , " a very conservative voice , to a pair of Democratic Latinas , sisters who now represent nearby districts in the U.S. House of Representatives : Rep. Loretta Sanchez of Garden Grove ( Orange County ) and her sister , Rep. Linda Sanchez , of Lakewood ( Los Angeles County ) .
Salazar said Obama 's strategy is clear in choosing Southern California for his stage this week .
" I think this is a state that 's very important to the president ... especially given the economic circumstances we 're facing , " he said .
" As California goes , so goes the nation .
And , if he can help turn the economy around in California , that will cascade all over the country . "
Republicans are ready
But some Republicans insist Obama will still have plenty to answer for at those town hall meetings .
" There will be some individuals there asking why AIG got $ 165 billion and others got foreclosure notices ... how is the regular Californian being helped out ( by his policies ) ? " asked Hector Barajas , spokesman for the state Republican Party .
" We just sent out 9,000 pink slips to California teachers - and he 's about to go on the Jay Leno show ?
It just shows the lack of priorities of this president . "
While Obama - the head of the Democratic Party - gives a nod to the power and influence of Orange County and Southern California as a key battleground for voters and campaign donations , Republicans appear to be preparing their comeback : Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele plans on visiting Southern California in the next two weeks for his own series of town hall sessions , sources said .
ST . LOUIS ( AP ) — Mickey Carroll , a St. Louis actor who was one of the last surviving Munchkins from the 1939 film “ The Wizard of Oz , ” died Thursday at the home of his caretaker in suburban Crestwood , Mo .
He was 89 and until January had lived in his own home in suburban Bel - Nor .
His death was announced by his caretaker , Linda Dodge .
Mr. Carroll was one of more than 100 adults and children who played the natives of Munchkinland .
“ Oz ” was his only appearance in a film , and it was followed by decades of recognition .
After the film was shown on television , he began appearing at charitable , retail and Oz - related events .
“ It ’s not me ; it ’s the movie , ” Mr. Carroll said .
“ When they see me , they think of their childhood , and it makes them smile . ”

Mr. Carroll was born Michael Finocchiaro on July 8 , 1919 , in St. Louis , the son of Italian immigrants .
He danced in local theaters and worked in Chicago clubs and in vaudeville .
He did radio ads and radio shows with George Burns , Gracie Allen , Jack Benny and Al Jolson .
The Office of the US Trade Representative ( USTR ) released its annual Special 301 report ( PDF ) on Thursday , which discusses the adequacy and effectiveness of IP protections by US trading partners .
As usual , China , Russia , Chile , and India topped the list when it came to concerns over piracy .
But this time , the USTR gave some extra love to our neighbors to the north by elevating Canada from the regular " Watch List " to the " Priority Watch List " for the first time .
First , though , let 's look at the usual suspects .
The USTR acknowledged that China is paying increased attention to IP rights as of late , but that the continued goal in significantly reducing infringement throughout China has not been met .
" China ’s IPR enforcement regime remains largely ineffective and non-deterrent , " wrote the USTR .
The report goes so far as to say that China 's officials may be concerned about their job security during the latest economic slowdown and , as such , have encouraged more lenient enforcement of IP laws .
On the upside , the USTR says that China went to " unprecedented lengths " to crack down on unauthorized transmissions of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 , though overall piracy and counterfeiting levels remained " unacceptably high . "
Russia sits in a similar position as China , with piracy and counterfeiting remaining core concerns for content creators .
" Despite having closed down some illegal websites offering pirated music , many more have sprung up in their place , " notes the USTR , no doubt referencing the notorious AllofMP3 and its kin .
Now we finally get to blame the Great White North .
Canada , which has consistently made the regular Watch List in recent years , was elevated to the Priority Watch List with the likes of China and Russia for the first time in the 2009 report .
The reason Canada got this special treatment , it appears , is the country 's " failure to accede to and implement the WIPO Internet Treaties " that it signed in 1997 , as well as allegedly not delivering on its promises to improve IP rights protections and enforcement .
This , as pointed out by University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist , is despite Canada 's enacting anticamcording laws in 2007 and the fact that Canada has joined the US as a third party in the WTO copyright complaint against China .
In fact , Canada does not even recognize the USTR's Special 301 Report process ; officials argue that the report lacks objective analysis .
In 2007 , the House of Commons reiterated that it does n't think very highly of the USTR 's list : " We have repeatedly raised this issue of the lack of objective analysis in the 301 watch list process with our US counterparts .
I also recognize that the US industry likes to compare anyone they have a problem with , concerning their IPR regime , to China and the other big violators , but we 're not on the same scale . "
The US - based International Intellectual Property Alliance ( IIPA ) also targeted Canada earlier this year for special attention as a " priority " offender ( in addition to China , Russia , and 35 others ) .
The IIPA represents the BSA , ESA , MPAA , RIAA , and other major copyright business groups , however , and does as much as it can to influence the 301 process .
It comes as no surprise , then , that the IIPA was pleased with the USTR 's 2009 list .
" Special 301 is a critical tool by which the US government has been able to secure improved copyright protection and enforcement as well as fair and equitable market access with our trading partners , " said IIPA representative Eric H. Smith in a statement issued Thursday .
" We commend USTR for the decision to elevate Canada to the Priority Watch List .
Canada remains woefully behind the rest of the developed world ( and many countries in the developing world as well ) in adopting critical legislation that will facilitate the development of a healthy online marketplace for copyright materials . "
The IFPI nodded in sad agreement : " It is very unfortunate but correct that Canada has been placed on the United States Special 301 list of countries that offer inadequate protection for intellectual property , " the music group said in a statement .

Leaning against a creamy white war monument on the 1,200 - hectare Alderville First Nation reserve north of Cobourg , Wayne Beaver wonders how long his ancestors ' land will remain in his people 's hands .
They 've survived decimation by disease and discrimination , but now Canada 's native people are facing what Beaver calls " a legislated extinction of status Indians . "
Statistics that show the self - identified aboriginal population is growing fast – a 45 per cent jump over 10 years to 1.2 million – can be deceiving , said Beaver .
Under Canadian law , those who " count " are " status Indians " – a group strictly defined by the Indian Act .
Many First Nations communities will die out within a few generations , in terms of registered Indians .
That 's because the " two - generation cut - off " created when the Indian Act was revised in 1985 stipulates only children born of two Indian status parents inherit status .
Because of intermarriage , some communities will see their last status Indian born as soon as 2012 .
" Status matters , because all our funding is tied to how many status Indians we have in our nation , " said Beaver , 69 , whose 1,000 - member community expects to see its last status Indians born in 2032 .
" What happens to the land when there is no more ( status ) Indians ?
The reserve would be returned to ... the federal government .
Eventually , we will lose our land and everything that we call ours now . "
Bill C - 31 was passed in response to a formal censure by the United Nations , which decried the old law 's practice of discriminating against Indian women : Women lost their status when they married a non-status person .
Men did not .
But instead of opening the doors to the non-status partners of aboriginal women – a move that would have hugely increased Ottawa 's financial obligations – the amendments ensured that men and women suffered equal losses .
The new law extended Indian status and its accompanying rights , benefits and services – such as tax immunity , health benefits and reserve housing – to just one more generation by creating two classes of " status Indians " : the 6 (1 ) Indian who has two status parents , and the 6 ( 2 ) , who was born in a union of a status person with a non-status person .
If a 6 ( 2 ) marries a non-status spouse , their children are deemed to be non-status .
The result , warns Six Nations Chief Bill Montour , could be " the biggest land grab of the century . "
Last May , the Anishinabek Nation Grand Council , which represents 47,000 people from 42 nations , appointed Jeannette Corbiere Lavell as its first citizenship commissioner to help establish and define the Nation 's own form of citizenship and issue its own citizenship cards , among other things .
" I can think of no other issue as crucial for our future or as fundamental to our Nation as citizenship , " Grand Council Chief John Beaucage said at the time . "
It is not my ( government - issued ) status card that tells me I am Anishinabe .
The legacy of my forefathers , and my connections with my family , my community and my nation , tell me who I am . "
Corbiere Lavell , 66 , lost her status as a citizen of the Wikwemikong Unceded Indian reserve when she married David Lavell in 1970 .
Three years later , she led a Supreme Court challenge of the status determination system , but it failed .
At a recent community consultation in Toronto , Corbiere Lavell showed photos of her children and grandchildren to illustrate how the system divides her own family .
" Three of my five grandchildren do not have legal rights to be members of my community , " she said .
Since 2001 , the Assembly of First Nations has passed five resolutions calling on Ottawa to recognize the authority of First Nations to determine citizenship and status .
In 2005 , it signed an accord with Ottawa for the recognition and implementation of First Nation governments ; it includes issues concerning First Nations identity .
Meanwhile , individuals affected by the two - generation cut - off are suing .
In April , in the case of Sharon McIvor and her son Charles Grismer , the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled the Indian Act violates the Charter of Rights and ordered Ottawa to amend the act within a year .
The government has 60 days to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court .
Kelly LaRocca , of the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation has followed the citizenship issue closely .
The 33 - year - old lawyer , a registered " 6 ( 2 ) " Indian with a native mother and an Italian father , is married to a non-status man .
Her future children wo n't have status .

Text is Dead They Say Martin Fowler has recently published a lengthy but rewarding article on language workbenches .
I agree with the majority of what he says , and will follow up on that in due course .
However there is one particular thread running through the article with which I disagree , and which I wish to address here .
Martin's thrust is that in the so - called " post - IntelliJ " world that we inhabit , programming via textual files is a relic from a past age .
The notion that the we are passing out of the " age of text " ( my term , for want of a better one ) is one that an increasing number of people appear to be coming to .
However while Martin uses this as one of the central themes of his document , I personally think it does not affect his core argument .
Furthermore , I disagree with the basic tenet .
In the scenario Martin outlines , users will be increasingly creating and editing programs via DSL's .
Martin 's assumption is that the only practical way of editing DSL's is via dedicated editors that respond to the users input in intelligent ways .
This implies to him that users are directly editing a representation of an instance of the languages abstract syntax .
I believe that , practically speaking , this implication is correct , if irrelevant .
However the original assumption I believe to be flawed - why should users have to edit DSL code via specialised editors ?
I suspect that there are two deeply connected reasons behind this :
Parsing has traditionally been a very difficult thing to do .
Even those well versed in the parsing algorithms of such tools as yacc often find expressing a suitable grammar very difficult .
often find expressing a suitable grammar very difficult .
Articulating what the valid input to a DSL is to a user is a very difficult thing , partly because the grammar 's that many tools use are so complex that they are of little use as explanation .
I suspect that people such as Martin have been burned on bad parsing technologies many times before ( I know I have ) .
The prospect of such pain every time wants to come up with a textual DSL is deeply off - putting .
Python contains the best ( or should that be worst ? ) example of an unintelligible grammar I have ever seen .
Try following the Python grammar to work out how it encodes operator precedence , and you 'll see why parsing technologies derived from work in the 50's and 60's have seriously affected productivity in this area , through to the current day .
Is it any wonder that people run a mile rather than work with such nonsense ?
The prospect of creating a DSL editor via a tool thus becomes attractive , just to avoid the yacc 's and JavaCC's of this world .
The fact that I need to mention that yacc is an LALR ( 1 ) parser should suggest to the uninitiated how baroque virtually everything to do with parsing actually is .
From a users perspective , LALR ( 1 ) really means " this thing does n't parse a lot of things that I quite reasonably would expect it to be able to parse " .
In other words , yacc will generally refuse to work on most " human friendly " grammars , requiring the user to understand arcane nonsense such as " shift / reduce errors " .
This is all done in the name of efficiency .
However the need for extreme efficiency in these algorithms often dates from the 60's .
As we all know , computers were a little bit slower back in the day .
What was slow back then often works at the speed of light today .
There are parsing algorithms out there - Earley parsing is a particular favourite of mine - which can parse any context - free grammar , which constitutes the vast majority of modern programming languages .
They may not be as fast as yacc but for the vast majority of purposes ( up to and including full blown compilers ) they 're absolutely fine , and no user is likely to notice the difference in execution speed .
However anyone who uses , say , Earley parsing will most definitely notice the massive ease in which grammars can be expressed and used .
Therefore I believe the pain which most people associate with parsing text is the result of a 40 year old obsession with speed that today verges on the masochistic .
As a simple example of a chunk of an Earley grammar , here 's part of a grammar for calculators that encodes operator precedence : E ::= E " + " E % precedence 10 | E " - " E % precedence 10 | E " / " E % precedence 20 | E " * " E % precedence 30 | " ( " E " ) " Compare it to the Python example earlier .
I think the reader will agree that this is somewhat more readable , and I do n't even feel that I need to explain what the % precedence stuff means because it 's intuitive enough on its own .
You can give an example like this to most people who 've got a half - decent undergraduate computer science education and expect them to understand it .
Although this is a simple example , I hope that the reader is at least somewhat convinced that there are practical parsing techniques which alleviate the majority of the pain associated with traditional techniques .
So how does this relate to Martin 's original point ?
Well , if you agree with what I 've said up until now , then I hope you 'll then agree that it just might be practical to parse textual DSL 's easily .
Furthermore that it's then possible to give the user trivially adapted documentation about the grammar that they actually have a reasonable chance of understanding .
I really believe that this is the case .
It 's the fundamental idea underlying my Converge system , and while that 's still in its early days , nothing I or others have seen suggests to me that this is an unreasonable position to hold .
Systems such as Converge do n't require fancy editors to be built ( with all the potential usability and portability problems that are often associated with such things ) , and furthermore they still allow all our favourite tools to be used .
After print statements , the most effective debugging tool I have yet found is grep .
While grep works perfectly well on Converge source code , how is it likely to do on the proprietary format held in the sort of tools that Martin 's advocating ?
The implications of that worry me , and they might worry you too .
But that 's another argument for another time .
In summary , while I understand why people have an aversion to textual source code these days , I believe that is due to antiquated tools and techniques .
If one uses modern tools and techniques , parsing text becomes an easy and pleasant activity , and virtually everything in Martin 's articles holds true for pure textual systems .
I suppose the cachet once associated with mis-appropriating a Pete Townshend lyric has disappeared over the last year or two , but I can't resist it .
Text is dead they say ?
Long live text .
Updated ( July 11 2005 ) : Clarified that Earley parsing can cope with all context - free grammars .
Thanks to Marcin Tustin for spotting this ommission .
Updated ( January 27 2008 ) : Updated the link to the Python grammar , and changed the syntax for the Earley example to something more obviously EBNF - like .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - The Vatican played down Pope Benedict ’s teenage membership of the Hitler Youth Tuesday after it was highlighted by Jewish critics of remarks he made about the Holocaust during his continuing visit to Israel .
An official spokesman withdrew an initial statement that the German - born pope had “ never , never , never ” been in the Hitler Youth after reporters pointed out that Benedict himself had said he was -- in a 1996 book on the then cardinal , Joseph Ratzinger .
Rev. Federico Lombardi , the Vatican spokesman , revised his statement to say that the pope had been signed up against his will and did not take an active part in the Nazi Youth movement .
“ He was enrolled involuntarily into the Hitler Youth but he had no active participation , ” Lombardi said .
“ The Hitler Youth is not a significant experience in his life because he was not an active participant .
It was just something that was done . ”
The speaker of Israel ’s parliament , in some of the strongest criticism of the pope ’s speech Monday at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial , described him as a “ German who joined the Hitler Youth and ... a person who joined Hitler ’s army . ”
Many Israelis felt the pope , who spoke of never forgetting the “ horrific tragedy of the Shoah , ” could have displayed more personal emotion over his nation ’s genocide against the Jews .
In “ Salt of the Earth , ” a 1996 book of reflections based on interviews with German journalist Peter Seewald , the pope , now 82 , was asked if he had been in the Hitler Youth .
He replied :
“ At first we were n’t , but when the compulsory Hitler Youth was introduced in 1941 , my brother was obliged to join .
I was still too young , but later , as a seminarian , I was registered in the HY .
As soon as I was out of the seminary I never went back . ”
He said he also served on anti-aircraft batteries and was conscripted into the infantry late in the war .
Histories of the time say teenagers conscripted as anti-aircraft auxiliaries , or “ Flakhelfer , ” from 1943 were formally part of the Hitler Youth .
The developers of popular Half - Life mod Natural Selection are preparing to release standalone sequel Natural Selection 2 this year via Steam , and we 've got the exclusive teaser trailer to prove it .
Last we heard , the development of the standalone sequel to one of the most played Half - Life 2 mods had hit a financial snag , with developers forced to sell their bodies Sodoku to get by .
Now we learn that grassroots fund raising and investor capital have given developer Unknown Worlds all they need to finish the game , which will be released later this year via Steam .

I 'd have to say the game is looking absolutely gorgeous .
The team at Unknown Worlds have crafted their own game engine for the project , and everything you see in the video is created using said engine .
Not bad for a four - person development team , huh ?
Oh , and for those of you unfamiliar with the mod , that giant beastie up there ?
That 's an Onos , and it 's playable .
Yum .

Obama Caves to ' Scaredy - Cat Nation '
A paradox of the modern United States is that it wields unprecedented military power in the world yet its people are constantly kept frightened about unlikely foreign dangers .
Its politics , too , are dominated by fear .
Email
Printer friendly
The way this plays out most often is that Republicans ( aided by the U.S. news media ) exaggerate overseas threats and denounce the Democrats for being “ soft ” on whatever the current “ threat ” might be : the Reds , the yellow menace , Soviet “ beachheads ” in Central America , or now Islamic terrorism .
From the Vietnam War to today ’s “ war on terror , ” Democrats have reacted out of fear of getting blamed for not doing enough to “ protect ” the nation , so they undertake misguided actions to look tough , as Lyndon Johnson did in escalating U.S. troop levels in Vietnam or as Democrats in Congress did in going along with George W. Bush ’s invasion of Iraq .
In the latest chapter , President Barack Obama is succumbing to the same dynamic as he retreats on his campaign promises to restore the rule of law and to put relations with the Islamic world on a more rational footing .
Fulfilling those promises would require political courage from Obama and the Democrats , a commodity that remains in short supply .
And it appears to be beyond hope to expect that the Republicans and their right - wing media allies will ever behave responsibly – when there ’s a chance for political gain .
So , in the Age of Obama , the mighty United States again presents itself to the world as “ Scaredy - Cat Nation , ” terrified about the danger posed by a small number of suspected terrorists who might be transferred , in shackles , from the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to super -max prisons on U.S. soil .
All manner of terrifying tales have been imagined about inmates using their one hour a day outside their jail cells to organize breakouts or about terrorist comrades crossing the U.S. border to lay siege to a super - max prison and somehow busting the prisoners out .
Such fantasies , which sound like bad Hollywood movie scripts , have been circulated by prominent Republicans , including Texas Sen .
Kay Bailey Hutchison and FBI Director Robert Mueller , and have been echoed by key Democrats , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Fearing the Uighurs The American people also are supposed to get very scared that some Guantanamo inmates who were locked up for no good reason – like the 17 Chinese Uighurs who have been imprisoned at Guantanamo for seven years though the Bush administration concluded that they are no threat to the United States – might get relocated to the “ land of the free , home of the brave . ”
And then there ’s the panic over the slim possibility that after a trial , a few suspected terrorists might get acquitted , although in those cases the defendants would almost surely remain locked up pending deportation .
Whatever risks remain are so ephemeral that they are vastly outweighed by other dangers that the United States creates for itself by being perceived as a hypocritical nation that preaches human rights for others but not when Americans feel some remote danger .
If Americans really wanted to reduce the risk of a 9/11 repeat , they could undertake any number of policy changes , from reducing their dependence on Middle Eastern oil to demanding that the Israeli government grants meaningful statehood to the Palestinians .
Instead , the United States has opted for a behavioral pattern that veers from victimhood to bullying , from the tears that followed the 9/11 attacks and the lament “ why do they hate us ? ” to the cheers for George W. Bush ’s “ shock and awe ” bombardment of Iraq and the tough - guy treatment of captives .
On May 21 , former Vice President Dick Cheney defended this approach , which relies on force to eradicate perceived threats to the homeland : “ In the fight against terrorism , there is no middle ground , and half - measures keep you half exposed .
You cannot keep just some nuclear - armed terrorists out of the United States , you must keep every nuclear - armed terrorist out of the United States . …
“ When just a single clue that goes unlearned … one lead that goes unpursued … can bring on catastrophe - it 's no time for splitting differences .
There is never a good time to compromise when the lives and safety of the American people are in the balance . ”
A Logical Flaw
But there is a logical flaw to Cheney ’s so - called “ one - percent doctrine , ” which holds that even if a potential terrorist threat presents only a one - percent possibility it must be treated as a certainty .
The flaw is that reacting to unlikely dangers as certainties is almost guaranteed to create even more dangers .
For instance , invading Iraq to eliminate a tiny risk that Saddam Hussein might help al - Qaeda has killed 4,300 American soldiers , spared al - Qaeda ’s leadership in their hideouts along the Afghan border , strengthened Iran as a regional power , and spread anti-Americanism across the volatile region , including inside nuclear - armed Pakistan .
In other words , reacting to every hypothetical one - percent threat may sound reassuring to frightened Americans but the policy is almost certain to make the situation more dangerous .
Clearly , many Americans understand this .
They know that risk is part of life and intrinsic to a Republic , especially one that operates under a system of laws and cherishes what the Founders called “ certain unalienable rights . ”
Many such Americans voted for Barack Obama in hopes that this eloquent expert on constitutional law would break the cycle of Republican fear - mongering and Democratic cowering , that he would uphold the nation ’s principles and stop exaggerating the dangers .
However , Obama has disappointed many of these supporters .
While rhetorically stepping back from some of Bush ’s excesses and releasing some important evidence on how the United States officially embraced torture for the first time in the nation ’s history , Obama has maintained much of the legal paradigm of Bush ’s “ war on terror . ”
In his speech about terrorism on May 21 – right before Cheney ’s – Obama said some of the Guantanamo cases would have to go before revamped Military Commissions that would include a few more safeguards than the Bush / Cheney model but still fall far short of civilian courts .
‘ Prolonged Detention ’ Obama even proposed a new legal system that would allow for “ prolonged detention ” of terror suspects without trial .
Obama said he wanted to involve Congress and the Judiciary in this process – seeking to distance himself from Bush ’s views of unilateral presidential powers .
“ In our constitutional system , ” Obama said , “ prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man . ”
However , in truth , prolonged detention has little place at all in the U.S. constitutional system , which includes habeas corpus guarantees against arbitrary imprisonment and the right to fair and open trials .
It ’s also unclear why an extreme step like prolonged detention is needed .
For combatants captured on the battlefield , the law of war permits their detention as POWs for the duration of a conflict , thus negating the argument about how such situations do n’t lend themselves to the collection of evidence .
Rather , Obama ’s concept of preventive detention seems aimed at a suspected terrorist who , in Obama ’s example , has expertise in explosives and who may have been arrested far from a battlefield .
It ’s unclear why , in that situation , evidence could n’t be collected normally or why witnesses could n’t be developed to prove the case , even if that might require a plea bargain with one suspect to obtain testimony against another .
Given the absence of a compelling rationale , it appears more likely that Obama is bowing to the power of fear , political fear that he might be blamed by fearful Americans if a jury acquitted some allegedly dangerous terrorist because the evidence was insufficient or because the case was tainted by torture or other government misconduct .
Surely , if an acquittal occurred – even if the defendant was then deported to his country of origin – the Republicans and the right - wing media would stoke fears about this dangerous terrorist let loose to wreak havoc .
Without doubt , some Americans would fall under the spell of that fear - mongering .
Stirring Fear
The New York Times played into that pattern last week by touting a dubious report prepared by Bush ’s Pentagon in December 2008 , which claimed that one in seven detainees released from Guantanamo “ returned ” to militant activity .
Cheney cited that figure in opposing Obama 's promise to close the Guantanamo prison .
However , the evidence in the Pentagon report – details that were buried deep inside the Times article – identified only five released detainees ( out of 534 ) who “ have engaged in verifiable terrorist activity or have threatened terrorist acts , ” the Times reported .
In other words , less than one in 100 of the freed prisoners , not one in seven .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ NYT Helps the Bushies , Again . ” ]
The pressure on Obama to permit “ prolonged detentions ” also may reflect the Pentagon ’s blurring of the lines between militants and media workers .
It has become trendy inside U.S. counterinsurgency to lump journalists who criticize American actions with combatants engaging in violent acts .
For example , the U.S. military in Iraq has detained Ibahim Jassam , a Reuters cameraman , since September 2008 despite an Iraqi court order calling for his release and the absence of any formal charges against him .
The U.S. military continues to justify his detention on the basis of undisclosed intelligence that Jassam is a “ a high security threat , ” said Maj .
Neal Fisher , a spokesman for detainee affairs .
Journalists for the Arab TV network al - Jazeera also have been targeted for detention as well as for military attack .
Al - Jazeera journalist Sami al - Hajj was held at Guantanamo from December 2001 to May 2008 as U.S. interrogators unsuccessfully pressed him to link al - Jazeera to al - Qaeda .
[ For more on U.S. double standards regarding journalists , see this article by Jeremy Scahill . ]
Obama ’s proposal for “ prolonged detentions ” would seem to invite continuation of such prolonged abuses , when the intelligence data is vague or has little direct connection to terrorist acts .
It appears that Obama is signaling to frightened Americans that even if there is no usable evidence against detainees , he will protect the U.S. homeland by keeping the suspects locked up for the foreseeable future anyway .
That would be a victory for Scaredy - Cat Nation , but it would be a defeat for the honorable system that has guided Constitutional America for more than two centuries .
Obama ’s plan looks to be a cave - in to the cycle of fear that has done so much damage to the Republic .

Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev will meet for the first time on April 2 in London , officials said Monday .

Novosti , via Associated Press
Mr. Obama ’s letter , sent in response to one he received from Mr. Medvedev shortly after Mr. Obama ’s inauguration , is part of an effort to “ press the reset button ” on Russian - American relations , as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. put it last month , officials in Washington said .
Among other things , the letter discussed talks to extend a strategic arms treaty expiring this year and cooperation in opening supply routes to Afghanistan .
The plan to build a high - tech radar facility in the Czech Republic and deploy 10 interceptor missiles in Poland  a part of the world that Russia once considered its sphere of influence  was a top priority for President George W. Bush to deter Iran in case it developed a nuclear warhead to fit atop its long - range missiles .
Mr. Bush never accepted a Moscow proposal to install part of the missile defense system on its territory and jointly operate it so it could not be used against Russia .
Now the Obama administration appears to be reconsidering that idea , although it is not clear if it would want to put part of the system on Russian soil where it could be flipped on or off by Russians .
Mr. Obama has been lukewarm on missile defense , saying he supports it only if it can be proved technically effective and affordable .
Mr. Bush also emphasized the linkage between the Iranian threat and missile defense , but Mr. Obama ’s overture reformulates it in a way intended to appeal to the Russians , who long ago soured on the Bush administration .
Officials have been hinting at the possibility of an agreement in recent weeks , and Mr. Obama ’s proposal was reported on Monday by a Moscow newspaper , Kommersant .
“ If through strong diplomacy with Russia and our other partners we can reduce or eliminate that threat , it obviously shapes the way at which we look at missile defense , ” Under Secretary of State William J. Burns said about the Iranian threat in an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax while in Moscow last month delivering Mr. Obama ’s letter .
Attending a NATO meeting in Krakow , Poland , on Feb. 20 , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said , “ I told the Russians a year ago that if there were no Iranian missile program , there would be no need for the missile sites . ”
Mr. Obama ’s inauguration , he added , offered the chance for a fresh start .
“ My hope is that now , with the new administration , the prospects for that kind of cooperation might have improved , ” he said .
MPAA shows how to videorecord a TV set from timothy vollmer on Vimeo .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Fred von Lohmann sez , " Hearings for the DMCA triennial rulemaking are going on this week in DC , where the educational community is asking for an exemption to rip DVDs to take clips for classroom use .
The MPAA responded with a video showing how to camcord (! ) movies from a flat screen monitor , arguing that educators and students should do this instead of ripping DVDs .
In the words of media literacy researcher Martine Courant Rife , that 's like typing up a quote from a book , taking it outside , chiseling the words in a rock , photographing the rock , scanning the photo , and running OCR on it .
And for what ? "

Here 's good news about your net worth
Let me offer some good news about the state of your wealth .
Sure , the 401 ( k ) tanked , the house lost a big chunk of value , and things are looking shaky at work .
Indeed , the Federal Reserve recently reported that Americans all together lost $ 5.1 trillion during the last three months of 2008 alone .
But what you possess individually accounts for only part of your true net worth .
Each of us also owns a stake in some extremely valuable assets : clean air , fresh water , national forests , the Internet , public universities , blood banks , rich cultural traditions and more .
All these things are part of what is now being called " the commons , " and they are more important than ever .
The things we share enhance our lives in countless ways - the roads we travel , parks where we gather , publicly funded medical and scientific breakthroughs we take advantage of , the accumulated human knowledge we use for free many times each day .
In fact , without these commonly held resources , our modern society and market economy would never have gotten off the ground .
When the economy appeared to be booming , many of us did n't care about the commons ; it hardly seemed to matter that the local recreation center was in disrepair and Social Security on the ropes .
Private health clubs and IRAs would meet those needs .
But in today 's downturn , Americans are increasingly grateful for services and opportunities provided for us outside the for - profit economy .
But the news about our common wealth is not all good .
While it has not declined 30 to 40 percent in value over the past year like many people 's personal savings , it still faces major threats .
The financial downswing creates new pressures to balance state and local government budgets by hacking away at critical services and programs .
St. Louis is looking at cutting bus service in half and St. Paul , Minn. , is closing one library and slashing hours at 11 others .
And the state of California is looking at trimming almost every state program and service .
But even in good times , the commons are vulnerable to exploitation by those who seize an opportunity for personal gain at public expense .
This degradation of our shared wealth has become known as " the tragedy of the commons , " after a famous 1968 essay in Science magazine by Garrett Hardin .
Hardin , a biologist , used the example of grazing lands - perhaps the most familiar use of the word commons - to describe how selfish instincts led livestock herders in traditional societies to let their animals overgraze commonly owned land .
But the situation Hardin describes is " the tragedy of the unmanaged commons . "
Cultures throughout history , including our own , have devised effective systems to make sure that common assets were not depleted .
That was the impulse behind conservation laws , financial regulations and social programs enacted between the 1910s and 1970s .
The true tragedy of the commons has been inflicted on us by free - market zealots who attacked these sensible measures in order to carry out greedy raids on our common wealth .
Fortunately , this unprecedented looting of the commons sparked a new movement of " commoners " who are standing up to protect things that belong to all of us .
The commons is becoming a model for thinking differently about how we make decisions , manage resources and think about responsibilities .
Some people now envision a commons - based society where shared wealth compounds our individual assets in " the pursuit of happiness . "
Hockey or Sex : 7 In - Game Comments That Will Make You Think
Total Pro Sports –
It is always great to go and watch a hockey game live .
To be there among all the fans , cheering for your team and against the opposition is exhilarating .
But sometimes it is nice to be able to sit at home and catch the game on TV , with the commentary providing insight .
So what happens when that so called insight sounds more like something you would likely hear on one of the DVD ’s from you hidden porn collection ?
Some laugh , while others get different ideas and head straight under the bed to pull out their latest copy of “ Field of Wet Dreams ” .
Such moments have sparked this list here of the top 7 things you may hear while watching a hockey game that will make you ask yourself “ Is this Hockey or Porn ? ” ( the names of players are random and only used to create a more realistic effect ) :
7 . “ Price is weak between the legs ” –
It seems like they only say this about goalies .
You would likely hear this when the commentators are mentioning the weaknesses of the netminders .
And in a porn ?
Well we would hope you would never hear this , but it may find its way on some sort of a “ porno bloopers ” video .
6 . “ Crosby managed to barely slip it in there ” –
In this case , you have your typical forward on a breakaway , fakes left , goes right and just gets it by the goalie .
Ya , that ’s right .
He barely slipped it in there .
And in a porn ?
You ’ll likely hear this in “ teen - based ” porno .
Yes , tightness is an issue here .
No wizard ’s sleeves , thank you .
5 . “ Burrows just got nailed from behind ” – Its the always dirty hit from behind .
Never a pleasant sight in the game of hockey .
And in a porn ?
Most likely gay porn , unless the girl is wearing a strap on .
4. “ Chara just gave him a reach around ” – No I did not make this up .
I have actually heard this several times and it never gets old .
This occurs when one player reaches around the other with his stick to try and poke the puck .
And in a porn ?
Well rather than one man reaching around the other with his own stick , in this case the one reaching around would be doing so to get a hold of the others .
3 . “ Pronger stuck his stick between Thornton ’s legs ” – Defense liked using this old trick , but what is defined as “ the can - opener ” has since been outlawed by the NHL .
And in a porn ?
I believe most refer to it as the missionary position .
2 . “ Fleury took that that shot from Ovechkin right in the face ” – While most usually shoot to score , sometimes you may want to put some fear into the goalie and take a shot at his head .
And in a porn ?
The good ol ’ facial .
Should we offer a cherry on top ?
1 . “ Staal was looking backdoor and he snuck it in there ” – What a great goal .
While the play is going on at one side of the ice , you set yourself up at the far post and wait for the pass to put it in the net .
And in a porn ?
Well lets just say that they found another entrance in .
You can guess which one .
So next time you ’re on the ice .
Remember , its hockey , not sex .
Keep your stick to yourself .

Good news for those of us who 've endured countless interruptions at the hand of this widespread phone spam :
The FTC is finally cracking down on those automated " Your warranty is about to expire " spammer phone calls — but only after a US Senator received a call on his personal phone .

Photo by TheGiantVermin
This telemarketing / spam organization has been placing 1.8 million calls per day , whether you are on the Do - Not - Call list or not .
Once you pick up the phone , you hear an automated message telling you " This is the final notice that the factory warranty on your car is about to run out .
Press two and we 'll pretend to remove you from this list . "

The scammers made the mistake of placing an automated call to Senator Charles Schumer on his cell phone during a meeting ; afterwards he called a press conference to rail against the scammers .
The FTC finally cracked down on the scammers with an injunction and an attempt to force them to return the estimated $ 10 million in fraudulent earnings from the scheme .
This particular telemarketing scheme has been spamming at least two of the editors here at Lifehacker for months now , so we 're very pleased to see the government finally doing something about it .

Scientists are a step closer to making environmentally - friendly ' magnetic ' refrigerators and air conditioning systems a reality , thanks to new research published today in Advanced Materials .
Magnetic refrigeration technology could provide a ' green ' alternative to traditional energy - guzzling gas - compression fridges and air conditioners .
They would require 20 - 30 % less energy to run than the best systems currently available , and would not rely on ozone - depleting chemicals or greenhouse gases .
Refrigeration and air conditioning units make a major contribution to the planet 's energy consumption - in the USA in the summer months they account for approximately 50 % of the country 's energy use .
A magnetic refrigeration system works by applying a magnetic field to a magnetic material - some of the most promising being metallic alloys - causing it to heat up .
This excess heat is removed from the system by water , cooling the material back down to its original temperature .
When the magnetic field is removed the material cools down even further , and it is this cooling property that researchers hope to harness for a wide variety of cooling applications .
The technology , based on research funded in the UK by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , has proved possible in the lab but researchers are still looking for improved materials that provide highly efficient cooling at normal room temperatures , so that the technology can be rolled out from the lab to people 's homes and businesses .
They need a material that exhibits dramatic heating and cooling when a magnetic field is applied and removed , which can operate in normal everyday conditions , and which does not lose efficiency when the cooling cycle is repeated time after time .
The new study published today shows that the pattern of crystals inside different alloys - otherwise known as their microstructure - has a direct effect on how well they could perform at the heart of a magnetic fridge .
The Imperial College London team behind the new findings say this could , in the future , help them to custom - design the best material for the job .
Professor Lesley Cohen , one of the authors of the paper , explains that by using unique probes designed at Imperial , her team , led by Dr James Moore , was able to analyse what happens to different materials on a microscopic level when they are magnetised and de-magnetised .
This enabled the team to pinpoint what makes some materials better candidates for a magnetic fridge system than others .
Professor Cohen , from Imperial 's Department of Phsyics , said : " We found that the structure of crystals in different metals directly affects how dramatically they heat up and cool down when a magnetic field is applied and removed .
This is an exciting discovery because it means we may one day be able to tailor - make a material from the ' bottom up ' , starting with the microstructure , so it ticks all the boxes required to run a magnetic fridge .
This is vitally important because finding a low - energy alternative to the fridges and air conditioning systems in our homes and work places is vital for cutting our carbon emissions and tackling climate change . "
This new research follows on from another study published by the same Imperial group in Physical Review B last month , in which they used similar probing techniques to precisely measure the temperature changes that occur when different materials are removed from a magnetic field , and to analyse the different ways they occur .
The lead scientist Kelly Morrison found that at the molecular level two different temperature change processes , known as first - and second - order changes , happen simultaneously in each material .
The team think that the extent to which each of these two processes feature in a material also affects its cooling capabilities .
Professor Cohen says this means that whilst the majority of research to perfect magnetic refrigeration worldwide has tended to involve analysing and testing large samples of materials , the key to finding a suitable material for everyday applications may lie in the smaller detail :
" Our research illustrates the importance of understanding the microstructure of these materials and how they respond to magnetic fields on a microscopic level , " she concluded .

Herring Brain Box Prof. Robert B. Laughlin
Department of Physics , Stanford University
Stanford , CA 94305
The Herring Reference Archive is a digitized version of the Herring Brain Box , a collection of scientific references identified and cataloged by Dr. W. Conyers Herring , head of the Theory Group at Bell Labs during the Laboratory 's golden years - 1945 to 1985 .
It differs from a conventional catalog in being tastefully selective .
Dr. Herring , an excellent theoretical physicist , personally examined each reference and made an entry only if he judged it to be important .
His standards were high .
Nothing made it into the archive unless it was very fine physics or very fine engineering - and preferably both .
The Herring archive eventually became incorporated into Bell 's corporate personality and influenced many of its research decisions .
The archive is thus a fascinating historical record of the birth of the electronic age .
Herring 's references were not , unfortunately , recorded digitally but instead written by hand as scribbles on 3x5 cards - mostly in English but occasionally in Russian , German or French .
This immensely complicates their digitization .
The transcription cannot be done by computer , but instead must be done manually by people who know enough physics to decipher Herring 's writing and find mistakes .
This excludes graduate students , unfortunately , because they lack the seasoning required to make good judgments .
Hand transcription , in turn , requires the entries to be checked individually for errors by actually tracking down the reference .
For these reasons and others , the digitization is an ongoing project , not a completed one .
The archive 's content will slowly change for the next several years , and will not be reorganized and outfitted with a proper search engine until the transcription and checking is completed .
The objective at present is to preserve the massive catalog just as Herring wrote it - including his arcane organization scheme .
Notwithstanding the primitiveness of the methods , Herring eventually accumulated thousands of references .
The cards on which they were written became so numerous that he was forced to carry them in a large black suitcase .
This " brain box " became increasingly notorious at Bell Labs , both because carrying a suitcase to the library was absurd and because Herring gradually developed an uncanny ability , through the agency of this very box , to direct you to just the right place when you sought his advice .
The box eventually filled to capacity and then overflowed into filing cabinets .
The above photograph , taken in 2007 , long after Herring had stopped adding to the archive , is full for this reason .
The total number of cards is about twice the number visible in the photograph .
The present archive records both the overflow cards and the ones in the box at the time Herring ended his work .
Americans Can't Handle The Truth , So Pick Up Your Bibles Instead Posted by Pile ( 12105 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ News Media ]
We reported on these types of shenanigans in Newsweek before .
This time , Time Magazine shows the rest of the world one thing , and America something different .
This week , Time 's cover story is an essay arguing in favor of teaching the Bible in schools .
On the cover of its international edition is a story : " The Truth About Talibanistan , " about the resurgence of the Taliban and al - Qaeda in Afghanistan ( and also , Pakistan ) , and how it 's " the next battleground of the war on terrorism . "
The story is in the U.S. edition of the magazine but not on the American cover , presumably because Rick Stengel & co. think the Bible will do better newsstand .

The contents of the Bible , totally aside from belief in its messages , is fundamental to comprehending most of Western civilization and literature .
Much of the language and its basic images and analogies derive from Biblical stories .
Probably there is no other single work or book which is more important for knowledge of our culture .
This is not a matter of religion ; it 's basic education .

Despite plenty of protests , the French Parliament passed a controversial new law last week that will see alleged copyright infringers disconnected from the Internet .
Now , a new survey reveals that 60 % of French Internet users are against the so - called HADOPI law .
69 % say they believe it will fail .
The new legislation passed in France last week requiring ISPs to cut off the Internet access of alleged copyright infringers has never been popular with anyone outside of the government and entertainment industries .
The new ‘ HADOPI ’ ( Creation and Internet ) law introduces unlimited options for copyright holders to go after individuals and sites that are alleged to have infringed copyright , without having to actually prove that the accused are categorically guilty .
Now , a new survey by French Institute of Public Opinion ( IFOP ) for LeJdd shows just how ( un ) popular this so - called ‘ graduated response ’ is with the public .
From a survey of 1004 individuals representative of the French Internet user , 60 % of respondents said they were not in favor of the law ( 42 % were strongly against ) , with a third saying they support it “ somewhat ” .
Only those respondents over 65 years old showed greater support , with 53 % in favor and 41 % against .
Despite this , 64 % of the respondents in this category felt that the graduated response wont be affective at all .
Interestingly , there was no difference between the different age groups in the expected effectiveness of the new anti-piracy legislation .
Overall , the majority responded quite negatively .
Just 24 % of respondents said that they felt the ‘ graduated response ’ would be “ very ” or “ somewhat ” effective , with a huge 69 % believing it will fail .
As in most countries , illegal file - sharing is widespread in France .
One in four of the respondents admitted that they downloaded copyrighted music or movies regularly .
There is a clear generation gap here , as 40 % of those younger than 30 years categorized themselves as active downloaders opposed to 6 % in the 65 years and older group .
Not not everyone is sceptical of the scheme .
While repeating the IFPI nonsense that 95 % of all music is pirated , U2 manager Paul McGuiness writes that not only is the Creation and Internet law “ the right solution to an enormous problem ” but also “ a fair and balanced solution ” that “ will work in practice . ”
Clearly not everyone agrees .

Ever thought of rearing your own pork , but do n't want to alarm the neighbours ?
Try remote ownership , says Alex Renton .
Hands up who fancies his pig's ears in brine
When the Maasai of East Africa kill a cow , the herdsman first coaxes it to the ground and then lies beside the animal , stroking and calming it .
He whispers in its ear to explain why it must die and asks its forgiveness .
Then he smothers it .
I 'd planned to do something similar when our pig Spidey 's time came , but I did n't get the chance .
To start with , smothering is not acceptable humane practice in the modern British slaughterhouse .
What I would have told him is that , while his death was ignoble , the butchering would be glorious .
A food hero with proper respect for good pork was flying in all the way from Italy to do the honours .
And we , who had fed him and visited him , were going to enjoy every bit of him .
In turning Spidey into food we were going to bide by Nose to Tail St John chef Fergus Henderson 's wise dictum : " If you 're going to kill an animal , it seems only polite to use the whole thing . "
An hour or so into the job of chopping him up , we broke for lunch .
And while Spidey is still with us in the form of salamis , bacon , a whole host of roasting cuts and some coppa ham that I 'm very excited about , that lunch was his finest hour so far .
We ate it round the table in Chris and Denise Walton 's farmhouse , with Renato Toros and a bunch of Slow Foodies from Friuli in northern Italy , who had come over to see what the Scots do with pigs .
The Italians cooked .
We ate the liver and the cheeks , sliced and fried with onions , juniper , bay and a little white wine ; a traditional Pig- butchering Day meal , when the offal and the parts that can't be cured are eaten .
We drank a crisp white from the Veneto , and on the side each of us had a piece of home - baked bread and a frittata made with the pig 's brain .
It was noisy , jolly , filling - a proper worker 's meal .
After it we went back to turn the lean meat into salsicce and salami .
The story of Spideypig Curly Bacon - to give him his full name - started nearly a year earlier , at Peelham Farm in Berwickshire .
We knew Chris and Denise Walton , the farmers , and the fantastic organic pork , beef and lamb they sell at Edinburgh Farmers ' Market .
We drove to Peelham and picked our piglet , one of a litter of 10 Tamworths we found playing tag around the vast shape of their mother .
I wanted to take him straight back to the terraced street in Edinburgh where we live and keep him in the back garden .
But I was dissuaded .
My next - door neighbour pointed out the " no livestock " clause in the title deeds .
So instead we did a deal with the Waltons : remote pig ownership .
They 'd look after him , we 'd pay his bed and board at £ 18 a month and come to visit him .
My children - then nine and three - chose the name .
I was glad , because in it lay the story of the pig 's ultimate fate .
I wanted to avoid misunderstandings come slaughter - time .
Spidey , like all the Waltons ' pigs , was a Tamworth , with a rough ginger coat and a long snout .
The breed is known for being hardy , clever and quick , only a few genes removed from their wild - boar ancestors .
And for evolving ultimately into great sausages .
Through last spring and summer we went down regularly to visit him , bringing organic treats ( he was the perfect outlet for the unwanted roots and leaves from our veggie box ) .
The children decided he deserved sweets , so since we had to abide by the organic rules , Spideypig became the only pig in Scotland to savour Green & Black 's chocolate .
It was a little like having a child at boarding school .
" Well , he looks happy , " my wife and I would say a little wistfully as we drove home after a visit .
The children had less sentiment : " When we eat Spidey , we can eat all of him but not his nose , " said the three - year - old .
They grow up fast .
Spideypig seemed to have doubled in size each time we visited him .
Pigs convert food to weight faster than any other domesticated animal , and he and his siblings swelled on the barley and peas that the Waltons grow as fodder .
They lived very happily and healthily in the muddy fields on the bare Berwickshire hills ; his total vet 's bill was £ 1 .
I was proud to own a remote pig , free range and organically fed from the fields next to his own .
And as he got bigger , I got smugger .
What had begun as a practical project motivated partly by economy but mainly by greed became a high moral stance as each month passed .
As last autumn and winter went by , more emerged about the horrors and failures of industrial pig farming .
Earlier this year in the Guardian , Jon Henley wrote a shocking exposé of pig farming in continental Europe .
Most of our cheap pork comes from there , because welfare standards are lower , he explained .
It became clear that if you paid less than £ 10 or £ 12 a kilo for bacon , you were buying cruel pork .
But cheap bacon lies at the centre of the supermarkets ' relentless " value " marketing - for most of 2008 no British ordinary pig farmer was covering their costs .
According to the National Farmers ' Union , they were in fact losing more than £ 20 per carcass .

The awful stories about the origins of the swine flu - a virus probably bred and mutated in the vast pig factories of American corporations - have now made the case for returning to the old , humane ways unarguable .
In January this year Jamie Oliver revealed more in a TV show entitled Jamie Saves Our Bacon .
European sows that are kept all their breeding lives in cages too small to turn around in ; pigs , he thought , were treated worse than battery chickens .
Supermarkets , he said , habitually bend the truth on labelling : Dutch or Danish bacon is described as " sourced in the UK " , even if it is merely packed here .
A " traditional Wiltshire cure " does n't mean cured in Wiltshire .
He advocated a boycott .
I wrote in the Observer 's food blog , Word of Mouth , about another way - the remote pig .
I boasted about my ownership of an interactive , educational pet-cum - recycling machine who would end his days as very cheap bacon , but decently produced and giving a proper return to the farmer .
We should all form pig clubs , I said , like in the film A Private Function .
But the readers did n't buy it .
They emailed to say I was an " out - of - touch elitist " , denying people the chance to eat cheap pork , and " twisted " for exposing my children to the brutal truths about where meat comes from .
My three - year - old daughter , they said , was " scary " .
We all stood in white coats in the meat - processing room at Peelham Farm .
On the table lay the pig , gutted .
Out came the saw , to split the carcass into manageable parts .
Quite swiftly the pig lost its shape , like a house being demolished .
It took about 45 minutes to turn him into piles of meat , skin and fat , and a bucket full of bones .
We were butchering two pigs that day , one Italian style , and one British , and the two butchers watched each other with keen interest .
Andy Winterburn , the butcher from Berwick - on - Tweed who works at Peelham , sniffed as Renato from Friuli made incisions to take out the spare ribs from the pig 's belly , ready to roll up for curing as pancetta - Italian bacon .
" No butcher in Britain would do that , " he said .
And when Renato started stripping down the pig's head for meat , Andy muttered : " I could have done two pigs in the time this has taken .
This is just not cost - effective . "
But as Renato pointed out , there was 2 kg of good meat on the head , including the cheeks - a delicacy once sold in Britain as Bath chaps .
Nowadays in most British butchers the head goes straight in the bin .
When we 'd finished we totted up the proceeds .
The British - butchered pig had started out at 75 kg - from that we got 42kg of usable meat .
The Italian pig weighed in at 62kg , and produced 52kg .
The disparity shocked even Andy , who spent his career working in a busy butcher 's shop .
" Until 12 years ago , " he said , " we used to employ a man who spent all day taking the spare meat off the bones , for sausages .
But we stopped .
There was n't the money in it .
Now most butchers just skin and cut and take the joints - and you can do that in half an hour . "
So meat has become too cheap ?
" Yes , " he agreed , " I suppose so .
But everyone still wants it cheaper . "
A leg and much of the belly and shoulder of the pig Andy had worked on went into brine , the beginning of the bacon - and gammon - making process .
More was put aside for sausages , and the rest for shrink - wrapping as joints and cuts to go home with me .
But Renato 's work was only just beginning - he travels from farm to farm in his home region of Friuli , near the Austrian border .
He 's called in when a family pig needs turning into sausages and hams - often he 'll take on a 200 kg animal , a process that takes five or six hours .
His arcane arts turned out to be surprisingly simple .
First we took the best meat , about 15kg of it , for salami - at a 75 % lean to 25 % fat ratio .
As it was ground through a meat mincer , one of Renato 's friends mixed up the seasoning , a " French cure " - white wine , pepper , coriander powder , garlic salt and a little sodium nitrite , a preservative .
With the children helping , the mixture was pumped into sausage skins and tied off with string by Renato .
These then went into a warm , humid room to ferment for 24 hours .
It will take a further six weeks before they are ready to eat .
The osso collo - the pork neck - we spiced , wrapped in sausage skins ( which are the cleaned intestines of another pig ) and put away to cure - they will emerge in three months as a coarser parma ham , like coppa .
And the deliciously fatty belly meat , which would go for streaky bacon here in Britain , was salted , rolled and trussed up to cure as pancetta .
Wine and pepper - heavy salsicce sausages for immediate frying came next .
And then the last of the piles , which seemed to be largely fat and skin , went into fat nine inch sausages ( called cotechini in northern Italy ) .
The best fat , snowy white , from the back , we salted and peppered and put away to dry , for up to a year , as lardo - which in Italy is a delicacy cut petal - thin and served on bruschetta .
The rest of the fat , mainly from the belly , was taken off to the kitchen to boil up with apple and bay , to render it into strutto - cooking lard for frying and pastry - making .
Herein lies the secret of why so little of the Italian - butchered pig was wasted : we used the fat , almost all of it .
We discussed making pestadice , a sausage with little nuggets of fried , crunchy pork skin mixed into it .
During this conversation I thought I might faint , I was enjoying myself so much .
I think it may have been the finest moment yet in a life spent talking about food .
Meanwhile my son was attempting to cleave open the pig's head with a machete , to get the brain out .
I watched him , with a deep and ancient pride brimming in my heart .
Now if only I could get him to taste the brain frittata , then my happiness would be complete .
The test for the cotechini came a week later , after they 'd dried in my fridge for seven days .
I was holding a pig - out for friends : a grand dinner with a startlingly well - balanced menu , so long as it was pig .
We started with a pig 's liver and lean meat terrine , encased in trotter jelly and the strutto fat , and served with capers and gherkins .
On top I laid snippets of Spideypig 's ear , brined for five days , and fried till they were crisp .
That went down all right .
Then there was a bonne bouche of roast pork fillet slices , with a spicy apple sauce .
Gone in a second .
Finally , served on a mound of puy lentils which I 'd boiled in pork stock , the great baby 's arms of the cotechini .
And they scoffed the lot of them - the sausages surprisingly pungent for something made largely of skin and fat .
Everyone got a going - home present of half a dozen salsicce .
I think it was the best dinner party I 've ever cooked .
And what of the children , you might wonder .
There have been neither tears nor nightmares .
They 've declared Spideypig 's bacon very good - my son , who likes to cook breakfast on Saturday , is impressed that when you put it in the pan there 's no need to add any cooking oil .
And no evil white gunk comes out .
He thinks roast pork may be a competitor for his usual favourite meat : beef steak , well done .
And my daughter ?
As we drove home from the pig- butchering she looked out of the window at the first of the spring lambs .
" Can we get a lamb ?
Please ! " she asked .
We waited expectantly for her next line .
" We could eat him . "

Danger : Monitors are designed to operate within certain frequency ranges , or for fixed frequency monitors at certain frequencies .
Driving a monitor at a frequency that it is not designed for is not recommended and may cause damage to the monitor 's circuitry which can result in a fire and safety risk .
It is wise to know and understand the specifications of the monitor (s ) that you will be driving in order to prevent damage .
Consult the manufacturers documentation for the monitor for the information , or if not available , contact the manufacturer directly .
If the monitor makes unusual noises , or the internal temperature exceeds the rated temperature of its components , the monitor is likely to experience failure .
This failure may not be immediate , but is under most circumstances inevitable .
Monitor failures can be violent in nature , and can explode and produce shrapnel , as well as overheat and catch fire .
In no circumstance should one leave a monitor unattended in an uncertain state .
Furthermore , exceeding the rated maximum frequencies of a monitor may cause the phosphors to age prematurely , as well as increase the amount of harmful radiation projected towards the viewer beyond the specified maximums .

In no circumstance should one leave a monitor unattended in an uncertain state .
Furthermore , exceeding the rated maximum frequencies of a monitor may cause the phosphors to age prematurely , as well as Warning : Clock chips and RAMDACs as well as other components of the video card are designed with a maximum frequency .
Programming these chips to operate at a frequency greater than they were designed for causes the chips to run hotter than they were designed to operate , and may cause the component to fail .
It is wise to know and understand the maximum operating frequency of the components of any video subsystem you will be programming .
Do not assume that the component is safe to operate at a particular frequency because it can be programmed to operate at that frequency .
The rated frequencies are rated and verified according to batch yield .
As clock frequencies increase , the failure rate of the chips during manufacturing testing increases .
It is impossible to predict the actual point at which a given semiconductor will fail , thus manufacturers monitor the failure rate statistically to determine the frequency that gives an acceptable batch yield .
These failures are typically unobservable and require a method of testing every gate on the chip , as many failures may only be observable under very specific circumstances , typically resulting in intermittent failures , although complete " meltdown " due to a newly formed short is also possible .
If they occur , the entire semiconductor must be rejected due to these failures being irrepairable .
As you exceed the rated frequency you are taking a semiconductor that has passed a thourough test at its rated frequency and entering the realm of statistical probability .
Attempting to find the maximum frequency is impossible , as by the time a failure is noticable the semiconductor has already been permanently damaged .
Cooling the external package by using a heat sink and / or fan may increase the frequency at which a semiconductor can operate ; however , there is still no way to determine the frequency at which a specific semiconductor will fail as it can only be done statistically and practically undetectable without being able to determine the proper operation of every gate on the semiconductor .
Semiconductors such as fast CPU's are rated with the required heat sink and / or cooling fan in place .
Aftermarket cooling devices are sold as " performance coolers " due to the inability to determine the statistical likelyhood of failure and the inability of the end user to simply reject failed semiconductors .
Under no circumstances should a programmer develop software that overclocks an end - user 's hardware without the end user being warned of the statistical likelyhood of failure .
Making any claims about the safety of the software 's operation can leave the programmer with legal liability that cannot be excluded by disclaimer .

I would guess the sound recording is still under copyright , so I suspect it cannot appear on This film will be featured on my forthcoming podcast ( RFETN Podcast 005 ) .
While researching the film and the missing stereo soundtrack at the end , I found on a certain video streaming site the recording mentioned sourced from vinyl .
Listening to the different movements , I think I found the correct piece from Sunset .
Using the link below with the time jump about 19 minutes and 39 seconds into the suite , it appears to match up very well : I would guess the sound recording is still under copyright , so I suspect it cannot appear on archive.org together .

Love the period decor and furnishings , and the outsized enthusiasm for recorded sound by all concerned .
The biggest problem I have with this film is n't the multiple - role acting by the talent - challenged Hugh Beaumont wannabe .
It 's the missing stereo music .
Obviously this was meant as a sales demonstration film , with the actual stereo sound provided in the store during the silent sections .
It would be great if RCA or UMG or whoever owns all this now could dig up or assemble a stereo - dubbed version , for posterity ( and the archive ) .

A variety of men , all named Smith , enthuse about hi-fidelity sound to an off - screen male narrator .
Although we see the various Smiths in pristine domestic settings , we never see their spouses or children .
One Smith tells the announcer that his wife threatens to leave him because of his enthusiasm for hi-fi .
Are we surprised ?
The various Smiths obsessive - compulsive attitudes about stereo components and listening to long pieces of classical music are guaranteed to drive family members out of the house .
Despite their great sound systems , the Smith men are a forlorn group .
Its a good thing the narrator dropped in for a visit .
If it werent for him , these men would have no one to talk to .

About 5 or 6 Mr Smiths , all of which I believe are played by the same actor are all awed by the wonders of High Fidelity Sound stereos , all of which are in fab late 50's living rooms .
Even the stereos themselves look groovy .
After much technical talk , One of the Mr Smiths lets us listen to Hi - fi - 2 , all we here is nothing .

In a novel trick , the audio for this segment was obviously to be heard from an outside source .

" Dear Dennis ,
I am studying photography and I need an easy to use external harddrive ( HD ) to store lots of memory .
Could you please suggest a good exterior hard drive .
By the way , what is the difference between eSATA , Firewire and USB external HDs ? "
My Response :
There is an easy answer to your question , but let 's first break down the basics to better understand what your options are .
Acronyms : eSATA , USB , and Firewire :
What does it mean ?
USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. eSATA stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment .
Firewire is not an acronym ;-)
USB , eSATA , and Firewire in the simplest sense are connection ports on your PC or laptop .
The ports allow your computer to communicate ( and to transfer data to and from ) an external device such as a harddrive , digital camera , and the like .
Compatibility and Speed : USB , Firewire , and eSATA
Most computers are equipped with USB ports because USB is the standard that has been around the longest .
Not all PCs and laptops come with Firewire and eSATA .
Firewire is faster than USB but are not as common on PCs and laptops .
Only newer computers and laptops have external SATA ( eSATA ) ports .
In terms of speed : eSATA is the fastest , followed by Firewire , and then USB .
Suggestions for an External HD : Features , Value , and Cost
All major harddrive manufacturers make external harddrives , typically with a USB connection .
Some external harddrives offer both firewire and USB connections .
The most affordable external harddrive at this time ( according to cost per gigabyte ) would be a 500 GB , 750 GB , or 1000 GB / 1TB external harddrive .
Look around on the Internet ( amazon.com , or ebay.com for example ) and compare brands , prices , and features .
Passive versus Active Heat Dissipation
External harddrives typically get hot .
Try to find an external enclosure with active heat dissipation .
Active dissipation means that it uses a fan to remove stagnant ( hot ) air from the enclosure , keeping the harddrive cool and ( in theory ) increasing the life of your harddrive .
Passive enclosures use heat sinks and are silent and cost less to produce .
Some enclosures offer both active and passive methods .
Build your own External Harddrive
It 's easy enough to build your own external harddrive if you 're relatively tech savvy .
To do so , simply pair an external enclosure with an internal SATA drive .
Typically this would be the way to go especially if you 're picky about brands -- and especially if you want an active cooling unit versus a passive one .
Active cooling enclosures are more prominent in build - your - own external enclosures .
Note that an internal SATA drive paired with an external enclosure can utilize any external interface ( USB , Firewire , or eSATA ) : it simply depends on enclosure you choose , and what ports are available on your PC .
Anti-war MP George Galloway has been banned from Canada , it emerged today .
A Canadian spokesman confirmed that the Respect MP had been deemed inadmissible on national security grounds and would not be allowed into the country .
Galloway today branded the ban " idiotic " and vowed to fight the ruling with " all means " at his disposal .
He is due to give a speech in Toronto on 30 March .
Earlier today the Sun said border security officials had declared Galloway , 54 , " inadmissible " because of his views on Afghanistan and the presence of Canadian troops there and would be turned away if he attempted to enter the country .
A spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada said the decision had been taken by border security officials " based on a number of factors " in accordance with section 34 ( 1 ) of the country 's immigration act .
The act states :
" A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds for :
( a ) engaging in an act of espionage or an act of subversion against a democratic government , institution or process as they are understood in Canada ;
( b ) engaging in or instigating the subversion by force of any government ;
( c ) engaging in terrorism ;
( d ) being a danger to the security of Canada ;
( e ) engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada ; or
( f ) being a member of an organisation that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages , has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) . "
Galloway , MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , is consulting the organisers of his north American speaking tour and exploring whether legal action can be taken to overturn the ban .
Jason Kenney , Canada 's immigration minister , has the right to exempt people from the act if it is felt that their presence would not be " detrimental to the national interest " .
But a spokesman said Kenney would " decline to exercise that discretion " in Galloway 's case .
Alykhan Velshi , Kenney 's spokesman , said that the act was designed to protect Canadians from people who fund , support or engage in terrorism .
" We 're going to uphold the law , not give special treatment to this infandous street - corner Cromwell who actually brags about giving ' financial support ' to Hamas , a terrorist organisation banned in Canada , " he said .
" I 'm sure Galloway has a large Rolodex of friends in regimes elsewhere in the world willing to roll out the red carpet for him .
Canada , however , wo n't be one of them . "
Responding to the news , Galloway issued a statement headed : " This idiotic ban shames Canada . "
The MP said : " This decision , gazetted in Rupert Murdoch 's Sun , is a very sad day for the Canada we have known and loved – a bastion of the freedoms that supporters of the occupation of Afghanistan claim to be defending .
" This has further vindicated the anti-war movement 's contention that unjust wars abroad will end up consuming the very liberties that make us who we are .
" This may be a rather desperate election ploy by a conservative government reaching the end of line , or by a minister who has not cottoned on to the fact that the George Bush era is over .
" All right - thinking Canadians , whether they agree with me over the wisdom of sending troops to Afghanistan or not , will oppose this outrageous decision .
" On a personal note – for a Scotsman to be barred from Canada is like being told to stay away from the family home .
" This is not something I 'm prepared to accept . "
Galloway is due to speak at a public forum entitled Resisting War from Gaza to Kandahar , hosted by the Toronto Coalition to Stop the War later this month .
He is also due to speak at a second public forum in Mississauga , west of Toronto , on 31 March .
His proposed visit prompted the Jewish Defence League of Canada to write an open letter to the country 's government urging it to do " everything possible to keep this hater away " .
In 2006 , Galloway was refused entry to Egypt on the grounds of national security after he travelled to the country to give evidence at a " mock trial " of Tony Blair and George Bush .
He was held overnight in a police cell before the authorities changed their minds and allowed him into the country .
When you tamper with an album as awesome as Ten , it begs the question : legitimate remix or self - serving desecration ?
Upon first listen of my favorite Pearl Jam track , Alive , I noticed how much louder it seemed .
I immediately put on the original .
Definitely subdued by comparison .
But , also recognizable , correct .
I could n’t tell .
A few sleepless nights later , I decided to look at the waveform .
I listened again , unsure of whether these images were influencing me the wrong way .
The new mix now seemed too loud , while the original mix , which the band themselves seem to regard as amateur , nonetheless used its effects to enhance Vedder ’s secrets and snarls , and it sounded more evenly distributed .
I listened back and forth a few more times , my frustration growing …
There ’s only one way to get to the bottom of this and know once and for all whether this re-release is the real deal .
A side - by - side listen to both tracks .
I rigged this up in Final Cut Pro .
The top tracks represent the original 1991 version from Ten while the lower tracks are from the 2009 remix .
Vodpod videos no longer available .
Personally , while I may feel guilty losing some of the bassline and all of the vocal effects , ( mainly out of nostalgic loyalty for every last nuance of the original ) , there ’s no denying that the new cut delivers more of what made the track a classic in the first place : Vedder ’s powerful command of the vocals which ( unfairly ) draw comparisons to Robert Plant and the dynamic interplay between guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready .
These elements are stripped of any “ produced ” sound , brought front and center and made loud .
As you listen to the side - by - side you can literally hear the band ’s balls disappearing every time it switches back to the original mix .
When Gossard ’s epic solo kicked off , it laid whatever was left of my skepticism to rest .
It almost seems unfair that this new offering could become the definitive version .
I ’ve since heard the rest of the album and can say it ’s a pretty sweet improvement that seemed totally unwarranted .
Double surprise !
Winner : Alive ( 2009 )
I know there are bound to be purists who’d have me burned for saying so …
What do you think of the new remix ?
Staying true to our 6 months release cycle we will probably release BinNavi 2.1 , the latest version of our binary code reverse engineering tool , next week .
After BinNavi 1.5 and BinNavi 2.0 this is the third release of BinNavi I have been in charge of .
I want to take this opportunity to talk about the features I like most in BinNavi 2.1 .
You can actually find a more or less complete list of what is new in BinNavi 2.1 compared to BinNavi 2.0 over here .
The feature I like most in the new version of BinNavi is the ability to write programs and scripts that access the BinNavi API without actually having to start BinNavi itself .
Or as Matt Drudge would say
Breaking News : BinNavi lead dev says that the best part of the new version of BinNavi that you do not have to run BinNavi anymore
My colleague Vincenzo Iozzo actually requested this feature because he is currently working on combining BinNavi with a fuzzer to combine static and dynamic analysis in some way ( the exact details still elude me at this point ) .
Running scripts from inside BinNavi and pushing disassembly data to an external process is tedious to implement because you need some way of inter-process communication .
Having a stand - alone version of the BinNavi plugin API would be significantly easier .
It only took like 10 minutes to implement this feature but its usefulness is immense .
You can now write Jython ( or JRuby , or Java , or ... ) programs , run them from your standard shell and access the whole BinNavi API and all disassembled data managed by BinNavi without actually having to start BinNavi .
Not only does that allow you to get BinNavi disassembly data into other programs ( like fuzzers ) very easily , you can also do other cute stuff like accessing all of the disassembly data from your standard programming language shell .
Below you can see how to access BinNavi disassembly data from the Jython 2.5b3 shell to count the mnemonic distribution of a disassembled function .
Another side - effect of this feature is that you can use Jython 2.5 to access BinNavi data while scripts executed from inside BinNavi support only Jython 2.2 so far .

Another thing I really like about this release of BinNavi is the improved REIL support .
REIL is our Reverse Engineering Intermediate Language which we use for static code analysis .
You can get slides about REIL from a talk given at CanSecWest here and you can get a paper that describes REIL here .
Not only did we add REIL support for major parts of the 32 - bit PowerPC and the 32 - bit ARM instruction set ( in addition to the 32 - bit x86 support we already had in BinNavi 2.0 ) but we also added MonoREIL .
MonoREIL is a static analysis framework based on abstract interpretation .
The purpose of MonoREIL is to make it easier to write static analysis algorithms to detect security - relevant defects in code on assembly level .
Of course REIL and MonoREIL can be accessed fully from the BinNavi plugin API .
For more information about REIL and MonoREIL please check out this part of the BinNavi manual .
One of the applications of MonoREIL is register tracking , another new GUI feature which is pretty useful .
Assume you have an interesting value ( for example a pointer to unvalidated user input ) in a given register .
Now it is pretty useful to know how this value propagates through the program .
To what other registers is this value written and how does this value effect flags and therefore control flow .
This can be done with register tracking .
You simply click on an instruction in the BinNavi graph view and choose the operand you want to track .
The register tracking algorithm then calculates all influenced instructions and highlights them in the graph view .
In the screenshot below you can see an example of register tracking ( click for bigger ) .
What happened here is that in instruction 0x7C855EF7 the lpContext function argument of kernel32 !
BackupSeek is written to EAX .
For whatever reason I have decided to track the value of EAX from this point on .
That 's why this instruction is highlighted in green .
Two instructions below , this value of EAX is used as a pointer to load a value .
Light blue means that the original tracked register influences this instruction in some way and because ESI depends on the original EAX the value in ESI is tracked too from this point on .
The next instruction is interesting .
It overwrites the tracked register EAX .
That 's why it is highlighted in a light red .
There is also dark red highlighting ( not shown in the screenshot ) which means that all effects of the tracked registers are cleared at this point and the original tracked value has no effects beyond this instruction .
Some more instructions are highlighted in light blue .
These instructions are highlighted because they indirectly - through ESI - depend on the tracked value EAX .
All instructions not highlighted do not depend on the original value of EAX in any way .
Note that register tracking does not track values written to memory .
That 's why it 's called register tracking , not value tracking .
Nevertheless I want to stress that register tracking is platform - independent ( thanks to REIL ) and also works with PowerPC and ARM programs .
There are many , many other potential uses for REIL and MonoREIL which we will hopefully develop and publish in the next few months .
Another one we mentioned in the CanSecWest slides was an analysis algorithm we developed to find array accesses through negative indices .
This helped us to find the MS08 - 67 vulnerability automatically without doing any manual work except for verifying the output of the algorithm and the existence of the vulnerability .
Of course hindsight was 20:20 for the MS08 - 67 example .
By the time we wrote the analysis algorithm this vulnerability was already publicly known and documented .
Nevertheless our algorithm is generic and we hope to detect similar negative - index array - access bugs in the future .
Note that this analysis algorithm is not included in BinNavi 2.1 but we hope to include it in our fall release of BinNavi later this year .
There are a few other useful features in BinNavi 2.1 which are worth mentioning .
First , we added the ability to group arbitrary graph nodes into groups and collapse these groups .
This feature is obviously copied straight from IDA Pro where it is one of my favourite features .
We also have a dedicated stack view in the BinNavi debugger now where you can follow changes on the stack .
The scripting dialog ( where you run Jython / JRuby / ... scripts from inside BinNavi ) was improved a lot too .
For example you can now configure startup scripts which are executed every time a scripting dialog is opened .

Common Pleas Court Judge Jack A. Snite Jr. approved the dismissal of charges against Harold Cancel , 35 , but allowed the prosecutor to refile if the probe 's outcome makes that possible .
The Cancel case was hitting the deadline by which it had to be tried .
Scores more cases resulting from the work of the veteran narcotics officer could soon be in the same place .
PORTLAND , Ore. --
In October , as the stock market tanked and the economy shed 400,000 jobs , Matt Singer moved from Oxnard , Calif. to Portland , Ore .
He did n't have a job , but he was attracted to the city 's offbeat culture and hungered for change .
Mr. Singer 's plan was to get an editing or writing gig at an alternative weekly newspaper , the job he was doing in California .
Seven months later , the 26 - year - old is still without a steady job -- and still here .
" I was n't really aware of how bad the job situation was at the time , " says Mr. Singer .
This drizzly city along the Willamette River has for years been among the most popular urban magnets for college graduates looking to start their careers in a small city of like - minded folks .
Now the jobs are drying up , but the people are still coming .
The influx of new residents is part of the reason the unemployment rate in the Portland metropolitan area has more than doubled to 11.8 % over the past year , and is now above the national average of 8.9 % .
Some new arrivals are burning through their savings as they hunt for jobs that no longer exist .
Some are returning home .
Others are settling for low - paying jobs they are overqualified for .
With his search for a journalism job coming up short , Mr. Singer has spent thousands in savings , and is now earning $ 12 an hour at a temporary job scanning loan documents , a task he says is so mind - numbing he listens to his iPod all day .
" Careerwise , it 's definitely not what I 'd like to be doing , " says Mr. Singer .
The word kilt comes from the Scots word kilt , which means " to tuck up the clothes around the body . "
The Scots word derives from the Old Norse word kjalta , from Norse settlers who wore a similar , non-tartan pleated garment .
The history of the kilt goes back to the end of the 16th century .
The kilt is an item of traditional Scottish highland dress .
In the early 19th century , the highland kilt was adopted by Lowlanders and the Scottish Diaspora as a symbol of national identity .
People from many countries with Celtic ancestors wear kilts .
The original kilt ( the great kilt ) was a full length garment that featured the upper - half as a cloak that was draped over the shoulder or worn over the head as a cloak .
The walking kilt ( or small kilt ) did not come into play until the late 17th or early 18th century and was basically , the bottom half of the great kilt .
Just this week , in West Haven , Utah , principal Craig Jessop at Rocky Mountain Junior High informed 14 - year old Gavin McFarland , who comes from Scottish heritage , that the kilt he had worn twice in the past two weeks as a prop for an art project was inappropriate and could be " misconstrued as cross-dressing . "
The Weber School District later made the principal apologize to McFarland .
It 's a relief to see that the Weber School District stepped up and sided with Gavin , who was wearing attire that is important to his Scottish roots .
Regardless of whether he was crossdressing or not , I do n't see why a student would be told that was inappropriate attire .
I wonder if girls wear pants at Rocky Mountain Junior High ?
If they do , I highly doubt that would be considered crossdressing .
What IF a boy showed up wearing a dress to school ?
Do you think that there is a double standard when it comes to what society considers " appropriate " in terms of gender attire ?
Responding to the outcry over its proposed regimen of price - gouging bandwidth caps , Time Warner Cable says that it 's anxious to explain its intentions to the public .
" We appreciate the feedback we 've received , " Time Warner Chief Operating Officer Landel Hobbs wrote in a blog entry last week .
" We 'll look forward to more dialogue as we progress in these trials . "
Hobbs is referring to test market tryouts that could leave consumers paying access rates of six dollars a month per gigabyte of data .
In fact , TWC is laying out a " lower priced option " that would have " lighter Internet users " forking over 15 bucks a billing period for a single gig .
But apparently the company does n't want said dialogue to go too far , telling the Federal Communications Commission that the agency should watch its words as it advises the government on how to spend the recovery plan 's broadband stimulus money .
" Now is not the time , nor is this the appropriate proceeding , to engage in a debate about the need for net neutrality obligations , " two TWC lawyers warned the FCC on Monday .
The discussion should stay strictly focused on broadband deployment , the company insists .
" Debates in this proceeding about new net neutrality regulations would only divert attention from these important goals , delaying the distribution of funds while generating considerable contention when the Commission should instead be fostering a spirit of collaboration . "
Golly gosh , an observer might wonder , when exactly would be the right time to have a discussion over at the FCC about bandwidth cap plans that potentially ding consumers for accessing non-cable provider video content ?
Robust or bust
But TWC may be technically correct , at least proceeding - wise .
As Ars reported on Monday , the company has filed in a docket that has gotten far less publicity than the agency 's call for comments on its National Broadband Plan .
At the start of this month , the agency released a Notice of Inquiry asking for comment on the FCC's " consultative role , " through which it advises several other departments on how to roll out the 7.2 billion in broadband stimulus money contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .
Specifically , the FCC must help the National Telecommunications Information Agency define three key terms : " broadband , " " unserved , " and " underserved " areas .
It must also help outline " the non-discrimination obligations that will be contractual conditions " for those NTIA grants .
And here 's where Time Warner is ordering the FCC to mind its wording .
Besides , the company assures the Commission , " robust competition in the broadband marketplace ensures that service providers will act in consumers ’ best interests .
In particular , broadband providers must adopt reasonable pricing practices and traffic management policies or consumers will defect to a competitor that better meets their needs . "
That 's assuming , of course , that there 's a competitor in the area who is n't considering bandwidth caps as well .
So how should the FCC define " non-discrimination , " you might wonder ?
Well , the cable companies and big telcos are in a tricky legal / statutory position around this question .
Most of them probably do n't like the FCC's August 5 , 2005 Internet Policy Statement ( or " broadband policy statement , " as it's also called ) .
The document says , among other things , that the Commission " has a duty to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age . "
And one of them , Comcast , definitely thinks that the agency was way out of line to invoke this statement when sanctioning the company for P2P throttling last year , and has filed legal papers against the FCC in federal court .
Expect arguments that the Commission never really properly established the declaration as a set of rules when the trial starts .
Now we 're stuck with it
But the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has hard - wired the FCC 's pronouncement into law , at least when it comes to stimulus grantees .
The legislation requires of grant recipients " at a minimum , adherence to the principles contained in the Commission ’s broadband policy statement . "
Plus the government must publish , in consultation with the Commission , " the non-discrimination and network interconnection obligations that shall be contractual conditions of grants awarded . "
So many of the big industry groups that have filed in this proceeding , like the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , have conceded that the FCC should define " non-discrimination " in this instance as " adherence to the principles contained in the FCC's August 2005 Broadband Policy Statement . "
But the agency should go no further , they urge .
" Imposing new and untested nondiscrimination or interconnection requirements as a condition of stimulus funding risks injecting contentiousness , uncertainty , and delay into a process that should focus on creating new jobs and new broadband connections as quickly as possible , " NCTA added in a filing submitted on Monday .
TWC is definitely on board with this stance .
There is a dialed up tone to the company 's comments , however , that sets it apart from the crowd .
" The Commission should be especially loathe to recommend the application of net neutrality regulations in connection with programs that are intended to spur additional investment , " the company warns .
But with the FCC's National Broadband Plan NOI asking how " the Commission should evaluate the term ' access ' with certain basic consumer expectations in mind , " and with a member of Congress calling for a law whacking bandwidth caps outright , it seems like this aspect of the net neutrality debate may be about to open a new chapter , and not just over the blogosphere .
Columnists give a newspaper its edge and flavour , its zest and colour .
They are often outspoken , always provocative and can usually be relied upon to spark a furious response .
They should be allowed to campaign fearlessly for what they believe to be right , but as CP Scott wrote : " The voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard .
Comment also is justly subject to a self - imposed restraint .
It is well to be frank ; it is even better to be fair . "
These words came to mind when reading a letter from several co-signatories who felt that Observer columnist Nick Cohen had gone beyond the bounds of reasonable comment when he asked Shiraz Maher , the co-author of a paper on the government 's counterterrorism strategy , why he had not offered it to left think - tanks such as the Fabians or the Institute for Public Policy Research .
Cohen reported that Maher had guffawed at the suggestion .
" They would never print what he wrote .
For this Muslim liberal , the left was no longer a home but an obstacle . "
Fabian general - secretary Sunder Katwala saw this as a direct accusation that his and other left organisations had deliberately suppressed criticism of Islamist extremism .
He launched a furious denial on his blog which met an equally spirited blog from Cohen , in which he admitted to sharing Maher 's " contempt " for the Fabians .
Then former New Statesman political editor Martin Bright joined in , accusing Katwala of bullying Cohen and trying to silence him .
It 's tempting to dismiss all this as just so much scrapping by a small clique , but let 's look a little closer at the detail .
Shiraz Maher , Cohen 's " Muslim liberal " , is a former Islamist activist who associated with Glasgow bomber Bilal Abdulla , recently jailed for at least 32 years .
Readers should have been told that .
Maher wrote in the Mail on Sunday last month about government ministers being unwilling to promote the idea of Britishness , yet the concept of what it is to be British is central to Gordon Brown 's government and has been a major Fabian theme .
If Maher really is this out of touch with democratic public debate , it calls into question his credibility on the subject of think - tanks .
Katwala told me that Maher had never had any contact with the Fabians or the IPPR , but " his co-authored paper is quite good ; it contains nothing we could not have published " , so it would appear that Maher and Cohen 's accusation of censorship is without foundation in this case .
As a footnote , I offer the unrelated story of Hassan Butt .
He claimed to be a former al - Qaida operative who called upon his fellow Muslims to renounce violence .
He wrote a piece for the Observer in July 2007 which readers praised for its bravery ; Nick Cohen , along with many others , wrote about him last year .
However , at a recent trial of another man accused of terrorist offences , Butt said that he had made the whole thing up , telling journalists stories " the media wanted to hear " and admitting that he was " a professional liar " .

The Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , which provides position , navigation , and timing data to users worldwide , has become essential to U.S. national security and a key tool in an expanding array of public service and commercial applications at home and abroad .
The United States provides GPS data free of charge .
The Air Force , which is responsible for GPS acquisition , is in the process of modernizing GPS .
In light of the importance of GPS , the modernization effort , and international efforts to develop new systems , GAO was asked to undertake a broad review of GPS .
Specifically , GAO assessed progress in ( 1 ) acquiring GPS satellites , ( 2 ) acquiring the ground control and user equipment necessary to leverage GPS satellite capabilities , and evaluated ( 3 ) coordination among federal agencies and other organizations to ensure GPS missions can be accomplished .
To carry out this assessment , GAO 's efforts included reviewing and analyzing program documentation , conducting its own analysis of Air Force satellite data , and interviewing key officials .
It is uncertain whether the Air Force will be able to acquire new satellites in time to maintain current GPS service without interruption .
If not , some military operations and some civilian users could be adversely affected .
( 1 ) In recent years , the Air Force has struggled to successfully build GPS satellites within cost and schedule goals ; it encountered significant technical problems that still threaten its delivery schedule ; and it struggled with a different contractor .
As a result , the current IIF satellite program has overrun its original cost estimate by about $ 870 million and the launch of its first satellite has been delayed to November 2009 - - almost 3 years late .
( 2 ) Further , while the Air Force is structuring the new GPS IIIA program to prevent mistakes made on the IIF program , the Air Force is aiming to deploy the next generation of GPS satellites 3 years faster than the IIF satellites .
GAO 's analysis found that this schedule is optimistic , given the program 's late start , past trends in space acquisitions , and challenges facing the new contractor .
Of particular concern is leadership for GPS acquisition , as GAO and other studies have found the lack of a single point of authority for space programs and frequent turnover in program managers have hampered requirements setting , funding stability , and resource allocation .
( 3 ) If the Air Force does not meet its schedule goals for development of GPS IIIA satellites , there will be an increased likelihood that in 2010 , as old satellites begin to fail , the overall GPS constellation will fall below the number of satellites required to provide the level of GPS service that the U.S. government commits to .
Such a gap in capability could have wide - ranging impacts on all GPS users , though there are measures the Air Force and others can take to plan for and minimize these impacts .
In addition to risks facing the acquisition of new GPS satellites , the Air Force has not been fully successful in synchronizing the acquisition and development of the next generation of GPS satellites with the ground control and user equipment , thereby delaying the ability of military users to fully utilize new GPS satellite capabilities .
Diffuse leadership has been a contributing factor , given that there is no single authority responsible for synchronizing all procurements and fielding related to GPS , and funding has been diverted from ground programs to pay for problems in the space segment .
DOD and others involved in ensuring GPS can serve communities beyond the military have taken prudent steps to manage requirements and coordinate among the many organizations involved with GPS .
However , GAO identified challenges in the areas of ensuring civilian requirements can be met and ensuring GPS compatibility with other new , potentially competing global space - based positioning , navigation , and timing systems .
1 . Theseus , the hero who became king of Athens , by an Amazon had an illegitimate child named Hippolytus .
Hippolytus stayed chaste while practicing hunting , tending to horses , and other affairs of “ manly men . ”
When Hippolytus had grown ,
Theseus took another , younger wife , Phaedra , who bore him several children .
Phaedra fell in love with Hippolytus ; the legend has that some attempt was made to seduce him .
He said “ no ” to her and she killed herself , leaving a suicide note accusing him of attempting rape .
Theseus read the note , believed Phaedra , prayed to Poseidon to destroy Hippolytus and exiled him .
Given that Poseidon promised
Theseus three wishes , this was a father murdering his child ; Poseidon did as he was asked .
The goddess Artemis , in the play , has to make the truth known to Theseus who would otherwise believe he understood the situation perfectly : in the play , he is grateful for the death of his son until she appears .
The question is :
Why does of any of this messed - up story matter ?
Were the ancient Greeks into perverted amusements ?
If so , why could n’t they have transmitted something with more sex and a lot fewer head games ?
I ca n’t promise that any of the speculation in this post will be even remotely correct , but the question of the play ’s immediate relevance is what I want to focus on right now .
2 . One way of reading the play itself is as an indictment of Theseus .
The play begins with Aphrodite swearing that will she be revenged upon Hippolytus , who is extremely dismissive of her , only worshipping Artemis , the goddess of hunting who is chaste .
The play ends with Theseus saying that he shall remember the injuries Aphrodite caused him .
It is not hard to believe that Aphrodite and Artemis are working together in this cause .
Hippolytus does seem to be Artemis ’ best follower : she speaks to him ( lines 86 - 87 ) , although he never sees her face to face until he is dying .
But when we consider that Hippolytus does not really need Artemis ( Benardete 95 ) , that his chastity and excellence in things such as hunting are due to his ability alone , it becomes unclear whether he could actually be a devotee of the god .
Hippolytus swears by Zeus he will accept exile if he has been a “ villain ” ( l. 1025 - 1031 ) : in putting forth or accepting exile , he is effectively saying he cannot worship Artemis any longer , from whose “ inviolate Meadow ” he has created gifts for her .
Hippolytus is not in love with Artemis : she is a woman , after all , and Hippolytus does not think terribly highly of women .
Lines 616 – 627 bear witness to this –
“ Women !
This coin which men find counterfeit !
Why , why , Lord Zeus , did you put them in the world ,
in the light of the sun ?
If you were so determined
to breed the race of man , the source of it
should not have been women .
Men might have dedicated
in your own temples images of gold ,
silver , or weight of bronze , and thus have bought
the seed of progeny , … to each been given
his worth in sons according to the assessment
of his gift ’s value .
So we might have lived
in houses free of the taint of women ’s presence .
But now , to bring this plague into our homes
we drain the fortunes of our homes .
In this
we have a proof how great a curse is woman . ”
Now I have not bothered to quote all of Hippolytus ’ misogynistic rant , for this reason : like all Greek tragedy , this play is irreducibly complex .
It turns out some of the things women are accused of by Hippolytus they themselves , in the play , will admit both to being guilty of and deserving of punishment .
And the misogyny here , as problematic as it is , ca n’t be taken too far : while Hippolytus may not need Artemis , he does worship her , and he certainly respects her .
The most interesting thing is the connection of women to wealth .
Hippolytus is chaste , but not moderate : he can see a world where wealth alone brings forth progeny .
Private property seems to be his greatest good , going hand - in - hand with self - sufficiency .
When we consider his initial prayer to Artemis , lines 71 – 83 –
“ My Goddess Mistress , I bring you ready woven
this garland .
It was I that plucked and wove it ,
plucked it for you in your inviolate Meadow .
No shepherd dares to feed his flock within it :
no reaper plies a busy scythe within it :
only the bees in springtime haunt the inviolate Meadow .
Its gardener is the spirit Reverence who
refreshes it with water from the river .
Not those who by instruction have profited
to learn , but in whose very soul the seed
of Chastity toward all things alike
nature has deeply rooted , they alone
may gather flowers there !
the wicked may not . ” [ boldface mine ]
– we see the material , bodily self - sufficiency of the Meadow immediately .
We also see how Hippolytus has turned the natural world itself into private property : it just happens to be owned by a goddess .
Moreover , look at what has happened to thought : the things one learns by instruction are shared – they cannot be holy , nor proper to man , for man needs only one thing .
3 . We will discuss that one thing very shortly , but we need to flesh out why this might be an indictment of Theseus .
Theseus as a hero was extremely reckless – he first made his mark going to places where bandits were known to set up , killing each bandit the way the bandit killed his victims .
That “ eye - for - an - eye ” justice proved to be no justice at all , just a form of “ I ’m better than you . ”
When he killed the Minotaur and escaped Minos ’ labyrinth – all thanks to Phaedra ’s sister , Ariadne , whom he had loved – he ditched her on the island of Naxos .
He had no qualms about letting his father think he had perished , so that the old man would do something drastic , i.e. commit suicide and leave him stuff .
I think it is also Theseus who attempted to kidnap Helen as a baby , knowing she ’d grow up to be hot .
In other words : Theseus is the “ hero ” who gets whatever he wants and does n’t pay any price .
He ’s also the king of Athens , and yes , while this is all well before Athens will become the democracy Euripides is writing for , one cannot help but feel there is a moral critique here .
I do n’t think it will surprise any of you to know that Athenian law was very restrictive regarding women , basically confining them to the house .
Athenian men took each other as lovers often .
4. Benardete is pretty direct about Hippolytus himself :
Imitation for Hippolytus is obedience [ ed .
– another reason why he cannot be pious ] .
It is , accordingly , not completely true that Hippolytus is entirely without love ; but what he loves is as alien as he himself is .
After wishing that he could pity himself , and Theseus having accused him of self - worship rather than justice toward his parents , Hippolytus bursts out : “ Oh miserable mother !
Oh bitter birth : may no friend of mine be a bastard . ”
Legitimacy , he believes , is the indispensible basis for love .
So Hippolytus is in love ; he is in love with the law … .
This love of Hippolytus cannot be requited , for he is outside the law both by birth and by nature , and therefore in his uniqueness he longs for the universality of the law .
His hatred of women is thus not a direct function of his chastity but his way of being useful to the law from which he is forever excluded ( Benardete 96 ) .
It may seem strange to combine universality and private property , but notice that we have done that today .
It may seem even stranger to do that in this play – would Hippolytus never consent to exile , if he truly loved the law because of property ?
– but I think the relevant concern is as follows .
The things we love we must see as benefactors in some way ( this brings up the question of whether we ever truly love beauty ) .
Hippolytus sees the law as ennobling , making him who he is .
In Euripides ’
Athens , there is open factional warfare between those who would side with “ Old Athens ” – children of oligarchs and some aristocrats , people with money who cannot stand the democracy and its arbitrariness with the law , their traditions – and those of “ New Athens , ” certain democrats , some of whom are from households of higher standing , whose desires change but are always fervent .
That ’s the battle really being depicted here , I suspect .
Theseus unleashed this problem by being a “ hero ” who was not a hero and attempting to rule .
But getting everything you want is no basis for rule , even if you want children who are so dedicated to order that they want to preserve every last letter of the law .
I do n’t know that Phaedra is a democrat : that ’s where this attempt to read this entirely as a metaphor for a very particular political situation ends .
It looks more like she ’s one who wants to love the law and the law - abiding merely for being that , rather than human .
It is no surprise she ends up killing herself and falsely accusing Hippolytus to preserve her name , so her children are not tainted .
Underlying devotion to the law in - and - of itself is not the unity of a people , as the example of lawyers demonstrates daily .

Tech / Help
Why we wo n’t help :
The difference between helping and enabling
Sometimes when someone comes in and asks for help , I say no , even though I know I will be berated for it .
It is just sometimes not worth it to help certain people .
Let me lay out a series of events , that are all recent , to explain why :
The case of the flat tire
A woman in her mid-20s , comes to the store with a flat tire which is just slapping around the wheel , not holding air .
She parks the car in front of the door , the flat tire is steaming and pieces of it are crumbling onto the asphalt , she walks to the front counter wearing a uniform of a popular fast - food restaurant , her name is on her nametag .
She introduces herself to me and I recognize her last name , her mother is a customer at the store .
She says she needs a tire .
I have a few in that size , she chooses one , we get the car on the lift and put the tire on .
I call her to the front counter to pay .
Me : That will be $ 87.73 please .
Her :
Oh , I do n't have the money , can my mom pay the next time she 's in .
Me : No .
Do you need to use the phone to call a friend or family member for the money ?
Her : Sure . ( makes a few phone calls )
My boyfriend is on his way but he only has $ 40 .
Me : OK , that 's a start .
( pause )
Her : ( silence )
Me : ( silence )
( Man in his 20s enters , he is wearing a uniform from the same fast food place .
This restaurant is on the same road as our business .
He gives me $ 40 in cash . )
Her : OK ... well ... I need to go .
Me : Yes ma'am , I still need $ 47.73
Her : I do n't have it but we both get paid on Friday ( today is Tuesday ) .
We work right there ( she points to the restaurant , you can see the top of the sign from our lobby , just down the road from us ) can I pay you then ?
Me : ( Against my better judgement but it seems a safe bet , so ... )
OK .
Come by Friday before 6:00 and pay the rest .
Her and the guy :
Thank you !
See you then !
Friday comes and goes ... neither of them show up .
Once the next Tuesday rolls around , I go to the restaurant but I do n't see her car .
I do n't know what the boyfriend is driving but I figure I 'll at least run into one of them there or at least find out when one of them is working again , so I go up to the counter .
Me : Is Sherry here ?
Dude : Yes , hold on , Sherry !
Sherry : Hi - I meant to tell you , I do n't have that car anymore .
Me :
You still owe me $ 47.73 for the tire .
Sherry :
But I do n't have the car anymore .
I wrecked it on Thursday and it 's gone .
Me :
That has nothing to do with the money you owe me - I need you to pay your bill .
Sherry : I can't , I do n't have the car , I 'm not going to pay for something I do n't have any more .
Me :
Well then give me my tire back .
Sherry : I do n't have it .
Me : Neither do I , because you took it from me without paying for it .
Sherry :
Well , you let me .
Me : Good point .
Tell you what - keep the money , and do n't ever come back to my place again .
You and your boyfriend and your mom and your whole family .
Tell them to stay away and if I ever see you on my property again , I 'm calling the police .
Sherry : Fine !
Two days later , her mother came by and paid the bill and apologized for her daughter 's behavior , and I still told her the girl was not welcome back .
She understood .
The case of the angry veteran
A man in his 60s comes by the store , steam pouring out from under the hood of an Oldsmobile that appears to be about five years old .
He introduces himself at the front counter , he is new in town , but his niece is a regular customer of our store and recommended he come to us when his car overheated .
The man is wearing a Vietnam ball cap and t- shirt , and is walking with a limp .
I explain to him the cost on a pressure test / leak check for his coolant system , go through a couple of standard warnings about overheating and how quickly damage can be done to cylinder heads and the engine .
He agrees on the test and we proceed .
It turns out it is a split in the radiator .
The tech is also recommending replacing the thermostat and gasket , and the radiator hoses .
The total cost of the repair is around $ 400 .
The man says yes , please do it .
While he is waiting , he hovers at the front counter , telling me everything about his current living situation - he is a wounded veteran , lives alone , needs to make constant trips to doctors offices and therapy , relies on his car for transportation .
( I know what you are thinking - is n't there a veteran 's administration ?
Yes , in our area , there is .
And they provide free transportation .
He is not the only wounded veteran I know .
But , I 'm just making light conversation with him , and honestly trying to work and answer the phone while he 's talking , it 's none of my business , I do n't ask details on a stranger 's personal life , so I let that point go . )
The car repair is complete a few hours later .
I give him the total .
He fishes around in his pants pocket and hands me three crumpled up $ 20 bills .
Me : Sir , that will be $ 421.18
Customer :
This is all I have .
Me : Perhaps you need to call a friend or family member to give you a ride to the bank or something ?
I can wait .
Customer : No , this is ALL I have .
When I pay you this , I do n't have money for food .
Me : Sir , there 's a phone in the waiting room , let me know when you are ready to pay and I 'll ring you out .
Customer :
This is all the money there is .
I can't pay you any more .
Me : Understood , but the bill is $ 421.18 .
Please come back when you can pay .
Customer : I get my government disability check on the 3rd , I can pay you the rest then .
Me : OK , see you then .
Customer : ( blank stare )
Me : ( blank stare )
Customer : So , give me my keys .
Me : Absolutely , as soon as you complete payment , I 'll release the vehicle .
Customer :
You can't do that .
I have to have this car to get to the doctor 's office .
( Understand at this time other customers have been up to the front counter also , checking in , or checking on their car , or being rung out by another employee .
A couple of them start to hover around the counter out of curiousity . )
Me : Sir , at the time you approved the repairs , you did not tell me you could not pay for them .
The repairs are done , you need to pay to pick up your vehicle .
Otherwise , come back when you can pay for the repairs .
What followed was a loud and emphatic lecture about how he fought for my freedom , how he served his country , how horrible he was being treated , and what a disgrace we are to our country for denying a wounded veteran food by taking his last dollar , and how his word was his honor and he would pay me on the 3rd as promised .
I am angry .
I feel like I 'm part of an orchestrated scam .
I feel he is experienced in this .
My instincts are rarely wrong .
His tone of voice , the way the speech ramped up , the way he addresses the other customers , all felt rehearsed .
However , can you have a wounded veteran at your front counter , in a Vietnam t- shirt and ball cap , proclaiming his service to the country , and berating you in front of people , and having people sympathetically tilt their heads and sigh with sadness , and not do whatever you need to do to cut the drama short and make it go away ?
So I take $ 40 , leaving him the $ 20 for food until the 3rd , he signs the invoice and provides the necessary identification of his address , full name , etc. and we agree he will return on the 3rd and pay the remainder of the bill .
His tone changes to giddy jubilation , he proclaims us all " patriotic " , and leaves with his car .
Can you guess what happened next ?
The 3rd rolls around , he 's not there .
Then the 10th , the 20th , the 30th .
Then when the 3rd of the following month rolls around , and my many messages have gone unanswered , and I have sent him registered mail reminding him of his bill , and I have placed calls to his niece who very dismissively tells me she has little to do with him and rarely sees him , I go looking for his neighborhood and find him , and the car .
Me : Mr. (*** ) , you still owe this bill .
Not -Customer : I can't pay it .
Me :
This is the second month since you said you would pay it .
Not -Customer : I wo n't be spending money on that , I need my money for food .
Me : I will expect then that you are not to come back to my property until you have paid this bill .
( Rest of conversation is pointless and goes badly .
He does suggest that I sue him . )
I can sue him , right ?
I have his signature .
I have MANY witnesses .
But how would that go ?
Can you imagine what would happen ?
This guy would probably have a press conference first about how we are persecuting wounded veterans .
Just time to cut my losses and walk away .
The case of the Cadillac lady
An older woman driving a 20 + year old Cadillac comes in , she is walking stooped over and has a cane .
Another customer holds the door open for her .
It 's a Tuesday , that will be important to know to understand this story .
She comes up to the front counter and said she was getting a warning light on her dashboard and asked if we could check and top off her fluids for her .
Normally checking the fluids is free , we 'll check fluids and tire pressure at any time for free .
Topping off air is free , fluids are not free .
We do n't get fluids for free , we do n't give them away for free .
I have never seen her before and she is hard of hearing , so just to keep things brief I say okay and ask a tech to check and top off and let her go .
She goes back out to her car and does not even ask if it costs anything and does not even offer to pay ( many people who are new will ask us if there is a charge to put air in the tires - I am sure they know that it is free , but they are just being courteous and showing appreciation . ) .
The next day , Wednesday , she 's back .
She says maybe they forgot to check her antifreeze and she 's getting a warning light and asks if we can check again .
The tech who did it Tuesday is off on Wednesday so I ask someone different , and this time I walk out there myself .
The other fluids are dead on but the coolant is low , which is not at all like Tech # 1 to forget .
I am suspecting there 's more than just forgetting to top off coolant .
I start to explain to her about the possibilities - she might have a leak , the sensor might not be working , but it is very hard to talk to her because she seems to not be able to hear well .
I give up and ask tech # 2 to top off her coolant .
I watch it myself .
Then when she starts the car , I look inside at her dashboard and see the light come on , then go off again .
She leaves , again does not even ask or offer to pay .
Thursday , she is back and annoyed with me , at the front counter there are already a few people as it is lunchtime and that 's the most popular time for people to get an oil change or something else quickly , so she has to wait , and when she gets up to the front counter , being kind of hard of hearing , she is very loud and says we have n't helped her and she 's still getting a warning light .
I am trying to explain to her that her car needs to be diagnosed and she probably has a problem with it but I can't just keep pouring antifreeze in it for free every day .
She is yelling .
She is not steady on her feet and customers are tilting their heads and sadly sighing as I am being berated by an old woman with a cane saying we are not fixing her car .
Mainly for the benefit of people listening , I explain that we have added coolant FOR FREE twice to her car but the car has a problem and she needs to get the problem fixed .
She is becoming angry .
She keeps saying " Why wo n't you help me ? " and I keep saying " Dumping coolant on the ground does not help you !
The car needs to be fixed !
Leave it with me and I will find what is wrong so it can be fixed ! "
She says she can't , she needs her car .
She keeps asking me to add more coolant .
I say no .
I am getting yelled at by an old woman who can barely stay on her feet with a cane .
But I 've had enough of this extortion and I 'm not doing it any more .
I say as loud as I can " MA'AM YOUR CAR HAS A LEAK .
ADDING COOLANT DOES NOT HELP .
WE CAN FIX YOUR CAR .
IT IS NOT FREE .
I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE FOR FREE .
IF YOU WANT IT FIXED , LEAVE IT WITH ME .
IF NOT , I AM NOT GIVING YOU ANY MORE FREE COOLANT .
THAT IS ALL ! "
She leaves in disgust , yelling also at the other customers about how she can't get any help , that no one will help her , that we wo n't fix her car .
People glare at me like I 'm the devil .
There are many charities we are regular contributors of , and many organizations who come to us for help .
This is money we choose to donate to organizations of our choice .
These people who rely on sympathy , causing a scene , or emotional blackmail to get what they want are not charities , they are scam artists .
Whether they do it intentionally or not , their behaviour gets rewarded by the businesses they pull these stunts on so they keep doing it .
They may not be walking in the door thinking " I 'm here to pull a scam , " they might just be thinking " I will ask these people to help me ; " I do n't know what 's in their heads but it works for them and somehow they justify what they do .
So does this mean we are anti-pregnant women , anti-wounded veterans , and anti-old ladies ?
Or just tired of being ripped off and tired of being forced to " donate " against our will ?

Mr. Kiser , of the outdoor power equipment group , said some initial tests already indicated that E15 could cause serious problems  including safety issues  with some small engines .
Image The E.P.A. may allow more ethanol in gasoline .
Credit ... Dan Neville / The New York Times
At Honda , which makes a wide range of engines for products from minivans to power generators , the concern is that the effects of a big increase in an additive like ethanol are unknown , said Edward B. Cohen , vice president for government and industry relations at American Honda .
“ The impact can be on the emissions system , like the catalytic converter , ” he said .
“ It can be on the various tubes or couplings that are part of the fuel system , and it could affect the performance of the vehicle , particularly cold starting . ”
Honda can design engines to run well on new gasoline blends , Mr. Cohen said .
The issue is the legacy fleet , whose engines were designed over two decades for varying requirements .
There is no single answer , Mr. Cohen said , to the question of how E15 would affect them .
The American Petroleum Institute is also concerned , said Robert Greco , the group director of downstream and industry operations .
He said more research was needed  probably several years ’ worth  before the institute would be convinced that E15 was safe for so many different kinds of engines .
“ We think that the current waiver request is premature , ” Mr. Greco said .
“ The science is n’t in yet . ”
And Jeremy Martin , a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists , an environmental advocacy group based in Cambridge , Mass. , said there was simply not enough solid information on which to make a decision that would have such a broad impact .
“ We should n’t just look at a little data and extrapolate , ” he said .
“ There are rules here , and there are procedures .
And there is a proper engineering way to come to this determination .
One can guess about the most likely outcomes , but that is not sufficient to put all the fleet at risk . ”
Wendy Clark , group manager and principal researcher in the fuels performance group at the Energy Department ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory , said a lot of credible organizations were studying E15 .
But she said it was too early to know for sure how engines would be affected .
One question is how many of the studies will be done before Dec. 1 , the date by which the E.P.A. is required by law to make its decision .

Mr Shepherd says he could face the death penalty if returned to the US American Iraq veteran Andre Shepherd shocked fellow servicemen when he walked off his military base in Germany and deserted the US army .
Now he is causing even more of a stir by applying for the right of asylum in Germany .
It was the middle of the night in April 2007 when Mr Shepherd packed a few things and walked out of the gates of his American army base in Katterbach onto German soil .
" I could no longer support this illegal war in Iraq with a clear conscience , " explained the 31 - year - old , who had been due to return to Iraq where he had already spent six months serving as an Apache helicopter mechanic .
" It has been proved that Saddam Hussein was not a direct threat to the United States and the war is simply being waged in order for the US to gain access to raw materials in the Middle East , " he said .
After almost two years spent living underground in Germany , he has now applied for asylum .
His case rests on a European Union law guaranteeing refugee status to soldiers who might be prosecuted for desertion if military service involves violating international law .
This is just Shepherd 's way of avoiding his responsibilities completely
Jonn Lilyea
Military blogger According to Mr Shepherd , that is exactly what the war in Iraq does .
If sent back to the US , Mr Shepherd would be court - martialled and most likely sent to prison for a period of between six months and a couple of years .
" In theory desertion can also result in the death penalty , " says Mr Shepherd , although the last US serviceman to receive this punishment was in 1945 .
But German politicians are wary of supporting his case .
" A soldier deserting the army because his conscience no longer allows him to carry out his military duties is clearly not a reason for him to be granted political asylum here , " says Christian Democrat ( CDU ) politician and deputy chair of the CDU / CSU parliamentary group , Wolfgang Bosbach .
Mr Shepherd is the first Iraq veteran to apply for refugee status in Europe , and there are fears that his case could encourage some of the other 60,000 American soldiers based in Germany to desert and do the same .
Others argue that granting him asylum would damage US - German relations by effectively defining the war in Iraq as illegal .
Public support Campaigners say more than 25,000 US soldiers have deserted since 2003
The pretty medieval town of Freiburg in southern Germany , with its cobbled streets and ornate half - timbered houses , is a far cry from the bombs of Baghdad .
But , incongruous as it may be , it is here that the deserters ' campaign group Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) is holding a discussion forum to gather support in Germany for Mr Shepherd 's case .
According to anti-war campaigners , more than 25,000 US soldiers have deserted since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Although only 30 of them now live in Germany , they can count on substantial support here .
The majority of Germans have always opposed the war in Iraq , and German soldiers have never been sent to Iraq as part of the conflict .
Your home country will always think you are a traitor , whether you were justified or not
Andre Shepherd Wearing a black T - shirt bearing the campaign 's name , Chris Capps - Schubert explained that he deserted over disgust at how the war in Iraq was being waged .
" I worked in telecommunications and when I found myself laying down cables for Abu Ghraib prison , I just thought , oh , so that 's what I 'm doing here , " he says , referring to the Baghdad detention centre where Iraqi prisoners were tortured by American soldiers .
Mr Capps - Schubert deserted his base in Mannheim after coming back from Iraq and before being sent out again to Afghanistan .
He turned himself in for court martial in May 2007 , thereby avoiding a prison sentence .
Today he advises US servicemen on how to leave the army .
US disgust Critics say Mr Shepherd left other soldiers to do what he would not Although deserters are now getting a certain amount of support from American anti-war campaigners , Mr Shepherd 's application for asylum has been scorned by many US servicemen and veterans .
" This is just Shepherd 's way of avoiding his responsibilities completely - not going to Iraq and not willing to go to jail for breaking his promises and forcing his duties on his comrades , " writes Desert Storm veteran and blogger , Jonn Lilyea .
Other military bloggers are even more direct with their criticisms , and the accusation of " coward " is one of the least offensive things Mr Shepherd is being called online .
At the end of February German immigration authorities heard Mr Shepherd 's case , and are currently examining his eligibility for asylum .
A decision should be reached within the next few months .
If asylum is knocked back , Mr Shepherd has said he will appeal to the courts , a process which could take up to five years .
In the meantime , Mr Shepherd can legally stay in Germany , but cannot return to the United States .
The decision to desert was not an easy one , Mr Shepherd says .
" Your home country will always think you are a traitor , whether you were justified or not , " he explained .
" Although my family is supporting me , they wish I 'd taken a different step , because the potential for me not returning [ home ] causes a lot of emotional stress .
I have to apologise to my parents for that . "

The FAQ
Compiz
Compiz is what is known as a " compositing manager . "
It enables your desktop to run faster than with traditional window managers , and allows you to be more productive .
Compiz controls the effects you see on your desktop : Shadows , animations , " the cube , " and a whole bundle of other fun effects .
On Ubuntu 7.10 and up :
Open System > Preferences >
Appearance .
Click on the Visual Effects tab .
If Compiz and desktop effects are enabled , Normal , Extra , or Custom will be selected .
If Compiz is disabled , None will be selected .
To switch modes , simply click on another selection .
Changes take effect immediately .
Install the package fusion - icon and reload your session for a notification icon to switch between Compiz and the standard window manager .
Beryl was merged back into the Compiz project to create what is now know as Compiz Fusion .
Beryl is no longer supported or developed meaning that if there is a bug , no one will fix it .
Therefore it is recommended that you use Compiz Fusion which comes installed by default in Ubuntu .
Custom only appears if the package System > Preferences > Simple CompizConfig Settings Manager .
only appears if the package simple - ccsm is installed .
When you install simple - ccsm , a new selection will be available in Visual Effects , which allows you to customize what effects are active on your desktop .
You can also customize the effects from
You can also access it from System > Preferences >

If you are looking for more options , install the package compizconfig - settings - manager .
Be sure to keep simple - ccsm installed so that the Custom option remains available in Visual Effects .
You can also access it fromor by opening a terminal ( or Alt + F2 ) and typing

Why does n't Compiz start ?

Eating high - fat curries may not be as bad for us as we thought - at least , not if we lace them with turmeric .
Scientists at Boston 's Tufts University found that mice fed a high - fat diet that contained curcumin , a component of turmeric , put on less weight .
This puts the spice in that magic group of foods with health - giving properties - along with garlic , ginger and fish oils .
Like ginger , turmeric is a rhizome , a horizontal stem of a plant that grows underground .
Generally speaking , it is prized more for its colour than its flavour : turmeric is the oldest natural food dye in the world , and is now seen in ingredients lists as E100 .
In my opinion , however , this downgrading from flavour to colour is largely due to the spice we get in Britain being old and dull by the time it reaches us .
In Zanzibar , I got the shock of my life when I cut into a nugget just dug from the earth : it had an intense smell , was dazzlingly bright and practically orange in colour , with an interesting , bitter , earthy flavour .
Indispensable all over Asia , turmeric forms the basis of most curry powders , and during the Raj , we Brits loved it in our piccalilli and kedgeree .
These days it is commonly used in the batter for fish and chips , and ( mistakenly ) as a replacement for expensive saffron in dishes from paella to fish pie or sauces such as rouille .
It is the unsung hero of the spice rack , though , so my advice to unlocking the inner flavour would be to go to the kind of shop or market where you are more likely to encounter turmeric that was ground in this century , then fry it gently with something simple to let the flavour come out .
Turmeric seems to respond particularly well to other roots , such as carrots and spuds - especially with a few mustard seeds - as well as the bigger meats such as mutton and lamb .
Tomatoes , too .
It is only by giving it a chance to go pretty - much solo that we cooks can really get to grips with its hidden depths .

Take 20 wallets .
Fill each with $ 43.77 ( enough change for a TTC ride and a little extra for good measure ) , photo ID , baby pictures , a grocery list , receipts , a contact number , an ATM card , a fancy hankie and a handwritten love note .
Now " lose " the wallets in high - traffic areas across Greater Toronto where people work , play and pray .
Now wait .
Would the one stashed beside the $ 197 bottle of Fonterutoli " Siepi " in the Vintages section of the Summerhill LCBO stand a better chance of being returned than the wallet dropped on the pedestrian bridge in Humber Park ?
Would lawyers - in - training at Osgoode Hall out - Samaritan the patrons of the Parkdale Public Library ?
Over a two - week period , the Toronto Star conducted this admittedly unscientific experiment to challenge the city 's honesty .
Of the 20 wallets dropped , 15 have been returned so far .
We 're trying to reach two additional callers who left messages before this story went to press .
The exercise yielded some surprising results .
For one , honesty is different than goodness .
Goodness is bigger .
It 's going out of one 's way to return that lost item .
It 's empathizing with someone you 've never met .
And , boy , is Toronto good .
In fact , so many concerned citizens called repeatedly that our special phone line ( the emergency contact number left in the wallet ) was almost instantly clogged with messages .
" Hi . It 's James again .
I just wanted you to know that in case I 'm in the TTC , just leave a message and I 'll call you back .
Please call . "
That was James Song , 21 , who had gone to the Eaton Centre with a buddy hoping to chat up a pretty clerk he had met earlier that week at the Yogen Fruz .
She was n't there but a wallet was – abandoned by the big fountain in the lower level .
Song , who 's taking a year off his studies in chemical engineering at the University of Toronto and later admitted he could 've used the money in the wallet , waited by the fountain for 20 minutes , hoping to spot the woman whose photo ID he found inside .
" I 'm like , how is this person going to get their groceries done ?
That 's all I was thinking , " he says .
Paul Dowell , a brawny realtor who looks like he makes a living lifting homes instead of selling them , left his office in Don Mills mid-morning last week to come downtown , fetch the wallet from his house and hand deliver it to its owner less than four hours after finding it in the Beaches .
" It was n't a big deal , " he says .
" I was working on taxes . "
Dowell found the wallet on a boardwalk bench just outside Kew Gardens Tennis Club .
" Losing my wallet myself , I know how insane it is , not knowing who 's got your identity , " he says after learning the real story .
Ken Gallinger , the Star 's ethics columnist , estimated we 'd see no more than half a dozen wallets returned .
On hearing the results , he offers an explanation : " It 's hard to do bad to someone with a name and a story .
I would think the more you put in a wallet that connects it to a real person , that just adds to the motivation to return it . "
Lorraine Methven , principal of the Toronto Island School , found the wallet aboard the Ongiara ferry on her ride home after school .
" I was thinking , here is a person who has either a child or a grandchild , " she says .
" I know if I lost something and somebody returned it , I 'd be quite ecstatic .
I wanted to do the same for somebody else . "
Silvana Fazzolari also put herself in the wallet owner 's shoes .
Her husband found the wallet when they returned their shopping cart at Whole Foods Market in Oakville .
She offered to track down the owner , explaining to her husband : " It 's best that I call because this is a woman 's wallet .
Maybe the woman would n't feel comfortable calling a man to get her wallet back . "
But before you start feeling too warm and fuzzy , sociologist Robert Brym warns about drawing sweeping conclusions , although he did say 17 out of 20 is " impressive . "
" Twenty cases is an awfully small sample , " Brym says .
" The results are almost certainly going to be idiosyncratic .
On the whole , though , my guess is that in harder economic times , people would be more inclined to take the money . "

Fact is , these results are not recessionary results – numerous studies link times of economic crises with a rise in crime .
A StatsCan study using crime data from 1962 to 2003 , for example , found that years with higher rates of inflation tended to have higher rates of financially motivated crimes .
Of the 15 wallets returned , one dropped in the public reception area of The Globe and Mail was missing the cash .
A Globe spokesperson said last night the person who picked up the wallet found no money in it " and we have it on video surveillance . "
Another lost wallet sparked a fraud probe by the criminal investigation branch of the Durham Regional Police .
Dropped by the Star outside a Shopper 's Drug Mart in Whitby , the wallet was found hours later , the cash surprisingly intact , a few blocks away in the parking lot of a TD Canada Trust .
( We had help from TD Bank Financial , whose donation of inactive debit cards made the wallets truly authentic ) .
" They tried to use the ( debit ) card , " Const .
Roxanne
Yelle says of the unidentified person who found it .
A Whitby man picked up the wallet , discarded in the parking lot and reported it to police .
" It 's quite a good thing you 've done ... just to see who the Good Samaritans are out there . "
The five wallets still missing include one dropped at a sidewalk fruit stand on Yonge St. , just north of Eglinton ; one left at eye level on the book stacks at Osgoode Hall Library and one left on a table at a Tim Hortons in Vaughan .
If you 've found one , it 's not too late to call .
Father Paul McGill of St. Basil 's will forgive you .
We dropped a wallet by the prayer candles in his church .
A parishioner found it after morning mass , took it to the parish office , and the church receptionist called us .
Our experiment reminded Father McGill of co-ordinating a food drive with high school students in Windsor .
" They were all gung - ho to go to this very wealthy neighbourhood .
And they were shocked by how little they collected .
...
It was a real learning lesson for them , " he said .
" People who have experienced deprivation tend to be more generous than the very wealthy . "
Similar wallet experiments conducted by Reader 's Digest and the Chicago Sun-Times did note that people in affluent areas were less likely to return found property than those in lower - to - middle class areas .
Our pattern of discovery showed that downtowners were quicker than suburbanites , and that more wallets were returned by men than women .
Discuss .
What we can say is in Toronto – now , in the worst recession since the Depression – honesty is not about the rich , or the poor .
It 's everywhere , and it 's overwhelming .
" I think , " says Father McGill , " most people in their conscience know what the right thing is . "
For the Good Samaritans who have come forward , the cash returned has been donated to a charity of their choice .
A tax receipt will be issued in their name .
Not being able to remove the body of Senior Constable Len Snee from the scene was painful to all the police involved , he said .
" It hurts all of us .
Len should be with his family .
We wish more than anything we could have got him out overnight . "
Numerous attempts to do so had been met with " dozens " of gunfire blasts , he said .
The civilian who was wounded in yesterday 's shooting had arrived at the gunman 's house while the search warrant was being executed yesterday morning , Mr Hoyle said .
" He 's attempted to disarm the offender and for his trouble got shot . "
He had acted quite heroically , Mr Hoyle said .
Police had been able to speak with Constable Diver in hospital overnight and information he gave police had shed " quite a bit " of light on the situation , he said .
Police had been striving to interview as many of gunman 's associates as possible , and speak to his family , to determine how many weapons he had , he said .
" We know he has a number of weapons , he 's fired on us with a number of different calibres . "
He did not hold a firearms licence , Mr Hoyle said .
When asked what his message to the gunman would be , Mr Hoyle said : " Give himself up " .
" Answer his phone and give himself up . "
The gunman had only been answering phone - calls sporadically from police overnight , he said .
Mr Hoyle said he wished for the gunman to surrender to police and go through the normal criminal process .
" We want a peaceful resolution with no - one getting hurt . "
Peter Molenaar , one of Jan 's five brothers , said Jan sold a few small deals of marijuana to his mates , but was no big - time drug dealer and he had no gang connections .
He said his message to his brother would be to " try and give yourself up " .
" ... but it 's hard to say at the moment what 's going through someone 's head . "
" I did n't find out until late in the morning what happened ... I just went into shock . "
He told Radio New Zealand the matter had gone " way out " of his hands and it was " maybe not likely " that his brother would survive .
Peter Molenaar said his brother came home from walking his dog yesterday morning and found police in his house gathering evidence of alleged cannabis growing .
" Obviously , he was all pumped up from his walk and his adrenaline was going , and that was it . "
His brother reached for his gun and told the officers to get out .
Peter Molenaar did not know why his brother had chosen to start shooting .
There was further gunfire from the house overnight .
Several shots were fired at 2.07 am , then a long series of shots - more than a dozen - at 2.53 am .
Jan Molenaar 's partner , who left the house safely yesterday , said he had just overreacted to the situation and " flipped " .
Peter Molenaar said his brother had told him he knew police had been watching the house over the past couple of weeks .
He said Jan was an " occasional " drug user , but had " definitely not " used methamphetamine .
Peter Molenaar said he wanted to say to the families of the police officers involved that he was " very sorry " for what had happened .
He said his family are very upset and have not been able to talk to their brother since the siege began .
THREE OFFICERS SHOT
Senior Constable Len Snee , 53 , of Taradale police , was killed about 9.30 am yesterday while conducting an apparent low - risk cannabis operation at the Napier Hill property .
This morning , his body was still lying next to his police car outside the Chaucer Rd house , on Napier Hill .
Senior Constable Bruce Miller , 40 , a community constable in the suburb of Ahuriri , dog handler Senior Constable Grant Diver , 50 , and a neighbour were wounded by gunshots .
All were in a critical condition in Hawke 's Bay Hospital 's intensive care unit .
It was reported that Mr Miller was shot in the stomach , and was in an induced coma .
Members of the public had tried to help Mr Miller .
Mr Diver was able to crawl to a neighbour 's house to raise the alarm .
Police Commissioner Howard Broad and Napier Mayor Barbara Arnott visited the scene this morning .
Police spokeswoman Kaye Calder said police asked the defence force for " assistance with resources " .
The army had responded by sending two light armoured vehicles .
Three schools were closed today as a precautionary measure .
Parents and caregivers of Napier Central School , Napier Intermediate and Nelson Park School were being asked to make alternative arrangements for their children .
Road blocks were in place at several major intersections and commuters were being asked to take alternative routes .
About 30 armed offenders squad ( AOS ) members and other specialist police staff from across the North Island were continuing to surround the house , Ms Calder said .
Members of the Special Tactics Group - the police counter - terrorist and tactical wing - have joined AOS officers in the cordon around the house .
A journalist at the scene reported three armoured vehicles had arrived in the area around the house , where former army reservist Mr Molenaar was holed up with a rifle and possibly explosives .
Mr Molenaar , a 51 - year - old former territorial army member , has been firing a high - powered rifle sporadically at police officers surrounding the house .
Eastern District Commander Superintendent Sam
Hoyle said last night the gunman could stay holed up in his house for hours .
VICTIMS IN CRITICAL CONDITION
The two police officers and a member of the public who were injured in the Napier shooting are listed as critical , Police Minister Judith Collins said today .
Ms Collins , who was about to head for Napier , said she had been briefed on the situation .
" The gunman has been continuing to fire shots , as it has been described to me on the hour , every hour , " she said on Radio New Zealand .
Asked about the wounded officers and the civilian , reported to live near the scene of the shooting , Ms Collins said : " I 've been told this morning they 've been listed as critical . "
The wounded officers have been named as Senior Constable Bruce miller , 40 , a community constable , and dog handler Senior Constable Grant Diver , 50 .
The civilian has not been named .
Ms Collins said the evacuation was still going on as police removed neighbours or anyone who was in line of sight of the siege house .
" Obviously it 's a very big task , it 's a huge imposition on the people of Napier but the police say it has to be done , " she said .
" They have asked for certain resources , I can't go into that .
They 're planning for contingencies , it 's a very volatile situation . "
HEAVILY ARMED Friends of Molenaar , say he is a former territorial soldier and likely to be heavily armed .
One person described him as a " one-man army " , and a friend told how he bade farewell to his partner as if he " had already accepted his fate " .
" This situation is a complete nightmare , perhaps it was a nightmare waiting to happen , " said Molenaar 's friend and business partner Arthur Hyde .
" The guy is a total Rambo , OK ?
I 've never met another person that 's fitter than him .
He 's a very good marksman , he 's just the wrong person .
Wrong person , wrong place , wrong time , the police should have f...ing known .
That 's their business . "
Molenaar 's friends said they doubted he would give himself up and police should not enter the house .
Molenaar was a part - time territorial force soldier , attached to the armoured corps , from 1982 - 88 , and friends believe he is heavily armed , and they suspect he may have " wired the place " too .
" There 's enough there to take that house off the face of the planet , " friend Tony Moore said .
Mr Moore said Molenaar said goodbye to his partner , who left the property a short time after the seige began , as if he intended to die .
" He said ' Goodbye Hon ' , had a good blubber about it , and then : ' best you go ' .
So he 's already accepted his fate . "
Mr Moore said he asked police to let him speak to Molenaar to talk him around but they rejected the offer .
Another friend Allan Roser described Molenaar as a " one man army " .
" He 's like a special forces type of character .
It would n't surprise me if he had a bunker under there . "
Mr Hyde sent Molenaar a text message yesterday morning telling him to give himself up but did not get a response .
The gunman 's mother , Anna , said she wanted to apologise to the dead officer 's family and those who were injured in hospital .
She was struggling to understand what had happened .
" I do n't know why they grow up and become vicious , " she told TV One 's Close Up .
Loading " What are they trying to protect ... a silly marijuana plant ?
What a thing to protect , take someone 's life .
Now someone has been shot and two others I can't quite believe it really . "
She wanted to ask her son why he had not thought of the good things in his life , including his " wonderful son ... he 's going going to have to put up with this for the rest of his life . "

People with mental health problems in Ghana are turning to privately - run ' prayer camps ' , hoping religion will be a cure for their problems .
With only four practising psychiatrists in the country and a stigma attached to mental illness , doctors say the only way to cope with the workload is to work with the Church - run camps .

Emmanuel Saez , 36 , a public economics expert teaching at the University of California at Berkeley , was awarded the 2009 John Bates Clark Medal last week .
Nobody has done more to describe the broad changes in income distribution in the United States that have taken place during the last ninety years .
His most striking finding has been to confirm the widespread intuition that income inequality has been increasing – that one of the key regularities of post - World War II economics had fallen apart .
It was in 1955 that Simon Kuznets , then of the Johns Hopkins University , observed that inequality in developing countries tended to describe an “ inverted - U , ” rising substantially for a time as workers moved from farms into industrial cites , then steadily diminishing as output grew and gains from increased productivity were more evenly distributed .
Saez demonstrated that the “ U ” had decisively turned right - side up – that inequality has been rising steadily for thirty years instead of falling .
Working backwards from tax data to infer household income back to 1913 , when the income tax was established ( modern government income surveys came into being only in 1960 ) , he found that families making up the top ten percentile of the income distribution had been steadily increasing their share of all income since the 1970s .
This best off decile of earners had one heyday in the “ Roaring 1920s , ” when their share reached nearly 45 percent of national income .
There they remained until about 1940 , when norms associated with the conduct of World War II apparently knocked them down to around 33 percent of the total .
Their share remained remarkably stable for the next three decades , at around a third of national income , until the mid-1970s .
Then the top decile ’s share began to climb again , hitting 49.7 of national income in 2006 , higher than any year since 1917 and surpassing its level in 1928 , Saez found .
It took $ 104,700 in market income for a family to make the top 10 percent in 2006 .
Moreover , most of that improvement owed to record gains for families in the top one percent of income ( earning more than $ 382,600 ) .
It was the very rich whose fortunes seemed to have been at the center of the story of income distribution , Saez wrote in Striking It Richer in the Stanford Center for the Study of Poverty and Inequality ’s Pathways Magazine – from nearly a quarter of the whole in the late 1920s , to less than 10 percent in the 1960s and 1970s , before climbing back to nearly a quarter by 2006 .
( Matt Yglesias has a picture of this . )
Saez , a French citizen , was born in 1972 , meaning that he is only slightly older than “ the tax revolt , ” a phenomenon which , in the United States , as in much of Europe , can be said to have begun in the mid-1970s .
He is emblematic of a new generation that takes public finance seriously , devising more explicit and efficient tax codes , and measuring behavioral responses to tax changes about which political activists and their think - tank acolytes previously have only argued .
( Do people work less or leave town when their taxes go up ? ) .
Much of his work has been done in collaboration with his countryman Thomas Piketty , of the Paris School of Economics ; the two are co-directors of Public Policy program of the Centre for Economic Policy Research , the European counterpart of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US .
The American Economic Association citation accompanying the award stated , “ Unlike many others who work in this area , Saez straddles the great divide between theory and empirics and brings the two noticeably closer together .
His work usefully illuminates questions concerning issues such as the appropriate marginal tax rate for high income taxpayers , the structure of income transfer programs , the treatment of capital income , and the taxation of married couples . ”
For all the emotional impact of the tax debate , however , there are clearly additional reasons for the increase in inequality of the past thirty years .
They include technological advances , increasing globalization , changing theories of compensation and altered public expectations of economic growth .
It will be a long while before any of it is pinned down .
But Emmanuel Saez and others of his ilk have dramatically raised the level of the debate from the days when the price of entry was no higher than a curve sketched quickly on a cocktail napkin and insistently reproduced in newsprint .

The annual meeting of the Royal Economic Society is an ad
vantageous window through which to view recent developments in mainstream economics .
The preponderance of these developments unfold in North America , so the program committee flies a handful of lecturers across the Atlantic ( or the Channel ) every year to showcase the latest styles .
Last week at the University of Surrey , in Guildford , they included David Laibson , of Harvard University ; Pinelopi Goldberg , of Princeton ; Gilles Saint Paul , of the University of Toulouse and Birkbeck College ; Chang - Tai Hsieh , of the Graduate School of Business of the University of Chicago ; Mark Rosensweig , of Yale ; and Esther Duflo and Michael Greenstone , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
John Vickers , Warden of All Souls College , Oxford , gave the presidential address , on differing jurisprudential approaches in Brussels and Washington to competition policy and property rights – to intellectual property rights in particular .
The organizers also select fifty or so paper to showcase , from among the more than 100 that are contributed , mostly by up - and - comers in European and British universities .
And all the while they maintain a running commentary among themselves about how best to use the United Kingdom ’s advantages to compete for graduate students in a global market .
So it was good news that an International Benchmarking Review last autumn deemed the nation ’s economics research faculties to be in robust good health , “ more prominent ” than those of any other country except the United States .
In a nation where so much education is centrally funded , such studies ( and the recent Research Assessment Exercise ) are important .
Chaired by Harvard ’s Elhanan Helpman , an outside panel of experts concluded that UK faculties ought to beef up their capabilities in macroeconomics ( who should n’t ? ) but that otherwise things were in relatively good shape – development studies and microeconomic topics in particular .
In general , the UK was gaining slightly on the US in economic research , the committee found , at least bibliometrically , gauged by the influence of its publications , while Australia , the Netherlands , France and Germany were gaining slightly at the expense of the UK .
Not so in Israel .
Another committee , this one appointed by the quasi - governmental Israeli Council on Higher Education , again led by Helpman , including David Kreps , of Stanford ; Joel Mokyr , of Northwestern ; Ariel Pakes , of Harvard ; and Robert Pindyck , of MIT .
The report ’s conclusion :
“ The state of the discipline of economics in Israeli institutions of higher education is dire .
There are , without question , some bright spots in the picture .
But the picture is dismal overall . ”
Hebrew and Tel Aviv universities were among the twenty best departments in the world fifteen years ago .
“ But today , Tel Aviv ’s department is collapsing , and Hebrew University ’s is teetering on the brink . ”
Not that Israel ’s universities are n’t turning out plenty of economics majors ; there are more than ever before .
But while they know plenty of theory , they often fail to understand its connection to the world around them .
And while the best of them have long gone to the United States for their graduate education , fewer than ever are returning to teach in Israel .
Instead they remain in the US to teach .
Among assistant professors in the top ten American departments , 16 percent ( 18 professors ) received their first degree in Israel , a contingent second only to the 28 percent whose undergraduate degree was earned in the United States .
What ’s the solution ?
A recognition , the committee urged , that Israeli economics must embrace the hiring and promotion practices of departments in Western Europe and the United States , and that more money is needed at every level .

The American newspaper industry has fallen on hard times , and its authority has dimmed , at least for the moment .
But the conservators of its traditions quietly took an admirable stand last week .
The Pulitzer Prize Board passe
d over The New York Times columnist ( and Princeton professor ) Paul Krugman and gave its 2009 commentary award to Eugene Robinson instead , citing The Washington Post veteran for columns on the election of the first African - American president that exhibited “ graceful writing and grasp of the larger historic picture . ”
Krugman and Regina Brett , of the Cleveland Plain Dealer , were runners - up .
Krugman is an economist of considerable distinction .
He deserves the Nobel Prize for his work elucidating the mechanisms of international high - tech trade ( though the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences would have done better to wait another year and to honor his co-author Elhanan Helpman as well ) .
But there is something about Krugman ’s newspaper journalism that chafes .
True , he gets half - a- dozen scoops a year .
He has become a columnist of enormous influence .
He is an energetic blogger , too .
Yet he often cloaks his claims in professional authority , overstates them , omits arguments that undermine his case , and is a bit of a bully .
We Are Iron Man
WARNING : This is a rant as well as an announcement .
If you do n't want to read the part where I complain , curse and insult people , click this link to go to the Enlightened Perl announcement .
Edit : Updates , as promised , are here
Over the past couple of years it 's come to my notice more and more - perl is next to invisible in the blogosphere , except for the occasional " OH NOEZ PERL IS EVIL " or " NETCRAFT CONFIRMS PERL IS DYING " post or whatever .
And , well , to be honest , I do n't really blame the slashdots and reddits and diggs of this world because our collective blog output is basically only a whisper shy of fuck all .
So , being a person of an enquiring mind , I started talking to people - at perl mongers meetings , at conferences , on IRC , even occasionally on mailing lists .
Now , if you re-read that past paragraph , you should spot something .
Like , say , the complete fucking absence of me talking about blogging to try and find this shit out .
The complete absence of me even thinking about blogging as a communications channel .
Or , really , anything web based .
So , let me make an admission here .
I fucking HATE web forums
Maybe it was the appalling signal to noise ratio on them back in 2000 when people still actually used usenet .
Maybe it was the fact that I 'm a console bunny and like irssi and mutt as my primary communications tools .
Maybe it was the time I made the mistake of trying to read part of the PHPBB2 source code .
Maybe it was a combination of those factors , or something entirely different .
Maybe I 'm just an antisocial bastard .
Fuck knows .
Anyway ...
But here 's my point :
Perl people hang out on mailing lists .
We bottom post , carefully interleaved , with 76 character lines .
We have signatures that meet the McQ standard for acceptable size .
We hang out on IRC servers and bitch , moan , interact and collaborate with the aid of an 80x25 xterm with irssi , BitchX or IrcII in it .
Sometimes we sit at home with a beer and do one or more of the above .
Forums ?
Meh .
Those are the things the PHPtards like because they can't figure out how to work a mailing list , right ?
Blogs ?
That 's not even a fucking word !
I mean , in my day , we posted to usenet using Larry Wall 's rn that did n't even have decent fucking threading , and we schlepped the posts about from one bnews spool to another over 1200 baud dialup links , and we liked it ! .
On top of this , the perl community has always had a major bias against strongly worded advocacy , or heaven forbid , marketing .
It 's amazing the reaction you get from most perl people when you say the ' m ' word .
I mean , at the Nordic Perl Workshop last week I spoke to the organiser about making sure the videos taken by assorted wonderful and selfless volunteers got up in time to be fresh enough for people to care , and got up as many places as possible so they'd be seen as widely as possible .
" It 'll be good marketing for the state of the art in modern perl " , I said .
He twitched , and took a small step backwards away from me , for I was tainted by having spoken the word and he did n't accidentally want to catch whatever I had .
" Oh no , I 'm not trying to do marketing at all " , he said , " I 'm just trying to raise awareness of this stuff " .
Hello ?
FUCKING HELLO ?!
That .
Is .
What .
Marketing .
Is .
Well , it 's part of it , anyway .
I mean , there 's all the coherent message stuff and the brand positioning stuff and all the things that people who 're actually good at marketing think about to good effect .
But the quality and coherency and virality and whatever of the message really makes fuck all difference if you 're NOT ACTUALLY GETTING THAT MESSAGE OUT TO ANYBODY ANYWAY .
And yet , when I try to point this out to people , when I try to explain that marketing is a good thing and they should participate , they react like what I actually said was " buggery is a good thing and you should participate - so lube up and bend over and I 'll give you a demonstration " .
And I sort of find that quite severely fucking ironic , because as a community if we do n't get off our collective asses and start showing the world what our language and our libraries and our culture is capable of , then we 're sure as hell buggered then .
The rest of the world still thinks that we write a thing called PERL , whose purpose is as a super - awk or to write CGI scripts , they think that this language is designed to be write only line noise that 's only slightly more legible than brainfuck , and we 're sort of sat here going " meh , well , they 're wrong " and NOT ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT
Which is what Iron Man is really about , at the heart of it :
This is our language .
It lives and dies by our actions .
We , the current generation of the perl community , are responsible for getting the word out beyond our narrow horizons , beyond the echo chamber of our mailing lists and our conferences and perlmonks and use .
perl.org , and making people realise that this is a live language , this is a language you can do for large scale development - for fuck 's sake it runs the BBC iPlayer website , an Alexa top 50 site - and perhaps more importantly , we need to make sure we recruit the next generation of perl programmers because if we do n't then there is n't going to be one to inherit this amazing culture and toolkit and the giant fucking collection of reusable components we call the CPAN and for christ 's sake people this is IMPORTANT so WHY AREN'T WE FUCKING DOING SOMETHING
... and breathe ...
So , having thrown a chair or three so far in this post , it 's time to actually propose something constructive - and thanks to the help of the other people in the Enlightened Perl Organisation , and all the other poor bastards I 've talked ideas over with during the gestation of this concept , I not only have something constructive to propose , I have a plan .
A plan so cunning you could brush your teeth with it .
Let 's blog .
Blogging is good .
Blogging is easy .
Blogging is visible .
Blogging is indexable .
Blogging is submittable .
I dig ( g ) blogging .
But of course those are empty words - without some extra motivation it 's damn hard to keep to a regular posting schedule .
I mean , I 've failed at blogging .
Twice .
Post , post , post , post , fuck I 'm busy this week miss a post oh shit I forgot about it this week miss the next post aaaaand you 're fucked .
And then you 're not even trying anymore .
And really , not trying is also failing , it 's just a quieter sort of fail .
So , here 's what we 're going to do about it .
Enlightened Perl : Blogging Iron Man
Blog once per week .
Every week .
Every single week .
Ten lines is fine .
It 's going to take all we failures some effort to get into this , so there 's no going to be restriction on post length .
There 's going to be no barrier for how badly written it is .
None of us are good enough , and that is n't a problem .
What matters is we try .
What matters is that we make some fucking noise .
Show off cool new toys you 've found , or cool new toys you 're writing , or even trying to write .
Show off neat tricks you came up with .
Talk about your failures , too , because then maybe the next guy who makes the same stupid mistake will find it on google and think " I 'm so glad that guy did n't mind sharing his idiocy because he 's saved me wasting half a day because I 'm an idiot too . "
Tell the world that perl5 is alive .
If you 're a perl6 true believer tell the world how it 's soon going to be christmas .
Talk about the stuff that you love , the stuff that you hate , the stuff that excites you , the stuff that drives you insane .
But MAKE SOME FUCKING NOISE because if enough of us do , the law of averages says there 's going to be some of it that 's well worth reading .
So , to the nitty gritty :
There will be badges .
Mark 's series of posts on Paper Man , Stone Man and Iron Man might give you a clue as to what they 're going to look like .
Right now , the infrastructure is n't there yet - we 're shipping early to get the word out , so if you want to be involved , mail ironman < at > shadowcat.co.uk with your blog URL , RSS feed URL and the nickname you want to be known by - once I have some actual system to put this stuff into I 'll grandfather you in .
The actual numbers are going to be : 4 ( four ) posts every 32 ( thirty two ) days , on a rolling basis , with no more than 10 ( ten ) days between posts .
This is an intentionally loose definition of " once a week " so that people do n't get spannered by travel schedules or work crises or having a wife and kids or whatever .
Everybody starts off as Paper Man .
Manage four posts , week on week , and you get to be Stone Man .
Get further and you get to be Bronze Man .
Six months of straight posting qualifies you as Iron Man .
And do n't worry if you fail - there 's no losing this competition , you just go back to Paper Man ( and there 'll be a consolation prize while you work your way back up ) .
There will be a post of the month competition .
I 've been talking people who are not me , who can actually write well , to the point where some of them actually get paid for it , and they 're going to look over the posts and pick one out to be honoured each month .
The winner will get a limited edition T - shirt and maybe some other schwag if we can find companies mad enough to join in and donate some .
Better still , the post of the month committee members are all going to be available to critique your posts , if you want them to .
These people all know how hard it is to write well and they 're all willing to try and help you write better if you 're interested .
There will be a planet .
Of course , once again I suck so it is n't running yet , but that 'll be there within the next week .
I 'll be updating both this post and the enlightenedperl.org website to reflect this stuff as it appears , and tacking the information on to future posts of mine as well .
And .
AND
There 's an extra incentive .
Of course I 'm going to be taking part .
Of course , I 'm not eligible to win anything because I 'm an organiser - but given the quality of my writing that 's not really any loss :)
But if I fail , and you guys succeed - if people get to the six month mark and achieve Iron Man status and any time after that I miss a single post , then there 's going to be a forfeit .
Those posters who have achieved Iron Man status will get to , between them , select a talk title , and a colour .
And I will submit a talk of that title to YAPC ::EU and YAPC :: NA the next time there 's a CFP , and I will give that talk with my hair dyed the colour that 's been chosen .
If I can't find hair dye of that colour that 's semi-permanent , I get the option to spend the entire conference wearing clothes of that colour instead .
So , if you do n't care about any of the rest of it and just think I 'm an uppity annoying profane obnoxious bastard , maybe getting the chance to help me make a fool out of myself will motivate you instead !
In summary
GET FUCKING BLOGGING
Mail ironman@shadowcat.co.uk with your blog details ( I 'll replace this text when I have something webby written so you do n't have to risk talking to me to sign up )
Start posting now .
This post counts as backdated to saturday for me , because that 's when I was supposed to put it up but I got distracted by the NPW hackathon - so I 've got until tuesday to get another post up or I 've already failed once and you can all point and laugh .
And two last thoughts :
One : alone , we are tiny voices crying in the wilderness .
Together we can be Iron Man .
Two :
JFDI
mst , signing off .
Thanks for reading .
