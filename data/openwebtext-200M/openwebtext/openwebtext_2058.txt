I saw that I was stabbed twice in my head and blood was coming from my head
Dilek Guvec
Francis Sheridan , prosecuting said the attack on the mother - of - two only ended when the blade broke off the knife and he ran off .
Mrs Guvec , 29 at the time , was " badly cut " but survived the attack .
The court heard that her marriage of 11 years had broken down and the couple 's children were living with her .
Mrs Guvec broke down in tears as she gave evidence from behind a screen about the alleged attack , via a Turkish interpreter .
" He was saying ' listen to me ' .
My daughter ran off to the school , to her class .
He was next to me .
He said ' I 'm going to kill you . '
" Then he started punching me .
I had n't seen the knife .
I saw that I was stabbed twice in my head and blood was coming from my head . "
Haydar Guvec of Enfield , told police he accidentally cut his wife with a knife he had taken to the school as he was hoping to see his four - year - old son and peel an apple for him .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - A rocket fired from the Gaza Strip hit southern Israel on Tuesday just hours after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert visited the area and cautioned residents not to expect a lull in Palestinian attacks to last .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attends Friday prayers at his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah March 7 , 2008 .
Hamas denied on Tuesday comments by Abbas , that its pursuit of an Egyptian - mediated truce with Israel was motivated by a desire to protect its leaders from Israeli assassination .

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the rocket strike , the first against Israel since Sunday , saying its “ battle against occupation is continuing ” .
Such attacks have tailed off sharply since Israel ended a Gaza offensive eight days ago and Egypt stepped up truce mediation efforts .
Israel has not raided the Gaza Strip since the five - day assault that killed some 120 Palestinians .
A police spokesman said the rocket fell in open ground south of the major Israeli city of Ashkelon , causing no injuries .
A few hours earlier , Olmert visited Ashkelon , hit by longer - range rockets during a recent surge of violence , and told residents there were no guarantees Katyusha salvoes from the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip would not resume .
“ Do n’t think it was a one - time experience , ” Olmert said about Katyusha attacks that put Ashkelon within range of rocket - launching squads in the Gaza Strip , seven km ( four miles ) away .
Olmert said Hamas has “ created a reality in which there is no way to protect Israeli civilians except to hit back at those who hit us , and sometimes to hit back disproportionately so their pain will be enough to deter them from continuing to fire . ”
Israeli officials gave no indication whether the military would respond to the latest rocket strike .
A spokesman for Olmert said Hamas , in charge of the Gaza Strip bore overall responsibility for attacks from the territory .
“ We have no illusions as to the extreme , violent and hateful agenda of Hamas , ” spokesman Mark Regev said .
“ We will hold them accountable . ”
Hamas Islamists , who seized control of the Gaza Strip from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ’s Fatah faction in fighting last June , have been holding their fire against Israel for the past seven days .
PEACE EFFORTS
A Gaza truce could be key to U.S. - brokered peace efforts between Israel and Abbas .
Amid much skepticism , Washington hopes the negotiations can lead to a Palestinian statehood deal by the end of the year .
A ceasefire could also prove attractive for Hamas if it included an easing of an Israeli - led Gaza blockade that is part of a campaign to weaken the group .
Hamas has spurned Western demands to recognize Israel , renounce violence and accept existing interim Israeli - Palestinian peace deals .
Abbas said in Amman on Monday that Hamas and Islamic Jihad , the main groups in the Gaza Strip behind cross - border rocket fire at Israel , wanted assurances that in return for agreeing to a truce , their leaders would not be attacked .
Olmert has threatened to target all those behind the rocket strikes , raising speculation that Hamas ’s political leadership could be on the firing line .
Hamas denied its pursuit of an Egyptian - mediated ceasefire was motivated by a desire to protect its leaders from Israeli assassination .
“ Hamas leaders seek martyrdom and would never bargain over the blood of their people like others do , ” Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in a statement .
Israel assassinated top Hamas leaders Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al - Rantissi in the Gaza Strip in 2004 .
I wonder who the first teacher was who said to his class , " Okay , we have ball point pens now .
No need to use class time to learn how to use a fountain pen . "
I heard from two people this week ( one is 11 , the other twice that ) who were forbidden to use Wikipedia to do homework .
When I was in b-school , I admit that I discovered a shortcut .
I had to write a long paper on Castro .
I went to the magnificent Stanford library , found a great book on Castro , opened to the bibliography and found ten sources .
Which I then laboriously paged through , spending hours and hours in order to find the facts I needed .
Then , facts in hand , I was able to do the actually useful part …
I synthesized some new ideas and wrote a paper .
Apparently , going through the act of finding the books , sorting through them , reading a lot of chaff and eventually finding the facts is an essential skill for an 11 - year - old kid .
And for a college sophomore .
Essential enough to be responsible for 80 % of the time they spend on the work itself ?
Selecting the facts is an important part of the process .
Finding them should n’t be .
I do n’t know about you , but when I hire someone , or go to the doctor or the architect or an engineer , I could care less about how good they are at memorizing or looking up facts .
I want them to be great at synthesizing ideas , the faster and more insightfully , the better .
Until just recently , law students had to learn a painstaking process to look up cases by hand .
No longer .
The academy realized that teaching students to be great at Lexis was a smart idea .
Please do n’t tell me that Wikipedia is n’t a real encyclopedia or one that ca n’t be trusted .
Perhaps it ca n’t be trusted if you ’re prepping for a Presidential debate , but it is sure good enough to help me learn what I need to learn–which is how to quickly take a bunch of facts and turn them into a new and useful idea .
Here ’s what just about every exam ought to be : " Use Firefox to find the information you need to answer this question : " And as the internet gets smarter , the questions are going to have to get harder .
Which is a good thing .
Until teachers get unstuck , our kids are going to be stuck and so will we .
* As it happens , I think I 've almost transformed into faculty at this point .
I walked into my office last Friday , returning from a quick out - and - back to get a cup of coffee , and realized to my dismay that I was the only person still there .
At 2:00 in the afternoon .
My immediate thought was , " Shit !
Why the hell is n't anyone working ? ! "
** Labeled as such so that , if I want to add to the list later , I can call it " Part the Second " and make it all look intentional .
Cool , eh ?
It 's fall again and I 've begun to notice something around my department : people I do n't know .
They have these expressions that speak of a curious mixture of fear , uncertainty , and excitement .
They 're constantly out - of - breath and frequently avoid looking me in the eye .
Who are these mysterious people ?
Fugitives ?
Sex offenders ?
Scientologists ?
No , they 're something far more mysterious : first year graduate students .
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , it 's that time of year - the time when the wee little firsties begin their magical journey into post - graduate education .
I do n't have a lot of contact with first years anymore , to be frank , largely because I 've been here for a really long time .
As such I 'm one of those scary older grad students who stalks around the department always looking busy . *
That said , the appearance of first years reminds me of myself when I was at that point .
Particularly , it reminds me of all the stupid shit that I thought I knew then about graduate school .
It occurs to me that perhaps I should pass on some of my admittedly poor insights about grad school to future generations .
And so , contained here is a random assortment of things I wished I 'd realized when I started grad school .
I make no guarantees as to the quality of these thoughts - if you want quality you should read Fabio 's series of posts " Grad Skool Rulz " rather than this crap .
Only take my advice if you want to turn out more or less like me
It is important to realize as soon as possible that you are not an undergraduate any longer .
In fact , you 're not really even a student .
Grad school is more like an apprenticeship program than traditional schooling .
As such , you 're here to learn by doing .
Stop thinking about what you do as " school " and start thinking of it as " work " and particularly as " your career . "
You 're no longer practicing for your future - you 're doing it right now .
Along these lines , keep in mind that nobody is impressed with your ability to get by while doing as little as possible .
If you did n't want to do the work , you should n't have come to grad school .
The idea here is to work hard and accomplish a lot , not just to pass classes .
Grad school has a short game and a long game .
The short game is about a year long - passing classes , taking comprehensive exams , finishing a master 's thesis , and so on .
The long game is about four to five years long and involves positioning yourself for success .
The short game is important - you have to pass your classes to keep playing - but the long game is your real path to success .
Do n't get so wrapped up in the short game that you forget to pick your head up now and then .
Ultimately , as long as you pass , hardly anyone cares about your classes .
Do n't obsess over them .
That said , keep in mind that your classes are taught by faculty who you are going to need to sit on your committees and write your recommendation letters .
Do n't be rude , do n't be obnoxious , and do n't be a goof off .
Remember that faculty members are people too .
They have lives beyond the department , spouses and children and hobbies and a need for leisure time .
When they give you their time , be grateful .
When you ask for time , make sure you do n't waste it .
Also keep in mind that faculty have personalities the same way grad students do .
Some of theirs wo n't mesh with yours , no matter what you do .
This can be an exercise in professionalism but , more often , is a signal that you need to work with someone else .
Like it or not , some advisors suck .
Some are really hands - on and will help you a lot , but may be very controlling .
Some are totally hands - off and will leave you flailing , but give you freedom to follow your own path .
Be prepared to figure out what you need and find a way to get it .
If you can't work with your current advisor , switch to a new one .
You 'll make your advisor and yourself happier .
Additionally , remember that the person with the greatest stake in your success is you .
Do n't expect your advisor to run after you with a whip to get you to do your job .
Get to know your faculty .
These people will have a lot of control over your life and can help , or hurt , you substantially .
Additionally , a lot of them are genuinely fun .
If all goes well , you 're going to be a colleague of folks like these before too long , so start getting ready .
Remember that your faculty 's needs do not always match up with your own .
Senior faculty have been busting their asses for twenty years or more to get where they are .
They will not be impressed by grad students who miss deadlines .
Junior faculty are in the process of busting their asses and do n't have time for dead weight .
When working for or with faculty make sure that you 're meeting their needs if you are going to expect them to help you meet yours .
Most faculty are pretty good people .
They 're smart , energetic , and often fun .
At the same time , a relatively small number are exploiters and will suck you dry if you let them .
Figure out who these faculty members are and stay away from them to whatever extent possible .
Get to know older grad students in your department .
They 've been around the block and can point out potholes that you'd be wise to avoid .
They can also be a source of information about which faculty are good to work with .
At the same time , keep in mind that grad students have interests of their own .
They may not want to share their advisor 's attention with someone else .
Likewise , take all advice with a grain of salt .
Beyond a certain point it 's worthwhile to ask why an old grad student has n't become young faculty yet .
Get to know your own cohort .
You 're going to spend a lot of time with these folks and they 're good study partners and potential collaborators .
Social isolation is a near death sentence , so avoid it .
Some departments foster a lot of competition between grad students , some do n't .
My view is that you 're usually better off being helpful and decent to others than not .
It 's always good to be owed favors and , frankly , a lot of academia runs on goodwill .
Do n't be a sucker , but do n't be an asshole either .
Some grad students realize in the first few years that they 've made a horrible mistake in coming to grad school .
This is normal .
Unfortunately , some of these folks will continue to plod through the program because they do n't know what else to do .
This is , generally speaking , bad .
If this is you , do n't do it - you 're just wasting time .
If this is n't you , do n't get too close to these folks as they can be a motivation suck .
Find what works for you and do it .
Grad students are different people and , while some of them might work 9 - 5 , others will prefer quasi- nocturnal schedules .
In the end , it does n't matter as long as you get things done .
You 're a really smart person .
You probably spent most of your college career near the top of your classes .
This is good but , when you get to grad school , you will be surrounded by people like yourself .
You 're all smart , you were all at the top of your classes , and you 're all small fish in a big pond .
Get over the shock of this as quickly as you can .
Being surrounded by smart people is a good thing and will ultimately help you succeed , if you let it .
Grad school is sort of like a marathon crossed with a steeplechase .
This is to say that it 's a long - ass race with intermittent barriers that you 're going to have to clear .
Sometimes yoube running with wet feet .
Do n't try to run grad school like a sprint , doing everything at once - you 'll just exhaust yourself .
Instead , work steadily throughout your years .
And do n't forget : when you become faculty the workload will only increase .
The time scale in grad school is really , really long .
The publications process can require several years to get one paper from a " final " draft to appearing in print .
Other times you may get a paper into print - start to finish - within a year .
Be prepared for these long time scales and start early .
Any paper you write for a class should be done with an eye towards turing it into a publication later .
The sooner you start on this , the better , because you will need these things for the job market .
Learn how , and when , to cut your losses .
Some papers are just craptacular and will never get better no matter how much work you put into them .
Painful though it may be , let these papers go .
Every hour you sink into them is an hour you could have been spending on a paper that actually has a chance .
It 's almost more important to work consistently than it is to work long hours .
Given the long time scales of grad school , regular consistent performance will mount up rapidly .
Do n't wait til the last minute to do things .
Remember to have fun .
For at least the next few years , grad school is your life .
You have to decompress and relax periodically or you 'll burn out .
Play sports , work out , see movies , hang out with friends ... whatever .
Just make sure you have a way to unwind .
Fun is good .
Too much fun is bad .
Remember : you 're being paid to be a grad student because the department thinks that there 's an outside chance you might turn into a respectable Ph.D. someday .
They 're going to give you time and space to develop , but this is n't a decade long pass to screw around .
Do n't spend too much time reading the blog of some asshole online .
His opinions are n't necessarily correct in your case .
We 're all different people with different styles of working .
Find what works for you , do it , and do n't feel guilty .

Warren Buffett 's big multi-billion dollar bet that stocks wo n't end up lower years from now gets some attention and analysis in this weekend 's Barron's .
In an article headlined Here 's How Buffett Spent 2007 ( paid subscription required until Monday afternoon when it becomes free content ) , writer Andrew Bary points out that " for someone who has been publicly lukewarm on the equity market , Warren Buffett has been buying a lot of stocks for Berkshire Hathaway . "
Bary notes that during 2007 , Berkshire bought just over $ 19 billion dollars of equities , twice last year 's $ 9.2 billion .
That 's an average of $ 75 million in buys for each business day .
Berkshire 's net stock purchases ( stocks bought minus stocks sold ) during the year totaled $ 11 billion .
But Berkshire is not just buying individual stocks .
Barron 's underlines the section on page 16 of Buffett 's annual Letter to Shareholders in which he describes " various put options we have sold on four stock indices ( the S&P 500 plus three foreign indices . ) "
Unsafe Abortion Remains a Major Global Health Challenge
London , UK :
The number of induced abortions worldwide declined from nearly 46 million to under 42 million between 1995 and 2003 .
Abortion rates fell most significantly in Eastern Europe , a trend that corresponds with substantially increased contraceptive use in the region , according to “ Induced Abortion : Rates and Trends Worldwide , ” a new report by the Guttmacher Institute and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) published in the 13 October 2007 issue of The Lancet .
For every 1,000 women of childbearing age ( 15 – 44 ) worldwide , 29 were estimated to have had an induced abortion in 2003 , compared with 35 in 1995 .
The decline was most substantial in Europe , where the rate fell from 48 to 28 abortions per 1,000 women , largely because of dramatic declines in Eastern Europe .
On the whole , the abortion rate decreased more in developed countries , where abortion is generally safe and legal on broad grounds ( from 39 to 26 ) , than in developing countries , where the procedure is largely illegal and unsafe ( from 34 to 29 ) .
Significantly , the abortion rate for 2003 was roughly equal in developed and developing regions — 26 and 29 , respectively — despite abortion being largely illegal in developing regions .
Health consequences , however , vary greatly between the two regions , since abortion is generally safe where it is broadly legal and mostly unsafe where restricted .
“ The overall downward trend in abortion rates is encouraging , but positive change is happening too slowly and too unevenly across different regions , ” says Dr. Sharon Camp , president and CEO of the Guttmacher Institute .
“ We know , and the new evidence confirms yet again , that the best way to make abortion less necessary is to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first place .
And we know that the crucial first step in making abortion safer is to legalize the procedure , ensuring that it is performed by skilled providers under the best possible conditions .
It ’s high time for policymakers worldwide to renew their commitment to women ’s health by addressing these crucial issues . ”
The lowest abortion rate in the world in 2003 was for Western Europe ( 12 per 1,000 women aged 15 – 44 ) , where contraceptive services and use are widespread and safe abortion is easily accessible and legal under broad grounds .
The rate was 17 for Northern Europe and 21 for the Northern America region ( Canada and the United States ) .
Africa , Asia and Latin America had the highest regional abortion rates , even though abortion is generally legally restricted and often unsafe in those regions .
Abortion rates in Africa , Asia , and Latin America and the Caribbean have declined since 1995 , but the estimated number of abortions has increased in Africa because of the increasing number of women of reproductive age and a possible underestimate of abortions in 1995 .
Because the world ’s population is concentrated in Asia , most abortions occurred there — about 26 million yearly ; China alone accounted for nine million procedures .
The study also found that an estimated 20 million unsafe abortions occurred in 2003 , 97 % of these in developing regions .
The prevalence of unsafe abortion remains high , with up to 39 unsafe abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 – 44 in Eastern Africa and 33 per 1,000 in South America .
By contrast , developed regions , where almost all countries allow abortions with few restrictions , had an average unsafe abortion rate of two per 1,000 .
The consequences of unsafe abortion — death , serious injury , infertility and increased health care cost are largely borne by poor women .
The report concludes that reducing the incidence of unsafe abortion would result in an immediate and substantial reduction of maternal mortality and improve maternal health .
" Nearly half of all induced abortions are unsafe , putting the lives and health of women at major risk .
Each year , about 70,000 women die due to unsafe abortion and an additional five million suffer permanent or temporary disability , " notes Dr. Paul F.A. Van Look , director of WHO ’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research .
“ The widespread unmet need for contraception must be addressed if we are to see further decline in abortion rates , especially in Sub -Saharan Africa , where contraceptive use is low and unsafe abortion - related mortality is the high , compared with other regions "
“ Induced Abortion : Rates and Trends Worldwide ” was authored by Gilda Sedgh , Stanley Henshaw , Susheela Singh , Elisabeth Aahman and Iqbal Shah .

The Kremlin was yesterday accused of mounting an unprecedented attack on academic freedom after one of Russia 's top universities was closed .
The European University at St Petersburg ( EUSP ) has been forced to suspend its teaching after officials claimed that its historic buildings were " a fire risk " .
On Friday a court ordered that all academic work cease , classrooms be sealed and the university 's library shut .
Academics at the EUSP said the move was politically motivated - and followed a row last year over a programme funded by the European commission to improve the monitoring of Russian elections .
The university accepted a three - year , £ 500,000 EU grant to run a project advising Russia 's political parties on matters such as how to ensure elections are not rigged .
Last October , the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , launched a vitriolic attack on the EUSP - which has close links with universities in the UK and US - accusing it of being an agent of foreign meddling .
On January 31 , the EUSP 's academic council bowed to Kremlin pressure and abandoned the monitoring project .
" It 's clear [ the closure ] was politically motivated , " Maxim Reznik , the leader of St Petersburg 's opposition party , Yabloko , said .
" We are observing a change in the political regime in Russia from authoritarianism to totalitarianism .
What happened here is one example among many . "
He added : " This has n't got anything to do with fire risk .
The university was carrying out important work in connection with election monitoring .
Now it 's being punished for it . "
Putin has frequently attacked Russia 's NGOs , human rights groups and reformist opposition - accusing them of being traitors and tools of the west .
But the Kremlin has largely ignored the higher education sector , allowing academics relative freedom and autonomy over teaching , student selection and research - until now .
Yesterday the EUSP 's rector , Nicolai Vahtin , said he hoped the university would reopen soon .
" There 's obviously been a misunderstanding .
We are hoping to solve this in a couple of days , " he said .
There were " no facts " to support or deny the suggestion the closure was political , he continued .
" We are one of the best schools in the city and in the country .
It would be a waste of talent and motivation to put us out of business . "
Asked whether the EUSP was still functioning , he said : " The administration is working .
But the courts have sealed the classrooms so there are no classes . "
The university 's EC - funded project was launched in February 2007 .
Its aim was to develop and raise the effectiveness of electoral monitoring in Russia 's regions .
Putin's United Russia party took an immediate dislike to it .
Last summer a party deputy demanded an investigation , and accused the university of trying to influence the result of the country 's parliamentary and presidential elections .
Russia has been sensitive to persistent outside criticism of its electoral process , which independent observers say falls well short of international standards .
In December , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) described Russia 's state Duma elections as " not fair " , adding there had been " unprecedented abuse " of office by Putin .
Last week the OSCE said its observers would boycott Russia 's March 2 presidential election because of Moscow 's refusal to cooperate with the monitoring process - prompting a furious Kremlin response .
Backstory
Founded in 1994 on the initiative of St Petersburg 's liberal mayor Anatoly Sobchak , the European University is one of Russia 's top universities .
A graduate school , it is known for its progressive views and western - educated staff .
It has 120 Russian and 10 - 15 western students studying for an MA in Russian studies .
Its aim is to integrate Russian scholarship with that of Europe and the US - at a time when Russian academia is becoming increasingly isolated from the west .
From a time long forgotten .
A time when big hair and ripped jeans ruled the streets .
When Michael Jackson was someone to look up to .
A time when break dancing was rampant .
This time was known as " The 80's " .
And from the 80's came some of the worst movies of all time .
I have compiled a list of the most awesomely bad movies of the 80's .
These films were some of my favorites as a child growing up .
I like to relate them to driving past a car pile - up , you do n't want to see what you are seeing but you always slow down to look .
This was going to be a Top Ten List but # 11 was to dear too my heart to let go .
so without further delay lets look at the top eleven awesomely bad movies of the 1980's .
And remember , except for # 2 I like these movies .
WARNING : SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED IN SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FILMS .
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE MASTERPIECES AND ARE INTERESTED IN VIEWING THEM DON'T READ ANY FURTHER !!!#11 THE STUFF ( 1985 ) Directed by Larry CohenA weird yummy goop erupts from the earth and is discovered by a couple of miners .
They taste it and decide to market it because it tastes so good , and makes you feel good as well .
The American public literally eats up the new dessert known as The Stuff but , unfortunately , it takes over the brains of those who eat it , turning them into zombie - like creatures .
Also another side affect is that it can kill you !
Yogurt !
Either by eating you alive from the inside - out or by simply covering you ( suffocating ) you to death .
It is up to ex-FBI agent David Rutherford and a kid named Jason ( of course ) to stop the spread of the mind - devouring dessert .
It seems to me that if a national trend is causing people to die that more than just one kid and an FBI agent would respond to this .
I guess they did n't want to make it a dull movie ( Mission not accomplished ) .
The rest of the movie consists of face meltings and some very poor acting .
I will admit that the face meltings are pretty cool .
I just have a hard time believing the FDA would allow a yogurt like substance that can control your body onto the market , at least not without testing it first .
#10 THE TOXIC AVENGER ( 1985 ) God do I love this horrible film !!!
I own three versions of this it .
That does n't save it from this list though .
It 's the first film from Troma ( King of bad movies ) on my list , and it is The Toxic Avenger .
Young janitor Melvin , a 98 lb weakling , is tricked into wearing a tutu and falls into a open barrel of toxic waste that 's in the back of a truck that was passing by ( do n't ask , just accept it ) .
The waste turned Melvin into " The Toxic Avenger " the first super Hero from New Jersey .
With his new super size and strength he brings to justice those that caused his mutation , falls in love with a blind babe , and kills the mayor of Tromaville .
The first movie that I know of to feature a death by a mop ( and boy are they numerous ) .
Dan
Snow should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of " Cigar Face " , a name that makes me laugh even today , who also plays the most insane cop I 've ever seen in Toxic Avenger 4 : Citizen Toxie .
This movie is terribly gruesome and completely lacking of good taste .
That ’s why I love it so much .
This movie is a must own for those who either : Love 80's flicks or awesomely bad movies ( or both ) .
#9 RAWHEAD REX ( 1986 ) WOW , is this a strange one .
Rawhead Rex would actually be a good movie , if the special effects of the monster were not so incredibly horrible looking .
I mean these were just awful .
There is one scene in the trailer park at night when Rawhead is killing a lot of people that his eyes are glowing red and chasing people …. to their doom !
Besides this scene the monster looks like a remote controlled mask on a weight lifters body .
With the death of the main hero ’s( David Dukes ) young son at the hands of Rawhead , the movie shows it is a no-boundaries slasher 80 ’s flick .
It seems that old Rawhead can't harm a woman for some reason but males are open game .
The ending is a joke , Some stone held by a woman shoots out cheesy special effects that kill Rawhead .
I might sound like a broken record on this one but holy crap are the special effects bad .
I am embarrassed to say that this movie scared the crap out of me when I was eight years old .
Definitely a prime example of “ The book is better than the movie ” .
( Clive Barker wrote the novel ) .
#8 976-EVIL ( 1989 ) Directed by Robert EnglundBasically put , if you call 976 - evil on your phone , ext. 666 , you gain supernatural powers that somehow cause your death .
Let me say that again , you call a 976 number and you get demonic powers !!!
More specifically a boy finds card containing a Satanic phone number , boy meets girl , boy ’s cousin finds number and uses it to kill girl and lots of other folks , boy ’s cousin then turns into a hell spawn , and boy must save the day .
No , it is n’t particularly scary or even very startling and it certainly does n't make any sense , but it is rather gross in spots .
Calling a 976 number for demonic powers , who thinks this crap up anyway ?
Oh that ’s right …
Freddy Krueger .#7 BASKET CASE ( 1982 ) Now this movie is a treat .
Duane and his mutant Siamese brother Bilyle kill a lot of people in this cheese fest
For it's time though the special effects were pretty good .
For it 's time mind you .
the seemingly innocent Duane Bradley arrives in New York City 's Times Square accompanied by a wicker basket within which is something both disgusting and destructive .
You guessed it !
he 's carrying his mutant , telepathic twin brother in a big basket .
actually they were Siamese twins , separated against their will and seeking no prisoners taking revenge on the doctors who surgically parted them !
Of course , it falls upon Duane to keep his brother well - fed , and the basket - dweller 's appetite ranges from hotdogs to hookers , with plenty of lowlife , skid - row snacks to be found in the seedy motel they wash up in .
Naturally enough an assortment of new yorkers find themselves sliced and diced and the mysterious resident of the wicker home is later revealed to have been rescued from the rubbish bin before their father was sent on his way to greet his maker ... seriously he was thrown in the trash .
With the two horrible sequels that followed it this one EARNED it ’s spot on this list .
The other two are just running off the fumes of this OG of awful “ Twin brother is a mutated head with arms that used to be attached to my side until some doctors separated us and now mutant brother is crazy ” movies .
#6 DEATHSTALKER ( 1983 ) Now why would I ( in 1983 ) go see a good action movie like The Return of The Jedi , when I could see this agonizing barbarian movie that looks like it took place in northern California ?
The warrior Deathstalker is tasked by an old witch lady to obtain and unite the three powers of creation - a chalice , an amulet , and a sword - lest the evil magician Munkar get them and use them for nefarious purposes .
After obtaining the sword , Deathstalker joins with other travelers going to the Big Tournament to determine the strongest warrior .
The false king takes hold of a kingdom and holds the true princess in captivity , and then plots to have Deathstalker killed , and Deathstalker must fight to free the princess , blah blah blah .
But what the movie ( and all of it ’s sequels , I ’m thinking 9 of them ) is really about is women in little to no clothes .
This actually is a movie that will make you laugh in parts , but definitely a rental not a purchase .
sorry honey but shielding your eyes will not help you #5 APRIL FOOLS DAY ( 1986 ) “ Why do n’t you tell us something about yourself ? ”
“ Okay … I want to work with handicapped children .
And my parents are my best friends .
Oh , and I start convent school next semester .
And I f—k on the first date . ” - actual quote from the filma group of college students getting together for a spring break weekend .
Muffy ( Foreman , and no , I did n’t make that name up ) invited them all to her luxurious island summer home for her birthday ( which happens to fall on April 1st ) , for a couple of days of fun , friendship , and practical jokes .
Then in the ferry ride to the getaway one of the kids gets crushed between the boat and the dock .
That ’s not going to stop the partying though .
And as the weekend goes on more and more kids die in typical horror movie style , until just one remains .
Then to her surprise all of her friends were not dead , but in fact playing a April fools joke on her !!!
Totally lame because some of the deaths in the movie could not be faked in real life .
And to add to the confusion the last scene shows our Muffy getting what looks like her throat slashed by a stranger .
Biff from Back to the Future plays a character in this flick but he is the only noticeable person in the cast .
#4 CLASS OF NUKEM ’ HIGH ( 1986 ) Another Classic from the good people at Troma .
Tromaville high school is our setting here , and the story centers around several of its attendees .
Tromaville high is complete with ridiculous stereotypes and students who appear to have a median age of 25 in real life .
In other words , it 's more or less your typical all - American high school of the 80's , except for the fact that it 's right next to a nuclear power plant .
I 'm talking about across the street from a nuclear power plant .
The plant 's head honcho , Mr. Finley assures the citizens of Tromaville that the plant is completely safe , but some students of Tromaville high are starting to mutate .
The school 's honor society have transformed into a horde of gutter punks who call themselves " The Cretins " and unassuming scrawny little nerds are vomiting up green stuff and hurling themselves headfirst out of closed windows ( A common accurance in Troma films . )
The Cretins start to sell " atomic pot " grown right on the plant 's grounds and a student named Warren ( I guess you could call him the hero ) finds out the story behind the super powered weed , and tries to destroy the Cretins .
The problem is that Warren is a dorky little nobody and the Cretins are some evil bastards .
But due to nuclear radiation , Warren starts taking on a vindictive alter ego .
Warren now has disposed of a couple of the Cretins ' baddest dudes .
But Chrissy , Warrens girlfriend is also experiencing some odd aftereffects from the pot as well , as she gets pregnant and then spits up a creepy little monster into the toilet .
Of course , someone flushes it down the toilet .
The Cretins get pissed at Warren for killing some of their boys , so they plan to lure him into certain doom using Chrissy as bait .
However , there are more intimidating things in the school at this point , including Chrissy 's own mutant - spawn , which has reached full size and is now a gigantic radioactive killer monster living in the school 's bowels .
You can pretty much guess the rest of the plot from here .
This is a horrible film , but funny in the fact that it does n’t take it self seriously .
In fact it makes fun of itself a lot .
#3 GARBAGE PAIL KIDS : THE MOVIE ( 1987 ) I have an idea , lets take a series of disgusting trading cards and make them into a horrible movie .
Good Idea !!
I loved garbage pail kids as a child so I liked this movie .
I watched it a lot when I was young …. until it disappeared .
The story of the frighteningly bad movie is as follows : Dodger , a skinny dork , works for the " magical " Cap'n Mancini , an antique storeowner with a suspicious garbage pail in his basement .
When Dodger accidentally overturns the pail , a greenish ooze oozes out which formulates itself into seven Garbage Pail Kids ( actually little people in trashy costumes ) : Valerie Vomit , Ali Gator , Greaser Greg , Nat Nerd , Windy Winston , Messy Tessie and Foul Phil , all named after their various afflictions .
It seems that Dodger has a thing for Tangerine , a frizzy - haired hottie who makes and sells clothes for a living , but has NO interest in him ; her boyfriend is a psycho who wears too much eye makeup and spends his days beating Dodger up .
But when the Garbage Pail Kids design a Napoleon suit for Dodger to wear that 's supposed to make him look cool ( it does n't ) , Tangerine suddenly sees Dodger in a different light .
And in an typical eighties - style , she puts him into service making clothes for her by coming onto him , and he cracks the whip on his " friends " the Garbage Pail Kids to produce clothing .
Basically a Garbage Pail Kids sweatshop .
It all comes down to a fashion show .
In the meantime the Garbage Pail Kids escape from the confines of the Cap 'n 's basement , terrorize a bar and movie theater , and eventually get themselves locked in a cage at a zoo for ugly people , with the label " TOO GROSS " plastered across the bars .
Not to worry , though , because Dodger has solicited the help of a gang of bikers who break them out , allowing the Garbage Pail Kids to crash the fashion show and deal with its corrupt patrons in various gross ways : Windy Winston farts into the crowd , Valerie Vomit pukes on one of them , etc .
In the end you wonder why you just spent the last 90 min or so watching midgets and a kid doing weird and gross stuff .
Mackenzie Austin ( then a regular on THE FACTS OF LIFE ) , was the star appeal of this moviekinda looks like Gene Simmons .
God these things freak me out #
2 BREAKIN AND BREAKIN 2 : ELECTRIC BOOGALOO ( 1984 ) Both released in 1984 and counted as a single film according to this list .
Kinda like Kill Bill , only these are terrible .
To explain the plots of these movies is like describing the plot of a porn film .
I mean that the movie is just scenes leading up to another dance scene ( just like porn is just scenes leading up to more love scenes ) .
I think part 2 is about a community center that is getting torn down and the only way to save it is to dance up the walls to the ceiling and having a dancing drive for money .
Granted the dancing is cool but these movies are just plain awful .
I mean just look at this guy .
Shame on you if you Like either of these films .
Try Krush Groove , now there is a good flick .
These two are just the " you got served " of 1984 .
terrible .
I do laugh every time it's on TV .
so I guess it 's not that bad .
And who can forget the oversized boom box craze ?
Do people still do that ?
Or have iPod 's totally taken over ?
#1 SURF NAZIS MUST DIE ( 1987 ) Here it is folks , the worst of the worst .
Again another film from our friends at Troma , God bless them .
This movie does NOT take itself seriously , please remember that when viewing this film .
SURF NAZIS MUST DIE takes place in a post - earthquake near future , where the beaches have been overrun with gangs of surf punks .
Run by a guy named Adolf , the Surf Nazis recruit at a young age , and paint swastikas ( often backward , but whatever ) all over everything .
They also do n't like minorities ( or for that matter , anyone . )
And that ’s the big draw back to the movie - the extreme racism but then again they are Nazis .
The Pipeliners , a rival gang , try to eliminate them , but fail at this task .
The Nazis just seem superior : they have better equipment ( surfboards with switchblades built in ! ) and dirtier fighting techniques ( they even beat trained samurai . )
For the most part , the Nazis have free reign .
They drive around in their shark - mouthed van , steal purses from old ladies , and bash the heads of people they do n't like ( Another common accurance in Troma films ) .
A man by the name of Leroy Washington tries to thwart the actions of the Nazis one day , and meets a gruesome fate as a result .
But while Leroy may have just seemed like just another victim to the Surf Nazis , he winds up being the worst mistake they ever made .
You see , the Nazis were n't counting on Leroy to have a vindictive , bloodthirsty grandma ( a middle - aged , obese black woman named Eleanor Washington ) , who breaks free from her nursing home to build up an arsenal to get revenge for the loss of her grandson .
Before you know it , she 's not only hauling around a HUGE gun , but a collection of explosives as well .
Hilarity ensues .
And I mean that .
Mama is worth watching this by her self .
The climax comes in a scene in which we quickly learn what happens when you get run over by a speedboat .
Ouch .SURF NAZIS MUST DIE is a bad movie .
But it 's that special type of bad movie that should be witnessed by everyone .
Well that ’s it folks !
Hope you enjoyed my list and any other movies you think should be on the list let me know .
Here are some Honorable Mentions that almost made the list : Saturday the 14th ( 1981 ) - a spoof film sure but wow is it badSaturday the 14th II ( 1988 ) - it ’s better than the first one but still worse than GigliKiller Klowns from Outer Space ( 1988 ) - need I say more ?
Motel Hell ( 1980 ) - u check in but …well you know …. get turned into chili ????
Dead Poets Society ( 1989 ) - I hate whiney , the world sucks kind of people and this movie is their anthemDirty Dancing ( 1987 ) - would n’t hate it if I had to watch it only once , I like a good love story every now and again , but after the 534th time I want to punch Patrick Swayze in the face and throw Baby off of a cliff .
Any boyfriend to a GIRL in America has to agree with me on this one .
Howard the Duck ( 1986 ) - I think Lea Thompson ’s song “ Howard the Duck ” at the end put this one over the topYentl ( 1983 ) - did anyone actually think Barbara Streisand looked anything like a boy in this film , me either .
Worse sexual conversion movie ever , including White ChicksHairspray ( 1988 ) -

Time travel by warping close to the sun ?
Star Trek V : The Final Frontier ( 1989 ) - the rest were ok until insurrection The Terror Within ( 1989 ) - Andrew Stevens at his finest , he fights a guy in a monster suit … .
I mean a mutated monster .
No I do n’t mean George Kennedy eitherGymkata ( 1985 ) - some strange stuff here .
A town of crazed Europeans attack the contestants of this race ( ? ) to marry the king 's daughter ( ? ) or something .
Reminds me of Resident Evil 4 , maybe Capcom stole the idea for Resident Evil 4 from Gymkata ( just kidding ) The Gate ( 1987 ) - only because a heavy metal record played backwards opened the gate to hell .
Night of the Demons ( 1988 ) - worst Halloween slasher ever madeCHUD II : Bud the CHUD ( 1989 ) - not that the first one with Daniel Stern and John Heard was any better .

A Must see !!!
Bronx Warriors ( 1982 ) - post apocalyptic new York complete with desert biker gangs and shirtless savagesCannibal Apocalypse ( 1980 ) - The Title explains it all .
Goulies ( 1985 ) - Little demons killing people , apparently no one knows how to " kick " , cause I would punt one of those things 30 yards .
To purchase any of these films go to Amazon.com or IMDB .
comto rent try Netflix.com
Try Netflix anyway though , it is awesome and it has good movies from the 80's too !!!!

EVERY day the world we live in seems to get a little greener .
There are green politics , green economics , green living and , well , Green.view .
The colour is used as a synonym for environmentalism .
This is bad .
Whilst chlorophyll is , without doubt , hugely significant to life on this planet , the anthropocentric , terrestrialist view of the world that dubs those that care as " green " needs to be challenged .
Simply because those who would save the planet have feet and not flippers , and breathe air rather than water , they 've called themselves greens rather than blues .
Yet Earth is mostly water .
As any schoolchild can tell you , the planet is blue .
When did you last hear of the Earth from space described as the " Green marble " ?
Never , that 's when .
AP
Almost blue
Such terrestrialism has had serious consequences .
We 've spent decades following a green agenda that has ignored some of the biggest environmental issues and most important places on the planet .
We 've spent years listening to greens complaining about the loss of the rainforests , acid rain , and extinctions of mammals , birds and plants .
All serious issues .
But while we 've been worrying about them , we have eaten 90 % of the world 's large fish , destroyed much of the world 's coral and nurtured algal blooms the size of entire American states .
The trouble is that because people do n't see what goes on in the water , they do n't identify with it .
Caring about green stuff , even green stuff on the other side of the planet , is a kind of planet - scale nimbyism .
Green stuff is in our back yard , and blue stuff is not .
Green stuff is recognisable and feeds our drive to conserve .
Given the choice , what conservation flagship species would you chose to cosy up to : the cuddly giant panda or the slimy giant squid ?
This columnist would happily eat deep - fried panda nuggets if it would help draw attention to the absurd lack of focus on ocean conservation .
Luckily she might not have to , because the agenda is starting to change anyway , thanks to technology that is allowing us to open up the black ( or maybe very dark blue ) box that is the ocean .
Overhead satellites , diving robotic probes , buoys , sonar mapping , floating and underwater observatories and tagged ocean animals ( whose tags email scientists every day with an update as to where they 've been and what they 've been doing ) allow scientists to see more of the oceans than ever before .
Today scientists are starting to map the planet 's living marine highways , as well as the ocean 's physical environment .
As a result , a new , blue agenda on over - fishing , pollution and ocean warming is emerging .
Really big issues are starting to swim into focus .
Concern about destructive fishing practices such as trawling and blast fishing is mounting .
Trawling cuts the living material from the sea bottom , and reduces the future productivity of the ocean .
It stirs up a lot of sediment : sediment plumes can now be seen on Google Earth .
Blast fishing involves blowing up reefs in order to harvest fish .
When was the last time someone decided to harvest land animals by blowing up entire forests ?
Increasingly , the blues are taking a leaf out of the green book , and campaigning for nature reserves to improve fish stocks and aid marine conservation .
Last year , President Bush responded to such concerns by creating the world 's largest ocean sanctuary around Hawaii , surpassing the Great Barrier Reef park in size .
Still , marine conservation is in its infancy .
Terrestrial conservation has a massive head start : Yellowstone , the world 's first national park , was created in America in 1872 .
Less than 1 % of the ocean is protected by marine parks .
That compares with 12 % of the land .
One way of getting blue issues on the agenda is to put more effort into finding out what is going on down there .
To this end , a group calling itself the Partnership for Observation of Global Oceans ( POGO ) , says it wants up to $ 3 billion to set up a proper global marine monitoring system which actually looks at what is going on under the ocean .
Will it happen ?
Not if it is up to the Greens to decide .
At a Council on Foreign Relations event in D.C. today , as a Hillary adviser touted Clinton ’s foreign policy experience , McCain adviser Randy Scheunemann reportedly chimed in with : “ Please keep running those 3:00 a.m. ads about who you want to answer the phone , because we like those . ”
The U.S. Justice Department on Monday ( March 24 ) approved the merger between satellite radio companies Sirius and XM more than a year after the two companies first announced the initial deal .
According to its
Web site , the Justice Department 's Antitrust Division cleared the merger after determining that Sirius ' takeover of XM would not harm competition or consumers .
" After a careful and thorough review of the proposed transaction , the Division concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that the proposed merger of XM and Sirius is likely to substantially lessen competition , and that the transaction therefore is not likely to harm consumers , " reads a statement on the approval .
" The Division reached this conclusion because the evidence did not show that the merger would enable the parties to profitably increase prices to satellite radio customers for several reasons . "
Those reasons , according to the statement , included " a lack of competition between the parties in important segments even without the merger ; the competitive alternative services available to consumers ; technological change that is expected to make those alternatives increasingly attractive over time ; and efficiencies likely to flow from the transaction that could benefit consumers . "
The merger was first proposed in February of 2007 as a way of stemming billions in losses incurred in attracting on - air talent , sports deals and subscribers .
Sirius , home to Howard Stern , Martha Stewart and NASCAR , claims 7.67 million subscribers , while XM , which broadcasts all Major League Baseball games has such headline talent as Oprah Winfrey and Opie and Anthony , has 8.57 million , according to Bloomberg.com .
Next , the merger must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission ; a ruling is expected in the coming weeks .
Both companies , in an effort to gain FCC support , derived various pricing packages , including an a la carte pricing system .
As a result of the merger , Sirius and XM subscribers — who are now asked to pay $ 12.95 a month — could end up paying substantially less ( as little as $ 6.99 , with the proposed tiered pricing ) .
In addition , the combined company plans to eliminate duplicative programming , including a number of music channels .
The deal 's main opposition came from the National Association of Broadcasters , the trade group that represents free radio stations , which waged a lobbying campaign in Congress and at the FCC to stop the merger , arguing that it would create a pay - radio monopoly .
Shareholders of the two companies approved the combination in separate special meetings on November 13 .
More than 96 percent of those who voted approved the transaction , according to The Washington Post .
" The likely evolution of technology in the future , including the expected introduction in the next several years of mobile broadband Internet devices , made it even more unlikely that the transaction would harm consumers in the longer term , " reads the Justice Department decision .
" Accordingly , the division has closed its investigation of the proposed merger . "
The French reseller of Taser stun guns , dogged by scandals over Taser - linked deaths in Canada and the United States , has taken Amnesty International to court for harming its reputation .
In May last year , the French branch of Amnesty issued a statement claiming that a Taser gun had been put up for auction on eBay and that 220 US deaths had been linked to the Taser gun .
Following a complaint from SMP Technologies , which has imported and supplied Taser guns to the French army , police and gendarmerie since 2004 , Amnesty later said it had sent out the statement by mistake .
Upon investigation , the rights group said the object for sale on eBay had turned out to be a publicity gadget , not a Taser gun .
According to SMP 's lawyer , Catherine Hennequin , Amnesty agreed to publish a clarification but has yet to do so eight months on , and has continued to claim that deaths were linked to the weapon 's use .
Amnesty 's lawyer Simon Foreman says his client was mistaken about the eBay sale , but not about the " dangerous nature " of the Taser itself , accusing SMP of taking legal action " with the sole aim of intimidation " .
Amnesty International says around 300 people have died around the world after being zapped with a Taser and has called for the weapon 's use to be suspended while a full investigation is conducted .
The Taser packs a 50,000 - volt punch that can paralyse targets from up to 10 metres away .
The United Nations Committee against Torture ruled in November that its use constitutes " a form of torture " which can result in death .
The UN criticism followed a string of deaths in the United States and Canada that occurred after police used Tasers to subdue people , including a Polish man who was filmed dying after being stunned at Vancouver airport .
A verdict in the French trial is due on March 11 .

It would be much better — tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars better — if the market rose more steadily and the bulk of the 401 ( k ) contributions could then rise along with it .
Buy low and sell high , right ?
A true crash would take care of this problem .
But the market ’s big fall from 2000 through 2002 does n’t fit the definition , because it did n’t come close to erasing the effects of the bubble .
Stocks are still more expensive today , relative to corporate earnings over the previous decade , than at any time besides the late 1920s and the dot - com boom .
So unless you ’re about to retire or sell stock for some other reason , you should n’t get too upset about the market ’s fall .
As long as you are planning on more buying than selling over the next decade or two , a market correction is your friend .
It ’s also likely to improve the nation ’s long - term economic prospects .
The bull market of 1990s , combined with the housing boom , fooled many people into thinking they did n’t need to save money .
They evidently figured that their existing assets would continue to soar in value and could serve as their nest egg .
Last year , Americans saved only 0.4 percent of their disposable income , down from 7 percent in 1990 .
This decline in personal savings has set the stage for all kinds of problems .
The biggest may be that less savings , by definition , equals a smaller pool of capital available for overall investment .
Less investment — be it in medical technology or software — will mean slower economic growth and lower standards of living down the road .
Fortunately , the savings rate has begun to climb , especially since the housing market turned .
So far this year , Americans have saved 0.8 percent of their income , and the number should continue to rise .
As Joe Davis , an economist at the Vanguard Group , the investment company , said , “ This will be a slow - moving and ongoing process , but I think a welcome one . ”
The other ostensible pieces of bad news have their own silver linings .
As the cost of gas has soared to $ 3 a gallon , from an inflation - adjusted low of about $ 1.20 in 1999 , Americans have finally started buying more efficient cars and trucks .
For the first time since the mid-1980s , the fuel economy of new vehicles has increased for two straight years , the Environment Protection Agency recently reported .
This will slow global warming and make life a little less comfortable for oil - rich autocrats ( though not nearly as much as a carbon tax would ) .
How well did Florida Gov. know alleged child porn peddler ?
Michael Roston
Published : Friday February 8 , 2008

Print This Email This Floridians were shocked last week when police announced that the spokesman for the state 's Department of Children and Families had been arrested and charged with peddling child pornography .
But buried in news accounts of the case was a curious detail : the official in question had listed the state 's current Republican Governor , Charlie Crist , as a reference when he applied for his post in 2005 .
Gov. Crist returned to the news as the nation awaited the outcome of the Republican presidential primary in Florida .
The Sunshine State 's governor 's endorsement of Sen. John McCain late in the campaign may have helped push McCain across the finish line to take the state 's 57 delegates .
Crist 's endorsement also contributed to ending the campaign of Rudy Giuliani , who had heavily courted the governor 's thumbs up .
Just after the Florida electoral contest , Tampa Bay police announced the arrest of Al Zimmerman , the spokesman for the state 's Department of Children and Families .
Zimmerman , a former TV reporter , was charged with 8 child pornography counts after taking photos of two underage boys performing sexual acts .
Some evidence indicates that he may have met one of the boys on the job , and that he may have had additional victims .
He could face up to 120 years in jail .
While the news prompted state officials to say they were reviewing the personnel files of state employees for red flags , Zimmerman appeared to have come highly recommended when he was appointed to his post in 2005 .
Among the five references he listed , one of them was Crist , then the state Attorney General under Gov. Jeb Bush .
Crist 's office has implied that the governor had little direct connection to Zimmerman , and that the listing of top state officials as references was a routine matter .
An AP report noted that the governor , " does not recall authorizing a recommendation for Zimmerman , but added that he often is asked to give them , spokeswoman Erin Isaac said Sunday . "
But according to some earlier accounts , Crist was directly aware of Zimmerman and his work as on - air talent for a Tampa - area TV station .
" A spokeswoman for the governor said Crist knew Zimmerman through his reporting job in Tampa Bay but does not remember being asked to be one of his references , " according to a Sunday report in the Palm Beach Post .
Regardless of how well Zimmerman and Crist knew one another , state officials made it clear that Crist was never formally contacted prior to the spokesman 's hiring in 2005 .
Prior to his appointment as a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families , Zimmerman appears to have had a colorful past .
News reports indicated that he faced an outstanding warrant in Texas for theft .
Additionally , he was arrested on DUI charges in Georgia in the 1990s .
In 2003 , he was arrested for passing a bad check in Florida , but the case was dropped .
As a reporter , Zimmerman also made waves .
According to the Tampa Tribune , a report that Zimmerman completed called " Perverts in the Park " provoked controversy when it aired in Texas in 1996 .
The TV report focused on a public restroom in a park in San Antonio where gay men met for trysts .
And when the news item was broadcast , Zimmerman forgot to digitally blur explicit sexual images recorded with a hidden camera .
It also appears that Zimmerman may have contemplated a career in online pornography as far back as the 1990s .
News reports indicate that he and his brother bought the URL , " boxersorbriefs.com , " but never began using it .
While Zimmerman appears to have engaged in illicit activity online , he also created a public trail that might have exposed him to controversy had it been uncovered prior to the his arrest .
On his MySpace profile , Zimmerman describes himself as not only a " Government Employee , " but also as a " Swinger . "
He remarks that he 's looking for " Someone who hates to cuddle afterwards , " as well as , " a friend that likes to pay for everything . "
The profile furthermore lists Zimmerman as straight , but a friend joked in his comments section that he was gay , prompting another friend to remark , " if we all stopped commenting on everyone 's sexual persuasion , maybe the press would n't have anything to report . "

Tracy Brooks made a string of false rape claims against different men but walked free from Newcastle Crown Court
A binge - drinking woman who accused five innocent men of rape walked free from court .
Tracy Brooks , 26 , wasted massive amounts of police time when she made two false allegations against two friends within the space of a month last summer .
The men were arrested , questioned , held for hours in custody and faced the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence if her claims were believed .
But weeks later , she came clean and told detectives the allegations were false .
Several years ago , Brooks , a self - confessed binge - drinker , falsely accused three other men of rape in separate incidents , Newcastle Crown Court was told .
In 2001 and 2002 , she made complaints against two former boyfriends and in 2004 , she told police she had been raped by a friend 's boyfriend .
But the judge said he could not take these incidents into account in passing sentence because she had never been formally cautioned or charged in relation to them .
Instead , Brooks , of North Shields , North Tyneside , was given a 32 - week suspended prison sentence and a three - month night - time curfew .
She had admitted two charges of perverting the course of justice .
The court heard she made one complaint last July 31 , telling police she had been attacked by a male friend at his home .
The man was arrested and made to give DNA samples , while she was examined by a doctor and a video was made of her describing her fake ordeal to detectives .
Just a month later on August 30 , she made another complaint , saying a different friend had raped her in her home .
The man went through a similar ordeal and she was again examined and videotaped .
It was weeks later , on September 27 , that she was arrested and the allegations against the men were formally withdrawn .
Passing sentence , Judge David Hodson told her : " The effect of your false complaints was two men were subjected to a substantial degree of humiliation and a colossal amount of anxiety that they were being charged with an offence that could have resulted in a very lengthy sentence of imprisonment . "
The judge said she had escaped custody by " a hair 's breadth " and added : " I am sure the two men who were the victims of your false complaints would expect you should receive an immediate sentence of imprisonment .
" But I take the view it would be counter - productive in the light of the more stable life you have had recently . "
Defence barrister Gavin Doig said Brooks , who had a history of mental health problems , was an alcoholic who came from a troubled background .
He said she was making good progress with the help of mental health organisations .
After the case , jobless Brooks apologised for her actions , saying : " I feel devastated and ashamed of what I have done .
" On top of my mental health problems , I have had a drink problem for a very long time , though I have n't drunk now for five months .
" Giving up booze has given me clarity of mind and now I feel I am a better person . "
David Swanson , Democrats.com — Christiane Brown ( KJFK , Reno ) interviews Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in this audio clip from last week and presses him on why he admits impeachable offenses have been commited but opposes impeachment .
Reid says that impeaching Bush would just give you Cheney , but Brown points out that Cheney can be impeached too ( in fact , the only impeachment bill in Congress right now is to impeach Cheney ) .
Reid says there ’s not enough time , but Brown points out how swift past impeachments have been .
Reid struggles and fails to find a coherent explanation .
Here ’s the Audio :
The agreement , defined as a Civil Assistance Plan , was not submitted to Congress for approval , nor did Congress pass any law or treaty specifically authorizing this military agreement to combine the operations of the armed forces of the United States and Canada in the event of a wide range of domestic civil disturbances ranging from violent storms , to health epidemics , to civil riots or terrorist attacks .
In Canada , the agreement paving the way for the militaries of the U.S. and Canada to cross each other 's borders to fight domestic emergencies was not announced either by the Harper government or the Canadian military , prompting sharp protest .
" It 's kind of a trend when it comes to issues of Canada - U.S. relations and contentious issues like military integration , " Stuart Trew , a researcher with the Council of Canadians told the Canwest News Service .
" We see that this government is reluctant to disclose information to Canadians that is readily available on American and Mexican websites . "
The military Civil Assistance Plan can be seen as a further incremental step being taken toward creating a North American armed forces available to be deployed in domestic North American emergency situations .
The agreement was signed at U.S. Army North headquarters , Fort Sam Houston , Texas , by U.S. Air Force Gen. Gene Renuart , commander of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command , or USNORTHCOM , and by Canadian Air Force Lt. Gen. Marc Dumais , commander of Canada Command .
" This document is a unique , bilateral military plan to align our respective national military plans to respond quickly to the other nation 's requests for military support of civil authorities , " Renuart said in a statement published on the USNORTHCOM website .
" In discussing the new bilateral Civil Assistance Plan established by USNORTHCOM and Canada Command , Renuart stressed , " Unity of effort during bilateral support for civil support operations such as floods , forest fires , hurricanes , earthquakes and effects of a terrorist attack , in order to save lives , prevent human suffering an mitigate damage to property , is of the highest importance , and we need to be able to have forces that are flexible and adaptive to support rapid decision - making in a collaborative environment . "
Lt. Gen. Dumais seconded Renuart 's sentiments , stating , " The signing of this plan is an important symbol of the already strong working relationship between Canada Command and U.S. Northern Command . "
" Our commands were created by our respective governments to respond to the defense and security challenges of the twenty - first century , " he stressed , " and we both realize that these and other challenges are best met through cooperation between friends . "
The statement on the USNORTHCOM website emphasized the plan recognizes the role of each nation 's lead federal agency for emergency preparedness , which in the United States is the Department of Homeland Security and in Canada is Public Safety Canada .
The statement then noted the newly signed plan was designed to facilitate the military - to - military support of civil authorities once government authorities have agreed on an appropriate response .
As WND has previously reported , U.S. Northern Command was established on Oct. 1 , 2002 , as a military command tasked with anticipating and conducting homeland defense and civil support operations where U.S. armed forces are used in domestic emergencies .
Similarly , Canada Command was established on Feb. 1 , 2006 , to focus on domestic operations and offer a single point of contact for all domestic and continental defense and securities partners .
In Nov. 2007 , WND published a six - part exclusive series , detailing WND 's on - site presence during the NORAD - USNORTHCOM Vigilant Shield 2008 , an exercise which involved Canada Command as a participant .
In an exclusive interview with WND during Vigilant Shield 2008 , Gen. Renuart affirmed USNORTHCOM would deploy U.S. troops on U.S. soil should the president declare a domestic emergency in which the Department of Defense ordered USNORTHCOM involvement .
In May 2007 , WND reported President Bush , on his own authority , signed National Security Presidential Directive 51 , also known as Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 , authorizing the president to declare a national emergency and take over all functions of federal , state , local , territorial and tribal governments , without necessarily obtaining the approval of Congress to do so .
So it 's only an an agreement , but is n't this the same way the EU started ?
Another troubling similarity is the lack of referendum .
I would like to be consulted ...
Would n't you ?
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
A court has ordered pop singer Britney Spears to give up custody of her children effective Wednesday at noon .
Kevin Federline and Britney Spears , here during happier times , have two children .
Spears ' former husband , Kevin Federline , is to retain custody of their two sons " until further order of the court , " according to a ruling by Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon .
It was not clear what led to Monday 's decision awarding Federline full custody .
A transcript of the court proceedings was ordered sealed .
Last month , a judge ordered Spears , 25 , to submit to random drug tests after finding she engaged in " habitual , frequent , and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol . "
That order , also by Gordon , provided no details and did not name any drugs .
The former couple has been embroiled in a bitter custody fight over their sons , Sean Preston and Jayden .
The parents had split custody 50 - 50 , but Federline then asked for the arrangements to be shifted to 70 - 30 in his favor .
Watch how Spears became user of -- and prisoner to -- fame »
In addition to ordering the twice - weekly drug tests , Gordon ordered Spears to spend eight hours per week working with a " parenting coach , " who was to observe her interactions with her children .
Gordon also told both parents to avoid alcohol or " other non-prescription controlled substances " 12 hours before taking custody of the children .
He also barred the exes from making " derogatory remarks about the other party and the other party 's family or significant other " during the case .
And he ordered the parents to go through " joint co-parenting counseling " and barred them from using corporal punishment on the boys .
Spears and Federline were married for two years before their divorce became final in July .
Monday 's order comes amid a career freefall for Spears , whose new album is due to be released November 13 .
After her September 9 " comeback " performance on the MTV Video Music Awards , critics derided her singing and dancing as lackluster and said she appeared overweight in her sequined two - piece costume .
Her former divorce lawyer , Laura Wasser , resigned last month as her legal representative after telling reporters the singer " just wants to be a mom . "
Spears ' management company , the Firm , recently quit after representing the singer for little over a month .

What is the overlap between strict and speculative ?
Can both variants be combined ?
( almost certainly yes )
Is speculative really simpler ?
Is speculative sufficient ?
What are the performance benefits of speculative ?
For the last few days I have been thinking about how to write a low - level program optimiser , based on the ideas from Supero .
Supero works at the level of a lazy Core expressions , but actual hardware works on a sequence of strict instructions .
The possible idea is to translate the lazy expressions to strict sequences , then borrow the ideas from supercompilation once more .
In particular I have been looking at the GRIN approach , which defines such a set of instructions .
The GRIN work is very clever , and has many ideas that I would like to reuse .
However , the one aspect that gave me slight concern is the complexity .
A GRIN program requires the use of several analysis passes , and many many transformation rules .
While this approach is perfectly acceptable , one of the goals of the Supero work is to make the optimisation process simpler -- comprising of a few simple but powerful rules .
I will first explain how strictness works , then how my speculative approach works .
Readers who already know about unboxing are encouraged to skip to the speculative section .
When doing low - level compilation , one of the most important stages is strictness analysis , and the associated unboxing .
To take the example of thefunction in Haskell :
Here it is easy to see that thefunction always evaluates .
We can also use our knowledge of the definition of Whereis an actual machine integer ( possibly stored in a register ) , andis a lazy box surrounding it .
Since we know thatwill always unwrap our , we can pass thearound without thebox .
I have made all the conversions fromtoexplicit using an , but have left all the unboxings implicit .
The operatorsetc. are simply unboxed and strict variants of the standard operators .
Also , since we knowis strict in its first argument , we can evaluate the first argument to the recursive call strictly .
Applying all these optimisations can now write :
We have removed the explicit boxing in the recursive call , and work entirely with unboxed integers .
Nowis entirely strict .
We can even write a wrapper around our strict version , to provide a lazy interface matching the original .
I have usedto denote the unboxing of .
Nowlooks like it did before , but operates much faster , on unboxed integers .
I would like to not include a strictness analyser in my optimiser , or if it is included , have it be the result of a series of transformations -- without explicit " stop and analyse " then " use the results " stages .
As part of my thoughts on this , I was trying to consider how to optimisewithout invoking the strictness analyser .
The speculative transformation I have defined first generates - I have left out the details ofit decides to .
This step is entirely safe - we have defined , but we have not written a wrapper that invokes it , even in the recursive case .
Thefunction is equivalent toif the initial argument was evaluated .
We have transformedusing only local knowledge , at the point .
We can also transform , replacing any uses ofwhich are guaranteed to come afteris evaluated , with .
This transformation is merely reusing the knowledge we have gained unwrapping
Now we promote any primitive operations on only unboxed values .
Given , it is cheaper to evalute the subtraction than to store a lazy thunk to the function .
We can now use our knowledge that if we know an argument to a function is already evaluated , we can call the strict variant ( this corresponds closely to constructor specialisation ) : We can also replace theinwithas we know we will have to evaluate the result of a function .
Now we have ended up with a fast inner loop , operating only on unboxed integers .
We have not required strictness information to make any transformation .
One way of viewing the difference between strictness and this transformation is the flow of information .
In strictness , the caller is informed that a particular argument will be evaluated .
In speculative , the callee informs the caller that an argument has already been evaluated .
These two concepts are not the same , and while they overlap , there are instances where they differ considerably .
Consider the following example :
Here thefunction is strict in , but not either ofor .
A strictness analyser would generate a variant ofwith only the first argument unboxed .
In contrast the speculative variant will determine thatandshould be evaluated , and pass unboxed values in all arguments of , even thoughmay not evaluateorTo see this behaviour in GHC , it helps to makerecursive :
Now run with the options , and you will see thevariant has typeThese thoughts are still very preliminary , and there are a number of unanswered questions :
a good cube is hard to find
I make ice cubes using two trays .
I stack them together in my freezer , usually on the upper shelf .
When the cubes are finished freezing , I empty them into a bin .
Yes , I am one of those people and their damned bins .
Others prefer to loosen the ice cubes in place and pick them out one or two at a time .
That ’s fine .
Either way , a simple truth is observed : Sometimes the ice cubes pop out of the tray cleanly , easily , and in whole cubes .
These are good cubes , and leave me feeling happy and rambunctious .
Sometimes , though , the ice cubes stick in the tray .
These are bad cubes .
Not only are they harder to get out , but usually they break into pieces .
When I next pour myself a Fresca™ and reach into my lovely , precious bin for a few ice cubes , my eager hand encounters chips and jagged pieces .
Sometimes it ’s enough to spoil the whole Fresca Experience™ .
A Ferraro flashback
" If Jesse Jackson were not black , he would n't be in the race , " she said .
Really .
The cite is an April 15 , 1988 Washington Post story ( byline : Howard Kurtz ) , available only on Nexis .
Here 's the full context :
Placid of demeanor but pointed in his rhetoric , Jackson struck out repeatedly today against those who suggest his race has been an asset in the campaign .
President Reagan suggested Tuesday that people do n't ask Jackson tough questions because of his race .
And former representative Geraldine A. Ferraro ( D - N.Y. ) said Wednesday that because of his " radical " views , " if Jesse Jackson were not black , he would n't be in the race . "
Asked about this at a campaign stop in Buffalo , Jackson at first seemed ready to pounce fiercely on his critics .
But then he stopped , took a breath , and said quietly , " Millions of Americans have a point of view different from " Ferraro's .
Discussing the same point in Washington , Jackson said , " We campaigned across the South . . . without a single catcall or boo .
It was not until we got North to New York that we began to hear this from Koch , President Reagan and then Mrs. Ferraro . . . .
Some people are making hysteria while I 'm making history . "

Welcome to Cloud City .
[ Images : Courtesy of Studio Lindfors ; maybe Will Smith , in I Am Legend should have lived in one of these things ...
If so , he might have survived ] .
" Though perhaps an unusual proposal , " we read , " Cloud City is literally an uplifting experience that will allow communities to remain intact as they pull themselves out of the rubble . "
It 's an Archigram - like instant city in the sky :
The homes can be rapidly deployed with minimal site preparation .
They are intended to ‘ plug in ’ to existing utility services , and can be deployed by a team of four workers in roughly an hour .
Once airborne , the floating homes allow construction crews below to work unimpeded , speeding up the recovery effort .
This in turn reduces cost overruns and unnecessary delays .
The hovering metropolis seems easy enough to construct .
[ Images : Courtesy of Studio Lindfors ] .
As the architects themselves explain , the blimps are a kind of emergency city , held in reserve : Inflatable homes would be pre-fabricated and stored in warehouses for deployment as required .
Each home consists of three basic components : an inflatable bladder , a rigid core , and a metal and wood platform .
The bladder would consist of two compartments , filled with pressurized helium ( which is non-combustible ) .
The pressurized gas would give shape to the tailored and stitched fabric shell , creating an open living space within .
Made from recycled polyester fabric , the balloon has a large surface area suitable for mounting of flexible solar panels for generating electricity .
Within this living space is a rigid core which contains an efficient kitchenette and bathroom , along with plumbing and electrical services .
The 300sf living space is open , and can be configured in many ways , with up to three bedroom spaces suitable for a family of four .
However , a part of me thinks there 's no real reason to wait until disaster strikes ; we could simply migrate into the sky .

You can take off that ninja mask now .
A new facial - recognition algorithm created by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign is able to recognize faces with 90 - 95 percent accuracy , even if the eyes , nose and mouth are obscured .
" Most algorithms use what 's known as meaningful facial features to recognize people – things like the eyes , nose and mouth , " says Allen Yang , a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley 's College of Engineering who developed the new algorithm .
" But that 's incredibly limiting because you 're only looking at pixels from a designated portion of the face and those pixels end up being much smaller than the whole image .
Our algorithm shows that you only need to randomly select pixels from anywhere on the face .
If you select enough of them , you can produce extremely high accuracy . "
Yang 's new algorithm , which was created with the help of a team of researchers at UIUC , could mark a quantum leap in face - recognition technology .
Current feature - based systems have accuracy that tops out at 65 percent when some form of occlusion is introduced .
They also require relatively high - resolution images , and can easily be fooled by changing small details such as adding a mustache , donning a hood or changing one 's expression .
The secret sauce in Yang 's new method is a mathematical technique for solving linear equations with sparse entries called , appropriately enough , sparse representation ( .pdf ) .
While all other facial - recognition algorithms tend to compare a given feature set against all others in a database ( generating percentages of likeliness along the way ) , Yang 's algorithm ignores all but the most compelling match from one subject – basically , its most confident choice .
" It sounds like a simple idea , but by enforcing that one extra constraint you can suddenly see a huge boost in the performance , " Yang says .
As Shankar Sastry , the dean of UC Berkeley 's College of Engineering , notes , Yang 's new facial - detection method also renders years of research in the field obsolete .
" The academic community is really upset , " he says .
" It sounds terrible .
You do n't care what features you choose ?
It flies in the face of many years of research . "
Nevertheless , the new technique could pave the way for completely new models for online advertising , new ways of annotating video and still images , and new techniques for monitoring and identifying people in public places .
Yang says he 's already been approached by one startup ( which he would n't name ) interested in adopting this technique for what he calls " preannotation . "
For instance , this technology could automatically add family members ' names to each image in a massive photo library , Yang says , saving you the trouble of flipping through thousands of photos to find that one of Uncle Bill .
It 's also easy to imagine search engines like Google being interested in automatically recognizing the faces of the humans portrayed in publicly available photos , adding the image data to the textual information surrounding those photos to produce yet another dimension for targeting advertisements .
Looking at a party photo of Johnny Depp on a fan site ?
Google could display advertisements for Sweeney Todd .
This new technique is also bound to raise a series of red flags for privacy advocates , since what Yang has developed is a highly accurate way of recognizing people even with occlusion or distortion .
With more and more cities , retailers and employers deploying security cameras in public places , it 's only a matter of time before face - recognition technology like Yang 's gets added to these cameras .
Then the question will be not just who is watching you – but whether they know exactly who you are .
BAQUBA , Jan 25 ( IPS ) - Broken promises have brought a dramatic increase in anti-U.S. sentiment across the capital city of Iraq 's Diyala province .
Many people in Baquba , capital of Diyala 40 km northeast of Baghdad , had supported U.S. forces when they ousted former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein .
But failed reconstruction projects and muddled policies mean the U.S. has lost that support .
" The Americans based their strategy in Iraq on certain Shias here who have direct enmity with Sunnis and allegiance to Iran , " resident Ayub Ibrahim told IPS .
" This was the source of the gap between certain Shias which the U.S. backs , and certain Sunnis they back . "
Shias and Sunnis are different sects within Islam .
The U.S. has also alienated people through its policy of extensive detentions .
Many believe that raids that lead to arrests are based on motivated information given to the U.S. military by Shia militiamen who have infiltrated the Iraqi army and police .
" We never witnessed an attempt to arrest Shia people either by the U.S. army or the Iraqi police and army , " resident Abdul Sattar al - Badri told IPS .
Most people see no reasonable basis for many of the arrests .
In November the International Committee of the Red Cross said that around 60,000 people are currently detained in Iraq .
" The Americans occupied our country and put our men in prisons , " Dhafir al - Rubaiee , an officer from Iraq 's previous army told IPS .
" The majority of these prisoners have been arrested for nothing other than for being Sunni .
Every one of these prisoners has a family , and these families now have reason to hate Americans . "
Others blame the lack of security and the destroyed infrastructure for the increasing anti-U.S. sentiment .
" The lack of security is a direct result of the occupation , " resident Abu Ali told IPS .
" The Americans crossed thousands of miles to destroy our home and kill our men .
They are the reason for all our disasters . "
Another resident , speaking on condition of anonymity added , " We lived in need during the period of the Saddam government , but we were safe .
We were compelled to work sometimes 20 hours a day to earn our living , but we were happy to see our children and relatives together . "
U.S. forces , he said , have ended all that .
Abu Tariq believes the U.S. military intentionally destroyed Iraq 's infrastructure .
" The Americans destroyed the electricity , water pumping stations , factories , bridges , highways , hospitals , schools , buildings , and opened the borders for strangers and terrorists to get easily into the country , " he said .
The large number of Iraqis killed by U.S. forces has also hardly endeared the forces to the people .
" When targeted by a roadside bomb or suicide bomber , U.S. soldiers shoot at people randomly .
Innocent civilians have been killed or injured , " Yaser Abdul - Rahman , a 45 - year - old schoolmaster told IPS .
" Thousands of people have been killed like this . "
The anti-U.S. sentiment in Baquba is now so high that people no longer hide their distrust of the U.S .
" At the beginning of the occupation , the people of Iraq did not realise the U.S. strategy in the area , " Abu Taiseer , a member of the communist party in the city told IPS .
" Their strategy is based on destruction and massacre .
They do anything to have their agenda fulfilled .
" Now , Iraqis know that behind the U.S. smile is hatred and violence , " Taiseer added .
" They call others violent and terrorists , but what they are doing in Iraq and in other countries is the origin and essence of terror .
America is the biggest producer of terror , and they spend huge funds for creating and training death squads all over the world . "
Despite the differing U.S. ways of dealing with Shias and Sunnis , the two sects seem one in their hatred of the U.S .
" Look at our country , it will need 30 years to get back again , " Edan Barham told IPS .
" This has nothing to do with sects ; all of us are Iraqis , and we should think of Iraq in a better way than sectarian lines . "
" People of Iraq of all sects now realise that it is the occupation represented by the Americans that has damaged the country , " resident Khalil Ibrahim said .
Political analyst Azhar al - Teengane says the only Iraqis who support the occupation are those benefiting directly from it .
" The occupation is good for politicians who have made money , militiamen , contractors and opportunists , " Teengane said .
" These form not more than 5 percent of Iraqi people . "
Self - rule could help lower anti-U.S. sentiment , said resident Jalal al - Taee .
" In order to improve the situation , the U.S. army should let the people of this city run it . "

The results in the Republican race might have delivered a fatal blow to the campaign of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who was a distant third as results came in Tuesday night .
Two GOP sources with direct knowledge of Giuliani 's plans said he will drop out of the race and endorse McCain at an event in California on Wednesday .
While Giuliani did n't say he was withdrawing from the race , he did speak of his campaign in the past tense at one point .
" I 'm proud I ran a positive campaign , " he told supporters .
" I ran a campaign that was uplifting . "
Watch how Giuliani reacted to the results »
With 97 percent of Republican precincts reporting , McCain held a 36 - 31 percent lead over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
Giuliani had 15 percent of the vote , followed closely by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee who held 14 percent .
See what the results mean »
A top campaign official from McCain 's camp has been in " ongoing discussions " with Giuliani 's campaign about endorsing McCain 's candidacy , a GOP official familiar with talks told CNN Tuesday .
Watch what happened to Giuliani 's campaign »
A source close to Giuliani confirmed that discussions were taking place and said there is talk among the staff that an endorsement could come Wednesday in California .
The source said McCain and Giuliani need to talk , but " we are working to make it happen . "
" Tonight , my friends , we celebrate .
Tomorrow , it 's back to work , " McCain said as he claimed victory .
" We have a ways to go , but we 're getting close , and for that , you all have my profound thanks . "

A Florida win gives McCain all 57 of the delegates at stake .
Romney took aim at McCain Tuesday night , putting the Arizona senator on the hot seat for failures in Washington , his criticisms of President Bush and for going from the military directly into Congress .
" Washington is fundamentally broken , " Romney said .
" We 're not going to change Washington just by sending the same people back just to sit in different chairs . "
Watch Romney thank his supporters »
McCain , who cultivates an image as a maverick , has been in the senate for four terms after two terms as a U.S. congressman .
Huckabee told his supporters he was " playing all nine innings of this ball game . "

With about 97 percent of Democratic precincts reporting , Clinton had 50 percent of the vote .
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was in second with 33 percent , and former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards was in third with 14 percent .
The Democratic vote may have little impact on the presidential race , however , because the party 's national leadership said it would not allow Florida 's delegates to participate in the national convention because of a squabble over scheduling .
Republicans penalized the state as well , but took away only half of their 114 delegates .
CNN political analyst Bill Schneider said earlier a Florida victory for McCain would be significant because it would be a way for him to prove he has the support of his party 's base .
Florida is a closed primary , which means that only registered party members may vote in their own party 's primary .
McCain won primary contests in New Hampshire and South Carolina , thanks in part to the backing of independent voters who cast ballots in the Republican contests .
Clinton claimed victory despite party sanctions stripping the state of its convention delegates , thanking supporters even though she and other candidates did not campaign there .
" I am thrilled to have had this vote of confidence that you have given me today , " Clinton told supporters .
" I promise you I will do everything I can to make sure not only are Florida 's Democratic delegates seated , but Florida is in the winning column for the Democrats in 2008 . "
Watch how Clinton won in Florida »
Clinton has called on the Democratic Party to formally lift sanctions on the state .
Robert Gibbs , communications director for Obama campaign , downplayed the Florida results and got a dig in at Clinton .
" Mike Gravel is going to get the same number of delegates as Clinton , " Gibbs said , referring to the former Alaska senator who has yet to earn a single percentage point in earlier contests .
Gibbs said he thought the results would have little effect on the race heading into Super Tuesday .
" You can't gain momentum in a state that everyone but Hillary Clinton pledged not to campaign in , " Gibbs said .
Turnout was high for the Democratic race even though no delegates were at stake .
Florida Sen . Bill Nelson said about 2.5 million voters cast ballots , and nearly 400,000 people cast early or absentee ballots ahead of the primary .

Donna Brazile , who managed former Vice President Al Gore 's presidential bid , said many Democrats were likely to turn out to vote on a state constitutional amendment that would limit property tax increases and expand homestead exemptions .
" People are very afraid this will cut public services , cut back education , " said Brazile , a CNN analyst .
" So the Florida Education Association and all of the unions are spending millions of dollars to get voters to turn out . "
The economy is overwhelmingly the top issue for voters in Florida 's primary , according to early exit polls .
Among Republicans and Democrats , the economy dwarfed other issues affecting their vote .
Forty - seven percent of Republicans said the economy is the most pressing issue , as did 55 percent of Democrats .
The primary calendar played in Florida 's favor .
Other than Republican caucuses in Maine this weekend , Florida is the last contest before the coast - to - coast primaries and caucuses on February 5 , known as Super Tuesday .
McCain , Romney and the three other candidates engaged in a civil debate in Florida on Thursday night .
But since Friday , the McCain and Romney camps , and the candidates themselves , have fired away at each other over the war in Iraq , the economy , illegal immigration and border security , campaign finance reform and the environment .

And the negative attacks are not just occurring at campaign events and being reported by the media .
" It 's also raging in paid advertising on TV and radio .
Romney has spent $ 30 million on TV ads in Florida this year , " said CNN political correspondent Dana Bash .
That 's five times as much as the McCain campaign , which is now using less expensive radio commercials to directly question Romney 's credibility on the economy .
Huckabee has campaigned in Florida , but he's also spent time stumping in some of the Southern states that will vote on Super Tuesday .
Rep. Ron Paul of Texas is also concentrating on the February 5 states .

A report of a suspicious man carrying a gun on the campus of Ferrum College in Ferrum , Va. , triggered a daylong school lockdown .
The lockdown , which began around 8 a.m. , was still in effect as of 4:06 p.m. , when an alert message was sent out thanking students and employees for their patience and instructing them to continue to wait for updates from law enforcement .
Franklin County Sheriff Ewell
Hunt said the lockdown followed a report from a campus housekeeper of a man carrying a firearm at a residence hall on campus .
" At this time , no threats were made toward anybody , no incidents have occurred except the subject was seen with a firearm , " Hunt said at a news conference held jointly with Jennifer L. Braaten , the president of Ferrum College .
The man with the gun reportedly told the housekeeper to keep quiet about the weapon .
Multiple agencies responded this morning to the campus , Hunt said , where a command post was set up and authorities combed the campus and guided students to secure gathering areas .
The college is just 45 miles from the Virginia Tech campus , the site of April 's mass shooting .
The adjoining Ferrum Elementary School was also locked down as a precaution , Hunt said .
Administrators at Ferrum College sent a first text message through the campus emergency alert system at 8:13 a.m. warning students to stay indoors .
A siren was also sounded , which Braaten described as the initial signal to students that something is happening on campus .
" When we heard of this incident earlier this morning we immediately put into effect all of our procedures , " Braaten told ABC News .
At 8:43 a.m. , a second message was sent announcing that the siren had been silenced but the campus was still in a lockdown situation .
Phone numbers were also provided where students could obtain additional information .
At 9:54 a.m. , classes were canceled for the day .
At 10:30 a.m. , another message was sent indicating the campus is still on lockdown .
" In the best interest of the Ferrum College students , faculty and staff , we have put the college in a lockdown as the result of a possible situation on campus , " a woman who would only identify herself as a media relations staff member told ABC News before the press conference .
The woman insisted that there had been " no incidents " and " no injuries . "
" Authorities have been notified and are on campus and in control , " the woman said .
Ferrum College is less than an hour 's drive from Virginia Tech 's Blacksburg campus , where Seung Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty in the worst mass shooting in American history .
The lockdown comes one day after students at Northern Illinois University returned to campus after a shooting there Feb. 13 that ended with five students dead , more than a dozen injured and another campus gunman who like Cho took his own life .
Campus police at Stony Brook University on Long Island searched the campus Monday after a report of a man carrying a gun .
Police issued an all - clear at 4 p.m. and classes proceeded as normal .

Nanotubes yield the blackest black
Scientists have created the blackest material on Earth that absorbs more than 99.9 % of light and say it could one day be used to block defence signals or create highly efficient solar panels .
The substance was created from carbon nanotubes by Professor Pulickel Ajayan , of Rice University in Houston , and team whose work will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Nano Letters .
" All the light that goes in is basically absorbed , " says Ajayan .
" It is almost pushing the limit of how much light can be absorbed into one material . "
The material is almost 30 times darker than a carbon substance used by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology as the current benchmark of blackness .
And the material is close to the long - sought ideal black , which could absorb all colours of light and reflect none .
The substance has a total reflective index of 0.045 % , which is more than three times darker than the nickel - phosphorous alloy that now holds the record as the world 's darkest material .
Basic black paint , by comparison , has a reflective index of 5 % to 10 % .
The researchers are seeking a world 's darkest material designation by Guinness World Records .
But their work will likely yield more than just bragging rights .
Ajayan says the material could be used in solar energy conversion .
" You could think of a material that basically collects all the light that falls into it , " he says .
It could also could be used in infrared detection or astronomical observation , the researchers say .
Ajayan , who worked with a team at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , New York , says the material gets its blackness from three things .
First , the carbon nanotubes - tiny tubes of tightly rolled carbon that are 400 hundred times smaller than the diameter of a strand of hair - help absorb some of the light .
The nanotubes are standing on end , much like a patch of grass and light is trapped in the tiny gaps between the " blades " .
The researchers have also made the surface of this carbon nanotube carpet irregular and rough to cut down on reflectivity .
" Such a nanotube array not only reflects light weakly , but also absorbs light strongly , " says Shawn - Yu Lin , a professor of physics at Rensselaer , who helped make the substance .
The researchers have tested the material on visible light only .
Now they want to see how it fares against infrared and ultraviolet light , and other wavelengths such as radiation used in communications systems .
" If you could make materials that would block these radiations , it could have serious applications for stealth and defence , " Ajayan says .
The Indian - born Ajayan holds the 2006 Guinness World Record as co-inventor of the smallest brush in the world .
The mothers of two teenage soldiers killed in Iraq accused Tony Blair 's government of going to war " on a lie " as they took their fight for a public inquiry into the conflict to the House of Lords .
Beverly Clarke and Rose Gentle argue that ministers breached their duty to Britain 's armed forces by failing to ensure the invasion was lawful .
Trooper David Clarke , from Littleworth , Staffordshire , was killed by " friendly fire " near Basra in 2003 , while Fusilier Gordon Gentle , from Glasgow , died in a roadside bomb attack in Basra in 2004 .
Both were 19 .

The law lords yesterday began considering the mothers ' argument that servicemen and women have the right not to have their lives jeopardised in illegal conflicts .
Rabinder Singh QC , who is representing the women , told the court : " That duty is owed to soldiers who are under the unique compulsory control of the state and have to obey orders .
They have to put their lives in harm 's way if necessary because their country demands it . "
Mr Singh said the overwhelming body of legal advice received by the Government was that the invasion would not be lawful without a second UN Security Council resolution .
" These mothers ... have come to court with reluctance .
They are proud of their sons , who died with honour serving their country , " he said .
Mrs Clarke and Mrs Gentle base their argument on the legal advice prepared by Lord Goldsmith , the former attorney general , in the run-up to the war .
They say 13 pages of " equivocal " advice were reduced to one page of unequivocal advice that military action would be legal in just 10 days .
The women are challenging a Court of Appeal ruling that said the Government was not obliged to order an independent inquiry under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which protects the " right to life " .
Mrs Gentle said : " I think Tony Blair sent our boys to war on a lie .
He just agreed with George Bush right away . "
Peter Brierley , whose son , L / Cpl Shaun Brierley , was killed in 2006 , said : " This was not defending his country .
The country was not under any threat of attack . "
Lord Bingham , sitting with eight other law lords , said they were mindful of " the human loss which underlies these proceedings " .

I ’ve always wanted to travel the world , ever since I was a little girl .
I dreamt about adventures in strange lands , treasures that were to be uncovered and destinies that had to be followed .
When I turned 35 years old , the time to live my dream had finally come .
I sold my house , surrendered my responsibilities and gave away most of my possessions to follow the call of my soul .
My journey started in 2007 with an overland trip to Pakistan that was only supposed to last for a few months .
I left my hometown of Leamington Spa in England for a train trip that took me through Germany , Czech Rep ... full info
LAS VEGAS -- Eddy Buompensiero noticed eight pairs of shoes outside the door of the modest house on Mother of Pearl Street , evidence that the former owners were still living there even though the bank had foreclosed .
Mr. Buompensiero , a gray - bearded inspector for REO Asset Services - 1st Realty Group , rang the bell .
When no one answered , he taped a letter to the door offering the occupants $ 1,000 to move out .
The catch :
They wo n't get a cent if they trash the house before they leave .
" If it was me , I 'd take the money , " Mr. Buompensiero said as he drove away .
Either way , they 're " going to get thrown out in a couple of weeks . "
The stucco subdivisions of Las Vegas are caught up in the nation 's foreclosure crisis .
These days , bankers and mortgage companies often find that by the time they get the keys back , embittered homeowners have stripped out appliances , punched holes in walls , dumped paint on carpets and , as a parting gift , locked their pets inside to wreak further havoc .
Real - estate agents estimate that about half of foreclosed properties to be sold by mortgage companies nationwide have " substantial " damage , according to a new survey by Campbell Communications , a marketing and research firm based in Washington , D.C .
Teachers are to launch a campaign against military recruitment campaigns that employ " misleading propaganda " in schools .
The National Union of Teachers yesterday vowed to back any school staff who wanted to boycott recruitment campaigns by the armed forces .
The union will hold a summit of teachers , education experts and campaigners to consider the issue of military recruitment in schools after allegations that the Ministry of Defence is employing heavy - handed recruitment campaigns in schools .
The NUT is concerned that some lesson materials prepared with MoD backing undermine schools ' legal duty to present controversial issues to children in a balanced way .
Last week the NUT 's leadership revealed that it had complained to the education secretary , Ed Balls , on the issue .
One worksheet supplied by the MoD and designed by a private marketing company , Kids Connections , describes the UK 's military efforts in Iraq as mainly targeted at " helping the Iraqis to rebuild their country after the conflict and years of neglect " .
It describes the work the armed forces have done in security and reconstruction , and notes the 2005 democratic elections .
But union officials said it failed to mention the US - led invasion , Iraqi civilian deaths and the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were ever found .
The union backed a motion committing the NUT to " support teachers and schools in opposing Ministry of Defence recruitment activities that are based upon misleading propaganda " .
Paul McGarr , a delegate from east London , told the conference : " Personally I find it difficult to imagine any recruitment material that is not misleading .
Let 's just try and imagine what that recruitment material would have to say were it not to be misleading .
" We would have material from the MoD saying ' Join the army and we will send you to carry out the imperialist occupation of other people 's countries .
Join the Army and we will send you to bomb , shoot and possibly torture fellow human beings in other countries ' .
" Until then , I think that all recruitment material is misleading and should be opposed , " he said .
Brigadier Andrew Jackson , commander of the recruiting group at the MoD , said that teams representing the armed forces visited 1,000 schools a year - at the invitation of teachers .
" Their aim is to raise the general awareness of the armed forces in society , not to recruit .
We are proud of the work we do with schools and colleges to inform young people about the tremendous work and careers on offer , which can provide fantastic and unique opportunities to a wide range of people from all sectors of society , " he said .
An MoD spokesman added : " Our recruitment practices avoid ' glamorising war ' and ' propaganda ' .
Anyone considering a career in the Armed Forces is presented with clear information and all aspects of service life are discussed in detail , following a sensitive recruitment process . "
Sometime around dawn on the first day of the 1991 Gulf War , Ted Molczan was woken by a mysterious phone call .
Molczan had been up until 3:30 am in his Toronto apartment , riveted by the televised images of Tomahawk missiles raining down on Baghdad , so he was groggy when the phone rang .
A male voice with a thick accent said : " I know you 're involved in satellite tracking .
I 'm interested in doing a trade . "
The caller offered Molczan information on the orbiting patterns of a constellation of eight US satellites .
In exchange , he wanted to know the orbits for the CIA 's KH - 11 " Keyhole " satellites - from space they can discern an object as small as a softball , and they were sending US forces hi-res digital imagery of Iraq and Kuwait .
The man made no apology for the early hour and would n't say why he wanted the information .
But one thing was clear :
He had found the right guy .
Molczan , an energy conservation consultant , was just becoming known for his skill at a most unusual hobby .
In his spare time , he likes to take binoculars and a stopwatch onto the balcony of his high - rise apartment and track clandestine US spy satellites .
There are thousands of amateur satellite observers active today , but Molczan is a leader of an informal group of 20 or so who specialize in so - called black satellites , the orbits of which are not disclosed , and the existence of which is often classified .
Molczan and his band of associates monitor some 140 classified US satellites , like the Lacrosse radar imaging satellites , which can see through cloud cover and darkness and produce photo - quality images of targets on Earth .
The observers , who congregate on a Web site called Heavens - Above and a mailing list called SeeSat - L , have amassed an impressive collection of information and expertise .
For two decades , they have played a high tech game of hide - and - seek with the US 's National Reconnaissance Office , a secretive satellite agency .
By coordinating their efforts , amateur observers in Europe , North America , and South Africa monitor satellites at different phases of their journeys and extrapolate the precise dimensions of their orbits .
Astonishingly , despite the hobbyists ' modest resources - most observe part - time from their balconies and backyards with equipment available at RadioShack - they are good enough to spot almost anything the NRO , with its estimated $ 7 ébillion budget , blasts into space .
That , of course , is why the mystery caller wanted to chat .
Molczan told the man that he did n't have current information on KH - 11s because most of his fellow satellite spotters were based in the Northern Hemisphere and Keyholes were " out of season " in winter , obscured by Earth 's shadow .
" I asked , ' Well , who are you ? ' " Molczan remembers .
" He sort of laughed and said , ' Let 's just say I 'm south of you . ' "
The conversation lasted barely three minutes , but Molczan says it still haunts him .
It made him begin to think about what would happen if the information collected by those " in the hobby " ever ended up in the wrong hands .
So far that concern has n't changed the way he works .
Fifteen years after that unsettling experience , Molczan and the network have developed an almost zoological catalog of the many secret creatures that streak across the evening sky - and they 've posted everything online .
But there 's one satellite whose information Molczan says he might not disclose .
As it happens , it 's also the one he cannot find .
Since the early '90s , he has been hunting a new , supersecret breed of satellite that has become a kind of white whale for the observers and a source of considerable controversy on Capitol Hill .
Codenamed Misty , it 's a multibillion - dollar stealth photoreconnaissance device that took the CIA and the NRO a decade to develop and was designed to be untrackable by Soviet adversaries .
It began orbiting Earth in the spring of 1990 , when it prompted a high - stakes hunt that obsesses the amateurs to this day .
" It 's too overcast to see any satellites tonight , " Molczan says .
" But look over there . "
We 're standing on the balcony of the bachelor apartment he shares with two cats , Josie and Midnight , looking out over Toronto , 23 stories below .
At 52 , Molczan is a large man , 6 ' 5 '' and fleshy , with long silver - blond hair and bangs in a sharp fringe over his brow .
Moving with the exaggerated care of a giant afraid he might break things , he adjusts his Swift 11 x 80 binoculars on their massive tripod so that he can train them over Lake Ontario , which appears swallowed by mist .
" See the TV tower ? " he asks , and sure enough , as I peer through the scopes a quartet of white lights blink from the other side of the lake , where before I had seen nothing .
" That 's Hamilton , where I was born and raised .
It 's about 30 miles from here . "
Molczan is a child of the space age .
When Yuri Gagarin orbited Earth in April 1961 , Molczan 's father cut the Russian cosmonaut 's picture out of the newspaper and gave it to 7 - year - old Ted .
" I was this totally square kid , " he told me .
" The Beatles were around , but they did n't exist for me .
My life was Apollo . "
He converted his parents ' rec room into a shrine to the space program , with clippings from Life magazine and a giant map of the moon .
Even before Molczan knew the constellations by name , he knew them by sight , and he discerned in the Rorschach of the night sky his own menagerie of shapes and creatures .
" But the idea that people were going to go there , " he says to me , still a little breathless at the thought , " that was new .
I mean , it was something people had dreamed about over the centuries , but here I was , a kid , and it was happening right then . "
One evening in the summer of 1968 , just after Molczan had flunked his first year of high school , he was standing in his parents ' driveway .
He saw a brilliant satellite low in the western sky , tracing a north - to - south arc .
The object was so vivid that he thought he could recognize it if it passed by again , and he grew determined to " recover it " - work out its orbit and predict its return .
Through a series of crude calculations , Molczan figured out the duration of a single orbit and the number of degrees Earth would rotate during that period .
Guessing the longitude of the previous night 's pass , he forecasted that the satellite would traverse the sky just east of Hamilton about 15 minutes after sunset that evening .
At that exact time , Ted Molczan stepped outside and looked up .
There it was , blazing high in the southeast .
A satellite observer was born .
US spy satellites photograph targets on the ground , intercept communications , and search for signs of nuclear testing .
In the 1960s , Corona satellite images convinced US officials that they had overestimated Russia 's progress in the arms race .
During the current conflict in Iraq , US satellites have been making hourly sweeps over the region .
Traditionally , spy - in - the - sky operations are cloaked in secrecy :
Though the US has spent some $ 200 ébillion on intelligence satellites during the past four decades , the government did n't even acknowledge the NRO 's existence until 1992 .
If denying the existence of a major intelligence bureaucracy with thousands of employees commuting each day to an office park near Dulles International Airport seems like a losing proposition , a similar set of challenges besets the NRO 's efforts to keep the satellites themselves obscure .
For starters , there 's the matter of putting them into orbit :
The launch of an Atlas rocket or space shuttle from the customary sites at Vandenberg Air Force Base or Kennedy Space Center is a spectacular event , visible for miles around .
Details of many of these launches are published well in advance by Aviation Week - or Av Leak , as it's known to the hobbyists .
Furthermore , the average spy satellite is the size of a school bus and blanketed in Mylar or some other shiny thermal material that regulates its temperature .
Once in space , it tends to reflect sunlight .
" The problem is , space is transparent , " says Jeffrey Lewis , a research fellow at the University of Maryland 's Center for International and Security Studies .
" There 's no way around that . "
Depending on its size , construction , and orbit , a satellite can reflect enough light to make it visible to the unassisted eye .
Thus , even as the NRO launched black satellites hoping that Russian radar observation stations would not detect them , those same satellites were occasionally spotted by kids like Ted Molczan , or anyone else who happened to look up at the night sky .
For America , having others know the precise time its eyes will be overhead poses a huge strategic problem .
India 's nuclear tests in the Rajasthan desert in 1998 caught US intelligence unawares because the Indians had ascertained the orbits of US satellites and hid their operations accordingly .
In Afghan caves abandoned by aléQaeda , US forces recovered documents detailing the passage of spy satellites .
In 1978 , a young CIA employee named William Kampiles sold the Soviets a technical manual describing the design and operation of KH - 11s - the satellite whose orbital information Molczan 's mystery caller sought .
Kampiles was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 40 years in prison .
When Molczan was recovering his first satellite , he had little idea that , an ocean away , a fledgling group of professional and amateur observers in the UK was already monitoring the increasingly busy thoroughfares of space .
One of them was British observer Russell Eberst , who worked in the satellite tracking section of the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh .
Thirteen years older than Molczan , he has recorded more data on secret satellites than any other tracker alive .
Once the skies got crowded and the satellites began to cross one another 's paths , the US started publishing the orbits of most of its military and intelligence satellites .
Eberst and his colleagues monitored those and others for scientific research , trying to evaluate the densities of the upper atmosphere and to refine their understanding of Earth 's shape and gravitational field .
But in 1983 , the US changed the rules .
That June , the Reagan administration stopped revealing most of these orbits , hoping , unsuccessfully it turned out , to hide them from the Soviets .
But the decision had a conspicuous unintended consequence :
It " unwittingly set a challenge to the amateur network of observers , " Eberst says , " to see if they could maintain reliable orbits for these ' secret ' objects . "
Molczan insists that the hobbyists are driven not by politics but by the technical challenges of observing something hidden .
" Iérespect the right of anyone not to publish the orbital elements for their satellites , " he says .
" But they have to respect my right to try to figure out what those elements are . "
Not long after the US started covering up much of its space - based espionage program , Molczan got in touch with the UK observers ; meanwhile , the British government continued a steady shutdown of its satellite prediction service .
This left an international fraternity of highly skilled satellite trackers with time on their hands itching to find out what had just been hidden .
And with the advent of Internet bulletin boards , far - flung observers could swap notes and post their observations in real time .
The game was afoot .
On February 28 , 1990 , NASA launched the space shuttle Atlantis from Kennedy Space Center , with a top - secret payload known as USAé53 .
Aviation
Week reported the launch , and a posse of amateur observers set out to try to glimpse it , spotting the shuttle and its satellite cargo on each of its final three days in orbit .
In Scotland , Russell Eberst saw it , as did a group of observers recruited by Molczan to watch from Alaska and Canada 's Yukon and Northwest territories .
Aviation
Week said that the payload was a large digital - imaging reconnaissance satellite ; the observers assumed it was similar to a Keyhole .
But when they spotted the satellite itself , they noted that it was unusually bright , giving them their first hint that they were onto something very special .
On March 16 , Soviet media reported an explosion associated with USA 53 and said that pieces of debris had been detected in orbit .
On several mornings following this news , Molczan stood for hours on the roof of his high - rise , scanning the horizon for the satellite .
" Iéfroze my butt off , " he recalls .
" But I did n't see it . "
What the observers did not know is that the shuttle 's cargo was n't just another KH - 11 .
It was a new class of stealth satellite codenamed Misty and designed to orbit undetected .
In fact , Jeffrey Richelson , a senior fellow at the National Security Archive , suggests that the " explosion " may have been a ruse to throw the Russians off the scent and allow the satellite to vanish .
To the observers , the idea that USA 53 could be a stealth satellite was laughable , because it had been so conspicuously bright .
But they saw it only briefly after its launch , and it was n't found again until October , when Eberst noticed a very bright object in an unfamiliar orbit over Edinburgh .
He spoke to Pierre Neirinck , an observer in France who had seen a similar unknown entity .
Neirinck then checked the path of the mystery object against the orbits of hundreds of nonsecret satellites , but he found no match .
The satellite sleuths have no official organization or meetings , and their revelations are often based on this sort of casual interaction - a phone call or email describing some odd occurrence , the swapping of notes and interpretations .
Using their combined observations , Neirinck worked up a preliminary orbit and asked his fellow observers to check it against their lists of objects they had observed but could not identify .
When Molczan went back and compared the mystery orbit to the trajectory of the satellite launched in February , he realized that the unknown object that Eberst and Neirinck had seen was none other than USA 53 .
The amateurs were eager to get another look , but bad weather prevented observation for the next two days .
If left undisturbed at high altitude , a satellite will continue its orbit for thousands of years .
According to Desmond King - Hele , the author of several books on satellite spotting , if nuclear war ever destroyed civilization , " satellites would remain circling a devastated planet , relics of the advanced technology that led to our downfall . "
In other words , satellites do not just disappear .
Over the years , the network of observers has kept an eye out for Misty , but none so diligently - perhaps obsessively - as Ted Molczan .
Even after Misty " disappeared , " Eberst likely spotted it again on three occasions in the late '90s , though it was very faint , even through binoculars .
He was n't sure what the object was ; Molczan ID 'd it as Misty .
Many experts also believe that a satellite launched in 1999 , known as USA 144 but unspotted so far , is a second - gen version of Misty .
For the observers , especially Molczan , finding Misty or its successor has taken on an almost mythological significance .
In fact , in the 15 éyears he 's been scanning the heavens for it , Molczan and some of his colleagues have developed a theory : Misty is n't just hiding - it 's hiding from them .
Molczan 's imagination may have gotten the better of him after his long search , but stealth technology of the sort deployed by aircraft and satellites does indeed work by specific targeting :
Objects do n't become completely invisible ; they reorient themselves so they can't be seen from certain vantage points .
Misty likely deflects the sun 's rays to make itself imperceptible from a particular location on Earth .
" They know where we live , " Molczan says excitedly .
He believes that when it was originally launched into orbit , the satellite was programmed to be invisible to the Soviets , but the National Reconnaissance Office failed to take the hobbyists into account .
Molczan is convinced that after reports of the observers ' USA 53 sightings , the satellite was reprogrammed with the coordinates of every area where skilled hobbyists live .
It sounds implausible , and he can't prove it , but to Molczan it 's the only reasonable explanation .
So why did n't Molczan or Eberst or Neirinck just pack binoculars on a trip to the South Pacific ?
" The vacation would have to be fairly long , " Molczan replies .
" Say , 3 to 12 months . "
Satellites are generally visible only for a few minutes a night , and a trustworthy identification requires multiple rigorous observations .
It ca n't be achieved with data gathered during a week in the sun .
One person who is convinced of Molczan 's theory is Allen Thomson , a well - respected former CIA analyst who has followed the observers ' work for years .
With stealth you " very much have to aim , " he says .
" Once they realized there were observers in Scotland and Toronto and wherever , they basically reprogrammed . "
In late 2004 , a fierce closed - door debate on Capitol Hill burst into the open .
Several senators announced publicly that they believed Congress was frittering away precious budget dollars on a proposed new version of Misty .
At $ 9.5 billion , it was likely the largest item in the intelligence budget .
While being careful not to mention the codename or specific nature of the project , US senator Ron Wyden ( D - Oregon ) , described the new satellite as " unnecessary , ineffective , overbudget , and too expensive . "
Part of the reason for the apparent ineffectiveness , of course , is the skill of the satellite sleuths .
Even if the observers do not currently have a bead on Misty , the fact that they have seen it and continue to look for it - and have posted info on pretty much everything else - raises questions about the efficacy and expense of stealth technology in space .
" It 's not an encouraging data point that these dudes could find the damn thing , " observes the University of Maryland 's Lewis .
Not surprisingly , the intelligence community is n't happy with the amateur observers .
" If we had our druthers , we would prefer that these things not end up on the Internet , " says Rick Oborn , an NRO spokesperson .
" It 's no secret that other countries stop doing what they 're doing when the satellites are overhead . "
Several years ago , then - senator Bob Kerrey ( D - Nebraska ) went a step further when he suggested that hobbyists who publish spy - sat information online are supporting terrorists .
For a short time after September 11 , some hobbyists stopped posting the orbital elements for military satellites .
But today the general feeling is that amateur observation is ultimately just that - something anyone could pick up .
National governments could do it easily with their sophisticated radar tracking operations .
Terrorists could make their own observations with a pair of binoculars and highéschool math skills .
According to this line of reasoning , the amateurs might even be doing the agencies a favor .
" That watchdog element is something to be grateful for as a US taxpayer , " says Theresa Hitchens , director of the Center for Defense Information , pointing out that if hobbyists can see a spy satellite , the bad guys can too .
If observers do spot Misty 2.0 , Molczan wonders whether they should " let the world know we found it " but withhold exact information about its movement .
He concedes that the observers will probably go ahead and publish whatever information they gather on Misty or any other spy satellite : " Generally , if we see it , it goes up there . "
But he likes the idea of withholding the Misty elements as a gesture of good faith , a sign that , despite the stakes , to the hobbyists it 's still just a hobby .
" There are people who build ships in bottles , " Molczan says with a shrug and a smile .
" I have no idea why .
But they probably enjoy it . "
How to Track a Black Bird
Step 1 : Start Your Browser
Heavens - Above.com lists orbit patterns for thousands of satellites , including the clandestine ones followed by amateur observers .
Enter the name of a particular satellite or city , and the site will tell you where and when to look .
Step 2 : Pick a Target
Choose something bright , like Lacrosse radar - imaging satellites .
Their distinctive orange hue is bright enough to see with the naked eye , even in places where city lights drown out the night sky .
Step 3 : Grab Your Binoculars
The best times for observing are just after twilight and just before dawn .
Fix your gaze on the region through which the satellite is predicted to pass and look for a constant ( not blinking ) light moving slower than a shooting star .
Step 4 : Take Careful Notes
Find sets of stars to serve as imaginary start and finish lines perpendicular to the trajectory of the object .
Precisely time how long the satellite takes to pass from one line to the other .
Use multiple observations to roughly determine orbit .

Gay couple ?
Well , scratch Florida off your list of possible vacation options .
But just as they were about to depart on the cruise from Miami , Florida .
Pond , a healthy 39 - year - old , suddenly collapsed .
She was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami with Langbehn and the children following close behind .
But once Langbehn and the children arrived at the hospital the hospital refused to accept information from her about Pondss medical history .
Langbehn says she was informed that she was in an antigay city and state , and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as family .
A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery .
Other than one five minute visit , which was orchestrated by a Catholic priest at Langbehns request to perform last rites , and despite the doctors acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation , neither she nor her children were allowed to see Pond until nearly eight hours after their arrival .
Soon after Ponds death , Langbehn tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children .
She was denied both by the State of Florida and the Dade County Medical Examiner .
This newspaper reported recently that Bill Gates hates my ideas .
I have no hurt feelings , at least nothing that months of intensive psychotherapy can't cure .
Mr. Gates , after all , has allied himself with the foreign aid establishment .
This establishment is notoriously sensitive to criticism from people like me , who find no evidence that the aid industry 's grand schemes are actually lifting anyone out of poverty .
Mr. Gates has now put forward his own scheme -- " creative capitalism " -- in a speech at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos .
He argues that today 's capitalism does not benefit the poor .
For Mr. Gates , regular capitalism works " only on behalf of those who can pay . "
While entrepreneurs fall all over themselves trying to meet the needs of the rich , " the financial incentive to serve [ the poor is ] zero . "
As a result , basic needs such as food and medicine go unmet .
Mr. Gates seems to believe that the solution is to persuade for - profit companies to meet the poor 's needs by boosting the " recognition " of corporate philanthropy .
But the dossier of historical evidence to suggest this would work is as thin as Kate Moss on a diet .
First of all , the recognition motive has proven to be awfully weak compared to the profit motive .
Otherwise we would have had a lot more than the $ 5.1 billion of annual American corporate philanthropy to the Third World ( as of 2005 , which has the most recent reliable figures ) .
That was four one - hundredths of 1 % of the $ 12.4 trillion of U.S. production for the free market .
Is it really the poor 's only hope that the Gap will donate a few pennies per sexy T - shirt for AIDS treatment in Africa ?
Profit - motivated capitalism , on the other hand , has done wonders for poor workers .
Self - interested capitalist factory owners buy machines that increase production , and thus profits .
Capitalists search for technological breakthroughs that make it possible to get more output for the same amount of input .
Working with more machinery and better technology , workers produce more output per hour .
In a competitive labor market , the demand for these more productive workers increases , driving up their wages .
The steady increase in wages for unskilled labor lifts the workers out of poverty .
The number of poor people who can't afford food for their children is a lot smaller than it used to be -- thanks to capitalism .
Capitalism did n't create malnutrition , it reduced it .
The globalization of capitalism from 1950 to the present has increased annual average income in the world to $ 7,000 from $ 2,000 .
Contrary to popular legend , poor countries grew at about the same rate as the rich ones .
This growth gave us the greatest mass exit from poverty in world history .
" If you love wealth more than liberty , the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom , depart from us in peace .
We ask not your counsel nor your arms .
Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you .
May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen . "
Samuel Adams , ( 1722-1803 )
A blog on various computer science topics that interests me .
The king of the gossip blogs is holding out on me .
' Where did you get the video ? '
' It had been hanging around for a while . '
' How do you mean " hanging around " ?
Someone must have given it to you .'
' It was sort of out there . '
Nick Denton is smiling , which is understandable .
The video in question features Tom Cruise extolling the virtues of Scientology and is both compulsive viewing and buttock - clenchingly embarrassing .
' We are the authorities on getting people off drugs , ' the Hollywood A - lister tells his Scientologist interviewer .
' We can rehabilitate criminals ... we can bring peace and unite cultures . '
Denton posted it on his media - gossip blog Gawker.com in the middle of January , and it swiftly became headline news around the world .
The Scientologists did everything they could to repress it , of course , forcing YouTube to take it down and throwing out legal letters claiming copyright like they were confetti .
Denton refused to be cowed .
' It 's newsworthy , ' Denton wrote .
' And we will not be removing it . '
Since then the nine - minute sequence - look at those teeth !
Listen to that laugh !
- has been viewed more than 2.5 m times .
It has driven huge volumes of traffic both to Gawker and the dozen or so other smart , sassy blogs that Denton owns , sites which cover everything from the LA film business through travel and sport to porn and politics .
In January , New York - based Gawker Media racked up nearly a quarter of a billion page views , making it the fourth most - visited set of sites when compared against the big US newspapers .
It was even ahead of the Los Angeles Times .
That can only mean one thing : bigger advertising revenues for the company .
In turn it has secured Denton 's reputation as soothsayer and seer on all things net , the go - to guy for predictions on the future of the online world by everybody from Rupert Murdoch to the Telegraph Group .
Advertising
Age has called him an ' industry leader ' ; New York magazine has credited his sites with establishing the ' de facto voice of blogs today ' .
Which is why I want to know where he got the video .
And perhaps I would by now if this interview were not hampered by what can only be described as a container - ship load of personal baggage .
Because while Denton may be new news to some , he 's very old news to me .
We have been friends for nearly 25 years , since we first met as 16 - year - old public schoolboys on the northwest London party circuit .
Almost all my trips to New York over the past few years have begun with a catch - up here in his impeccable Soho loft , all high white walls and stripped floorboards and sofas to die for .
He moved to Manhattan at the start of the decade after leaving another internet venture .
Back then , I asked what he planned to do next .
He gave me a long speech about something called ' web logs ' , or ' blogs ' for short .
Blogging , he said , was the future .
It would free the net , turn it from something people merely looked at into something to which they contributed .
Ordinary people would publish their thoughts and observations , not just journalists .
I had laughed at him .
Who , I asked , wants to read what ordinary people have to say ?
How many of them can actually write ?
Sure , he 'd been spot on before .
Following a career in journalism , Denton had already made a small fortune from other internet businesses .
This time though , I told him , he was wrong .
If he pursued this one he could only lose money .
Weirdly , he chose not to listen to me .
In August 2002 he launched a blog called Gizmodo.com , which gives the inside scoop on new gadgets before the print media has even managed to get the toys out of the box .
As a publishing model it was simplicity itself .
He found an amateur blogger with a sharp , snarky voice that he liked , paid them a modest salary to carry on doing in their bedrooms what they had previously been doing for free , and supplied the technical support to keep it running .
In December 2002 he followed that with Gawker , covering the New York media world .
It was initially written by a young woman called Elizabeth Spiers who , in 12 posts a day covering everything from a Tina Brown memo to the latest hiring and firings at the New York Times , perfected a gloriously sharp , nose - against - the - glass outsider take on the big wheels of Manhattan 's press and publishing worlds .
It was a big hit , a refuge for the city 's creative underclass - the assistants and secretaries and wannabes who needed a reason to get up in the morning .
Other sites followed and so , eventually , did the all - important ad revenue .
Last year Denton made his first appearance in the Sunday Times Rich List , at number 502 .
He was valued at £ 140 m .
As one of our mutual friends put it : ' Even if they 've overstated his wealth by a factor of 10 , Nick is still a hell of a lot richer than you or me . '
And now I have to work out what makes him tick , which is easier said than done .
The king of the gossip blogs is addicted to full disclosure , unless it happens to be about himself .
A chilly Friday morning on Spring Street in New York 's Soho , and Nick - I can't keep calling him Denton - is dragging me into Balthazar , the hip faux - French brasserie across from his apartment , for breakfast .
There are queues by the door , but we do n't have to wait .
They know him here ; he's now the outsider as insider , the anti-establishment figure who made it beyond the velvet rope by simply being unignorable .
Nick has suggested talking here rather than in his apartment because up there , waiting for him , is his Macbook and he wo n't be able to keep his eyes off it .
At the beginning of the year , after a series of resignations from his staff and media stories about unrest over a new payment system , Nick took over editing Gawker.com himself for the first time .
It is a major job .
From the days when it was just one woman in her bedroom knocking out a dozen posts a day , Gawker has spawned a staff of six reporters , including one in San Francisco to cover nights , generating more than 60 posts among them every 24 hours .
The other 14 sites are similar - sized operations backed up by technical people and ad sales teams .
In all there are around 130 people earning their income from Gawker Media - they keep track of each other through a Facebook group , what else ? - and they are in the process of opening a new office a short walk from Nick 's apartment , with 60 workstations and various meeting rooms .
It 's the end of a busy week for Gawker .
But then it 's always a busy week for Gawker .
These past few days they 've been taking the piss out of how the New York Times staff canteen is celebrating Black History Month - chocolate and watermelon on the menu , news of which was leaked to them by an anonymous staffer - tracking Naomi Campbell 's antics in Rio , and splurging on the cult of Barack Obama and the way it is being reflected by his celebrity supporters .
Chief among those ways is a video by Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas , set to one of Obama 's inspirational speeches .
' Things like this are so cliche , ' Gawker announces , ' that thinking they 're a cliche is a cliche . '
That one sentence captures the Gawker tone perfectly : sharp , world - weary , unimpressable .
Nick 's own relationship with the site is complicated .
He 's proud of it , but worries about the attention it receives , if only for business reasons .
' It irritates me that everybody concentrates on Gawker , because it 's just one of 15 sites and it does n't even get the most traffic .
It 's a significant site , but it 's not what we are . '
Perhaps not , but it has the most significant readership .
If it turns up on Gawker the people who edit America 's magazines , newspapers and books know about it , though they claim not to read it .
As a result the bitchy commentary runs both ways .
When there is a perceived change in Gawker they let Nick know about it .
Over the past couple of months there have been a series of high - profile articles accusing the site of heading downmarket towards the scatological .
New York magazine published a piece accusing it of having gone from knowing and smart to bitchy and vile .
Then the New York Times weighed in with accusations that it had lost touch with its core audience and was no longer a must - read .
The main problem , they all said , was a new payment system .
The days of the $ 12 - per - post pay packet had gone .
Gawker Media now pays proper salaries , often to established media people rather than bedroom bloggers .
This year they have also started paying bloggers by page views .
The monthly salary is an advance against a payment of $ 7.50 per 1,000 page views .
Advertising
Age promptly accused the Gawker group of ' pandering to the lowest common denominator ' .
It was an accusation that was hard to deny given a leaked internal memo from the company which admitted that paying per page views ' can overstate the value of cheap items with superficial appeal but which damage a site 's reputation .
Nevertheless it 's the best measure we have so we 're going to use it . '
It 's easy to see how it could work for the bloggers themselves .
The Cruise video's seven - figure viewing numbers would have netted the originator more than $ 20,000 for the month ( though , as it was Nick himself , the company did n't pay out ) .
For his part Nick describes it simply as the book publishing model and something that would have happened anyway .
' In print journalism you can't measure the success of each piece , but we can .
If you can measure , why would n't you want to pay people accordingly ? '
What about accusations that the site has become nastier ?
For example , he was accused recently of targeting people , such as the relatively unknown twentysomething daughter of New York publishing mogul Steve Brill , who are private individuals and do n't deserve the attention .
Gawker had posted an item mocking Emily Brill 's Facebook profile , and the photographs of her newly svelte self that she had put up .
From the outside it looked like victimisation for the sake of it : rich man 's daughter loses weight and is pleased with herself .
Denton snorts disdainfully .
' That 's bullshit , ' he says .
' The site 's always been seen as bitchy and nasty .
I do n't try to dress up these stories as having a noble purpose .
Occasionally , like the Scientology video , they may do , but that 's not the point . '
Nick , now 41 , was born and brought up in north London , the son of a Hungarian Jewish emigre mother and a Yorkshire - born economist father .
He went to the fee- paying University College School in Hampstead , whose pupils represented every cliche of the bookish , liberal , self - consciously cosmopolitan corner of London in which it was situated .
According to his schoolfriend and , later , internet co-conspirator Dave Galbraith , he had a Machiavellian streak even then .
' I was lousy at sport , ' Galbraith says now .
' But I 'd managed to avoid being bullied for it by being the joker .
Nick said he'd be friends with me because I knew lots of people . '
I ask Dave if he always knew Nick would be a success .
' The last time I was asked this by a newspaper I said I knew Nick was going to be successful because he read The Economist when he was 13 .
When [ that comment ] was published Nick phoned me up and took the piss out of me for it , said it made me sound suburban .
So this time I 'm going to say it 's a fucking miracle he ever amounted to anything . '
There was something distinctly calculating about Nick .
He was famous for not committing to a Friday - or Saturday - night plan unless he could be certain that he had alighted upon the best option .
As a result , if you ended up at the same bar or party as him , you were left with the sense you were in the right place , which was both reassuring and profoundly irritating .
Not that he was vastly gregarious .
Tall , with a large domed head , he was more a genial presence than at the heart of things .
We knew then that Nick was gay , though he did n't come out until university , and waited until his thirties to tell his parents .
Today he is happily cohabiting with Doug , an artist , and is matter of fact about his preferences .
When I suggest his sexuality simply adds to the notion of him as outsider , he shrugs - he does a lot of shrugging - and says : ' It 's the easy cliche , but it may be true . '
At Oxford he prospered in student journalism before returning to London , where he thought he'd ' walk into a high - profile media job ' .
When he found himself working for the Economist Group , editing dull texts , he decided his life had taken a wrong turn , packed up his car and headed in the summer of 1989 to his mother 's native Hungary , where he had spent his gap year .
He was there for the fall of the Berlin wall and soon picked up small reporting jobs .
At Christmas 1989 the local man for the Telegraph asked Nick if he would cover for him while he returned home .
Which meant that when the Romanian revolution happened and refugees started pouring over the border , Nick was there .
His first major article was a front - page splash in the Telegraph .
Soon afterwards he was put on contract by the Financial Times to report from Budapest , and stayed for a few years reporting on the new Europe .
Even then , in the early Nineties , he was intrigued by the net .
' Once a month as a treat I would take the train to Vienna to eat sushi , buy porn and pick up the latest copy of Wired . '
Shall I mention the porn ?
' I do n't care .
I would always try to avoid ripping off the wrappers before I got back to Budapest , but I could never resist . '
What ?
Of the porn ?
' No , Wired .
It seemed like a magazine beamed in from the future . '
And then , self - mockingly he says : ' I had a vision of a future where journalistic information would be online and available all the time . '
It 's a knowing gag .
He detests being labelled as a visionary , though mostly , he once wrote , because visionaries tend to be poor at executing ideas .
For his part he puts his uncanny sense for where the net is going down to ' having spent eight to 10 hours a day online for most of my adult life ' .
Eventually he returned to London to cover investment banking , and was the lead reporter on the collapse of Barings Bank , breaking the story about the secret 8888 account where rogue trader Nick Leeson had hidden his losses .
I ask him if that experience as a journalist informed what he does now .
' I do n't know , ' he says , helpfully .
' I 'm not very reflective . '
In 1996 he started writing about the internet , which in turn led to a move to San Francisco to report on the machinations of Silicon Valley .
It was a frustrating posting .
' The deadlines were horrible and the FT had no prestige there . '
Inevitably , he concluded that he would have more fun on the business side rather than reporting on it .
In 1998 he quit the FT , determined to start his own internet venture .
His interests took him in two directions .
He was intrigued by sites that linked to information on others , and wanted to create a way of aggregating news headlines from across the old media sites that were going on to the web .
He turned to his old schoolfriend Dave Galbraith who , though now trained as an architect , had been writing software for years .
Together with another mutual schoolfriend , Angus Bankes , they would come up with the software to support Moreover.com .
The idea was fiendishly simple .
Moreover offered an application that harvested headlines from news sites according to specific criteria .
So if you had a website dedicated to , say , deep - sea fishing or ballroom dancing , Moreover would provide your home page with a regularly and automatically updated set of headlines from the worlds of deep - sea fishing or ballroom dancing .
It made static , unchanging websites look dynamic and up to the minute .
In the days before blogging went global it was revolutionary .
Before that , Nick started pursuing another idea straight out of Silicon Valley : parties where budding internet entrepreneurs could be introduced to backers .
Back in London he helped found First Tuesday , named after the day of the month upon which their parties would be held .
In its short life , it would become a phenomenon , a poster child for the internet boom .
' First Tuesday was n't intended to be a business , ' he says now .
' We wanted to raise our profiles and find a way of getting to know investors without knocking on doors . '
Soon though , as the internet bubble of the Nineties expanded , investors were banging on the door just to sponsor the parties .
It would eventually spread to 60 countries and , in July 2000 , was sold to an Israeli investment firm for $ 50 m .
At the same time , backed with $ 20 m from Steve Newhouse , scion of the family that owns Conde Nast , Moreover had also become established .
But while the company did well , Nick was unhappy .
Ahead of the curve , he had set up a deal to buy Blogger , the self - publishing platform that would help launch the blogging revolution , for $ 3 m .
The Moreover board did n't see what all the fuss was about and blocked the deal .
( Today , Blogger is estimated to be worth north of $ 100 m . )
Nick stepped back from the company .
' Moreover had been a grand plan , ' he says now .
' And I told myself that I would never do another one of those .
I would only do things that came naturally . '
His notion of publishing blogs was not , he says now , a big idea for a big company .
It was just something he had the money to back and which amused him .
So when did it become serious ?
He thinks .
' When the editorial budget per month topped $ 100,000 . '
Friday lunchtime and time for the weekly management meeting .
Soon these will take place in the new Gawker headquarters , but for now it 's Nick and a few of the guys around the cooking island in the kitchen of his loft .
Ted Plunkett , the tech guy who keeps the sites up and running , rips away at a sandwich .
' We actually own our servers , which means we decide what stays up , ' he tells me .
' That 's why we did n't have to remove the Tom Cruise video .
There 's no service provider telling us what to do . '
For a while they talk budgets .
Noah Robischon , the managing editor , describes the editorial spend for January , and while it 's keeping to six figures it 's a long way beyond $ 100,000 .
But then they had a good month : not just the Tom Cruise story , but the death of Heath Ledger , and over at Gizmodo a big story from the Macworld exhibition .
Nick suggests they start thinking about selling a couple of their sites and perhaps launching a new one .
He says he 's keen on doing a gay site , but it 's clear this is all about business rather than something he would like to see as a consumer .
' It 's a nice sector because it 's fragmented .
There 's not much out there . '
His colleagues agree .
As they talk it becomes clear that it 's easy to misunderstand Gawker Media .
It looks like a new tech company , all slacker jeans and trainers and meetings on the fly .
But in truth it 's as hard nosed as it comes .
It 's built on old media principles and becoming more so .
It 's about editorial niches .
It 's about dollars and cents .
Afterwards , Nick agrees .
' When it comes to what succeeds on the web it 's exactly what British newspapers have been doing well for years . '
It is , he says , why Gawker and its brethren would never have succeeded here .
Our print media is already bitchy , sharp and stroppy .
US print media is very much more restrained , mortgaged to its sense of itself as a noble calling , creating a perfect opportunity for Nick and his bloggers to sneak in and blow electronic raspberries .
He accepts , however , that what they do has changed .
Once upon a time his blogs merely pointed at things and made smart - arse comments about them .
' Now there 's loads of that on the web , ' he says , ' and what 's missing is substance .
Everybody is looking for something to link to .'
The reality is that traffic is built by being the news rather than merely commenting on it .
Which is why the Cruise video was so important .
He eventually tells me that it came to him from a Hollywood journalist who had been working ' in league ' with the British writer Andrew Morton , who has recently published a big unauthorised biography of Tom Cruise .
Others had the tape , but did n't post it , perhaps wary of the litigiousness of the Scientologists .
' The rule is whoever has it first wins , so I rushed to put it up . '
Did n't he worry about the response from the Scientologists ?
A cue for one of his shrugs .
' I 've never been burnt by a story .
Maybe one day I will be and I 'll learn fear of hot objects . '
The first time the importance of news became obvious was in November 2003 when he started Fleshbot , a porn blog written in a knowing and jolly rather than pervy voice ( Nick , ever eager to distance himself from the slightest whiff of respectability , says he came up with it because he wanted to be able to find his porn of choice ) .
They launched with the Paris Hilton sex tape , which put them on the map from day one .
In March 2005 , they got another hit when they updated a long - standing feature on Gawker called Gawker Stalker , in which readers emailed in sightings of celebrities .
Now they 've hooked the sightings up to Google Maps , theoretically providing a graphic of where celebrities are in real time .
Hollywood PRs were furious , calling it a ' stalker 's charter ' .
George Clooney even called on fans to send in fake sightings .
' A couple of hundred conflicting sightings and this website is worthless , ' he said .
The then editor of Gawker , Jessica Coen , merely laughed .
Even in this wired age it took a while to get these things up online , she said , ' and celebrities are n't trees .
They do move .'
The future , Nick says , lies with what he calls iterative reporting , in which posts are used to request information and to help stand up stories .
' As a print journalist , if you hear a rumour you try to stand it up and if you can't the story dies , ' he says .
' With a blog you can throw the rumour out there and ask for help .
You can say : " We do n't know if this is true or not . " '
What about libel ?
' We just have to make sure we 're not doing it maliciously and that we also admit when we 're wrong .
Personally , as a print journalist , I always found the most interesting stories to be the ones hacks talked about in the bar after work .
Those are the ones we deal in . '
He goes further , talking about how he wants his readers to be the source of stories , how they 'll split page - view bonuses with them if the story runs .
' I want to institutionalise and automate chequebook journalism . '
Nick is in his element talking about this stuff .
He could talk about it until his and your eyes glaze over .
He 's done it to me often enough .
The more personal information is trickier .
He refuses to be drawn on how much he is really worth save that the Sunday Times Rich List figure is ' way out ' .
( He does direct me to a tech - industry site which calculates the Gawker Media yearly revenue at just over $ 12 m .
That calculation , Nick says , ' is not absurd ' . )
As we say our goodbyes , he returns to studying the enormous news feed on the computer screen before him : the pixelated stream of who 's been doing what to whom and who might or might not be making money out of it ; the stories about double - dealing celebrities and the people who manage them ; the endless , comforting cyber gush of information .
Creativity seems to never run out .
This time , we 'll see the incredible use of shadows in advertising .
Some of these are really clever , and I enjoy trying to figure out how the heck these guys came up with such great ads .
100 % creative .
Awesome !

I got a good chuckle .
Liked the video as much as the next person .
But come on guys .
If by showing , via a scripted video , that , even though you are one of the most powerful men in the world , you are still a personable dude with a sense of humor , and not afraid to venture into self deprecating humor here and there makes you cool , well then , that makes our favorite Mr. President George Bush one helluva cool motherfucker .
I can't take credit for this one .
It was suggested to me electronically by a patriotic American who had a fantastic idea that we should set aside a day and a precise time when we " vent " our outrage with these Bush / fascist / elite pigs with noise , noise , and more noise .
It would be a STATEMENT , hopefully orchestrated all over the country that at , say 12:00 noon ( adjusting for time zones ) we give them hell with all the noise making we can come up with .
Car horns , perhaps , most of all , but ANYTHING that would make an obnoxious noise would be welcome .
The fascist pigs , the press ( what 's left of it ) , and even the WORLD would almost certainly take note that this patriotic expression is just one way Americans are showing their solidarity , unity , and rage .
Would it magically change anything politically ?
Who knows , but it would certainly be a heads up to our spineless Democratic Congress ( who 's got the barf bag ? ) that liberals , progressive , moderates , and independents are bloody well out here in the millions .
Indeed , the " good " it would do would probably be more as a warning to the Republican Democrats ( e.g. , Hillary Clinton -- you know , the one with " corporate spy " stamped on her forehead ) than it would effect the Bush neo -Nazis .
Anyway , at this stage , let 's just say this is a probe with the hope the many , many of you will respond with suggestions as to the logistics and timing such a " patriotic event vent " .
It 's seems like a terrific idea to me and maybe many of you think likewise and if so we need to get something set and then NETWORK LIKE CRAZY -- including broadcasting the exact timing the two minutes ( more , less ? ) in as many medias as we can muster .
Much of its appeal is that it's a very simple and yet emphatic way to make a statement IN SPITE OF THE JUDAS MEDIA .
So , in the spirit of a town hall meeting , what do you folks think ?
Can we make this fly ?
The timing so close to the election should also be factored into this as everyone would know this would be a progressive / liberal call to political arms .
And at this stage , ANYTHING which could help save our country and planet from these evil elite vampires we dare not pass up .
Waiting for your response and suggestions , and hoping this will stir up cross currents of dialog that are totally not limited to this piece .

As a number of Op Ed readers attacked the credentials of authorities Leuren Moret and Doug Rokke cited in my previous article on radioactive ammunition , here are a few more authorities that support their view the U.S. , Great Britain and Israel are turning the Middle East into a slice of radioactive hell .
There ’s a ton of data about this on the Internet for the skeptics : from sources such as the 1999 report of the International Atomic Energy Commission to oncologist members of England ’s Royal Society of Physicians to VA hospital nuclear medicine doctors to officials at the Basra maternity and pediatric hospital to reporter Scott Peterson of the Christian Science Monitor .
Peterson used a Geiger counter in August , 2003 to find radiation readings between 1,000 and 1,900 times normal where bunker buster bombs and munitions had exploded near Baghdad .
After all , a typical bunker bomb is said to contain more than a ton of depleted uranium .
For a concise overview on radioactive warfare , read “ DU And The Liberation of Iraq ” by Christian Scherrer , a researcher at the Hiroshima Peace Institute , published on Znet on April 13 , 2003 .
Scherrer states : “ Based on the report of the 48th meeting issued by the UN Committee dealing with effects of Atomic radiation on 20th April 1999 , noting the rapid increase in mortality caused by DU between 1991 and 1997 , the IAEA document predicted the death of half a million Iraqis , noting that …’ some 700 - 800 tons of depleted uranium was used in bombing the military zones south of Iraq .
Such a quantity has a radiation effect , sufficient to cause 500,000 cases which may lead to death . ”
Scherrer writes ,
“ In 1991 the DU ammunition was mainly used against Iraqi tanks in the desert near Basra , while in the present war DU is being used all over Iraq , even in densely populated areas including the heart of Baghdad , Mosul , Tikrit and other cities . ”
He adds that , based on IAEA estimates and his previous research , “ the death toll may surpass a million deaths over the next few years , with more to follow ! ”
Scherrer notes , incidentally , the UN ’s Human Rights Commission back in 1996 declared DU a weapon of mass destruction ( WMD ) and that those who use it are guilty of a crime against humanity .
Among its users : the first President Bush , President Bill Clinton , who irradiated the Balkans , and the current occupant of the White House .
Now let ’s hear it from Iraqi doctors : Oncologist Dr. Jawad Al - Ali of Basra Hospital and Professor Husam al - Jarmokly of Baghdad University “ showed a rapidly increasing death toll in Iraq since 1991 due to cancer and leukemia caused by U.S. radiological warfare , ” Scherrer writes , based on their presentation of December 1 , 2002 at the Peace Memorial Hall in Hiroshima .
Al - Ali , who is also a member of England ’s Royal Society of Physicians , is quoted in Feb.
5 , 2001 , “ CounterPunch ” as stating , “ The desert dust carries death .
Our studies indicate that more than 40 % of the population around Basra will get cancer .
We are living through another Hiroshima . ” ( Basra is a city of 1.7 million .
Does that mean 680,000 people will be stricken ? )
The same article also reported since 1990 , the incident rate of leukemia in Iraq has grown by more than 600 percent and , similarly , “ The leukemia rate in Sarajevo , pummeled by American bombs in 1996 , has tripled in the last five years ” and “ NATO and UN peacekeepers in the region are also coming down with cancer . ”
Dr. Zenad Mohammed , employed in the maternity department of the Basra teaching hospital , said in the three - months beginning in August , 1998 , 10 babies were born with no heads , eight with abnormally large heads and six with deformed limbs , according to a report on World Socialist Web Site of September 8 , 1999 .
And the British Guardian newspaper reported Basra maternity reported cancer cases shot up from 80 in 1990 to 380 in 1997 .
Reporter Phil Gardner quotes Dr. Basma Al Asam , a gynecologist , at Al Manoon hospital , Baghdad , stating : “ I ’ve been watching this for seven years now and it ’s increasing .
We ’re not just seeing babies born with congenital abnormalities , but very late spontaneous abortions because of congenital defects .
In the past we used to see , maybe , one a month .
Now it is two or three cases per day . ”
( Two to three cases a day , h - m - m -m , does that equal about 1,000 a year at this one hospital ? )
And from an American doctor : Colonel Asaf Durakovic , formerly chief of nuclear medicine at the VA hospital in Wilmington , Del. , said he found uranium isotopes in the bodies of Persian Gulf War veterans .
The New York Times reported on January 29 , 2001 , Dr. Durakovic said he found “ depleted uranium , including uranium 236 , in 62 percent of the sick gulf war veterans he examined .
He believes that particles lodged in their bodies and may be the cause of their illness . ”
Once inhaled , Dr. Durakovic noted , “ uranium can get into the bloodstream , be carried to bone , lymph nodes , lungs or kidneys , lodge there , and cause damage when it emits low - level radiation over a long period , ” the Times reported .
The Times article also called attention to the cancer deaths of 24 European soldiers that served as peacekeepers in the Balkans “ and the illnesses reported by many others . ”
And from a U.S. researcher : Roberto Gwiazda , of the environmental toxicology department at the University of California Santa Cruz , was the lead researcher examining returned Gulf War veterans that had radioactive shrapnel wounds .
The university ’s “ City On A Hill Press ” newspaper quotes him as saying , “ Of those with radioactive shrapnel wounds , all had significant levels of uranium in their urine seven to nine years after the explosion .
Of those who only inhaled the incendiary uranium , a statistically significant number also had high uranium levels . ”
And from U.S. veterans : Tom Cassidy , of the 1st Cavalry Division who saw service in Iraq in 2003 - 05 : “ After the first gulf war , the level of radiation was 300 times what is considered normal .
In this invasion we used even more DU bullets .
The effects there are horrible , ” he told the UCSC paper .
Added Dennis Kyne , from the U.S. Army ’s 18th Airborne division and Desert Storm veteran and who suffers from an “ undiagnosed illness ” :
“ The scientists call it cell disruption , and they do n’t know why it ’s happening to veterans , but it ’s really radiation sickness , and it ’s because the DU is all over . ” #
On 60 Minutes Sunday Lara Logan interviewed Pakistan 's President dictator Pervez Musharraf about accusations that he may be to blame for the assassination of his chief political rival , Benazir Bhutto , and what exactly he is doing to combat the resurgence of the Taliban and al Qaeda , whom his government claims was behind her killing , and whether his government is even trying to find Osama bin Laden .
Download Download
On all counts , Musharraf 's answers were lacking .
He repeatedly denies that he was to blame for anything at all and points fingers elsewhere , callously blaming Bhutto for her own death by saying that " it was she to blame alone .
Nobody else .
Responsibility is hers . "
Apparently , in his mind , the man who climbed up on the back of the car and shot her in the back of the head and the suicide bomber who blew himself up and everyone else around had nothing to do with it .
Now I do n't know whether or not all of the rumors are true that Musharraf or his government actually had a part in Bhutto 's death or whether he should be held accountable for denying her repeated requests for more security , but he certainly did himself no favors in this interview to convince anyone otherwise .
It 's simply ridiculous to blame her " alone " for her death , and his refusal to accept blame for anything , his claims of successes in combating extremists in his country despite all the evidence to the contrary and his apathy towards whether or not his government is even looking for Osama bin Laden was - well - eerily Bush - like .
UPDATE : ( Nicole )
Some scary drumbeats being heard as far as Pakistan .
According to the NY Times , the US is considering covert push in Pakistan ( how covert it can be when it's in the NYT is another story ) , which Tom Hayden at HuffPo also weighs in on as well with a warning to Barack Obama to ratchet back the rhetoric .
Moreover , given the news coming out in international circles ( because you 'll never hear about it in the US media ) from Sibel Edmonds about our own actions in allowing Pakistan to develop their nuclear program , can we afford to take such an aggressive stance against Pakistan without risking any lingering goodwill we still hold on the global stage ?
( full transcript after the jump )
Logan :
The night of the assassination , President Musharraf believes Bhutto broke a basic rule of security in a crowded charged political rally - to be particularly careful when leaving .
Musharaff :
She should have just gone and moved fast , gone and waved , yes .
But if you 're standing and -- because you are vulnerable .
You 're vulnerable and people are charging .
And all the film that you see , people are charging .
Now , when people are there by the hundreds swarming around you , this man is one of them .
Who can check these people at that stage ?
Logan :
And the mistake she made , if I understand you correctly , was stopping ?
Musharraf : Yes .
But then the mistake was not that .
I mean , God was kind -- she went into the car in spite of the fact that she was waving and all that .
She did go into the car .
Now is the point .
Why did she stand outside the car ?
Logan :
Why did she stand up in the hatch ?
Musharraf : Entirely .
Who 's to blame ?
Logan :
Who is to blame ?
Musharaff : Only she .
Logan : So Benazir Bhutto , in your words , should bear some responsibility for what took place for her own death ?
Musharraf :
For standing up outside the car , I think it was she to blame alone .
Nobody else .
Responsibility is hers .
Logan :
Do n't you think it will make her supporters crazy to hear you say that ?
Musharraf :
Well , I do n't think so .
I mean , that 's the fact .
She should n't have stood up .
Logan : Just so I 'm clear , even with the benefit of hindsight , you feel that your government , you and your government , did everything possible to give Benazir Bhutto the security she needed ?
Musharraf : Yes , absolutely .
She had the threat .
So she was given more security than any other person .
Logan : Musharraf conceded that Bhutto's return was a bitter pill to swallow .
It was part of a deal engineered by the Bush administration after a year of political unrest and extremist violence in Pakistan .
Logan :
There was a year of secret negotiations ; the United States administration has made their views very clear .
President Bush endorsed Bhutto's return , Condoleezza Rice , they had top State Department officials meeting with her .
You yourself went to Dubai and met with her twice .
Musharraf :
Well , yes .
All this was going - you seem to be well - informed .
Very good .
Yes it was happening , I agree .
Logan :
One of the reasons Benazir Bhutto had such popularity amongst top U.S. officials is that she cast herself as the person who would take action against al Qaeda .
Who would go into the tribal areas .
Who would get Bin Laden .
Who would do all the things that she said you were not doing .
Musharraf : No. Now , again , these are misperceptions of American thinking .
All American media , some officials who do n't know Pakistan .
Logan :
So what are you doing to find Osama bin Laden ?
What is Pakistan doing ?
What end are you actually still today - seven years - under you ….
Musharraf :
We 're fighting terrorism .
And we are fighting extremism .
Logan :
But the question is really within that fight against extremism , what are you doing - if you like - to find Osama Bin Laden ?
Musharraf :
This is a very long answer .
Logan :
That 's what Americans want to know .
Musharraf : Okay .
We are fighting first of all al Qaeda .
Let 's take al Qaeda .
We have arrested or eliminated about 700 al Qaeda leaders .
Only Pakistan has done it .
And lately also whoever has been killed or arrested , I challenge -- who else , which other country has done this ?
Logan : Well , which other country has Osama bin Laden ?
Musharraf : No , I challenge -- I do n't accept that at all .
There is no proof whatsoever that he is here in Pakistan .
Logan :
But are you looking for him ?
Musharraf : No , again , the same answer .
We are not particularly looking for him but we are operating against terrorists and al Qaeda and militant Taliban .
And in the process , obviously , it is combined , maybe we are looking for him also .
Yes .
If he 's here ?
Logan : Musharraf was quick to blame Bhutto's assassination on al Qaeda , particularly a local extremist named Beitullah Mehsud , who operates out of Pakistan 's lawless tribal region where both al Qaeda and the Taliban enjoy widespread support .
Musharraf : Point two percent of our population is in South Waziristan and North Waziristan .
Point two percent .
Logan :
Well , that point two percent has be able to cause a lot of trouble .
Musharraf : Yes .
We must not say that Taliban are in Pakistan .
Pakistan , this is a frontier region .
Two tribal agencies of Pakistan .
Logan :
It 's still inside Pakistan .
Any way you look at it .
Musharraf :
But it 's a small part the population and it is this population where they hide and they get support .
Logan :
But they regrouped under ...
Musharraf : Yes , indeed .
Logan : … your watch ? "
Musharraf :
No , they regrouped because -- not under us .
Because of Afghanistan .
Okay ?
Logan :
But under your term as president .
Musharraf : Yes .
Yes , indeed .
Logan :
They have regrouped and they are stronger than ever .
Musharraf : Well , Taliban .
Yes .
They may be .
They may be .
They may be getting stronger .
I ca n’t say for sure .
Logan : Does the U.S. share any of the blame in this ?
Musharraf : Yes , of course .
I mean everyone , the whole coalition should share the blame for not succeeding .
Logan :
Of all the issues 60 Minutes discussed with Musharraf , the one that seemed to affect him the most personally , was about accusations that he may somehow have been involved in Bhutto 's death .
Logan :
There have been suggestions among certain quarters , particularly amongst Benazir Bhutto 's supporters , that you may have had a hand in Bhutto 's death .
Musharraf :
This is unfortunately a very baseless allegation .
Nobody has a right to blame anyone for killing anyone unless they have the proof .
I 've lived in a family which believes in values - it believes in certain principles .
It stands for character .
And I stand for that .
Why would I be informing her about all these intelligence reports that we have against her , the threat to her ?
Why would I be doing that ?
Why would I be concerned about telling her all this ?
' Do n’t go there , do n’t do this , do n’t do that . '
So these are all indicators .
I can't prove it legally , I can't prove my innocence legally .
But I can prove it only through what I stand for as a person .
Watch the full interview online on the CBS website here .
I must first say that after reading your other questions ( some resolved and some still open ) that you are definetely dealing with several issues .
Your wide range of topics concern me .
You state in other places of your disbelief in The Bible and Christianity and even say you agree with the atheists .
Another concern after reading those is the genuinity of this question .
If you are telling the truth and this dream really happened as you have said , I believe that I have the answer for you according to The Word of God .
First , our Heavenly Father has a Father 's heart in that He wants a intimate and a passionate relationship with His Kids .
He loves us so very much .
St. John 15th chapter talks about that He is the True Vine and we are the branches .
If we abide in Him ( affectionately , passionately , and intimately ) , then He will abide in us .
I want to imply that Jesus really is calling you to Himself in a affectionate , intimate , and passionate relationship with Him .
We are to be In Him and He will be in us .
Almost sounds like intercourse , does n't it ?
It 's better than intercourse as we know it .
There is a place in the spirit that we can live everyday like this .
It 's a sensual experience and you can feel the most awesomest presence of The Almighty God who created all the heavens and the earth and everything that is within them .
It 's much better that the highest high , much better than the most intense earthly sexual climatic orgasm .
I mean , who are we that a God of His Magnitude would allow us to enjoy such ?... but He does because
He loves us and desires that we love Him and move toward His direction .
It all starts with our decision to do so .
He has already done all He can do for us except
He will not make us decide to accept Him .
It 's your choice and if you wanna continue to deny Him ( Jesus ) , then as you deny Him before men
He says in The Word that He will deny you before The Father .
I believe the dream to be real and Jesus is calling you to love on Him , taste Him and see that He is good , to touch Him and embrace Him so that He can you as well .
To experience the love of our Father in heaven , we have to go through Jesus for He is The Truth , The Light , and The Way .
Man , you are troubled and it's never going to get any better for you until you first make a valuable decision to pursue that kind of relationship with Him .
He knows all about you , your deepest thoughts , all your desires , and your secrets too .
But several people have ministered some good words to you ,
It 's time to pay attention and change course .
You were not born homosexual .
God does not create homosexuals ... homosexuality is taught not inherited .
A airplane pilot is not born already knowing how to fly a plane , he is taught to do that .
You say you have read your Bible several times .... when are you going to start believing that Bible because you know the Bible does not teach that garbage .
When you were molested , there is a transferrence of demonic oppressing spirits that takes place .
Thats why that many rape victims and many who suffer molestation are oppressed and depressed .
Many wind up as alchoholics and dopers , many in jail ... it 's just so unbearable to deal with .
I 'm not implying that you are demon possessed , but those kind of spirits have been assigned to oppress you .
Those situations can be broken but you have to be sincere and truly want to be rid of them in your life .
I suggest that you call this ministry toll free number at 1-800 - 600-7395 and be sincere and honest with the person on the other end .
These are people who are sincere , knowledgeable of The Word , who prays the prayer of faith as a lifestyle .
These spirits can be broken from you and you can be free of these things , but you have to make the decision and make the call .
Ask them to follow up often with you , give them permission to do so and they will .
If you 'll take their lead , your life will start to change very quickly .
I hope this helps .
PEACE !!!
Before seeing those photos I thought that condom production is a pretty delicate process and requires a high level of sterility .
Looking at this production line from Ukraine it seems that at least in Eastern Europe it ’s not more than a myth .
Workers touch them with their hands , put in some device reminding the washing machine with a water inside looking like it was n’t drained from there for some time for sure and then storing them in some big bags .
I wonder if all the rest same factories use same methods , I bet all the production comes to Western world from outsourced factories in Asia , and there in Asia they might do even more not - so - sterile things with this gentle products …

Embattled Gonzales : I 'm sticking around to ' fix the problems ' David Edwards and Adam Doster
Published : Saturday July 21 , 2007 Print This Email This Embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made a surprise appearance Friday on Justice Vision -- an internal videoconferencing feed of the Department of Justice -- to assure employees that he would not step down from his post after his department was found taking political considerations into account during its hiring procedures .
" From my perspective , there are two options available in light of these allegations .
I could walk away , as some have demanded , or I could devote my time , effort , and energy to fix the problems , " he said .
" Since I 've never been one to quit , I 've decided that the best course of action was to remain here and fix the problems .
That is exactly what I 'm doing . "
Bush 's former lawyer expressed slight regret over the practices .
" I am troubled because the allegations regarding the politicization of this historic institution , an institution that stands for and protects the rights of the citizens of the greatest and most free nation on Earth , have occurred on my watch , " he said .
Gonzales also outlined a number of reforms his department was undertaking , including replacing many top members of his team , such as the Deputy Attorney General , his Chief of Staff and the Director of the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys .
" The strength of any institution , including one as great as the Department of Justice , lies in its people , " he said .
" And with that particular principle in mind , I have appointed individuals to serve in critical leadership positions who understand and embrace the independence of our law enforcement mission and who will ensure that our work and our hiring will never be influenced bu improper political considerations . "
Among the other reforms implemented to reinforce the public 's confidence in the department , Gonzalez pointed to revisions in the hiring process of immigration judges , the DoJ honors program and the summer law interns program .
The Attorney General finished with a call for dialogue .
" I have learned that there is a real need for improved communications with our U.S. Attorneys and other components , " he said , citing that he had met or spoken with all of the U.S. attorneys in the past few months to express regret over the flawed hiring process and to seek feedback about ways to improve the department .
The following video is from ABC , released on July 20 .
This will be short , but what I have to say is extremely important .
The Senate is scheduled to vote today in the President ’s authority to circumvent the rule of law by taking the court case that is reviewing the illegal wiretapping of Americans , and is trying to pass legislation that will take the issue out of the courts and pass a law that gives the telecom industries immunity for wiretapping Americans without a warrant .
This is a blatant attempt to circumvent the rule of law .
Senator Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn ) is threatening to filibuster this in the Senate .
Harry Reid , the Senate Majority leader has come out in favor of supporting the President ’s law .
If the Senate votes for cloture , this will effectively stop Sen .
Dodd from filibustering the bill by limiting the debate to 30 hours .
We must write to our elected officials and demand no vote of cloture and allow Sen .
Dodd to attempt to stop this assault on our basic rights under our Constitution .
This must be done immediately !
Make your voices heard and stop this nation ’s march to a dictatorship of the executive branch and demand that the President follow the rule of law .
This is a basic right we are letting Bush usurp with collaboration by the Democrats .
Please sign the petition to your Senators by clicking the appropriate parts of this article !
That ’s the way I see it .

Gold futures , dollars per ounce OIL PRICES ON THE RISE OIL PRICES ON THE RISE
Oil prices over 6 months .
WASHINGTON 
The plummeting dollar broke through an important benchmark against the Japanese yen Thursday and hit another low against the euro , continuing an unnerving plunge that shows little sign of easing .
For the first time since 1995 , the dollar traded for less than 100 yen while a euro now costs $ 1.56 .
The past six years , the dollar has lost 45 % of its value against the European currency .
The weaker dollar makes U.S. exports less expensive for foreign buyers , but it boosts inflation and especially the price of oil .
The greenback 's malaise is now so bad that currency specialists are considering central bank intervention to halt the rout .
" The Europeans are already verbally intervening in the market .
But they can't do this by themselves .
They need the U.S. on board , " says Stephen Jen , Morgan Stanley 's global currency head .
European Central Bank chief Jean - Claude
Trichet this week told a French magazine he was " concerned by excessive exchange - rate movements . "
President Bush late Wednesday caused a brief flurry when he said in an interview with the PBS program Nightly Business Report that he " absolutely " favors a stronger dollar .
The comment seemed to go beyond long - standing policy backing an unspecified " strong " dollar .
But White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the president , who is scheduled to speak on the economy Friday before the Economic Club of New York , " did not change his position . "
The dollar is likely to come under additional pressure next week , with the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates at its Tuesday meeting .
The dollar 's drop inflates world oil prices , which are quoted in dollars .
When the dollar weakens , oil producers raise prices to keep revenue stable .
Higher oil prices ignite inflation fears , causing foreign central banks to raise interest rates .
That draws investment away from the USA , further depressing the dollar .
" The danger is a vicious cycle between the dollar and oil prices , " Jen said .
If the U.S. does intervene , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would sell foreign currency reserves and buy dollars .
Such action was more common in the 1990s than today .
But Marc Chandler , currency head at Brown Bros .
Harriman , said intervention at this point would likely fail .
With the yield on two - year German notes roughly twice that of comparable U.S. securities , investor demand for the European currency will remain robust whatever the Fed does .
Chandler also said intervention wo n't be needed .
The dollar has rebounded from its lows against the British pound and Canadian dollar , reached late last year , and likely will do the same against the euro and yen .
" The dollar is in the process of turning , " he said .

This caps the worst week ever for red , when HD DVD was dumped by Netflix and Wal - mart , pushed to the background by Best Buy and put on -- an apparently incredibly short -- deathwatch right here .
Toshiba is mum on the subject right now , but we hear there 's plenty of cheap players and movies in a dumpster around back of the HQ .

Update : Along with an English translation of the NHK 's article ( Thanks sfditty ! ) comes additional confirmation from Reuters sources , it 's a wrap .
Toshiba is shutting down its DVD manufacturing facilities in Aomori Prefecture , Japan , while official word is expected " soon " .

Many of New York 's yellow cabs are driven by immigrants
Clyde Haberman , a columnist on the New York Times , epitomises the cosmopolitan , metropolitan take on the subject :
" They 're doing all the jobs that New Yorkers in particular and Americans in general do n't want to do - driving our cabs , tending to the flower stalls in front of , also , foreign - owned grocery stores , bussing tables in restaurants , very often being waiters in restaurants .
" This notion that somehow we are falling apart because of immigration is ridiculous .
Without them , we'd be in serious trouble . "
Most of the Democratic candidates in their heart of hearts would agree with Clyde Haberman .
They also know that legal Latino voters are worried about the Republican concentration on the immigration issue and that they may turn out in large numbers for the Democratic candidate next year .
But dare the candidates come out , fair and square , for the kind of policies that suggest real sympathy for illegal immigrants and a pragmatic approach to bringing them into society ?
Licence stumble
An example from a recent Democratic debate in Philadelphia might suggest not .
Mrs Clinton was accused of changing her position in one debate
When all seven candidates were asked whether they agreed with a proposal by Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York State that illegal immigrants should have driver 's licences , only Senator Chris Dodd said he disagreed .
Mr Dodd argued against the proposal , concluding : " A licence is a privilege and that ought not to be extended in my view . "
Mrs Clinton responded : " Well , I just want to add , I did not say that it should be done but I certainly recognise why Governor Spitzer is trying do it . "
Mr Dodd pounced on her apparently contradictory statements , an attack followed up by rival candidates Senator Barack Obama and former Senator John Edwards .
" Unless I missed something , Senator Clinton said two different things in the course of about two minutes just a few minutes ago , " Mr Edwards said .
Her campaign was later forced to issue a statement clarifying her position .
' So much anger '
A long way from New York City , in Wichita , Kansas , evangelical leader Pastor Terry Fox warns that listening to East Coast sophisticates on the subject of immigration could doom the Democrats to certain defeat .
" If they 're going to elect a president they are going to have to get out where the people are , " he said .
" There 's so much anger among the white males , the white females .
" [ The Democratic candidates ] better get out of DC , they better get out in the coffee shops , because they 're going to find out that immigration is very high on the agenda for the politics of the mainstream , average , working people . "
Republican opportunity ?
James Pinkerton , a media adviser to the Reagan and Bush Senior White Houses , was also among those listening to Hillary Clinton stumble - and drawing his own parallels .
I 've seen this before - a half - hearted Democratic attempt to talk about a law and order issue that gets sort of brushed off , but actually has enormous salience with independents and Republicans
James Pinkerton
He noticed in a Democratic debate in 1988 that the frontrunner , Michael Dukakis , was accused by fellow Democrats of being soft on crime , supporting measures to allow convicted murderers to spend time out of prison .
Among such murderers was Willie Horton , a prisoner who went on to kill a boy in a robbery while on a weekend pass .
Mr Pinkerton researched the matter , to bring it out with devastating effect in the run-up to the election .
So when you watched Hilary Clinton stumble on immigration , what did you think , I asked him ?
Democrat Michael Dukakis was accused of being soft on crime
He replied : " The light bulb went on .
I 've seen this before - a half - hearted Democratic attempt to talk about a law - and - order issue that gets sort of brushed off , but actually has enormous salience with independents and Republicans . "
And do you think the Republicans will have squirreled away that issue of illegal immigration to bring it out again later on in the campaign ?
" I do n't have a whole lot of faith in some of these Republicans , but ... if they do n't do it , they 're throwing away their best issue , " Mr Pinkerton said .
Could the 2008 presidential election be decided in the end not by Iraq or the economy or health , but by a nasty fight over immigration ?
It is , at the least , possible - and some people are very much hoping it comes to pass .
Swansea University ( TGW ) – Researchers at Swansea University are developing a way to paint solar cells onto the steel sheets commonly used to clad large buildings .
The paint will be based on dye - sensitised solar cells .
Instead of absorbing sunlight using silicon like conventional solar panels , they use dye molecules attached to particles of the titanium dioxide pigment used in paints .
While less efficient than conventional cells , dye - based cells do not require expensive silicon , and can be applied as a liquid paste .
The scientists are collaborating with leading metal group Corus Colours .
“ Corus Colours produces around 100 million square metres of steel building cladding a year .
If this was treated with the photovoltaic material , and assuming a conservative 5 % energy conversion rate , then we could be looking at generating 4,500 gigawatts of electricity through the solar cells annually .
That ’s the equivalent output of roughly 50 wind farms , ” said head researcher Dr. Dave Worsley .
Unlike conventional solar cells , the materials being developed are more efficient at capturing low light radiation .
The team has already demonstrated a prototype .

NO way to write today about the Lindsays , Parises , K - Feds , Katies , Toms , Nicoles or whocares .
No body cares about anything except New York ’s Gov .
Must be something in the water in the Northeast because we ’ve managed to upend three governors – McGreevey of New Jersey , John G. Roland from Connecticut and now Spitzer the shpritzer .
But while the world addresses his situation legally and politically , I want only to address his wife .
I want to tell her – so what .
She may not longer be New York ’s first lady , but a husband hooking up with a hooker is not reason enough to no longer be a married lady .
Sex , a primal need , outpoints fear , hunger and love as mankind ’s No. 1 driving force .
Unless you ’re a pig or a monk , many an able - bodied – and I use that term deliberately – 48 - year - old husband of 21 years has grazed .
I ’m not advocating it .
I ’m merely saying , so what ?
It ’s like takeout food .
Less work for mother .
In Louisiana it ’s the currency .
In Nevada those odds beat the tables .
In DC it ’s a revolving door .
In California they marry the hookers .
In France he becomes president .
A man who adores a woman enough to make his family with her and wants her forever as No. 1 in his life in a drawing room or dining room might also respect and treasure her too much for what he wants in a bedroom .
Paying a pro is n’t disrespect to his wife .
Disrespect is keeping , supporting , housing a mistress with whom there ’s an ongoing relationship and with whom you share not only time but emotions and thoughts and life .
Disrespect is dumping into a trash bin that partner , long out of the workforce after giving her all including her youth , to marry whatever new twinkie works your male menopausal pinky .
This “ f – – – ing steamroller ” did n’t do either .
If he did , it would n’t be enough for his wife to hate him – we ’d all hate him .
George Washington buried his wooden teeth in ladies other than Martha but , predating the Internet , texting , computers , cellphones and cable TV , his itch was kept quiet .
Grover Cleveland ’s illegitimate son fostered this 1884 ditty : “ Ma , ma , where ’s my pa ; gone to the White House , ha ha ha . ” Married Warren
Harding laid on so many mattresses he could ’ve died of bedsores .
There was a little Andrew Jackson stickiness .
And Eleanor Roosevelt ’s social secretary Lucy Mercer took more than dictation .
She took FDR .
Forgetting Bill Clinton , there was Dwight Eisenhower and his WWII driver Kay Summersby , who went riding even out of the car .
JFK ?
Please .
I mean , please .
Jackie supposedly knew about Judith Exner , Angie Dickinson , Marilyn Monroe and the cast of thousands .
Lyndon Johnson ’s healthy appetite was never satisfied by Angus beef .
Jimmy Carter and his peanut ?
We know he actually said he ’d “ committed adultery in my heart many times . ”
The one - time candidates ?
Womanizer Wendell Wilkie ?
Newt Gingrich , who had an affair then divorced the missus then had an affair then divorced the second wife who was suffering from cancer .
And 1988 gave us Colorado Sen. Gary Hart , who left Mrs. Hart home while he dandled and diddled Donna Rice and blew his election chances .
And everyone knows about R. Giuliani .
The Bushes .
Adulterous brother Neil zapped his longtime wife who bore him three children , Sharon .
And these holier than thous – besides the Catholic priest scandal , there ’s Rev. Jesse Jackson , Rev. Jim Bakker , Rev. Ted Haggard and the heavy into family values Sen.
Larry Craig , who ’s getting an airport bathroom named after him , and something named Livingston , who was forced to resign en route to becoming House speaker .
What exactly it is about men in power needing some extraspecial release , I do n’t know .
I only know that sex – missionary style , whambamslam style , deviant or pristine – is so primal a force it has been known – as in the OJ and Robert Blake cases – to end up with the wife suddenly dead .
But whereas these guys are free to golf , Spitzer ’s facing jail .
Look , with only addressing his situation humanly and personally , not legally or politically , the plain fact of handling your needs with a professional is a so what .
It ’s maybe the only way out ( or in ) for those in the white - hot spotlight .
In any case , not a reason to walk away from long - term marriage .
Probably the real reason for this highly intelligent woman to react with fierce anger is toward her husband ’s stupidity .
He ’s Mr. Clean , who has himself wiped out prostitution rings .
He ’s a law enforcer who knows from the Mann Act .
Even apart from the headlined Joe Bruno and Dick Grasso and Hank Greenberg , he ’s made powerful enemies up the kazoo .
So , who knows who tipped off whom ?
I love Silda Spitzer .
In truth , handsome , educated Silda might want to smack him .
But leave him purely and simply because he grabbed a little sex on the side ?
Or wherever he grabbed it ?
Naaahh .
If this lawyer wife really wants to get him , she might just cool it a few years then run for president .
PALM BEACH GARDENS , Fla . ( MarketWatch ) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is gearing up for the prospect of a large bank failure .
So double - check that all your deposits , including interest , are well within FDIC insurance limits .
The agency seeks comment by April 14 on a proposed rule designed to help it make a quick insurance determination amid an increasingly complex quagmire of FDIC rules and tough - to - figure - out bank accounts .
One section would place a provisional hold on a fraction - say , 10 % or so -- of certain account balances at some 159 of the nation 's largest banks .
The hold could affect some accounts with balances under $ 100,000 .
If you have uninsured deposits at a bank , should you worry ?
Possibly .
Depositors without FDIC coverage lost money in at least two recent failures -- NetBank , Alpharetta , Ga. , and Miami Valley Bank , Lakeview , Ohio .
Of $ 109 million in uninsured deposits at NetBank , nearly 30 % has not yet been reimbursed .
Of $ 14 million in uninsured funds at Miami Valley , only 5.9 % of uninsured funds , so far , has been reimbursed .
All deposits in the most recent failure -- Douglass National Bank , Kansas City , Mo. -- have been reimbursed .
Fortunately , FDIC insurance limits have increased on certain accounts in recent years .
Certain retirement accounts , for example , now are insured to $ 250,000 , up from $ 100,000 per person .
But the tide on FDIC reimbursement of uninsured depositors may have changed in 1991 for the worse .
Congress sharply curtailed the FDIC 's discretion to extend protection beyond insured deposits .
Now the FDIC must enter into the " least costly " transaction when dealing with a troubled bank .
So the FDIC wo n't reimburse uninsured depositors if it means increasing the loss to the deposit insurance fund .
" As a result , uninsured depositors are protected only if a bank acquiring the failed bank will pay more for all of the deposits than it would for insured deposits only , " said FDIC spokesman David Barr .
By contrast : " Prior to December 1991 , the only time that the insurance limit was imposed was when we could not find a buyer for a troubled bank and had to issue checks to depositors for their uninsured funds .
The overwhelming majority of the time , we were successful in finding a buyer . "
Big and bigger
Were n't you reassured about our deposit - insurance system with the bailouts of three colossal banks in the past -- Continental Illinois , First Republic and Bank of New England ?
Each large bank approached an eye - popping $ 40 billion in assets .
Today , however , a bank of that size would not rank in the top 40 , FDIC chairman Sheila Bair warned in a speech last year .
FDIC data indicate that as of Sept. 30 , there were 65 institutions with assets of $ 18.5 billion on its list of " problem " institutions .
Barr would not elaborate on their sizes .
Nor will the FDIC name the institutions .
Institutional Risk Analytics , Torrance , Calif. , based on FDIC data from that same date , puts Bank of America Corp.
BAC , - 1.32 % , Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , - 0.84 % , Wachovia Corp. WB , - 3.74 % and HSBC Holdings PLC HBC , +0.48 % , as the riskiest big banks .
More recently , Managing Director Chris Whalen cited J.P. Morgan , Citigroup and Bank of America as his chief concerns due to their heavier trading activity .
He stresses that there is a 45 - day lag time from the close of a quarterly period and the publication of FDIC data .
Bank conditions can deteriorate very quickly .
Fourth quarter 2007 FDIC data wo n't be released until late February .
Nevertheless ,
Whalen doubts that even uninsured depositors at those banks need worry .
" Uncle Sam is not going to let any of them fail , " he declared .
Some investors , though , could take " haircuts . "
Be on guard
So what should you do if you deposit large amounts at a bank ?

Over 30 % Seek Immediate Impeachment , 67 % also fault 9/11 Commission for not investigating anomalous collapse of World Trade Center 7
BBSNews 2007-09-06 — Kansas City , MO ( Zogby International ) September 6 , 2007 – As America nears the sixth anniversary of the world - churning events of September 11 , 2001 , a new Zogby International poll finds a majority of Americans still await a Congressional investigation of President Bush ’ and Vice President Cheney ’s actions before , during and after the 9/11 attacks .
Over 30 % also believe Bush and / or Cheney should be immediately impeached by the House of Representatives .
The 911truth.org - sponsored poll also found that over two - thirds of Americans say the 9/11 Commission should have investigated the still unexplained collapse of the 47 - story World Trade Center Building 7 at 5:20 p.m. on September 11 , 2001 .
WTC 7 housed the mayor ’s emergency bunker and offices of the SEC , IRS , CIA and Secret Service and was not hit by any planes but still completely collapsed into its own footprint nearly eight hours after the Twin Tower attacks .
FEMA did not explain this collapse , the 911 Commission ignored it , and the promised official study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) is now 2 years overdue .
Janice Matthews , executive director of poll sponsor 911truth.org , observes : “ The supermajority response to the WTC Building 7 question signals an increasing public concern about this remarkable event — up from 38 % last year .
We can perhaps credit this rising awareness to the millions who have recently witnessed videos or Youtube clips of this skyscraper ’s descent and the outspoken demands for a new WTC inquiry from over 150 architects and engineering professionals , including NIST ’s own former Fire Science Division Chief , Dr. James Quintiere .
Another contributory factor is the increased questioning among Hispanics , Blacks and Asians whose responses appear significantly more critical of the 9/11 Commission than Whites , sometimes twice as critical . ”
Strategy aide W. David Kubiak adds , “ While only 32 % seek immediate Bush and / or Cheney impeachment based on their current personal knowledge , a clear majority of citizens still seems hungry for a full exposure of the facts .
The results suggest widespread public support for legislators like Rep. Dennis Kucinich who pledge to investigate unanswered 9/11 questions in the relevant congressional committees this fall .
We hope more of our representatives find the spine to respond to this escalating dissatisfaction with the dubious accounting we have received thus far . ”
9/11 family member and 911truth.org advisor Donna Marsh O’Connor notes , “ I ’m not sure this poll is at all surprising .
Over half of those polled want more answers from Congress , from those they hired to represent them .
One quarter of the country knows enough to want to impeach both .
Does n’t it just mean people need figures they consider credible to tell them whether key details add up or not ?
Truth advocates need to press their case in Congress , on college campuses , in church groups with reason and absolute discipline regarding what can and cannot be proven .
The strongest evidence needs to reach the people ” ” including people who hate computers .
We must present it calmly .
Like whispering so that people reach in to hear . ”

On the first day of his confirmation hearings , Mr. Mukasey said he would resign if directed by the White House to take any action he believed was illegal or violated the Constitution , winning Democratic praise .
On the second day of his testimony , Mr. Mukasey sidestepped the question of whether waterboarding was torture and also suggested that the president ’s Constitutional powers could supersede federal law in some cases .
Those responses stirred strong Democratic opposition , throwing his confirmation into question .
Trying to stem the rising opposition , Mr. Mukasey said that while he personally found the concept of waterboarding repugnant , he could not pass judgment on whether it was illegal because he had not been briefed on administration interrogation techniques .
Senator Dianne Feinstein , Democrat of California , said she was confident that Mr. Mukasey would be nonpartisan and that his refusal to make a judgment on torture without knowing all the facts of interrogation policy should not keep him from the post .
“ This man has been a judge for 18 years , ” said Ms. Feinstein , who along with Mr. Schumer provided the key supporting votes to push Mr. Mukasey through the Judiciary Committee .
“ Maybe he likes to consider the facts before he makes a decision . ”
But she was in conflict with most of her Democratic colleagues .
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the Democratic leader , opposed the choice even though he said he was predisposed to back Mr. Mukasey .
“ During his confirmation hearings , Judge Mukasey expressed views about executive power that I and many other senators found deeply disturbing , ” said Mr. Reid .
“ And I was outraged by his evasive , hair - splitting approach to questions about the legality of waterboarding . ”
Republicans hailed Mr. Mukasey and accused Democrats of stalling the nomination and focusing on the torture issue to score political points .
“ The Department of Justice has a vital role to play in the war against Islamic terrorists , and it is critically important that it have a leader who can ensure that it fulfills its mission , ” said Senator Jon Kyl , Republican of Arizona .
“ Judge Mukasey is this kind of leader . ”
Mr. Mukasey presided over terrorism prosecutions while a federal judge in New York and has publicly backed the administration ’s broad interpretation of powers granted it under the Patriot Act .
Named to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 , Mr. Mukasey served as a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York until 2006 , the last six years of his tenure as chief judge .
Before that , Mr. Mukasey practiced law in New York City for 20 years and served as an assistant United States attorney in the federal prosecutor ’s office for four years .
In 1976 , he joined the law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler , where he returned three days after his retirement from the district court .
“ Defendants further preyed and capitalized on Beth ’s desperate need and desire to find her daughter by claiming directly to Beth that they may have found Natalee ’s gravesite and asking for .?.?.
Beth ’s DNA to test against the remains they claimed to have spontaneously discovered there , ” the suit says .
“ To obtain Beth ’s DNA , Defendants misrepresented and omitted facts surrounding their ‘ discovery ’ of remains . ”
The show ’s participants took possession of the bone fragments identified by the suspects .
On Aug. 10 2017 , Dave Holloway contacted his ex-wife , explaining they needed her DNA to see if the human female remains were Natalee’s .
He did not tell her the testing was part of a television production , the lawsuit said .
She provided the DNA sample — but then heard nothing , until she learned about Oxygen series .
The legal complaint alleges producers already knew the remains would not match the missing girl before making the request .
The key moments involved discussions with informants , including one who claimed “ to have known Joran van der Sloot , to have exhumed Natalee ’s body at van der Sloot ’s bidding , to have ‘ crushed ’
Natalee ’s remains into little pieces , and to have burned her skull before disposing of her remains , ” the legal complaint stated .
Did Oxygen media exploit a desperate family looking for answers finally in the case of missing Natalee Holloway ?
You make the call .
Was it really an attempt to find answers or just make money and exploit the case that so many want answers too ?
“ The documentary series was developed by a production company in close collaboration with Dave Holloway and his longtime private investigator .
The show followed his continued search to find answers about his daughter Natalee from a lead he had received .
We had hoped , along with Mr. Holloway , that the information was going to provide closure . ”
“ We were disappointed to learn of the complaint and its inaccurate depiction of how the series was produced , and we want to reiterate our deep compassion and sympathy for all members of the Holloway family , ” the statement said .
The lawsuit argues that the network and Brian Graden Media , the show ’s production company , knew “ prior to filming their Series that they would not find Natalee because the Series was pre-conceived and was not a real - time investigation discovering new facts . ”
According to a legal complaint filed Feb. 2 , the show was “ not a realtime or legitimate investigation into new leads , ” as the program claimed to be , but a “ pre-planned farce . ”
Holloway claims she was duped into providing her DNA to be tested against remains found by producers — without being told that the testing was for a television show .
Entertainment and ratings were the priority , not investigation , the lawsuit suggests .
All I can say is I hope Beth is successful .
I thought the TV series was pretty much nonsense after the first 15 to 30 minutes .
I painfully watched it to keep informed , but much of it became unwatchable .
It did seem contrived , like reality TV of a missing persons case , which I find a bit disgusting .
Having been involved in this case from the very beginning and having actually searched for Natalee Holloway in Aruba and knowing the family personally , the TV series seemed shameless .
In full disclosure , I have to say that I have never really found T.J. Ward ’s premises and conclusions credible .
We shall see how this law suit develops , I hope she wins .
Let ’s be serious folks , we know who did it , we know how it most likely happened .
Keep in mind , Joran Van der Sloot all but admitted it , the Aruba legal system just decided not to prosecute .
As reported at the WAPO , Beth Holloway , he mother of Natalee Holloway , is suing Oxygen media for $ 35 million of what she contends was a fake television documentary about the case .
Natalee Holloway , a Mountainbrook , Alabama teen went missing during her senior trip to Aruba in 2005 .
Holloway is seeking $ 10 million in compensation and $ 25 million in punitive damages against Oxygen Media , an arm of NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment , and the Los Angeles - based Brian Graden Media .
The suit contends that rather than being a documentary or true investigation , the show was a “ scripted , pre-planned farce calculated to give the impression of real - time events .
Dave Holloway said he was contacted by an informant named Gabriel , who said he had some information that may lead to finding Holloway ’s body .
With the help of a private investigator , they targeted where the human remains were found .
The remains are now being tested for DNA , which could take weeks .
Dave Holloway , the father of missing and deceased Natalee Holloway , is stating along with private investigator T.J.
Ward that they may have finally found her remains .
According to Dave Holloway and TJ Ward , remains have been discovered in the long - unsolved disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba and they have been determined to be human .
Now , DNA tests will have to be conducted .
The new lead was a product of the individual known as Gabriel .
This new discovery was the result of an 18 - month investigation with Ward , a search that was documented for an Oxygen TV show that debuts Saturday , “ The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway . ”
I can only hope for the family ’s sake that this is legitimate and will finally bring closure for Beth , Dave and the rest of Natalee ’s family .
Natalee Holloway went missing on May 30 , 2005 in Aruba .
But I have my doubts .
“ I have no doubt that if the book gets published , they ’ll extradite me to Aruba ! ” he bragged in the video obtained by Radar and The ENQUIRER .
But he insisted , “ I want to be extradited first before I tell more .
If I were to be in Aruba , I would n’t mind giving my story first to the authorities there , before releasing it as a book so they can confirm everything . ”
Van der Sloot , 28 , has been serving time in Peru ’s Challapalca prison since 2014 for the 2010 murder of local woman Stephany Flores .
It was there that a Radar and ENQUIRER operative obtained the chilling hidden camera footage of the killer .
As Radar reported , van der Sloot claimed he would reveal more details of his role in the Natalee Holloway murder in a juicy 500 - page tell - all book , and the new footage reveals his secret motivation for becoming an author .
Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot has been locked behind bars for more than five years , but that has n’t stopped his scheming !
RadarOnline.com and The National ENQUIRER have obtained a bombshell new video that reveals his secret plot to escape from Peru and get extradited to Aruba — or even the United States
Its been a while since we heard some lies from Joran Vander Sloot , the pathological liar and suspected killer of Natalee Holloway .
This was the headline from this week ’s RadarOnline.com and The National Enquirer : “ World Exclusive !
Evil Joran Finally Confesses ‘ I murdered Natalee Holloway ! ’
It is supposed to be a jailhouse admission from the psychopath that has lied more times that Pinocchio .
However , the parents of Natalee Holloway say reports of Joran van der Sloot ’s latest “ videotaped confession ” are nothing more than a publicity stunt and “ absolutely meaningless . ”
I could not agree more .
ITS HARD TO BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN 10 YEARS …
May 30 , 2005 … Alabama teen Natalee Holloway has gone missing in Aruba while on a class trip with her fellow Mountain Brook classmates to celebrate their graduation from high school , to begin their college careers and the rest of their lives .
Or so they all thought .
All of these young teens with their whole lives ahead of them , just celebrating one more time together before they went their separate ways in what was supposed to be a safe vacation surrounded by sand , sun and the sea .
Like so many classes before them , a visit to Aruba was supposed to be the one last high school fling .
Sadly , for Natalee Holloway it would be the one last thing she ever did in life , never to attend college , never to have the rest of her life .
Enter Joran Van der Sloot , Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe and everyone ’s lives would be changed forever and not for the better .
Natalee Holloway and friends in Aruba 2005
The first post Scared Monkeys ever wrote on this missing persons case was entitled , ‘ This Ca n’t Be Good For Tourism , Where ’s Natalee Holloway ’ .
At first glance , one night think it was rather crass and insensitive .
But having visited Aruba since the 1970′s , having friends on the small Caribbean Island , even having dated a beautiful Aruba girl in my teens , and having lived and worked on Aruba , I pretty much knew what the prime concern would be for “ One Happy Island ” and that was to save its tourism industry at all cost .
Even if it meant trying to push the dirt under the rug and hide things in the closet .
The cover -up , collusion , corruption and cronyism would only be made worse in the case of missing Natalee Holloway when the individual last seen with the beautiful blond Alabama teen was Joran Van der Sloot , a boy of Dutch privilege who ’s father was a judge in waiting with so many connections legally , politically and with law enforcement that all signs pointed toward the Holloway , Twitty and Reynold ’s family being given the run around from the very beginning .
I say this prior to ever having researched the case in depth or having talked to or met any of the family members .
From experience , I knew the family was in for a hell of a time from past experiences on Aruba where the most simple of things are made into some of the most exasperating efforts in futility .
I knew that Dave Holloway and Beth Twitty were in for a hell of a roller - coaster experience .
No one will ever convince me otherwise that the disappearance of Natalee Holloway and the subsequent search and investigation in Aruba was obstructed on two levels , one from the Van der Sloot family and Paulus Van der Sloot with his connections to prevent his son from going to prison and two , on a police , prosecution and government level to attempt to sweep this under the sand and save their economy that depended upon American tourism .
18 year old Natalee Holloway went missing on Aruba and was last seen leaving an Aruba bar , Carlos N’ Charlies , with three boys , Joran Van der Sloot , Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe .
The news of Natalee ’s disappearance was not made public to the adults in attendance with the teens until the following day when it was time to head off for the airport to leave .
Natalee was missing .
From the outset , something was very wrong in how this case was being investigated .
The Aruba police had the mindset that Natalee was just off having fun and she would return because this happens all the time .
REALLY ?
That might have been some what okay reasoning for Aruba LE had any one of the three people Natalee was last with were missing too .
However , they were not , they were already lying .
What changed this case , brought it to the forefront and escalated it to new heights that we have never seen before in a missing persons case was that Aruba and the powers that be never imagines that the Holloway / Twitty family would have arrived so quickly on Aruba and hit the ground running trying to find Natalee .
The Holloway / Twitty crew were doing the police and detective work that the Aruba LE should have already had done .
Like I said , from the outset something smelled to the high heavens , and it was not just inept and incompetent police work , some was so bad it was obvious it had to be intentional .
Carlos N’ Charlies 2005
The lies begin from the three amigos , Joran , Deepak and Satish …
From the beginning of dealing with the three individuals who were last seen with Natalee , the lies were flowing .
They stated that they dropped her off at her hotel , the Holiday Inn after having left Carlos n’ Charlies .
How can the last three people ever to see Natalee not be considered suspects ?
especially when video surveillance tape showed that the three had never done any such thing .
Would n’t that or should n’t that have been the first thing that Aruba LE should have checked ?
Instead , the family had to do the investigative work .
Holloway was last seen by friends getting into a vehicle and leaving the Carlos and Charlie ’s nightclub in the capital of Oranjestad before dawn Monday .
Police questioned and released three Aruban men who said they dropped Holloway off early Monday at the Holiday Inn , where she had been staying about 3 miles from the capital of Oranjestad , said police assistant inspector Jules Sambo .
The three were not suspects , he said .
MORE LIES … BLAME IT ON THE BLACK GUYS .
On June 5th , 2005 two black men were arrested in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway .
Why , because they were black .
How racist is that ?
The former security guards , Mickey John , 30 , and Abraham Jones , worked for the vacant Allegro hotel , two blocks from the Holiday Inn where Holloway stayed .
How does anyone arrest two black men for a crime when the last people seen with a missing person walk free ?
Thus , we see from the outset the mindset in Aruba to blame this on anyone , two hapless black men , just because Aruba can .
And they might have gotten away with it had Beth Holloway not come to their rescue and state , they were innocent .
The 2005 Arrest of Mickey John
A judge ruled Wednesday there was sufficient cause to keep holding two former hotel security guards in connection with the disappearance of an Alabama high school honors student .
The decision means authorities may hold Nick John , 30 , and Abraham Jones , 28 , for nearly four months while prosecutors investigate possible murder and kidnapping charges in the disappearance of 18 - year - old Natalee Holloway , defense attorneys said .
Neither man has been formally charged .
The two men were arrested Sunday on suspicion of first - and second - degree murder and capital kidnapping , the latter of which is invoked when a kidnapping victim is killed , according to court - appointed defense attorneys Noraina Pietersz and Chris Lejuez .
Later in the case , I had the opportunity to meet Mickey John in the States through the aid of FOM and talk to him as to what happened , his involvement , if any , and his opinions on the case .
After talking to him for 5 minutes it became obvious he had nothing to do with Natalee ’s disappearance and what just an easy patsy to blame it on .
Was Micky John a choir boy , of course not , but he was hardly a murderer .
John told me that he would never make any type of statement , especially in Aruba fro fear he would be arrested again for no reason .
What had always bothered me to this day was how did the Aruba LE , prosecution and judiciary allow the last three people ever to be seen with Natalee Holloway go from persons of interest and prime suspects to witnesses ?
From 6/8/05 , Attorney general spokeswoman Vivian Van Der Biezan also told a news conference that three “ persons of interest ” who were questioned and released last week were considered “ witnesses , ” not suspects .
HUH ?
They dropped the dime on Micky John and Abraham Jones and the Aruba legal brain - trust fell for it hook , line and sinker .
Of course the fact that Joran Van der Sloot ’s father , Paulus , was a lawyer and a judge in waiting with his many connections had nothing to do with this attempted cover up and frame job .
It would not be until June 13 , 2005 that Abraham Jones and Mickey John was released from jail .
Abraham Jones Released !
This announcement was telling on two fronts , one , justice finally prevailed in that these two black security guards were finally let out of jail as they had no involvement in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway and the other would be something that would become a common occurrence through out the investigation in Aruba .
The second interest fact was that Scared Monkeys broke the news of the release of the two security guards before the AP .
Needless to say that prompted many news outlets to contact us and ask how that was possible .
This became one of the events in the case that prompted the news outlets to track SM , not the other way around .
That ’s what happens when you have people on the ground and know others with connections that supplied info and data on a case that was so fluid .
On June 6th , volunteers in Aruba searched for missing Natalee Holloway .
About 700 volunteers joined police , soldiers and FBI agents on Monday , combing scrubland and beaches on Aruba ’s southeastern tip in an unprecedented search for an Alabama teenager who vanished a week ago on a trip to the Dutch Caribbean island .
The Aruba government gave their civil servant employees the day off to help search for Natalee .
However , only about 18 % of government employees showed to search on what was the biggest story to hit Aruba since their independence from Holland .
Also , who did not search … Joran Van der Sloot , Deepak Kalpoe or Satish Kalpoe .
It would not be until June 8 , 2005 that the three boys , Joran Van der Sloot , Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe would be arrested by Aruba authorities in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway .
However , Natalee went missing on May 30 , all this time for these three to get their stories synched together and to be coached by Joran ’s father , Paulus Van der Sloot .
Eight days go by and the individuals who were last seen with a missing person were allowed to sanitize , erase , get rid of and clean up all loose ends with the help of their master white - washer , Paulus .
In the last 5 years , I have been through company acquisitions and closings .
It is a rough time for everyone , and it is hard to stay focused when you are worried about if you will have a job in a month .
We all have bills to pay and many have family to take care of , but in times like this it is important to not lose your head .
The Role of a Manager :
The role of a manager in times like this is to keep all the other employees working .
In many cases , when a company is bought , the first thing the new owner will typically do is take away the managers power .
They wont remove them , becasue they want a familiar face their to keep the employees working .
At this point , managers essentially become figure heads in the store , no real power , except for the respect they earned from their employees .
If the manager does n't have that respect , you can be sure they wo n't be around much longer .
Managers are also pretty much " out of the loop " by this point .
As we saw with CompUSA closing , the managers did n't find out the sale was final until after the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets .
So please do n't blame your managers for not telling you , it is very likely that they did n't even know .
Once the initial take over is done , the managers will be there to keep employee moral up and things moving like normal , even when things are all but normal .
They have their own worries about losing their jobs so they will do what is needed to make sure their checks keep getting signed .
They have bills and a family to take care of , remember that .
The Role of the Staff :
Depending on the company , the current staff may or may not be asked to leave .
In the case of CompUSA everyone is out of a job .
In my previous jobs , I was hired immediately ( and into a better position with a raise ) so the buy outs are n't always bad .
Even if you are out of a job , do n't do anything stupid to get " fired " .
If you start to steal things , or just doing anything to hurt the company , you have basically just said good buy to your benefits , your severance , and any good recommendation the company could have given you to future employers .
I have also seen the purchasing company place the workers they did not keep into other jobs with companies they worked with .
Basically , you just need to keep your head .
Being an asshole wont save your job , and you are n't going to change anything .
The only thing you can do is hurt yourself .
Keep doing your job , and take pride in your work .
If you do n't want to be there , then just quit , but there is no point in trying to hurt the company , they are n't out to get you and it is just business .
Most companies understand what it is like for the employee 's and many will offer a severance package for you , if you have medical , COBRA should kick in if you lose your job , you 'll be paying for it , but you will be covered .
Positions of Confidential Information :
I worked as a tech during previous buy outs , and becasue of that , I had access to all client information , all contracts , basically everything the new owners needed and were paying for ( companies buy clients ... not operations )
I could have been a real pain and not helped in the transition , I could have told my clients to leave , I could have trashed the buyer , but I would have lost my job , my clients would panic and not know what to do , and it would have made everything harder .
The last company I left was basically a sinking ship .
I knew it and I left before they went down .
I was an administrator , so this is what I did .
Made a list of every client user name / password I had
Listed every daily / weekly / monthly task for each of the clients
Listed all of my contacts in each of our clients companies
Listed any quirks of the clients
Listed all work done in the last 6 months
Listed all pending work
Listed all proposals under review
Me leaving was business , they knew this .
I got a months pay for handing over the info and not leaving them in a bad position .
I also made my self available via telephone if they had questing in the next month .
The company is now gone , but the former CEO ( who was brought in to shut down the company ) has offered me jobs in his other company ( they were and are successful ) but I 've turned him down .
Other positions such as management , and sometimes security have similar information .
Leave on a good note .
Do not try and " screw " people , it will bite you in the ass .
Jobs come and go , but your reputation and pride are with you forever .
With a good reputation you will find a new job , with a bad one , people will avoid you like the plague .

US / NATO military shipping heroin out of Afghanistan
The global proceeds of the Afghan drug trade is in excess of 150 billion dollars a year .
There is mounting evidence that this illicit trade is protected by the US / NATO military .

Global Research Editor 's Note
The global proceeds of the Afghan drug trade is in excess of 150 billion dollars a year .
There is mounting evidence that this illicit trade is protected by the US military .
Historically , starting in the early 1980s , the Afghan drug trade was used to finance CIA covert support of the Islamic brigades .
The 2003 war on Afghanistan was launched following the Taliban government 's 2000 - 2001 drug eradication program which led to a collapse in opium production in excess of 90 percent .
The following report , which accuses the United States of using military transport planes to ship narcotics out of Afghanistan confirms what is already known and documented regarding the Golden Crescent Drug Trade and its insiduous relationship to US intelligence .
February 23 , 2008
Russia , facing a catastrophic rise in drug addiction , accuses the U.S. military of involvement in drug trafficking from Afghanistan .
JOHN MACDOUGALL /AFP
Afghan workers cutting open poppy bulbs , the first stage in the harvesting process , in Jalalabad .
Afghanistan produced 8,200 tonnes of opium last year , enough to make 93 per cent of the world ’s heroin supply .
Could it be that the American military in Afghanistan is involved in drug trafficking ?
Yes , it is quite possible , according to Russia ’s Ambassador to Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov .
Commenting on reports that the United States military transport aviation is used for shipping narcotics out of Afghanistan , the Russian envoy said there was no smoke without fire .
“ If such actions do take place they cannot be undertaken without contact with Afghans , and if one Afghan man knows this , at least a half of Afghanistan will know about this sooner or later , ” Kabulov told Vesti , Russia ’s 24 - hour news channel .
“ That is why I think this is possible , but can not prove it . ”
Afghan narcotics are an extremely painful issue for Russia .
They first hit the Russian market during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s when Russian soldiers developed a taste for Afghan heroin and smuggled it back to Russia .
The disintegration of the Soviet Union in December 1991 threw open the floodgates of drug trafficking from Afghanistan across Central Asia to Russia and further west to Europe .
Afghanistan ’s narcotics struck Russia like a tsunami , threatening to decimate its already shrinking population .
According to the Federal Drug Control Service , 90 per cent of all heroin sold in Russia comes from Afghanistan .
Russia today has about six million drug-users – a 20 - fold increase since the collapse of the Soviet Union and a huge figure for a country of 142 million people .
The Federal Drug Control Service said earlier in January that as many as 30 to 40 million people in Russia may have tried drugs at least once .
Annually , some 80,000 Russians die of drug - related causes .
One in five crimes committed in Russia is related to drugs .
The illegal drug turnover in Russia is estimated at between $ 10 and $ 15 billion , discounting transit trafficking .
Narcotics have become an integral part of the youth subculture in Russia .
In Moscow alone narcotics are sold at about 100 discotheques and cafes frequented by young people , the city drug control service reported in December .
About 45 per cent of Russian university students use drugs , according to Russian Minister for Education and Science Andrei Fursenko .
He described the situation as “ critical ” .
The Moscow city government plans to introduce mandatory drug tests for all students in the Russian capital this year .
Schoolchildren may be next in line for screening : some surveys indicate that four out of five young Russians are familiar with drugs .
The Russian Parliament is planning to discuss a law to allow compulsory treatment of drug and alcohol addicts .
President Vladimir Putin has described the drug abuse problem as a “ national calamity ” .
The catastrophic rise in drug addiction in Russia has been spurred by the painful transition from socialism to capitalism that Russia has been going through since 1991 .
Millions lost their jobs and were reduced to abject poverty during Russia ’s worst - ever economic meltdown in the 1990s .
But external factors have played a crucial role in the spread of drugs .
Last year Putin bluntly stated that Russia and Europe had been victims of “ narco- aggression ” .
When the Soviet Union broke up into 15 independent states , Moscow overnight lost control of nearly 5,000 kilometres of former Soviet borders in Central Asia and the Caucasus .
At the same time , nearly 8,000 km of what used to be internal nominal boundaries between ex-Soviet republics became Russia ’s new state borders .
In 1993 , Russian border guards returned to Tajikistan in an effort to contain the flow of drugs from opium - producing Afghanistan .
In 2002 alone they intercepted 6.7 tonnes of drugs , half of them heroin .
However , in 2005 Tajik President Imomali Rakhmon , hoping to win financial aid from the U.S. , asked the Russian border guards to leave , saying Tajikistan had recovered enough from a five - year civil war ( from 1992 - 97 ) to shoulder the task .
Within months of the Russian withdrawal , cross - border drug trafficking increased manifold .
Turkmenistan , another major opium route from Afghanistan , threw out Russian border guards in 1999 .
Since 2000 , Turkmenistan has reported no drug seizures to international organisations .
President Saparmurat Niyazov , who died last year , claimed his country had no drug problem .
However , independent surveys indicate that up to half of Turkmenistan ’s male population use drugs .
In 2002 , the country ’s Prosecutor - General Kurbanbibi Atadzhanova was arrested for operating a drug - trafficking ring .
Seventeen years after the break - up of the Soviet Union , borders between the newly independent states are still porous and travel is visa - free .
Air passengers arriving from Central Asia are routinely screened for drugs in Russian airports , but if drugs are shipped by land , there is only a remote chance that they get intercepted .
Afghanistan under the U.S .
When Russia backed the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan to crush the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the post - 9/11 scenario , the last thing it expected to happen was that drug trafficking from Afghanistan would assume gargantuan proportions under the U.S. military .
Since 2001 , poppy fields , once banned by the Taliban , have mushroomed again .
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , Afghanistan produced 8,200 tonnes of opium last year , enough to make 93 per cent of the world ’s heroin supply .
The U.S. - led North Atlantic Treaty Organisation [ NATO ] forces in the country have not only failed to eliminate the terrorist threat from the Taliban , but also presided over a spectacular rise in opium production .
Russia ’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Afghanistan was on the brink of becoming a “ narco state ” .
Narco business has emerged as virtually the only economy of Afghanistan and is valued at some $ 10 billion a year .
Opium trade is estimated by the U.N. to be equivalent to 53 per cent of the country ’s official economy and is helping to finance the Taliban .
“ Unfortunately , they [ NATO ] are doing nothing to reduce the narcotic threat from Afghanistan even a tiny bit , ” Putin angrily remarked three years ago .
He accused the coalition forces of “ sitting back and watching caravans haul drugs across Afghanistan to the former Soviet Union and Europe . ”
As time went by , Russian suspicions regarding the U.S. role in the rise of a narco state in Afghanistan grew deeper , especially after reports from Iraq said that the cultivation of opium poppies was spreading rapidly there too .
“ The Americans are working hard to keep narco business flourishing in both countries , ” says Mikhail Khazin , president of the consultancy firm Niakon .
“ They consistently destroy the local infrastructure , pushing the local population to look for illegal means of subsistence .
And the CIA [ Central Intelligence Agency ] provides protection to drug trafficking . ”
U.S. freelance writer Dave Gibson recalled in an article published in American Chronicle in December what a U.S. foreign intelligence official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , told NewsMax.com in March 2002 of the CIA ’s record of involvement with the international drug trade .
The official said : “ The CIA did almost the identical thing during the Vietnam War , which had catastrophic consequences – the increase in the heroin trade in the USA beginning in the 1970s is directly attributable to the CIA .
The CIA has been complicit in the global drug trade for years , so I guess they just want to carry on their favourite business . ”

A USAF cargo plane takes off from the U.S. airbase in Incirlik in Turkey in March 2003 .
A Russian news channel reported that drugs from Afghanistan were hauled
by American transport aircraft to the U.S. airbases in Kyrgyzstan and Turkey .
Now Russia has joined the fray accusing the U.S. military of involvement in the heroin trafficking from Afghanistan to Europe .
The Vesti channel ’s report from Afghanistan said that drugs from Afghanistan were hauled by American transport aircraft to the U.S. airbases Ganci in Kyrgyzstan and Incirlik in Turkey .
The Ganci Air Force base at the Manas international airport in Kyrgyzstan was set up in late 2001 as a staging post for military operations inside Afghanistan .
The Kyrgyz government threatened to close the base after neighbouring Uzbekistan shut down a similar U.S. airbase on its territory in 2005 , but relented after Washington agreed to make a one - off payment of $ 150 million in the form of an assistance package and to pay $ 15 million a year for the use of the base .
One of the best - informed Russian journalists on Central Asia , Arkady Dubnov , recently quoted anonymous Afghan sources as saying that “ 85 per cent of all drugs produced in southern and southeastern provinces are shipped abroad by U.S. aviation . ”
A well - informed source in Afghanistan ’s security services told the Russian journalist that the American military acquired drugs through local Afghan officials who dealt with field commanders in charge of drug production .
Writing in the Vremya Novostei daily , Dubnov claimed that the pro-Western administration of President Hamid Karzai , including his two brothers , Kajum Karzai and Akhmed Vali Karzai , are head - to - heels involved in the narcotics trade .
The article quoted a leading U.S. expert on Afghanistan , Barnett Rubin , as telling an anti-narcotics conference in Kabul last October that “ drug dealers had infiltrated Afghani state structures to the extent where they could easily paralyse the work of the government if decision to arrest one of them was ever made . ”
Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Richard Holbrooke said in January that “ government officials , including some with close ties to the presidency , are protecting the drug trade and profiting from it . ”
In an article carried by Washington Post , the diplomat described the $ 1 - billion - a - year U.S. counter - narcotics effort in Afghanistan as “ the single most ineffective programme in the history of American foreign policy . ”
“ It ’s not just a waste of money .
It actually strengthens the Taliban and Al Qaeda , as well as criminal elements within Afghanistan , ” Holbrooke wrote in the The Washington Post in early January .
It is an open question whether the Russian charges of U.S. complicity in drug trafficking are based on hard evidence or have been prompted by Moscow ’s frustration at Washington ’s failure to address the opium problem in Afghanistan .
But it is a fact that the U.S. and NATO have stonewalled numerous offers of cooperation from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) and the Moscow - led Collective Security Treaty Organisation ( CSTO ) , a defence pact of six former Soviet republics .
Nikolai Bordyuzha , CSTO Secretary - General , quoted a Pentagon general as telling him : “ We are not fighting narcotics because this is not our task in Afghanistan . ”
Instead of joining hands with the SCO and the CSTO in combating the narcotics threat , the CSTO chief said , the U.S. was working to set up rival security structures in the region .
Washington is working to “ drive a geopolitical wedge between Central Asian countries and Russia and to reorient the region towards the U.S. ” , Bordyuzha said last year .
With the U.S. and NATO rebuffing their cooperation offers , Russia , China and the Central Asian states have to rely on their own forces in combating the narcotics threat from Afghanistan .
The CSTO has been running a wide - ranging aid and military assistance programme for Afghanistan , which includes training Afghan anti-narcotic police .
Last year , the SCO joined in signing a cooperation protocol with the CSTO , which is aimed , above all , at curbing drug trafficking .
At its summit in Bishkek , the Kyrgyzstan capital , last August , the SCO decided to set up jointly with the CSTO an “ anti-narcotics belt ” around Afghanistan .

Writing in the Vremya Novostei daily , Dubnov claimed that the pro-Western administration of President Hamid Karzai , including his two brothers , Kajum Karzai and Akhmed Vali Karzai , are head - to - heels involved in the narcotics trade .
The article quoted a leading U.S. expert on Afghanistan , Barnett Rubin , as telling an anti-narcotics conference in Kabul last October that “ drug dealers had infiltrated Afghani state structures to the extent where they could easily paralyse the work of the government if decision to arrest one of them was ever made . ” Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Richard Holbrooke said in January that “ government officials , including some with close ties to the presidency , are protecting the drug trade and profiting from it .
” In an article carried by Washington Post , the diplomat described the $ 1 - billion - a - year U.S. counter - narcotics effort in Afghanistan as “ the single most ineffective programme in the history of American foreign policy .
”
“ It ’s not just a waste of money .
It actually strengthens the Taliban and Al Qaeda , as well as criminal elements within Afghanistan , ” Holbrooke wrote in the The Washington Post in early January .
It is an open question whether the Russian charges of U.S. complicity in drug trafficking are based on hard evidence or have been prompted by Moscow ’s frustration at Washington ’s failure to address the opium problem in Afghanistan .
But it is a fact that the U.S. and NATO have stonewalled numerous offers of cooperation from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) and the Moscow - led Collective Security Treaty Organisation ( CSTO ) , a defence pact of six former Soviet republics .
Nikolai Bordyuzha , CSTO Secretary - General , quoted a Pentagon general as telling him : “ We are not fighting narcotics because this is not our task in Afghanistan .
” Instead of joining hands with the SCO and the CSTO in combating the narcotics threat , the CSTO chief said , the U.S. was working to set up rival security structures in the region .
Washington is working to “ drive a geopolitical wedge between Central Asian countries and Russia and to reorient the region towards the U.S. ” , Bordyuzha said last year .
With the U.S. and NATO rebuffing their cooperation offers , Russia , China and the Central Asian states have to rely on their own forces in combating the narcotics threat from Afghanistan .
The CSTO has been running a wide - ranging aid and military assistance programme for Afghanistan , which includes training Afghan anti-narcotic police .
Last year , the SCO joined in signing a cooperation protocol with the CSTO , which is aimed , above all , at curbing drug trafficking .
At its summit in Bishkek , the Kyrgyzstan capital , last August , the SCO decided to set up jointly with the CSTO an “ anti-narcotics belt ” around Afghanistan .

The conservatives are part of this culture of corruption that the Republicans have brought to Washington .
Think of the Scooter Libby problem , the Alberto Gonzales Doug Feith problem .
Think of all of the people in the Bush Administration that have had to leave office under a cloud -- Randy Cunningham , the Republican congressman .

Q : This whole matter , actually though , seems in a funny way to be helping Senator McCain , because the conservatives who were so skeptical about him now are rallying around him and saying he is a victim of the liberal New York Times .
Is n't this a development that could actually wind up helping John McCain ?
dday over at Digby 's place adds more :
Any Democrat going on media to talk about this story needs to follow the template of Howard Dean 's comments to the National Journal .
They 're brilliant .
A taste :
Dean : I have no idea whether the affair story is true or not , and I do n't care .
What I do care about is John McCain -- and this has been well - documented -- is talking all the time about being a reformer and a maverick , and in fact , he has taken thousands of dollars from corporations , ridden on their corporate jets , and then turned around and tried to do favors for them and get projects approved .
He has tons of lobbyists on his staff .
This is a guy who is very close to the lobbyist community , a guy who has been documented again and again by taking contributions and then doing favors for it .
This is not a guy who is a reformer .
This is a guy who has been in Washington for 25 years and wants to give us four more years of the same , and I do n't think we need that .

" Photoshop Friday " is n't just a fun event held on certain online forums — it 's also an attempt to try and quell the concerns of Chinese citizens over environmental issues .
An elaborate scheme involving a doctored photograph of antelope has backfired on the state - controlled media , backed by the Chinese government , forcing them to issue a rare public apology over the incident .
It all started in 2006 when China neared completion of its massive , high - altitude , $ 4 billion Qinghai - Xizang railway that connects Tibet with " China proper . "
Environmentalists had protested loudly against the railway as its launch drew closer because it threatened the native habitat of an endangered antelope in China called the chiru .
Coincidentally , it was about that time when a photograph appeared in Chinese newspapers by Liu Weiquing , a photographer with the Xinhua news agency ( which so happens to be controlled by the Chinese government ) .
This photograph , pictured below , showed the Qinghai - Xizang rail system with a pack of chiru roaming underneath and ran alongside a story entitled " Qinghai - Tibet railway opens green passage for wildlife . "
It was then given an award for " photo of the year " by China 's state - run TV network CCTV , wherein Liu was interviewed about his experiences waiting for the antelope to pass .
" I wanted to capture the harmony among the Tibetan antelope , the train , men and nature , " he said , according to the Wall Street Journal ( subscription ) .
Photo Photoshop Credit : Liu Weiquing
But the Chinese people were n't quite as naive as the government initially believed — especially not those pesky environmentalists who had been studying the antelope for some time and knew their every quirk .
Some noticed that a few of the antelope appeared pregnant , which was unusual for the time of year the photo was allegedly snapped .
They were also running in an unusual pattern considering that they were near a very loud train .
Then one blogger took a risk by carefully examining a blown - up version of the photo and posting his questions about its authenticity online ( one reason China does n't like bloggers ) .
His observations set off a firestorm of analysis of the photo among photography enthusiasts before an independent news organization finally confronted Liu about the photo 's inconsistencies .
The pressure of being caught was apparently too much for Liu—he resigned from his job and posted to his blog that he had " no reason to continue " his career .
" I am not qualified for the job , " he wrote .
That brings us to last week , when CCTV revoked Liu's award and several state - controlled news organizations issued a public apology over the whole thing .
Some questioned whether the Photoshop was a result of Liu's desire to succeed in the industry or whether he was asked to do it on behalf of the government , but the split between China 's " official " news agencies and independents seems to tell the story .
The incident has also sparked public discussion of journalistic standards in China , or lack thereof , as the case may be .
As long as the government maintains tight control over the newspapers and TV networks in the country , though , there will always be a question as to whether those who work at those agencies are exercising the same ethics as others .
One thing is for sure : it 's going to be difficult to find a photographer in China willing to try and pass off a Photoshop as the real deal for quite some time .

On CNN ’s front page , a poll is current running that indicates 44 % of those who have so far voted favor “ WaterBoarding ” of individuals suspected of terrorism .
This is an indication that the “ Politics of Fear ” are working , and Americans are not thinking this issue through , but are instead reacting to fear without understand the history of WaterBoarding , its history in regard the law , and the direct effect it could have on American prisoners of war .
Waterboarding Used to Be a Crime By Evan Wallach
Sunday , November 4 , 2007 ; Page B01 First , WaterBoarding is considered torture , it ’s against international law and defies the Geneva Convention - which the United States was instrumental in forming and signed .
It is bad enough that our President refuses to comply with our own rule of law , much less international law , however it ’s sad to note that his decision appears to enjoy support from those that may now understand the implications and danger of WaterBoarding .
The United States knows quite a bit about waterboarding .
The U.S. government — whether acting alone before domestic courts , commissions and courts - martial or as part of the world community — has not only condemned the use of water torture but has severely punished those who applied it .
After World War II , we convicted several Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American and Allied prisoners of war .
At the trial of his captors , then - Lt. Chase J. Nielsen , one of the 1942 Army Air Forces officers who flew in the Doolittle Raid and was captured by the Japanese , testified : “ I was given several types of torture .
. . .
I was given what they call the water cure . ”
He was asked what he felt when the Japanese soldiers poured the water .
“ Well , I felt more or less like I was drowning , ” he replied , “ just gasping between life and death . ”
Nielsen ’s experience was not unique .
Nor was the prosecution of his captors .
After Japan surrendered , the United States organized and participated in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East , generally called the Tokyo War Crimes Trials .
Leading members of Japan ’s military and government elite were charged , among their many other crimes , with torturing Allied military personnel and civilians .
The principal proof upon which their torture convictions were based was conduct that we would now call waterboarding .
MUCH MORE
If more people knew these facts and the resulting international outrage , the danger it presents to our own troops when captured , but most of all , allowing us to apply a double - standard to ourselves when we have actually convicted others who have been guilty of this exact crime in wars that most of us no longer remember ; we ’re better than that , and I would urge everyone to vote in that poll and express the outrage of a country that has for far too long ignored the rule of law and international treaties of which we were instrumental in creating and urging others to sign .
The hypocrisy is staggering , and it does nothing to repair our image that many nations now label as “ dangerous ” and “ imperialistic . ”
I would urge anyone who is awake , now and tomorrow if the poll is still running to express our general outrage that our own country has violated our own , plus several international laws in the pursuit of Bush polices that continue to tarnish the image of the United States .
Vote at CNN .

Palestinian police separated the clerics so cleaning could continue
Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic priests were sweeping up at the church following the Christmas rites of the Western churches earlier in the week .
Reports say some Orthodox faithful encroached on the Armenian section , prompting pitched battles with brooms .
Intense rivalries at the jointly - run church can set off vicious feuds .
The basilica , built over the grotto in the West Bank town that is the reputed birthplace of Jesus Christ is shared by Roman Catholic , Greek Orthodox and Armenian religious authorities .
Pilgrimage season
Palestinian police formed a human cordon to separate the battling dark - robed and bearded priests and deacons , said to number about 80 , so that cleaning could continue .
Thousands of tourists visited the church for the Western Christmas celebrations this week , the first time municipal authorities reported a successful pilgrimage season since the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada in 2000 .
The Eastern or Orthodox Christian Church celebrates Christmas in the first week of January .
The floors , walls and rafters of the Church of the Nativity are scrubbed and swept by Orthodox priests between the two festivals .
One report says the dispute started when the Greek Orthodox contingent wanted to place a ladder over the Armenian portion .
The IKS Rotarran was a Klingon Bird - of - Prey in service during the 2370s .
With the withdrawal of Klingon fleet from Cardassian space in mid-2373 , following the Cardassian 's successful admittance into the Dominion , the Rotarran suffered half a dozen successive defeats in combat with the Jem ' Hadar , mounting heavy casualties over a period of seven months .
Late that year , General Martok was assigned command of the Rotarran by the Klingon High Council and dispatched to locate the missing IKS B'Moth .
Joining him was Worf as his first officer and Jadzia Dax as science officer ; both serving on detached duty from Starfleet .
Plotting course for the last known position of the B'Moth , the Rotarran was forced to circumnavigate the Tong Beak Nebula in order to avoid the Jem ' Hadar .
Martok 's wish to avoid a fight struck a sour chord with his weary crew .
– from Memory Alpha's Featured Articles ( randomize )
On the way , Martok reviewed his crew 's personnel reports , which included remarks such as : " dishonorable conduct , " " lack of respect , " " dereliction of duty , " " inattention to orders , " " unmotivated , " and " insufficiently aggressive . "
This did not go over well with neither Martok nor Worf .
Together they vowed to restore honor to theand make it a ship worthy of the Empire .

The scale of women 's reliance on abortion was revealed yesterday .
As campaigners claimed that termination had become just another form of contraception , figures showed that about 1,300 women had at least their fifth last year .
Almost 950 of those having a termination had already had four .
Almost 200 had already had five , 110 had had six before - and 54 seven or more .
At the same time , 61,904 women in England and Wales were having their second abortion last year - up from 58,740 in 2004 .
The statistics were disclosed by Dawn Primarolo , the Public Health Minister , last night .
It is thought that they could influence the first major Parliamentary vote on abortion since 1990 , which is expected within weeks .
Tory backbencher Mark Pritchard , whose Parliamentary questions prompted the release of the figures , said they were disturbing .
" They clearly reveal some women are tempted to use abortion as an alternative form of contraception .
" The Government needs to put in place an urgent action plan to reduce such incidents . "
Pressure has increased on the Government to review the law following concern at a rise in terminations .
More than 200,000 abortions take place each year in England and Wales , up from 175,000 in 2002 .
One in ten women in their late twenties to early thirties has had one .
Terminations are permitted up until birth if an unborn child is thought to have a range of disabilities , and until 24 weeks for social reasons .
But research at a top neonatal unit has found that an increasing number of babies born between 22 and 25 weeks are surviving .
In the early Eighties , only a third survived .
By the late Nineties , this had risen to 71 per cent .
Church of
England , the Roman Catholic , Jewish and Muslim leaders have all demanded a review of the law .
The Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , has said the law is being abused to allow abortion on demand .
Meanwhile , amendments to the Government 's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill - expected in the Commons in May - are being tabled .
They seek to bring the current 24 - week deadline for abortion down to 20 weeks in the light of scientific evidence .
Pro-life MPs from the three main parties say a reduction is necessary as medical advances mean premature babies born before 24 weeks have a reasonable chance of surviving .
They want to introduce a week - long period of " informed consent " , during which women who want a termination would be advised to reflect on their decision .
Between 150 and 200 MPs , including the Conservative leader David Cameron , are expected to back a reduction in the law in a free vote .
Turnout will be a key factor in whether it can succeed .
Tory MP Nadine Dorries , a former nurse , is leading a Commons - campaign to reduce the legal time limit .
She said : " What harder evidence do we need that the abortion law as it stands is being abused ?
" Abortion is supposed to be allowed if a pregnancy poses a significant risk to a mother 's health or mental wellbeing .
" But in fact it 's being allowed over and over again for purely social reasons .
Girls now get pregnant and think , " it does n't matter , I 'll just get an abortion " . "
LibDem MP Phil Willis chairs a Commons committee which concluded the time limit for abortion should not be lowered .
He believes more women asking for multiple terminations should be offered sterilisation .
LibDem health spokesman Norman Lamb said the figures underlined the need for better sex and relationship education in schools .
The Department of Health said £ 26.8 million would be invested in 2008 / 09 to improve access to contraception .
A spokesman said : " Some of this funding will be focused , initially , on those areas with high and increasing rates of teenage pregnancy and high abortion rates . "
A Boeing 747 passenger plane .
Most airlines board passengers the same way , first filling the seats in the back of the plane , and then moving to the front .
After a recent experience boarding a plane in this manner , Fermilab physicist Jason Steffen wondered if there might be a better way .
So , in the midst of studying gravitation and axion - like particles , Steffen took a short break to investigate an optimal boarding method for airline passengers .
“ I remember waiting in line to scan my ticket inside the terminal , I believe it was at the Seattle airport , ” Steffen told PhysOrg.com .
“ I remember being quite disappointed when I saw how long the second line was – the one at the entrance to the airplane – and how slowly it moved .
. . .
That 's when I thought that there had to be a better way to get people onto the airplane than the one that was being employed .
I did n't have the time to work on it right then , so I brooded over it for almost 18 months .
Last year , I decided that I either needed to solve the problem or stop thinking about it . ”
In his analysis , Steffen found that the worst method for boarding a plane is boarding from the front to the back , since passengers have to wait and step over each other to get to their seats .
As he explains in a paper submitted to the Journal of Air Transport Management , conventional wisdom suggests that boarding in a manner opposite to the slowest method seems like it should be the fastest method .
Quite unexpectedly , then , Steffen found that the common back - to - front boarding method is actually the second worst method possible , only slightly better than boarding front to back .
“ I was certain that the worst way to load the airplane was from front to back , so I ran my simulation in that configuration first to set a baseline , ” Steffen said .
“ I was also somewhat convinced that the optimal way would be from back to front or something like it .
I half expected to find that back - to - front loading is several times faster than front - to - back .
Had that been true , I was prepared to run the two simulations , see how much faster it was , be satisfied , and put it aside .
When the results were almost identical , I first thought that there was a bug in my code .
Once I was convinced that my code worked properly , I realized that the problem was more interesting than I had anticipated , and I got more serious about it . ”
Using a combination of a Monte Carlo optimization algorithm and intuition , Steffen determined an optimal boarding method , which could make boarding go 4 to 10 times faster than the worst method , depending on the size of the plane .
In the optimal method , passengers would board 10 at a time in every other row ( since loading luggage requires about two aisles of space ) .
This way , passengers could always be boarding luggage or sitting in their seats , rather than waiting in the aisle , as in the two previous methods .
However , Steffen also acknowledged that the optimal method might not be practical , since passengers who sit next to each other often travel together , and prefer to board together .
He proposed a modified version , where passengers board in blocks of three consecutive seats on one side of the plane in every other row .
In this strategy , there would be four boarding groups , with passengers in the same row on the same side boarding together .
This method provided a decent middle ground , as it was twice as slow as the optimal method , but twice as fast as the conventional method .
Although getting passengers to line up in their correct groups might sound challenging , Steffen noted that Southwest Airlines has been experimenting with having its passengers line up in numerical order – so the logistics would n’t be inconceivable .
Steffen also identified several other boarding strategies with results superior to the conventional method .
Contrary to our tendency for order , even completely random boarding proved to be a good alternative .
In fact , random boarding was nearly as fast as the modified optimal method .
Plus , by its very nature , it has the advantage of not requiring airline attendants to organize boarding passengers in any way .
And the random result also shows that , when passengers board out of order in the other strategies , the results will still be better than the conventional boarding method .
The main advantage of the alternative boarding methods is that they allow several passengers to load their overhead luggage simultaneously , which Steffen identified as the largest factor in determining boarding time .
By spreading the passengers throughout the airplane instead of concentrating them together , more passengers could load their luggage at once .
Steffen noted that , although he has recently heard of other boarding optimization studies , his analysis uses a unique method and is the first to generate this specific optimization strategy .
“ I think that the biggest challenge to implementing one of these methods is cracking into the industry , ” he said .
“ Right now , I have a model where the parameters need to be calibrated with data .
But that would require an investment from an airline company or manufacturer .
While I could be wrong , I doubt that when an airline company needs to study an issue like this one that their first thought is , " Let 's go talk to a physicist " ( followed by , " Look , here 's one that 's studied axions and extrasolar planets .
He 's our man . " )
The two fields just do n't talk to each other enough to have that kind of understanding . ”
Still , Steffen thinks that reducing the boarding time could benefit airlines in a number of ways , especially for short flights between nearby cities .
In such cases , quicker boarding might allow an additional daily flight to be scheduled , or it could reduce the number of gates an airline requires , since each gate could be cleared more rapidly .
With thousands of flights taking off around the globe every day , a few minutes could save a lot of people a lot of time .

The US is the world 's greatest prison state ; of that there can be little debate .
By any method of counting we incarcerate more of our citizens than any other country in the world .
Even China has fewer total prisoners than the US , and China 's per capita rate is also much smaller than the US rate .
Yes my friends , even China has fewer criminals in jail than we do .
Surprised ?
“ Statistics released today by the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) , a branch of the US Department of Justice , show that at the end of 2006 , more than 2.25 million persons were incarcerated in US prisons and jails , an all - time high .
This number represents an incarceration rate of 751 per 100,000 US residents , the highest such rate in the world .
By contrast , the United Kingdom 's incarceration rate is 148 per 100,000 residents ; the rate in Canada is 107 ; and in France it is 85 .
The US rate is also substantially higher than that of Libya ( 217 per 100,000 ) , Iran ( 212 ) , and China ( 119 ) . ” ( Human Rights Watch )
The question is whether the law is a shield that protects " the people " or a club that is used to beat down them down .
If we incarcerate many times as many of our citizens per capita than our European allies , can we find an explanation for this difference ?
Are we really that much more criminally inclined here in the good old USA than populations abroad that seem to be very similar to us ?
Paul Craig Roberts once wrote that the principles that make our law a shield of protection for the citizens , and not a weapon of tyranny in the hands of prosecutors , are called “ the Rights of Englishmen . ”
The Rights of Englishmen were listed by Mr. Roberts as : due process , the attorney - client privilege , equality before the law , the right to confront adverse witnesses , and the prohibitions against attacking a person through his property , bills of attainder , self - incrimination , retroactive law , and crimes without intent .
He claimed these rights are the bedrock of our legal system .
Let us look at due process ; what is it ?
The Constitution guarantees that the government cannot take away a person ’s basic right to life , liberty or property , without due process of law .
I suppose one could say that “ due process ” is basic fairness .
You could say that due process means that the state must prove its case in a manner that is just and moral in a court of law while respecting the other rights as outlined above .
In our system we expect that the truth will come out in the court trial of the accused , and we believe that everyone accused will have their day in court .
At least , that is our hope .
I invited a criminal defense attorney to speak to a class of 8th grade students in a private school a few years ago .
He was a parent of one of the children and after he was done he recommended another parent who was also a defense attorney to speak ; and I gave that other attorney equal time .
The talks by both men were simply amazing .
They both eventually got to the fact that over 97 percent of the cases in our town are settled by plea bargain .
Both had stories of men who pleaded guilty to avoid trial even though they were innocent .
These stories would immediately get the attention of the children , " why would someone say they were guilty when they were not " ?
The answer has to do with the awesome power of the prosecutor ’s office and the idea of piling criminal counts on top of other criminal counts until any matter could net one untold years in jail .
We were told by both attorneys that for centuries on end criminal charges were not arbitrary .
We in America would charge a horse thief with theft , but not with conspiracy to steal horses , willful evasion of taxes on stolen horses , cruelty to animals and diminishing the civil rights of horse owners ; but this is no longer true .
The prosecutor ’s office is also funded by the taxpayer and can spend untold fortunes on " expert witnesses " that are paid to testify in court to whatever the prosecutor ’s theory is in the matter .
The prosecutor can also offer time off or immunity to convicted criminals if they will testify against the defendant in the case .
The criminals will often say whatever is necessary to help their own situation and the truth or justice has nothing to do with it .
We were told that it is a fiction that the government will not retaliate against you if you demand your constitutional right to a jury trial in a criminal case .
That was the most shocking statement of the day to my young charges .
The class and I were left with the distinct impression that the courts were rigged to fill jails and that justice was not on the agenda .
When one of the children asked , " how is that fair ? " ; the answer was that the fair came to town in October and was at the fairgrounds on west Highway 50 .
This seems to be a well - known joke among lawyers , but it was a real comedown for the children and myself .
We were left with the idea that our system is founded on the idea that only in a proper court case tried by a jury of our peers could justice even have a chance of prevailing .
The famous rights of Englishmen identified by Mr. Roberts are without meaning as long as there is no trial .
That means in my town there is no justice in at least 97 percent of the cases .
No wonder the jails are full .
As long as we circumvent the court trial by jury with the plea bargain there will be no justice in America for the accused , be he innocent or guilty .
Do we really not care that justice is arbitrary in our country ?
I know I care ; but what can be done ?
I suppose for now we try to inform our fellow citizens and hope that they see that an injustice in any one case is an injustice for everyone .

" I 'm afraid that Hillary Clinton suffers from pseudologia fantastica , " said my friend the psychiatrist .
The would - be president of the United States is not one of his patients : this is what might be described as an informal diagnosis , provoked by Mrs Clinton 's extraordinary claim to have dodged sniper - fire in Bosnia in the service of her country .
She made the remarks in a speech at George Washington University – that 's George Washington as in " I can not tell a lie , father " .
The speech was to an audience chock - full of generals and admirals – and Mrs Clinton was clearly determined to demonstrate that she was up to being their commander - in - chief : " There was a saying around the White House that if a place ... was too dangerous , the President could n't go , so send the First Lady instead .
So that 's where we went .
I remember landing under sniper - fire .
There was supposed to be some kind of greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
When reporters and others who accompanied Mrs Clinton on that 1996 trip protested that nothing of the sort happened , she grimly stuck to her tale : " We had to be moved inside because of sniper fire .
There was no greeting ceremony .
Now , that is what happened . "
Unfortunately for Mrs Clinton , after a few days of her increasingly irate dissembling , CBS started broadcasting its 12 - year - old tapes of the then First Lady landing at Tuzla airport .
It showed the following : No sniper fire .
No running for cover – heads down or otherwise .
Instead we see Mrs Clinton – accompanied by daughter Chelsea – taking part in a charming greeting ceremony , receiving a bunch of flowers from an eight - year - old girl .
Just for the record , husband Bill had flown in to Tuzla some months earlier ( minus Hillary ) when it actually was a bit " dangerous " .
Faced with this avalanche of incontrovertible facts , Mrs Clinton finally collapsed into teenagerish incoherence : " You know , I think that a minor blip , you know , if I said something that , you know , I say a lot of things – millions of words a day – so if I misspoke , that was just a misstatement . "
Yes , dear .
Alas for her long - suffering supporters , Hillary Clinton has form : this is by no means an isolated incident .
A couple of weeks earlier she had boasted that : " The role I played [ in the Northern Ireland peace process ] was instrumental . "
Her spokesman added , just in case we failed to get the point : " We would not have peace today if it had not been for Hillary 's hard work in Northern Ireland . "
The former Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble – who with John Hume won the Nobel Peace Prize – showed great self - restraint in describing Mrs Clinton 's claims as a " wee bit silly " .
I spoke about this to Tony Blair 's ex-chief of staff Jonathan Powell , who was genuinely " instrumental " in the peace process : with all the tact of a former diplomat he said that he would n't comment on Mrs Clinton 's claims " because I do n't want to tell a lie " .
Like her bizarre account of dodging bullets in Bosnia , Mrs Clinton 's claims to have played a critical role in the Northern Ireland peace process are intended to mesh with her now notorious " attack ad " against Barack Obama , which insisted that only she possessed the character and experience to handle a " 3 am call to the White House " if America 's security were to be suddenly threatened .
Given that Mrs Clinton 's latest excuse for her " misspeaking " over her Bosnia escapade is that she was suffering from " sleep deprivation " , Americans might reasonably wonder if she would just scream at the 3am caller from the Pentagon : " Have you any idea what the time is ? " – and then slam the phone down .
My psychiatrist friend tells me that one of the characteristics of pseudologia fantastica – or pathological lying , in more vernacular language – is that the sufferer tells fibs even when there is no obvious gain to be achieved .
He – or she – just wants to be thought to be a much more interesting person .
This , presumably , would explain Mrs Clinton 's excited claim , in the immediate aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks , that she was a very worried mother because daughter Chelsea was jogging in the vicinity " when the plane hit " .
Later , Chelsea revealed that throughout the entire horrifying episode she was ( along with the rest of us ) " staring senselessly at the television " .
Then there is Mrs Clinton 's long - held insistence that she was named after the conqueror of Everest , Sir Edmund Hillary .
Given that Sir Edmund 's successful ascent of Everest took place six years after Hillary Clinton 's birth , we can see that myth - making is at the very heart of her sense of identity .
To some extent , this is true of all of us .
Memory is not put down like video - tape : we constantly rewrite it , according to our psychological needs .
The bigger our need for self - justification , the more we reconfigure our past .
This is what lies behind Nietzsche 's remark that pride always defeats memory when we do something wrong .
Yet Hillary Clinton 's fantastically careless reconstruction of her past , now that it has been exposed by the unforgiving videotape of CBS , is a crushing blow to what remained of her chances to defeat Barack Obama .
After all , the essence of her attack on Obama was that he was a fantasist , a mere purveyor of wishful thinking , and that she was the no-nonsense , down - to - earth realist who could deal with the world as it is .
She has not yet given up on this .
Yesterday , her spokesmen reminded us that in his speech last year at Selma , Alabama , Barack Obama had claimed that his parents had got married – and that he had been born – as a result of the great Selma to Montgomery civil rights march : " There was something stirring across the country because of what happened at Selma , Alabama , because some folks are willing to march across a bridge .
So they got together , and Barack Obama Jnr was born .
So do n't tell me that I do n't have a claim on Selma , Alabama . "
The problem with this , as Mrs Clinton 's spin doctors gleefully point out , is that the Selma marches occurred in 1965 .
Barack Obama Jnr was born in 1961 .
This is actually an interesting observation about Obama 's own self - invention – but has no power coming from such a deeply tainted source .
It is desperate , last - ditch stuff to respond to accusations of fantasising self - aggrandisement by saying , in effect :
So what ?
My opponent lies in exactly the same way that I do .
No , Mrs Clinton can not recover from her debacle at George Washington University .
It only remains for us to wonder what little Hillary would have said if her father had asked her who had killed the cherry tree in the family garden .
Perhaps : " I can not tell a lie , father .
I did cut it with my little hatchet – but only out of self - defence because its branches were attacking me . "

If the political prediction markets are right , we are going to end up with a presidential contest between two people who agree on the pressing need to expand the entire welfare - warfare state .
They can argue about priorities , but they agree on the overall goal .
With the campaign lacking serious issues , something tells me that the great American obsession over race is going to play a major role , which is gravely unfortunate since the discussion is unlikely to be enlightening .
Of course it ’s all politics , that is , equal parts dissembling and illusion , and designed to confer on some groups more power over other groups .
But it does raise important questions : what is racism and how can we tell if it exists ?
I ’m not talking about someone who dislikes African - Americans or whites or Latinos .
We might call that racism on the level of individual ethics , but there are no inevitable and widespread social consequences of a bad attitude .
Defining racism , a notion highly charged with political implications , also raises the specter of the Thought Police : did you or did you not think politically incorrect thoughts ?
Let ’s deepen and broaden the discussion in light of what Ludwig von Mises says about racism in contrast to the liberal view of the social order .
In Omnipotent Government , he shows that the modern doctrine of racism originated with the Frenchman Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau as a way to justify aristocratic privilege .
In the hands of the Nazis , the doctrine was extended to the alleged superiority of Aryans as versus everyone else .
They claimed that the races were inherently incompatible , and advocated state policies to bring about their desired outcome .
Mises first regards racism as a particular species of a general social theory that posits the existence of intractable conflicts in society , and that therefore it is impossible for society to work properly absent some fundamental structural change brought about by the state .
In the old Marxist variety , this conflict was between capital and labor .
That view does n’t have many adherents anymore since real - world events have disproved the Marxian vision for more than a century .
The poor did n’t get poorer under capitalism ; they became richer than ever before in human history .
In a similar way , the racialists must also confront the reality of the market economy .
As Mises said , in a market economy , there is no legal discrimination against anyone .
Freedom prevails , and “ whoever dislikes the Jews may in such a world avoid patronizing Jewish shopkeepers , doctors , and lawyers . ”
The problem is that this does not produce the results racists want .
Indeed , the market always tends to bring people together in peace , neither compelling nor forbidding exchanges .
“ Many decades of intensive anti-Semitic propaganda did not succeed in preventing German ‘ Aryans ’ from buying in shops owned by Jews , from consulting Jewish doctors and lawyers , and from reading books by Jewish authors . ”
What the racists wanted required more .
“ Whoever wanted to get rid of his Jewish competitors could not rely on an alleged hatred of Jews ; he was under the necessity of asking for legal discrimination against them . ”
The end result , then , is a policy of interventionism .
This interventionism is required if a racist result is to be brought about , and the allegedly intractable conflict finally resolved .
If this logic is carried to its end point , the result is mass suffering and death .
The Jews were the problem in Germany , so they had to be eradicated .
The Kulaks in Russia similarly had to be destroyed .
Same with anyone with Western or bourgeois attachments in Mao ’s China or Pol Pot ’s Cambodia .
The Hegelian synthesis in each of these cases is achieved through mass slaughter .
The supposedly persistent conflict between groups is washed away in rivers of blood .
Even as Marxists abandoned their old view of capital - labor relations , they promoted the conflict view of society — one entirely at odds with the old liberal idea — in other forms .
This is because the Marxian view itself has deeper roots in Hegel ’s view that history must tend toward a synthesis of two opposing forces , culminating in some transforming moment .
Socialism is one way to render the Hegelian view in material terms .
But there are other ways .
So long as you have the perception of a war - to - the - knife conflict , history cries out for a resolution .
Thus does the Marxian view easily mutate to take on a different caste depending on the political moment .
The sexist view of the world , for example , holds that men and women have opposing interests , and that a gain by one sex always comes at the expense of the other .
A forced rearrangement of social institutions , they believed , was required to fix the problem .
Now , keep in mind that this view of society is not necessarily held by one group or another .
We think of anti-male women ’s activists who believe that women can only advance through political action , but the view can also be held by men .
The misogynist male might also believe that women are the key problem with the world , and so social structures need to be forcibly rearranged to favor men .
The conflict view is a part of the environmentalist agenda too .
The notion that humans cannot advance without killing nature is widely held today .
People look at China ’s advancing economy and their first thought is not human flourishing , but environmental catastrophe .
Think too of those who accept as an article of faith that changes in weather patterns are due to us humans living it up too much .
We see this further today in the area of religion .
Some people are dead set on the idea that a free society is incompatible with a multiplicity of religious faiths .
This view is particularly popular among Christian fundamentalists , who claim that Islam will never be satisfied until it wipes out Christianity , and that every new mosque is a mortal threat to Christendom .
They ca n’t imagine that people can co-exist in peace , tolerance , and trade , leaving religion to personal conscience .
So too with race .
Decades after Gobineau , in the 1930s , it became the intellectual fashion to believe that state eugenics was necessary to cull the population of its inferior elements , so that the superior elements could thrive .
Behind this was an elaborate argument about human evolution and the need for planned reproduction .
This view was widely held on the left and the right , in highbrow and lowbrow circles .
Why was state planning necessary ?
Because , it was believed , there was a genetic competition that pitted all racial groups against all , and only one group could win .
Thus did the racialist view sample Marxism , changing the posited conflict from capital and labor to the races .
What they failed to understand , or understood but hated , was the capacity for voluntary institutions to harmonize racial interests .
The United States showed this to be true .
After the ghastly civil war came the blessed abolition of slavery , and then the end of laws requiring racial segregation .
We saw how the free market can bring about cooperative trading relationships among all people .
( Of course , the laws hindering freedom of association and contract in the name of antiracism retarded social cooperation . )
What freedom has illustrated is that differences among people do not need to lead to intractable conflicts .
More and more social cooperation is possible and fruitful , to the extent that people are granted the freedom to associate , trade , make contracts , and work together toward their mutual advantage .
Sadly , however , among many people in this country , there is still the impression that state - mandated institutional change , even revolution , is required to end intractable conflicts .
They believe that the very essence of the social structure captures this racial conflict .
Some blacks hold this view , some whites hold this view , some Latinos hold this view — the ideology of racism does not elude any group .
It should be no surprise , then , that Mises ’s ideas have drawn fire from white racialists who insist that by talking about markets and freedom , we are evading the real issue , which is who will dominate .
And there is the view that prosperity is not really about the question of freedom , but about the purity of the genetic stocks .
Such views are not limited to whites ; black activists too speak as if the only issue that really matters is gaining legal preferences for their group .
In either case , the agenda is all about who has power over whom , rather than ending the ability of any group to have power over any other group .
The state is not a neutral observer .
It will pass environmental legislation .
It will regulate relations between races and sexes .
It will put down this religion in order to raise that one up .
In each case , the intervention only exacerbates conflicts , which in turn creates the impression that there really is an intractable conflict at work .
For example , if the state taxes one group to give to another group , it fuels conflict and gives the impression that legislation is the route to liberation .
But who is the real winner in this game ?
The state and the state alone .
By purporting to be the great social referee , it accumulates more power unto itself and leaves everyone else with less freedom to work out their own problems .
And here is the real problem with racism or any - ism that fails to understand the capacity of the free society to work out its own problems through exchange and mutual benefit .
Thus can we see that racism is not a unique problem in society but part of a larger misconception about the basis of social cooperation .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
By Richard B. Schmitt and Tom Hamburger , Los Angeles Times
The government agency that enforces one of the principal laws aimed at keeping politics out of the civil service has accused the Justice Department of blocking its investigation into alleged politicizing of the department under former Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales .
Scott J. Bloch , head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel , wrote Atty .
Gen. Michael B. Mukasey last week that the department had repeatedly “ impeded ” his investigation by refusing to share documents and provide answers to written questions , according to a copy of Bloch ’s letter obtained by the Los Angeles Times .
The Justice Department wants Bloch to wait until its own internal investigation is completed .
A department official signaled recently that the investigation is examining the possibility of criminal charges .
But that , the regulator wrote , could take until the last months of the Bush administration , “ when there is little hope of any corrective measures or discipline possible ” being taken by his office .

I ’m making 0.0023 Seconds - in - Iraq per hour at my job … whoo !
The Sept. 11 commission 's executive director had closer ties with the White House than publicly disclosed and tried to influence the final report in ways that the staff often perceived as limiting the Bush administration 's responsibility , a new book says .
Philip Zelikow , a friend of then - national security adviser Condoleezza Rice , spoke with her several times during the 20 - month investigation that closely examined her role in assessing the al - Qaida threat .
He also exchanged frequent calls with the White House , including at least four from Bush 's chief political adviser at the time , Karl Rove .
Zelikow once tried to push through wording in a draft report that suggested a greater tie between al - Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and Iraq , in line with White House claims but not with the commission staff 's viewpoint , according to Philip Shenon 's " The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation . "
Shenon , a New York Times reporter , says Zelikow sought to intimidate staff to avoid damaging findings for President Bush , who at the time was running for re-election , and Rice .
Zelikow and Rice had written a book together in 1995 and he would later work for her after the commission finished its job and she became secretary of state in 2005 .
The Associated Press obtained an audio version of Shenon 's book , which is to go on sale Tuesday .
Reached by the AP , Zelikow provided a 131 - page statement with information he said was provided for the book .
In it , Zelikow acknowledges talking to Rove and Rice during the course of the commission 's work despite a general pledge he made not to .
But he said the conversations never dealt with politics .
The White House had no immediate comment Sunday .
According to the book , when Democratic commissioner Bob Kerrey learned the extent of Zelikow 's ties to the administration , he confronted Republican chairman Tom Kean and demanded to know why someone with such apparent conflicts of interest had been hired .
" Look Tom , " Kerrey is quoted as saying , " either he goes or I go . "
Kean eventually persuaded Kerrey to stay .

Former Rep. Lee Hamilton , the panel 's Democratic vice chairman , praised Zelikow as a " person of integrity " who was upfront in disclosing his background and White House contacts .
It made sense for commission staff to contact the White House regularly to get information , Hamilton said , and the book also notes that Zelikow was such a dogged negotiator that even then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales found him irritating and subsequently refused to meet with him .
" Did he try to sway the report to protect the administration ?
I think the answer was no , " Hamilton told the AP .
The book says phone logs maintained by the commission 's executive assistant showed at least two calls from Rove to Zelikow 's office number in June 2003 , and two more calls in September .
During that time , the commission was in the midst of its fact - finding .
Zelikow ordered the assistant to stop keeping phone records of his contacts with the White House , the book said , but the panel 's general counsel instructed her to ignore the order .
The phone logs do not record Zelikow 's calls out , nor do they show calls on his cell phone , which he relied on for most outgoing calls .
Records from the Government Accountability Office , which maintained some of the commission 's phone records , showed frequent calls from Zelikow to telephone numbers in area code 202 , with the telephone prefix 4 - 5 - 6 - the prefix exclusive to the White House , the book says .
Zelikow , in his written statement , said Rove had called with questions about the Bush library and other business related to Zelikow 's work at the University of Virginia .
Zelikow also said he enlisted Rice 's logistical aid on behalf of the commission at one point to get Saudi cooperation so the panel could interview their citizens .
" Rove and I did n't really know each other , " he said in the statement .
" I do n't recall ever having an extended conversation with him , and certainly not about politics or the commission . "
The book seeks to raise new questions about the independence of the bipartisan commission , which was created in 2002 to investigate government missteps that led to the Sept. 11 attacks .
Initially opposed by the White House , the panel issued a unanimous 567 - page final report in July 2004 during the height of the presidential campaign that did not blame Bush or former President Clinton for the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people but did say they each failed to make anti-terrorism a priority .
The book says that in early 2004 , Zelikow allegedly sought to add to an initial staff report wording that linked al - Qaida to Iraq .
The wording would have said the terrorist network repeatedly tried to communicate with the government of Saddam Hussein , a claim of cooperation the administration had cited to justify the war in Iraq .
After a staff protest , Zelikow backed down ; the final report said there was no " collaborative relationship " between Saddam and al - Qaida .
Zelikow has said that he simply wanted the panel to keep an open mind on the issue .

The South Korean firm hopes to clone hundreds more dogs
A woman from the United States wants her dead pitbull terrier - called Booger - re-created .
RNL Bio is charging the woman , from California , $ 150,000 ( £ 76,000 ) to clone the pitbull using tissue extracted from its ear before it died .
The work will be carried out by a team from Seoul National University , where the first dog was cloned in 2005 .
Commercial cloning
RNL Bio says this is the first time a dog will have been cloned commercially .
" There are many people who want to clone their pet dogs in Western countries even at this high price , " company chief executive , Ra Jeong - chan , told the Korea Times .
The cost of cloning a dog may come down to less than $ 50,000
Cho Seong - Ryul , RNL Bio
The firm is expecting hundreds more orders for pets over the next few years and also plans to clone dogs trained to sniff out bombs or drugs .
One out of every four surrogate mother dogs produces puppies , according to RNL Bio 's marketing director , Cho Seong - ryul .
" The cost of cloning a dog may come down to less than $ 50,000 as cloning is becoming an industry , " he said .
Dog attack
The pitbull 's owner , Bernann McKunney , gave the company ear tissue , which an American biotech firm preserved before the animal died 18 months ago .
An Afghan hound was the first dog cloned by the SNU team
She is said to have been particularly attached to the dog , after it saved her life when another dog attacked her and bit off her arm .
The university 's team is led by Professor Lee Byeong - chun , who was previously in a team headed by the disgraced stem cell scientist , Hwang Woo-suk .
Mr Hwang 's results on cloning human stem cells , initially hailed as a breakthrough , were found to have been falsified and he is now on trial charged with embezzlement and fake research .
But the team did succeed in creating the world 's first cloned dog two years ago - an Afghan hound named Snuppy .
They continued with the programme , cloning more dogs and also producing clones of Korean grey wolves .
A new exhibition follows the Beatles around Liverpool on 19 February , 1963 - the day they learned they had scored their first number one single with Please Please Me. Photographer Michael Ward travelled up from London to capture the band in their hometown .
" I was n't interested in them , " he recalls .
" I did n't know who they were . "
In stark contrast to the Beatlemania that would break out over the coming months , the pictures show the band followed by a small band of calm fans .
Ward says it was nearly impossible to get a formal shot of the band , who kept cracking jokes and chatting amongst themselves .
A forerunner of the iconic Abbey Road album cover , this shot on a zebra crossing is missing Paul McCartney as he is hidden behind Ringo Starr .
It was too cold to re-stage the picture .
The fab four eventually made their way to manager Brian Epstein 's office in Whitechapel , ahead of a performance at the Cavern Club .
During rehearsals , the photographer was struck by the close musical relationship between McCartney and Lennon .
There was a small moment of panic when Ward realised he had forgotten to bring a flash to shoot the concert - but he was helped by the stage lights .
Ward 's photographs of the Beatles can be seen at London 's Square One Gallery until 4 March 2008 .
A limited edition box set of the photos is also available from Genesis Publications .

What are these ?
Quick :
How do you tell if a woman in a movie is supposed to be intelligent ?
First off , she ’d probably be brunette , but past that .
Glasses , yes .
Little to no makeup .
Her hair is probably in a ponytail .
Clothes she probably bought at the Gap in a size too big .
You know she ’s the smart one because she thinks about more important things than her appearance .
It ’s a stereotype , yes , but it ’s constantly reinforced by intelligent women who should know better .
Germaine Greer rallied women to taste their own menstrual blood in The Female Eunuch and then attacked fellow feminist writer Suzanne Moore by stating that “ so much lipstick must rot the brain . ”
Feminists must reject the male gaze and use those ten seconds it takes to apply lip gloss to bring down the patriarchy .
( Why sensible feminists have not figured out how to band together and write press releases to disassociate ourselves from the crazy women who pretend to speak for us , I ’ll never understand . )
Fashion magazines do n’t help much either .
Elle talks to Ashlee Simpson .
And writes down what she says .
To be recorded for all time .
If you ’ve ever read one of the hundreds of books on the market telling women how to dress and how to shop , you know why fashion writing needs some more smart girls to come over to their side .
These books exist , and are in some ways needed , because there is a huge disconnect between the fantasy world of Vogue — where women spend their days romping in fields wearing $ 1,500 sequined leggings — and reality .
Yes , those egg - shaped coats look charming in the magazine , but can someone who weighs more than 80 pounds wear one ?
The magazines wo n’t tell you because to them , no such woman has ever existed .
Not every woman can afford to hire someone to make these decisions for them so some may need help deciding what works on their bodies .
Instead of alleviating our body fears , however , so many books advising what to wear do nothing but exaggerate them .
The entire structure of Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine ’s book What Not to Wear is built to help you define your particular version of body dysmorphic disorder .
Do you think you have short legs ?
A big butt ?
Big arms ?
There ’s a chapter telling you how to dress around each perceived flaw .
It ’s hard to walk out the door feeling hot and feisty when your entire dressing process has been focused on your main source of anxiety .
If I tried to dress to hide all the parts of my body I have ever been self - conscious about , the only thing left to wear would be a hazmat suit .
Then there are the “ shopping guides . ”
A book telling you how to shop seems ridiculous until you accidentally wander into H&M on the day a limited edition line is released .
You suddenly have to decide in 10 seconds if the ruffled collar on the Viktor & Wolf dress is really you , because there ’s a 14 - year - old girl tugging on the other end of it .
At some point you ’ll probably spend hundreds on a coat only to find the price slashed 80 percent the next week .
A strategy might come in handy .
It ’s strange that the shopping guides still exist in book form now that there is Lucky magazine , but they continue to come out every season , identical to each other and utterly disposable .
Susan Redstone has written one of the latest shopping guides , Just Try It On !
A Month by Month Guide to Shopping and Style .
It sounds so approachable , like Redstone ’s a friend holding your bag outside the changing room .
But she ’s more like the sales clerk who ’s thinking only of her commission when she says you look elegant in a skirt you are obviously 10 years too old for .
Redstone wants you to pull out that credit card to buy absurd things , like a “ stable ” of designer bags .
Nothing being sold on the sidewalk , because “ many of these are illegal and usually trace back to dodgy production in rural places where labor laws and copyright laws are broken with abandon . ”
Before you start thinking she ’s just worried about ethics , you should note she has no problem with sweatshop sneakers or even fur .
It ’s the word “ rural ” that sticks out , as if she ’s most offended by the idea that the bag was sewn in a place where cows are milked .
Never has shopping sounded like less fun than it does with Redstone .
She advises women to create a persona to guide all their shopping choices .
“ Before trying something on or making a purchase , you should ask yourself , would my alter ego , the aristocratic heiress , buy this pocketbook ? ”
Redstone does not simplify shopping , she complicates it .
I first have to create a persona based on my favorite drink — she gives examples for dirty martinis and champagne , of course , but strangely there ’s no advice for us straight whiskey drinkers .
I should try to schedule my shopping around my menstrual cycle to avoid feelings of low self - esteem .
Redstone just parrots back all the marketing nonsense that is forced upon women , and nowhere is that more obvious than in her endorsement of the “ right hand ring . ”
Developed as a way to boost diamond sales after those pesky stories about the jewels ’ funding civil wars and killing children came out , they ’re marketed towards single , professional women .
Why wait for a man to buy you a diamond ring ?
Buy your own and flaunt it like a “ Single and Lovin ’ It ! ” bumper sticker .
Redstone calls the idea “ liberating ” and “ ingenious . ”
I call it “ disgusting . ”
It makes me wonder where Hadley Freeman has been all my life .
( Writing for the Guardian , apparently . )
Her new book The Meaning of Sunglasses : And a Guide to Almost All Things Fashionable will not make you feel worse about the state of your thighs , nor your brain .
Freeman namedrops Andrea Dworkin and poet Joseph Parisi as often as she does Anna Wintour .
She ’s the one you want on the other side of the changing room , not Redstone .
If you came out looking cheap , she would grab you by the shoulders , turn you around , and demand you change immediately .
As she writes in the section labeled “ Cleavage , and the plumbing of depths , ” “ Show me a woman with a good three inches of cleavage on display , and I ’ll show you a woman who , rightly or wrongly , has little faith in her powers of conversation . ”
Freeman wrote a book for women who actually exist .
Women who have to wait for buses in the middle of winter .
Women who like to dance at parties , and do not want to have to sit in the corner because their feet are bleeding .
She knows that these women live in the real world , where fur is not harvested from free - range chinchillas that all die of natural causes ( see “ Fur : bad ” ) .
She also knows that clothing is not about a set of rules or dressing to please men .
“ Fashion should be about self - expression , and if your self has a little more going for it than worrying about what pleases either of the two pillars of fashion dictatorship – men ’s mags ( tight , short , available ) or TV - style makeover shows ( fluted sleeves , bias cuts , unthreatening ) – then flaunt it to the world , and if they do n’t like it , that ’s just too bad . ”
If more fashion writing was done in the tone of smartypants Freeman , we could avoid the fear that caring about our appearance makes us a vain fool or a victim .
A work colleague recently took one look at the four - inch peep toe heels I was wearing and snarled , “ Do n’t you know why men invented high heels ? ” I doubted anything I said would deflect what was coming next , so I just shrugged .
“ So you ca n’t run away when they want to rape you . ” I understand .
I used to be a humorless feminist , too , complete with shaved head and my father ’s combat boots .
Then I discovered Charles David heels and got over it .
If only The Meaning of Sunglasses had existed sooner , I could have spent less time being a self - righteous twit .

McCain and Rove form a tentative alliance RAW STORY
Published : Monday February 11 , 2008
|
Print This Email This On Friday , a day after Karl Rove donated $ 2300 to John McCain 's campaign , McCain ( R - AZ ) put aside a longstanding grudge over Rove 's famously bold tactics in securing George Bush the 2000 GOP nomination , and said that Roves advice would be welcome in his campaign .
" Nobody denies he 's one of the smartest political minds in America , " McCain said .
" I 'd be glad to get his advice .
I get advice from a lot of people .
I 'd be happy to have his advice . "
The news came just before President Bush praised McCain as a " true conservative " in a Fox News interview on Sunday , responding to a wave of attacks from conservative hardliners such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter .
" If John is the nominee , he has got some convincing to do to convince people that he is a solid conservative , " Bush said , " And I 'll be glad to help him if he is the nominee . "
McCain 's relationship with the Bush camp has been fraught since the 2000 primaries in South Carolina , when McCain was falsely accused of leaving POWs behind in Vietnam and of ' siring ' an illegitimate black child -- actually his adopted Bangladeshi daughter , Bridget -- and his wife , Cindy was accused of having a drug problem .
These attacks have long been attributed to Rove , acting through various GOP surrogate groups , including the group , ' Vietnam Veterans Against McCain , ' and the allusively - named Bob Jones University professor , Richard Hand , who authored a mass e-mail claiming that McCain had " chosen to sire children without marriage . "
The signal event in the negative campaigning was a telephone push - poll which asked voters , " Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain ... if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child ? "
McCain remarked on Friday , " I 've always respected Karl Rove as one of the smart great political minds I think in American politics .
I 've always respected him .
We never had any ill will after the initial South Carolina thing .
After we had the meeting with President Bush we moved on .
I 've seen Karl Rove many times when I 've been over at the White House .
We 've always had pleasant conversations . "
A transcript of McCain 's remarks is below , followed by the video of the event : QUESTION :
Are there other signs you see that are encouraging to you ...
MCCAIN : Oh yeah .
A lot of the fundraisers from other camps are coming on board .
And yeah we 're seeing that coming together really well .
We 're seeing it .
[ Inaudible ]
MCCAIN : Who ?
QUESTION : Karl Rove ?
MCCAIN : Oh I , listen , he ah .
Nobody denies he 's one of the smartest political minds in America .
I 'd be glad to get his advice .
I get advice from a lot of people .
I 'd be happy to have his advice .
QUESTION : I was wondering about that , right ....
MCCAIN : He beat me .
I certainly would be glad to get his advice .
I do n't think I 'd want to revisit how he did it .
And I mean that .
Not about South Carolina .
I mean I do n't feel like reliving my defeat .
QUESTION : Are you worried about , he uses very aggressive tactics is that something that -- MCCAIN : I 've always respected Karl Rove as one of the smart great political minds I think in American politics .
I 've always respected him .
We never had any ill will after the initial South Carolina thing .
After we had the meeting with President Bush we moved on .
I 've seen Karl Rove many times when I 've been over at the White House .
We 've always had pleasant conversations .
QUESTION : His tactics do n't , you do n't disapprove of them ?
They do n't make you nervous ?
MCCAIN : It 's not so much whether I approve of his tactics or not .
It 's that he has a very good , great political mind .
Any information or advice and council he can give us , I 'd be glad to have .
I do n't think anybody denies his talents .
So I 'd be glad to get any advice and council .
We would obviously decide whether to accept it or not .
I see so many modern watch designs cross my desk , and while I think lots of them are really cool , it ’s rare that I see one that I just must have for myself .
This is one of those times .
This gorgeous watch uses a bright OLED screen to display a field of “ stars ” when it ’s not telling the time .
But give the watch a shake or tap on its screen , and the dots scatter around the surface to display the time .
Chinese Industrial designer Lv Zhogfang ’s TIWE watch is just at the concept stage , but I ’m really hoping he manages to get these produced .
I ’ll be the first in line .

Felix Baumgartner is a skydiver and a BASE jumper .
His nickname is " Fearless Felix " and " God of the skies " because of the dangerous nature of the stunts he has performed during his career .
His most stunning jump took place in August 18 , 2006 , when he parachuted onto the top of a sweden skyscraper and then jumped off it to the ground .
" It was exactly 6:40 am when Felix jumped out of a helicopter , pulled his ripcord and - shortly thereafter - landed on the roof of the Turning Torso , the diameter of which is a mere 11 meters .
Three minutes passed before Felix went for his next jump , this time from the building ’s roof .
After three seconds in free - fall , “ 502 ” pulled his ripcord for the second time that day , landed safe and sound on Swedish ground just a few seconds later , and left the scene of his feat on a motorcycle .

When Temple Grandin argued that animals and autistic savants share cognitive similarities in her best - selling book Animals in Translation ( 2005 ) , the idea gained steam outside the community of cognitive neuroscientists .
Grandin , a professor of animal science whose best - selling books have provided an unprecedented look at the autistic mind , says her autism gives her special insight into the inner workings of the animal mind .
She based her proposal on the observation that animals , like autistic humans , sense and respond to stimuli that nonautistic humans usually overlook .
In a new essay , * Giorgio Vallortigara and his colleagues , argue that , while Grandin 's book " shows extraordinary insight into both autism and animal welfare , " the question of equivalent cognitive abilities between savants and animals " deserves scrutiny from scientists working in animal cognition and comparative neuroscience . "
Vallortigara et al. argue that savant abilities -- for example , exceptional skills in music , math , or art -- come at a cost in other aspects of processing and , therefore , appear to be unrelated to the extraordinary species - specific adaptations seen in some taxa .
Furthermore , the authors argue , rather than having privileged access to lower level sensory information before it is packaged into concepts , as has been argued for savants , animals , like non-autistic humans , process sensory inputs according to rules , and that this manner of processing is a specialized feature of the left hemisphere in humans and nonhuman animals .
At the most general level , they argue , " the left hemisphere sets up rules based on experience and the right hemisphere avoids rules in order to detect details and unique features that allow it to decide what is familiar and what is novel .
This is true for human and nonhuman animals , likely reflecting ancient evolutionary origins of the underlying brain mechanisms . "
Grandin , who responds to the authors ' critique in a special commentary , suggests that " the basic disagreement between the authors and me arises from the concept of details -- specifically how details are perceived by humans , who think in language , compared with animals , who think in sensory - based data .
Since animals do not have verbal language , they have to store memories as pictures , sounds , or other sensory impressions . "
And sensory - based information , she says , is inherently more detailed than word - based memories .
" As a person with autism , all my thoughts are in photo - realistic pictures , " she explains .
" The main similarity between animal thought and my thought is the lack of verbal language . "
Though Grandin appreciates the authors ' " fascinating overview of the most recent research on animal cognition , " she suggests that " further experiments need to be done with birds to either confirm or disprove Vallortigara et al .'s hypothesis that birds such as the Clark 's nutcracker , which has savant - like memory for food storage , has retained good cognition in other domains .
My hypothesis is that birds that have savant - like skills for food storage sites or remembering migration routes may be less flexible in their cognition . "
Grandin welcomes the discussion following the publication of her book -- we invite readers to join in that discussion by posting their own Reader Response .

Amarok for Life : Amarok developer gets a tattoo !
So the other day we were having our first # amarok.de " CP " ( channel party ) , which was a complete blast .
You can read about it in Nightrose's
So the question surfaced what kind of image it should be .
Well , for me there could only be one answer : The Amarok logo !
So the other day we were having our first # amarok .de " CP " channel party , which was a complete blast .
You can read about it in Nightrose 's blog .
But the real shocker is something we did n't make public yet .
In a state of drunken madness , I had foolishly declared to get a tattoo !
My first tattoo .
Do n't ask why the hell I would do that ; I guess I wanted to pull a stunt that everyone would remember .
Something special to celebrate our very special weekend together .
So the question surfaced what kind of image it should be .
Well , for me there could only be one answer : The Amarok logo !
Closing words
The House Is Rokin'Welcome to the first issue of AWN hosted on the official Amarok website .
This makes it a bit more official , so I had to stop screwing around and at least drop the word " Weekly " from the name .
So here it is , the Amarok Weekly Newsletter under its new name : .
Not weekly anymore :) .
LjubomirAfter many months of hard work developers prepared a preview release for your compiling pleasure ( and including * ubuntu packages ) .
The release summarizes all the work done on Amarok2 so far , and includes , but is not limited to , the following features :
That 's a lot of interesting features , but still many more needs to be done - there is a reason why it 's called " pre-alpha software " .
The Amarok team encourages everybody to try the new release and to provide feedback .
Just keep in mind that the user interface is the least finished part of the Amarok and needs much more work .
If you can find your way in GIMP , Photoshop or in particular , Inkscape , and would like to help with the artwork , you 're welcome to contact us Version 1.80 will be the last released version of Amarok using Qt 4.3 .
We will begin development using Qt 4.4 TP2 a few days after its released , assuming it has no show - stopper bugs .
Qt 4.4 provides features ( like QGraphicsWidget ) required or highly preferred by some parts of Amarok ( including the Context View and Playlist ) .
By the time Amarok comes out , the final version of Qt4.4 should already be released .
At least that 's the plan . :) Jeff Mitchell drops a few notes about media devices in new Amarok :
The media devices architecture in Amarok has come a long road lately .
Although not changed much visibly , the underlying code responsible for the device discovery and much of the device handling has been redesigned and rewritten with Solid in mind .
Provided a few things , * users of various types of media devices should be able to simply plug in and go - the device should be recognized and the correct plugin automatically loaded .
Generic storage devices also benefits from this automation - if they are listed as a portable audioplayer in HAL ( which can be configued in Amarok ) , they will be picked up automatically for use with the generic plugin .
Thanks to the independence that Solid provides , all of this should work on Windows and Mac too , provided someone writes the appropriate Solid backends :) There are also some architectural changes so that the devices can theoretically expose collections to the collection browser , which should make it possible to play " directly " from the device .
This is n't in place yet - all of the device plugins need some further work - but it 's planned . *
A working version of HAL 0.5.9 or greater , a supported device library , and a distribution which provides necessary FDI files .
Jeff Mitchell is an Amarok developer who , amongst other things , created the media device architecture .
Check his blog to read more about his interesting work .
One of the other great KDE4 libraries which makes developing easy is the multimedia layer called Phonon .
Applications using it can play audio and video files on any supported software platform with no changes in the code .
That , along with recent Trolltech 's contribution of GStreamer , DirectShow and QuickTime Phonon backends to KDE means Amarok plays music on all major operating systems , including Linux ( and other UNIXes ) , Windows and MacOS X!Work continues on Plasma powered Context View .
Some plasmoids load , however many important features ( like HTML display and proper layouting ) are still to be written , and are waiting for Qt4.4 .
Expect much work on it later .
Amarok 's service framework flourishes .
Two big services joined the pack recently : the Last .fm service which has been written by Shane King , and a completely new Ampache service , which adds a great amount of possibilities to Amarok .
Read more about this exciting service on Nikolaj 's blog
The playlist has quite improved since the last issue of AWN .
It supports smart album grouping , optional ( and unfinished ) " classic " view , and features a nice artwork .
The inclusion of Qt4.4 will help to improve it further .
Podcasts in Amarok are no longer treated as ordinary playlists , but have a separate browser .
It 's functionality is currently limited , but ( as others part of Amarok ) will improve in the future .
Our Windows guru , Shane King , writes about progress on Windows support :
One of the biggest ( and most controversial ! ) features of KDE4 and Amarok 2 is cross platform support .
There 's been a fair bit of discussion about Amarok 2 on Windows , and as Amarok 's " Windows guy " I 've been asked to give a quick overview of where it 's at .
Firstly , I can't take a lot of the credit for the porting .
Most of the hard work is in Qt and KDE itself , and was already done before I started .
Amarok itself is a good code base and required very little to make it cross platform .
I 've spent far more time investigating and fixing Windows specific fixes in the KDE libraries than in Amarok .
Currently , for basic music playing and organizational tasks , Amarok on Windows is in a comparable state to the Unix version .
Thanks to Qt 's audio backend , audio works well .
The major things missing are outside of Amarok : libraries need to be ported ( eg for media device support ) or the KDE libraries are incomplete on Windows ( some missing features , or not very " native " feeling in places ) .
In general though it 's pretty good for pre-alpha software .
This is why I find it funny when I 've heard people worry Amarok will gain Windows only features : it 's a struggle to even get to feature parity with Unix !
Linux distributions really make life so easy for development , you can rely on a whole bunch of libraries being installed , having someone who will package your program for you , and most of the software you use assumes a Unix environment .
For this reason I think Unix will always be the primary platform of Amarok .
I think Windows development will bring a couple of benefits to existing users .
The obvious one is that although a lot of people do n't necessarily want to use Windows , for a variety of reasons they have to .
Having Amarok available will at least ease the pain .
The less obvious benefit is that making the program available on Windows means the chance to attract more developers .
Amarok can never have too many developers .
For example , if it was n't for the ability to run Amarok on Windows I would n't be working on it , and the work I 'm now doing on the last .
fm service would have to be done by someone else ( or not get done ) .
So even if you never plan to touch Windows , the port is actually a gain for developer attention on Amarok , not a distraction .
To answer the inevitable question : I hope to make Windows binaries available for the preview release .
Check out the developer blog , they will be announced there when available .
To sum things up , Shane provided a nice screenshot :
It 's hard to notice it 's running on Windows , is n't it ?
Well , that 's good :)

The conference season started early for our promotion team this year .
Lydia and Sven visited Stuttgart , Germany , to take part in the LinuxDay at the HdM university .
Lydia talked about the open source community , how a FOSS project organizes itself and about KDE4 .
Sven showed the audience and the people on the live stream the wonderful world of Amarok , including a first peak at Amarok 2 .
Slides are available , recordings of the talks will be published soon on the LinuxDay website .
The talks were in German , the slides mainly in English .
The next version of the award winning ( well , it had to receive * some * award , it 's way too cool ) Kicker applet has been released .
Those who have n't used this piece of art before should visit the homepage immediately .
Besides improved eye candy , bugfixes and enhanced performance it features beautiful themeable fullscreen support , with support for automatically scrollable lyrics , and comes with a large amount of quality themes preloaded .
It appears however that Kirocker 's development has been ceased .
Any takers ?
One of the features of Amarok which you should not miss is the support for dynamic playlists .
Those are the special playlists which generate their content dynamically based on user defined criteria .
Our Community Manager Lydia made a blog post about interesting uses for a dynamic playlist Amarok developer Mark Kretschmann writes about his impressions on Amarok 's first channel party : Markey at the tattoo shop : Together with Myriam Schweingruber , Rokymotion member : I hope you enjoyed this release of AI ( what a funny abbreviation ; ) ) .
I 'd like to remind you that Amarok2 is under heavy development , and ask you not to judge the look , at least until the first beta version arrives .
Let the Rok be with you !
IT ’S a pickle of a paradox :
As our knowledge and expertise increase , our creativity and ability to innovate tend to taper off .
Why ?
Because the walls of the proverbial box in which we think are thickening along with our experience .
Andrew S. Grove , the co-founder of Intel , put it well in 2005 when he told an interviewer from Fortune , “ When everybody knows that something is so , it means that nobody knows nothin ’ . ”
In other words , it becomes nearly impossible to look beyond what you know and think outside the box you ’ve built around yourself .
This so - called curse of knowledge , a phrase used in a 1989 paper in The Journal of Political Economy , means that once you ’ve become an expert in a particular subject , it ’s hard to imagine not knowing what you do .
Your conversations with others in the field are peppered with catch phrases and jargon that are foreign to the uninitiated .
When it ’s time to accomplish a task  open a store , build a house , buy new cash registers , sell insurance  those in the know get it done the way it has always been done , stifling innovation as they barrel along the well - worn path .
Elizabeth Newton , a psychologist , conducted an experiment on the curse of knowledge while working on her doctorate at Stanford in 1990 .
She gave one set of people , called “ tappers , ” a list of commonly known songs from which to choose .
Their task was to rap their knuckles on a tabletop to the rhythm of the chosen tune as they thought about it in their heads .
A second set of people , called “ listeners , ” were asked to name the songs .
Veterans not entitled to mental health care , U.S. lawyers argue
Veterans have no legal right to specific types of medical care , the Bush administration argues in a lawsuit accusing the government of illegally denying mental health treatment to some troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan .
The arguments , filed Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco , strike at the heart of a lawsuit filed on behalf of veterans that claims the health care system for returning troops provides little recourse when the government rejects their medical claims .
The Department of Veterans Affairs is making progress in increasing its staffing and screening veterans for combat - related stress , Justice Department lawyers said .
But their central argument is that Congress left decisions about who should get health care , and what type of care , to the VA and not to veterans or the courts .
A federal law providing five years of care for veterans from the date of their discharge establishes " veterans ' eligibility for health care , but it does not create an entitlement to any particular medical service , " government lawyers said .
They said the law entitles veterans only to " medical care which the secretary ( of Veterans Affairs ) determines is needed , and only to the extent funds ... are available . "
The argument drew a sharp retort from a lawyer for advocacy groups that sued the government in July .
The suit is a proposed class action on behalf of 320,000 to 800,000 veterans or their survivors .
" Veterans need to know in this country that the government thinks all their benefits are mere gratuities , " attorney Gordon Erspamer said .
" They 're saying it 's completely discretionary , that even if Congress appropriates money for veterans ' health care , we can do anything we want with it . "
The issue will be joined March 7 at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti , who denied the administration 's request last month to dismiss the suit .
While the case is pending , the plaintiffs want Conti to order the government to provide immediate mental health treatment for veterans who say they are thinking of killing themselves and to spend another $ 60 million on health care .
The suit accuses the VA of arbitrarily denying care and benefits to wounded veterans , of forcing them to wait months for treatment and years for benefits , and of failing to provide fair procedures for appealing decisions against them .
The plaintiffs say that the department has a backlog of more than 600,000 disability claims and that 120 veterans a week commit suicide .
In his Jan. 10 ruling that allowed the suit to proceed , Conti said federal law entitles veterans to health care for a specific period after leaving the service , rejecting the government 's argument that it was required to provide only as much care as the VA 's budget allowed in a given year .
A law that President Bush signed last week extended the period from two to five years .
In its latest filing , however , the Justice Department reiterated that Congress had intended " to authorize , but not require , medical care for veterans . "
" This court should not interfere with the political branches ' design , oversight and modification of VA programs , " the government lawyers argued .
They also said the VA " is making great progress in addressing the mental health care needs of combat veterans . "
Among other things , they cited a law passed in November that required the department to establish a suicide - prevention program that includes making mental health care available around the clock .
The VA has hired nearly 3,800 mental health professionals in the last two years and has at least one specialist in post - traumatic stress disorder at each of its medical centers , the government said .
Since June , government lawyers said , the VA has had a policy that all veterans who seek or are referred for mental health care should be screened within 24 hours , that those found to be at risk of suicide should be treated immediately , and that others should be scheduled for full diagnosis and treatment planning within two weeks .
A new suicide - prevention hot line has been responsible for " more than 380 rescues , " the lawyers said .
Erspamer , the plaintiffs ' lawyer , was unimpressed .
" Nowhere do I see any explanation of what kind of systems they have in place that deal with suicidal veterans , " he said .
" There 's no excuse for not spending the money Congress told them to spend on mental health care and leaving $ 60 million on the table when people are going out and killing themselves . "

Polygraph Statement of " No Such Author "
The following is an account of my application to the Central Intelligence Agency and subsequent polygraph interrogation .
The Central Intelligence Agency polygraph interrogation is administered as part of a three - day preliminary selection process at various sites in the Washington D.C. area subsequent to a personal interview and written test .
The polygraph is only one element in the selection process , but is probably considered the most pivotal .
Interrogators from the Office of Security administer the polygraph .
Polygraph interrogation takes place in a textbook undecorated sound - proofed room furnished with a table and two chairs , the ubiquitus two - way mirror and of course , the polygraph apparatus .
To the extent I have read about the polygraph I think of the " test " as a thirty - minute affair .
I never consider it an obstacle and readily participate in the process .
I have nothing to hide .
There is nothing unusual about the polygraph hook - up .
Finger clamp on the index finger , two plastic tubes loosely connected around the torso : one around the chest , one around the lower abdomen .
A blood - pressure arm - cuff is secured too tight for comfort .
Once the various devices are connected they remain in place for the duration of the interrogation .
The arm cuff is only inflated when the apparatus is on .
The interrogation is conducted over two days by two different interrogators .
Each interrogation lasts between three - four hours .
I 'm not told about the second interrogation .
The impression the first interrogator gives me is " this is it . "
One of the most striking things about the interrogation is my interrogator .
He seems two years younger than I , and I am quite young .
This would have not been such a big issue were it not that , perhaps to compensate for his youth , my interrogator tries to boost his own accomplishments by making an outrageous claim .
Before administering the polygraph , the interrogator covers the workings of the mechanism in some detail and then goes over the various areas in the personal questionnaire .
The interrogator makes great pains to emphasize that the box is infallible and will readily detect deception .
He urges over and over not to lie .
Then he makes an astounding boast .
Wrapping up his spiel he adds a little something about his own acumen : " I have conducted literally thousands of polygraph examinations ... " he drones .
And on and on .
I tune him out .
" Literally thousands . "
It 's a boast of such phenomenal magnitude and seems so out of place in the setting of the small interrogation room I 'm dumbfounded .
I calculate how long it would take to conduct " thousands " of polygraph interrogations .
The sum I reach has only one answer : his childish boasting is eroding his credibility .
His overboard presentation is disingenuous and reeks of cheap showmanship .
The young interrogator suddenly seems foolish .
Bragging about his accomplishments .
Urging me , almost threatening me to come clean with him .
I dub him Poly Babe .
I am becoming increasingly reluctant to trust him as the ordeal drags on .
The interrogation covers areas from the lengthy application materials .
The questions break down into roughly three areas : professional background , personal background and criminal background .
The professional issues cover matters of loyalty to the United States and previous employment .
The personal background questions have a component of questions called lifestyle questions , a euphemism for sexual history .
After the lengthy spiel selling the capabilities of the box , the interrogator calibrates the box .
He instructs me how to sit .
Not to move .
Face straight ahead .
Not to turn my head .
Not to cough .
To take relaxed , measured breaths .
But sitting so still without moving at all becomes irritating .
And after being instructed not to cough or sneeze , suddenly coughing and sneezing are the only things on my mind .
I 'm struck by an incongruity .
The interrogator boasts about the box 's infallibility , yet instructs me to sit rigidly still .
Movement affects the results ?
It makes no sense .
We cover the questions .
Have you ever lied to an employer ?
Have you ever stolen from an employer ?
Have you been contacted by a foreign intelligence service ?
Are you currently a member of or associated with a foreign intelligence service ?
To every yes response , we go into the particulars to eliminate the incident in question .
I explain away incongruities in my character and conduct .
The interrogator pretends his focus is on getting a good read ; that " passing the test " is the focus of the inquisition .
Of course , getting the applicant to volunteer wrongdoing is the focus of the interrogation .
After covering the questions , never more than twenty , the interrogator turns the machine on and goes through the questions in random order .
The pace is unhurried .
Several questions are covered repeatedly .
At the end of the read , he removes paper from the box and leaves the room to interpret the results .
Before leaving he admonishes me to come clean , not to lie , the same mantra , over and over .
I sit in the room for about twenty minutes .
He returns .
Looks grave .
" You 're showing signs of deception in response to some of the questions . "
He runs through his whole spiel about being honest for what must be the tenth time .
But oddly , instead of going back over the questions again we proceed with the next batch of questions : the lifestyle questions .
During this series of questions I really lose it .
The interrogation focuses on deviant sexual behavior .
I 'm unsure what he 's fishing for and ask him to clarify .
He explains deviant sexual behavior as any sex acts other than what is known as the missionary position .
That strikes me as ridiculous and I ask him if he 's kidding .
Of course , he 's not .
The interrogator wants to know how many sex partners I have had ; how many of them are married ; if I have ever contracted sexually transmitted diseases , if so , how often , where , when .
Have I ever paid for sex , when , where .
Have I ever participated in sm. , bondage , bestiality .
What sort of positions .
You name it , he wants to know .
I get really worked up over this .
I 'm put on the spot to divulge the most intimate secrets of my own sex life , for the sake of clearing the test .
I 'm reluctant to discuss anything at all about my sex life and decide it 's none of their business .
Job or no job .
I know many people will disagree with me and decide to submit [ to ] anything in the name of getting the dream career .
It 's your choice .
If you wish the CIA to have detailed records of every sex act you 've ever performed , and the manner in which you performed it , be my guest .
Bill Clinton , as the most senior officer in the federal bureaucracy seems to think such standards do n't apply to him either .
But hey , you go for it .
Another matter arises that should be remembered : for the past hour - and - half in the interrogation room I am badgered with threats of the box 's infallibility and sensitivity .
Yet , after the very contentious exchange I have with the interrogator , I am so riled up , the subsequent reading must be useless .
Nevertheless , the examiner goes through the same routine at the end of the questions , removes the paper , leaves the room for twenty minutes , returns and announces we are having serious problems .
The CIA 's interpretation of outrage over their none - too - delicate attempt to dig into your sexual history is interpreted entirely as deception .
I suppose the box does n't register rage .
The interrogator tries to work through the questions again .
I explain I am uncomfortable discussing details of my personal sex life with a total stranger with the implication the information will be recorded and a matter of record .
He assures me everything said in the polygraph interrogation remains within the polygraph room ( lie ) .
I attempt to inquire whether the test is valid , since I have become noticeably aggravated .
He reassures me it's a normal response and irrelevant to the detection of deception .
This is another patent lie .
He conveys it so poorly I think I catch him lying .
We should both be rigged up to the machine .
After an attempt to secure more information on my sexual history we run through the questions again and do another polygraph read .
At the end of the session he removes the paper and leaves the room for the third time .
Twenty minutes pass .
He returns and says that although we 're still having problems we are going to proceed to the final segment of questions : the criminal background questions .
I calm down considerably .
This is another area that is irrelevant to me .
We run through the questions .
My answers are all straight no's .
It goes quick .
We do a read .
Same questions , random order .
He removes the paper , leaves again .
This time the wait seems longer .
After about thirty minutes he returns .
He 's sullen .
" We 're having a very serious problem . "
Now what I wonder ?
" It 's obvious you 're withholding information on your past history with use of illegal narcotics . "
I am utterly stupefied .
The entire polygraph experience has turned from surreal to farce to nightmare within an hour .
I have lived overseas for over a decade .
I have hundreds of foreign relatives and acquaintances .
Some of them have lived in communist countries .
One person is a registered card - carrying member of the communist party in his country .
I had expected the most serious scrutiny would be directed to this area of my life .
Instead , that area is covered in fewer than a handful of questions and never revisited .
Instead I become embroiled in a very contentious exchange over my sexual past .
And I have to admit , I 'm utterly unprepared for the entire sexual inquisition and very reluctant to give them one iota .
I have no criminal history and nothing to do with drugs .
Yet , by the final segment of questions , the entire polygraph interrogation is a hoax .
The most complicated area of my life is glanced over , I 'm badgered to volunteer intimate details of my sex life , and as if things could n't get any worse , finally , accused of concealing information on narcotics use .
I 'm struck by an acute realization there is no way to dissuade him from his beliefs .
A mere two hours ago I almost swaggered into the polygraph interrogation room .
Two hours later I 'm fatigued , humiliated , outraged , frustrated and now , dumbstruck .
And then the badgering over drugs commences .
My mind detaches itself .
The entire issue is irrelevant to me .
I 'm attempting to rationalize how the entire process could have gone so wrong .
We do another run with his box , and again he returns alleging I am showing deception .
At this point the polygraph is nothing but a bad joke .
I look at him as if he 's an idiot .
My best friends would laugh at the thought of me " lighting a joint " , let alone the insinuation I am doing hard drugs .
Poly Babe takes it a step further .
Wants to know if I 'm trafficking .
The farce becomes a parody .
It goes nowhere .
Now Poly
Babe reminds me without a good polygraph there is no employment offer .
What can I tell him ?
At one point I consider manufacturing a story about some pot smoking , then laugh it off as preposterous .
Poly Babe leaves .
I 'm devastated .
My dreams are in shatters .
I run through the entire session in my mind , unable to understand how the interrogator could have screwed up so badly .
He returns .
Here it comes I think .
To my surprise he announces he has spoken to a supervisor about my case .
I am being allowed a chance to retest .
I 'm ecstatic .
" Because we want you to pass your polygraph , we are going to go ahead and schedule another polygraph exam tomorrow to see if we can't help you clear the test .
You have to understand , this is a rare second chance .
We do n't do this often .
We 're doing this because we want to try to work with you .
I want you to think very carefully about what has happened here today and reconsider some of the answers you have given . "
I return to the waiting area .
Other applicants are there , waiting .
I 'm surprised to hear from their conversations that nearly all of them have been offered " rare " second chances to retake the polygraph the next day .
I do n't sleep at all that night .
By the next morning , I 'm exhausted , doubtful and unsure how the entire thing is going to turn out .
I tell myself the interrogator screwed up because he was young .
Inexperienced .
I was upset .
The reading was off .
Surely today they 'll get a good read .
They 'll figure this out .
The second polygraph interrogation is a farce from the start .
The interrogator is quiet and serious .
Says little .
Explains nothing .
He fits the attachments and launches into calibrating with little preparation .
The tone of the entire affair is different from the previous day .
His attitude seems to be , " You 're withholding information .
I 'm going to get it out of you . "
After calibrating the machine something odd happens .
He removes the arm cuff , leaves the room and returns with a gigantic rubber ring he fits around my thigh .
I 've never seen anything like it before .
He runs the apparatus again .
With the leg cuff inflated my leg goes numb .
It gets weirder .
He removes the leg cuff , leaves the room and comes back with a tiny little rubber that resembles a donut .
He fits the donut onto my thumb and repeats the calibrating routine .
I realize he 's having a problem getting a good blood pressure read .
I ask him about it .
He ignores me .
He announces we 're ready and launches straight into the narcotics issue .
This is n't retaking the test at all : the entire interrogation focuses entirely on the narcotics issue .
As far as I 'm concerned , the " test " is over before it has even started .
But I stick to it for at least two more hours , attempting to get through it and somehow salvage my candidacy .
It 's hopeless .
The interrogator talks to me as if I 'm a drug kingpin awaiting trial .
Any attempt I make to direct the interrogation back to the language that was used the previous day about clearing the polygraph is gone .
Apparently , the second polygraph is n't about clearing the polygraph at all .
The interrogator wants a confession .
Over the course of two hours he becomes even more sullen .
I become outraged .
Struggle not to hurl obscenities at him .
At one point I ask him his name , attempting to ratchet down the hostility .
Attempting to salvage my application .
" I 'm sorry , I did n't catch your name . "
His response almost sends me lunging for his throat : " My name is irrelevant .
What 's relevant is that you start cooperating and telling us about your drug use . "
I persist .
" Look , what do I call you ? "
It gets more outrageous : " This is irrelevant to answering my questions about your drug use . "
Nothing .
I 'm livid .
I mean white hot .
I 've never been treated like this before in my life .
A day ago I had considered myself an applicant to a prestigious executive entry - level federal job and now I 'm being treated as a drug suspect in an ongoing DEA investigation .
I terminate the " interview . "
Interrogator
Ass does the same song and dance about my application status .
My hopes of still securing a job had died two hours ago .
But within those two hours , a new sentiment is forged .
Where yesterday I was devastated at seeing my dreams in tatters before my eyes , the second interrogation is so patently abusive I start to wonder if I even want to be a part of an organization that treats people with such callous contempt .
It takes some doing for me to actually say it , but once I make up my mind , I go for it .
Call off the interrogation .
Rip the gadgets off .
Screw you .
Screw your incompetent little secret society and FUCK your polygraph .
That sums up my polygraph experience .
I fretted a good deal about how the polygraph results could have been so completely wrong .
Before going into the polygraph I was what you might call a believer .
I must have been an ideal candidate for the polygraph since I bought into the institutional myths about its abilities .
And yet , the entire polygraph experience was a catastrophe .
Quite aside from the assumption of the interrogators I was being deceptive simply because I got worked up over intrusive questions that were far beyond the realm of decency , I am curious how the entire drug issue is brought up .
Of all the accusations they could have come up with , they chose the one that was so far off to be almost comical .
And I was also curious why the session on the second day had no pretense of being a polygraph session at all .
The interrogator demonstrated to me with the rubber cuff routine he was experiencing difficulties getting a proper reading , and assumed such a hostile attitude from the start the entire second day 's polygraph was invalid .
I was seriously pissed off , especially when it became clear he had no intention of leaving the narcotics issue .
His attitude was confess or fail .
No amount of arguing with him was going to change it .
Yet he persisted with the polygraph farce , in spite of my open hostility .
Months later I learned about Voice Stress Analysis .
That inquiry lit a bulb in my memory , and almost a year after my polygraph , I was able to figure out what had happened .
Approximately a month before my three - day trip I got a phone call .
It was so brief it was hardly worth remembering .
But the call had been noteworthy for one reason .
The caller said he was with the Office of Security .
He wanted to go over the answers on my questionnaire to make sure there were no mistakes .
I said fine .
He said he would read the questions to me and asked me to answer with a simple yes or no .
We ran through the questions .
He thanked me for my cooperation and that was that .
The whole call lasted no more than seven minutes .
Why was it relevant almost a year later ?
It suddenly struck me that that one call had gone rather smoothly except for one question .
And only one question .
The caller had garbled it .
Instead of responding immediately , I hesitated and asked him to repeat the question .
He did so .
I replied no and thought no more of it .
Until I came across information on Voice Stress Analysis .
According to the literature , VSA can be administered by telephone .
I got to thinking .
If I were asked over the phone , " Have you ever tried or used illegal narcotics at any time ? " and my response appeared hesitant , would that be enough to focus on that singular issue while administering a polygraph in which the interrogator is having an extremely difficult time interpreting his results ?
I have no conclusive answer .
Nothing in literature I have read indicates the CIA administers a surreptitious VSA as part of its screening process .
But based on my personal experiences I am virtually certain a surreptitious VSA was administered , I must emphasize , without my knowledge , and that assumptions were made based on the VSA during subsequent polygraph testing .
VSA as a tool for truth telling is even more disreputable than the polygraph .
Even the American Polygraph Association distances itself from VSA .
This is but one of many problems with the CIA polygraph process .
The most troubling aspect of the polygraph interrogation is the sexual inquisition .
And while applicants must fill out ponderous and lengthy questionnaires going into painstaking detail on their lives and backgrounds , the sexual inquisition is merely alluded to in one sentence .
It 's almost glanced over .
Added as some sort of afterthought .
Until they get you in that room .
It is the one area where the applicant is ambushed and then required to make the fullest disclosures of the most intimate nature .
Allegedly for the sake of national security .
After observing the antics of the Clinton White House for eight years , I am convinced the CIA polygraph is without any validity .
Mere GS - 7 applicants must explain away the most intimate details of their sex lives while the commander in chief plays goose the cigar with young female assistants in the Oval Office .
It 's a double standard that is utterly unpalatable to me .
I will never subject myself to another polygraph again .
And consider anyone who does a fool and a boob .
The humiliation you will experience comes at your own expense .
The Office of Security uses the polygraph to catch criminals .
Not weed out unfit applicants .
When a certain percentage of applicants are rejected for being unable to pass their polygraphs , the Office of Security is unable to point to any successes .
It can merely claim to have protected the organization from foreign agent penetration .
But with the emphasis on catching criminals , they can uphold a record .
" See ?
This box works .
We get drug confessions .
Rape confessions .
Theft confessions . "
The cases they pass along to the FBI at least create a paper trail that substantiates the " validity " of their methodology and bolsters institutional faith in the box .
It 's all a scam .
I do n't see the box disappearing anytime soon .
As a scientific tool , it is without any validity .
But as an interrogation tool that forces coerced statements from fearful subjects , it works wonders .
Maybe they can't rig electrodes to your testicles , but they sure as hell can rig you up with other gadgets that operate on other human fears .
Small wonder then that the agency 's inept security apparatus swears by it .
Instilling fear by suggestion is after all their specialty .
It is a tragic irony that it is considered detrimental to the security of the United States if even one mole can penetrate an intelligence organization , while it is considered part of doing business when hundreds of highly motivated and skilled applicants are summarily written off as unfortunate losses simply because of the ineptitude of interrogators .
And all the while Aldrich Ames sits in his cell laughing .

Nowadays , it 's hard to find much body fat in Hollywood .
Today 's stars are slim and toned , whittled to within an inch of their lives .
When pressed about their slimming secrets , celebrities often rave about their " good genes " , their affection for junk food , or declare that their secret to staying thin is simply running around after their children .
But here 's what you should know : a lot of them are lying .
Scroll down for more ...
Slim stars - LEFT : Paris Hilton CENTRE : Lindsay Lohan RIGHT : Britney Spears
Shaping up : Angelina Jolie worked with Gunnar Peterson , who has dished the dirt on how stars achieve their figures
Celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson , who has trained Angelina Jolie , Jennifer Lopez , and Penelope Cruz , says : " I had one actress training with me four times a week in addition to daily exercise bike classes .
When the Press asked how she 'd ' transformed ' her body , she said : ' Oh , I do yoga and hike with my dog . '
It makes me laugh . "
So the next time you see a pin -thin celebrity bragging about her relaxed approach to eating , remember this :
They take drugs
When Lindsay Lohan was arrested on suspicion of drink - driving , police said they found cocaine in her pocket .
Paris Hilton recently admitted to U.S. talk show host Larry King that she takes Adderall for attention deficit disorder .
Both drugs are often used by women looking to lose weight .
Hollywood 's party girls always seem to have access to certain drugs known to help shed pounds .
At the moment , Adderall is the latest diet drug craze in Hollywood , and the number of celebrities addicted to it continues to rise .
Just about every female celebrity arrested - from Paris to Nicole , from Lindsay to Britney Spears - has had prescription Adderall in her handbag .
It keeps you awake while killing the appetite .
For the jet - set , hard - partying girl it has become the miracle pill - one , however , with potentially dangerous consequences .
Even when taken as instructed , Adderall can cause psychotic episodes , depression and serious heart problems .
Eating disorder expert Carolyn Costin , who has treated many Hollywood actresses , says she 's even seen a rise in " the drugs used for attention deficit being crumpled up and snorted " .
Some celebrities also take Clenbuterol , known as " Clen " .
Commonly prescribed to treat respiratory problems in horses , in humans it can cause fat loss .
While Clenbuterol and Adderall create a slimming effect in the short - term , after a while , users report a sudden and uncontrollable weight gain .
Having tampered with the natural metabolism , the drugs stop working .
Manhattan - based trainer Justin Gelband , who works with catwalk and catalogue models , says : " Diet pills and steroids are huge right now .
After Kate Moss was caught supposedly doing coke , the modelling agencies started to crack down on girls using hardcore drugs like cocaine and heroin to stay slim .
" So now it 's more diet pills and steroids ; they are easier to hide and , if pressed , the girls can say that they have a prescription . "
They eat nothing but boiled eggs
During the filming of Cold Mountain , there were rumours that one famous actress on set ate only boiled eggs .
She would rise in the morning and eat one and then have one or two at the end of the day .
That was her entire diet .
And apparently she is not alone .
Celebrity trainer David Kirsch says : " I had a client who was getting ready for the Oscars and all she ate was one meal a day - of two boiled eggs !
I was able to persuade her to add some almonds and a protein shake and some vitamin supplements .
" It 's a self - defeating strategy , you need to eat enough , and particularly protein , to build lean and toned muscle in the first place . "
They fast
Paris Hilton caused a stir when she walked into New York restaurant Nobu recently .
When a waiter asked the heiress for her order , he was quietly told : " Mineral water . "
In fact , over the course of her two - hour " meal " , Paris took sips of water and Red Bull - she did n't eat a single bite .
And she 's not alone .
Super - slim Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross was spotted dining at a restaurant a few years back with her now husband Tom Mahoney .
Lifelong battle : Marcia Cross describes not eating is ' a constant struggle '
According to one eyewitness : " He ordered sea bass and prawns , but she just sipped fruit juice . "
Marcia recently admitted to the pressure to be thin : " Not eating is a constant struggle .
It 's like they pay me not to eat .
It 's a living hell . "
Then there 's the master cleanse , otherwise known as the lemonade diet : water mixed with maple syrup , lemon juice and cayenne pepper .
Beyonce admitted following it for two weeks to drop one - and - a - half stone for the film Dreamgirls , and Jared Leto used it to shed the two stone he 'd gained to play Mark Chapman in the film Chapter 27 .
Gunnar Peterson calls it the " You 're an idiot " diet .
" I had a client who did it and I thought he was ill , " says Peterson .
" His skin was grey and his eyes had terrible dark circles under them .
He was shuffling when he walked , and this was after only ten days ! "
One of Hollywood 's dirty little secrets is the " IV diet " , in which celebrities check themselves into hospital to get put on an IV so they can avoid eating altogether .
Peterson says of the IV diet : " This is beyond ridiculous .
If you 're doing this you 're not fat , you 're crazy ! "
Suzanne Peck is the director of programmes at Homefield Grange Retreat , a cleansing spa in the UK that relies on juice - fasting .
She says : " Fasting is designed to rest the digestion , hence allowing clarity of thought , cleansing of toxins and healing of the body in general ; not to fit into a size - zero dress . "
They abuse laxative teas
Britney Spears has never been shy about her love for junk food and engages in all kinds of behaviour to counteract her taste for Taco Bell .
She smokes , drinks coffee and Red Bull , has diet pills in her bag and takes Adderall .
She has also been seen hitting all - night drugstores , shopping for laxatives .
And she is certainly not alone .
Today , many actresses are taking laxatives in the form of " dieter 's tea " , which has a mild laxative effect .
Some starlets are drinking up to ten cups a day .
Trainer Gelband says : " The latest trend among models is mixing laxative tea with the master cleanse diet .
All they drink is master cleanse and laxative tea . "
Such a drag : Katharine Heigl smokes regularly , a well known way of suppressing appetite
They chain - smoke
Grey 's Anatomy star Katherine Heigl looks to have lost a stone in the last year .
She may be following a healthy eating plan , but she appears to have a secret weapon - she smokes constantly .
A few days ago , the beautiful blonde was spotted having lunch in Los Angeles .
She ordered just a salad , but spent the meal chain - smoking .
Nowadays she is rarely photographed without a cigarette in her mouth , and when she is n't smoking , she is clutching a pack .
Marc David , nutritional psychologist and author of The Slow Down Diet says : " It 's a choice , really .
You are choosing possible lung cancer and death over treating your body with respect , all in an effort to be slim . "
They eat peanuts
Supermodel trainer Gelband admits : " I had one girl who was living on Diet Coke and peanuts .
She drank three to five Diet Cokes a day and ate a big bag of nuts .
If she got hungry , she smoked .
Her eyes had huge bags under them and she looked wasted .
When we tried to work out , we had to stop every five minutes .
It was awful . "
They guzzle caffeine
Paparazzi shots regularly show Hollywood 's skinniest actresses , such as Renee Zellweger and Mary - Kate Olsen , sporting giant sunglasses and regularly coming out of Starbucks clutching gigantic cups of coffee .
This is a trend in Hollywood , where many believe coffee not only speeds up their metabolism but also keeps them from eating .
" One client I had would eat almost nothing all day , she just drank coffee constantly , " says trainer to the stars Peterson .
" She 'd have some lettuce in the afternoon , and drink coffee instead of dinner .
Working out was a waste of time because of the state she was in . "
Marc David says : " Coffee and caffeine can actually make you fat .
If you 're drinking too much , the caffeine mimics the stress response in our bodies and your cortisol and insulin levels rise .
These elevated levels of stress hormone signal the body to store fat . "
They wear a patch
Peterson says : " I had one guy using a Nicorette patch , not to quit smoking but to stop food cravings !
This is a ridiculous approach and definitely wo n't work . "
Gym bunny :
To prepare for her role as Daisy Duke , Jessica Simpson worked out for two hours a day , six days a week
They live at the gym
Who can forget those photographs of a skeletal - looking Teri Hatcher jogging through Hollywood with weights in both hands and bones protruding - through her skin ?
Actress Kate Hudson , in a quest to shed the five stone she gained while pregnant with son Ryder , admitted to working out up to three hours daily for three months .
To prepare for her role as the sexy Daisy Duke , Jessica Simpson worked out for two hours a day , six days a week .
Justin Gelband says : " You can get addicted .
Unless you 're a professional athlete , you do n't need to do more than one - and - a - half hours a day to get a great result . "
Amber Kenain , general manager at Crunch gym in Hollywood , a celeb favourite , told Glamour magazine : " There 's one singer - actress who works out at my gym for about five hours a day , even on weekends .
She spent her birthday here . "
Peterson admits : " To be fair , a lot of the top women are doing the right things : eating healthy and exercising , but not obsessively .
It 's the up - and - comers who I see going to crazy extremes . "
He adds : " Forget trying to look like a celebrity - look at you .
The reality is , the girl that 's ten pounds overweight but loves her body is winning against the girl who is underweight but hates herself .
" There 's no straight guy in the world who knows the difference between a size 14 and a size 4 . "

The price of real gold is currently soaring Ethiopia 's national bank has been told to inspect all the gold in its vaults to determine its authenticity .
It follows the discovery that some of the " gold " it had bought for millions of dollars was gold - plated steel .
The first hint that something was wrong reportedly came when the Ethiopian central bank exported a consignment of gold bars to South Africa .
The South Africans sent them back , complaining that they had been sold gilded steel .
An investigation revealed that the bank had bought a consignment of fake gold from a supplier , who is now under arrest .
Other arrests followed , including business associates of the main accused ; national bank officials ; and chemists from the Geological Survey of Ethiopia , whose job it is to assay the bank 's purchases of gold and certify that they are real .
But what has clearly now got the government even more worried is that another different batch of gold in the bank 's vaults has also been found to be fake , and this time it was gold which had been there for several years , after being seized from smugglers trying to take it to Djibouti .
Mining
The Ethiopian parliament 's budget and finance committee ordered the inspection of all gold in the national bank 's vaults .
A report from the auditor - general on the affair is expected to be presented to parliament during its current session .
Gold is mined in Ethiopia in considerable quantities , and a trader selling gold to the central bank has to have it tested and certified by the Geological Survey .
Whether the bank bought fake gold in the first place , or whether real gold from the vaults has been swapped for gilded steel , the fraud has cost the bank many millions of dollars , and it must have involved collusion on a considerable scale .

What are these ?
“ AROUND mid-morning on Pentecost , June 8th of 1783 , in clear and calm weather , a black haze of sand appeared to the north of the mountains .
The cloud was so extensive that in a short time it had spread over the entire area and so thick that it caused darkness indoors .
That night , strong earthquakes and tremors occurred . ”
Thus begins the eyewitness account of one of the most remarkable episodes of climate change ever seen .
It was written by a Lutheran priest , Jon Steingrimsson , in the Sida district of southern Iceland .
At nine o'clock that morning , the earth split open along a 16 - mile fissure called the Laki volcano .
Over the next eight months , in a series of vast belches , more lava gushed through the fissure than from any volcano in historic times — 15 cubic kilometres , enough to bury the whole island of Manhattan to the top of the Rockefeller Centre .
Pentecost is the Christian festival celebrating the appearance of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles with the sound , the Bible says , “ as of a mighty rushing wind ” and an appearance “ like as of fire ” .
But there was nothing metaphorical or festive about the winds and fire of the Laki eruption .
It was the greatest calamity in Iceland 's history .
“ The flood of fire ” , Steingrimsson writes , “ flowed with the speed of a great river swollen with meltwater on a spring day . ”
It was rather as if the world 's largest steelworks had begun pouring molten metal all over the neighbourhood .
When the lava stream ran into water or marshes , “ the explosions were as loud as if many cannon were fired at one time . ”
When it hit an obstacle , such as older lava fields , great gouts of molten metal were flung in the air , splashing back to earth , he says , “ like cowpats ” .
But the damage to Iceland was only the start of a much greater trail of destruction that was eventually to reach halfway round the world , from the Altai mountains of Siberia to the Gulf of Mexico .
There are two sorts of volcanic eruptions , explosive and effusive .
The well - known sort is explosive .
It has the greater force .
Explosions of this sort destroyed Pompeii and star in Hollywood films .
Their sheer power throws volcanic gases and ash far into the stratosphere ( the higher reaches of the atmosphere ) , where they absorb incoming radiation and cool the earth until they dissipate after two or three years .
The eruption of Krakatoa caused record snowfalls round the world .
Effusive volcanic eruptions are different .
They simmer with less force , but produce a greater volume of debris .
Laki belched out clouds of volcanic gases 80 times greater than Mount St Helens , though Mount St Helens had much greater explosive power .
But because Laki was weaker , three - quarters of the gas reached only as far as the lower atmosphere ( the troposphere ) , the level at which rain , ordinary clouds and surface winds are carried .
The gases included enormous quantities of sulphur dioxide ; at its peak , the eruption produced as much in two days as European industry produces in a year .
Part of this dissolved in the vapour of the clouds to form sulphuric acid .
Within a few hours , the Laki volcano had produced a vast plume of acid rain , brooding over the skies of southern Iceland .
In the normal course of events , the prevailing winds would have blown this poisonous plume northwards , towards the Arctic Circle .
But the summer of 1783 was not normal .
A stable ridge of high pressure had settled over north - east Europe , pulling the winds , and the Laki cloud , south - east , towards the European mainland .
What happened next can be recreated in great detail because in the late 18th century diaries were fashionable among the newly literate middle classes and the circulation of newspapers was rising even in small towns ; there was also growing scientific interest in the natural world , with educated amateurs keeping detailed notes of natural phenomena .
From such records , one can track the course of the Laki cloud literally day by day ( see map ) .
On June 10th wrote Sæmundur Magnusson Holm at the University of Copenhagen , falling ash coloured black the deck and sails of ships travelling to Denmark .
The same day , a Lutheran priest in Norway , Johan Brun , reported that falling ash had withered the grass and leaves in Bergen .
Six days later , Anton Strnadt reported that “ the dry fog ” came up over the river Moldau into Prague while Nicolas von Beguelin reported its first appearance in Berlin the day afterwards .
“ The sun ” , he wrote , “ was dull in its shine and coloured as if it had been soaked in blood . ”
By June 18th the winds seem to have been blowing the cloud south and west .
Robert de Lamanon , a French botanist and explorer , wrote from Laon , in northern France , that “ the fog was cold and humid , with the wind coming from the south , and one could with ease look at the sun with a telescope without a blackened lens . ”
De Lamanon said fog — “ such as the oldest men here have not seen before ” — first appeared that day in Paris , Turin and Padua , from where Giuseppe Toaldo wrote that the whole of northern Italy was covered by the haze and smelled of sulphur .
The first mention of the haze in Britain came on June 22nd when Henry Bryant wrote to the Norfolk Chronicle that “ there was an uncommon gloom in the air , with dead calm and very profuse dew . ”
Gilbert White , a Hampshire clergyman , noted in his diaries for the 23rd that “ the blades of wheat in several fields are turned yellow and look as if scorched with frost . ”
By June 26th Leonhard Euler , a Swiss mathematician , reported a “ dry fog ” in St Petersburg .
By the end of the month , the cloud had reached Moscow and Tripoli in Syria , according to a Dutch professor , S.P. van Swinden , whose “ Observations on the Cloud which Appeared in 1783 ” says that “ a very thick haze covered both land and sea ; the sun could be seen rarely , and always with a bloody colour , which was rare in Syria . ”
Finally , on July 1st , the haze appeared at Baghdad and in the Altai mountains , according to a geologist , Ivan Michaelovich Renovantz , who reported unseasonable frosts in Central Asia .
By then , back in Europe , the cloud had thickened .
This was not a plume like that from Chernobyl , which appeared in one vast belch , spread over Europe and blew away .
After its initial effusion , Laki erupted again , more violently , on June 11th and with still greater force on the 14th .
Ferenc Weiss , a Hungarian meteorologist , was right to speculate that “ the thick fog was being continually replenished ” .
There were to be ten big eruptions between June 8th and the end of October , followed by a series of rumblings that exhausted themselves only in February 1784 .
As the cloud approached western Europe , it was sucked down in a spiral pattern towards the Earth 's surface , producing a thick haze near ground level .
By mid-summer , the “ dry fog ” had settled on Europe like a blanket ; it was to stay there throughout the summer .
Europeans reacted in different ways .
Steingrimsson was in no doubt : the eruption was “ the Lord 's chastisement ” .
On the fourth Sunday after Pentecost , with the lava advancing down the valley towards his church “ which was shaking and quaking from the cataclysm ” , he gathered his flock for Sunday service , as usual .
“ Both myself and all the others in the church were completely unafraid , ” he writes .
“ No one showed any signs of leaving during the service , which I had made slightly longer than usual . ”
On emerging , the congregation found that two rivers , blocked by the lava flow , had changed course and poured down , dousing the lava and stopping it yards from the church door .
( Two centuries later , Icelanders created the same obstacle by artificial means to save a town threatened by another eruption . )
“ From this day onwards the fire did no major damage to my parish in any way . ”
“ The miracle of the fire sermon ” became well known and sermons on the freakish cloud common .
“ You stare at the sky and at the horizon veiled in dark exhalations , ” Johann Georg Gottlob Schwarz admonished his audience in Alsfeld , Germany .
“ The Lord speaks daily to us and reveals in Nature his omniscience . ”
The end is nigh
The expressions of faith were driven partly by alarm , even terror .
“ Some fear to go to bed , expecting an Earthquake ; some declare that [ the sun ] neither rises nor sets where he did , and assert with great confidence that the day of judgment is at hand , ” wrote an English poet , William Cowper .
Parishioners near Broué , in northern France , dragged their priest out of bed and forced him to perform a rite of exorcism on the cloud .
After rains brought temporary relief in Antwerp , the Gazette van Antwerpen reported that public prayers were held to bring more .
Alarm and misapprehension were not confined to the illiterate .
The British government , fearing a plague outbreak , drew up plans to close the ports to traffic from the continent .
Nor were popular fears mere superstition .
The parish records of the English midlands reveal a spike in the number of deaths during July and August 1783 , though summer is normally the time of lowest mortality in agricultural societies .
Around 23,000 more English people died than would have been expected that year , doubling the normal death toll .
In France , on some estimates , 5 % of the population died that summer .
Unusually , the deaths included young men and women working in the fields , breathing polluted air in stifling heat .
In Japan , the famine was so severe that special crews had to be hired to clear the roads of the dead
In general , though , “ the Connoscenti ” , ( Cowper 's term ) sought rational explanations for the haze , rather than the consolations of religion .
A French naturalist was the first to connect the fog to volcanic activity in Iceland in a lecture at Montpellier as early as August 7th .
In Paris , meteorologists “ desirous of making some observations of the atmosphere , had a sort of kite flown to a great height after which it was drawn in , covered with innumerable small black insects . ”
In an apparent attempt to allay panic , a French astronomer , Jerome de Lalande , wrote a paper arguing the unusual weather was “ nothing more than the very natural effect from a hot sun after a long supersession of heavy rain ” ( he was wrong ) .
Everywhere , educated men left detailed descriptions of the cloud cover ; of the unusual appearance of the sun ( “ ferruginous ” said White ; “ the face of a hot salamander ” said Cowper ) ; and of the scorching of leaves and grass and the state of the harvest and livestock .
By the end of October , the last of the big eruptions at Laki was over , and the haze began to dissipate , blown by the autumn winds .
It was the end of the cloud but not the end of the damage .
One of the gases the volcano threw up was fluorine , which fell quickly back to earth as hydrofluoric acid .
In Iceland , this had horrible results .
“ The horses lost all their flesh , ” Steingrimsson wrote , “ the skin began to rot off along the spines .
The sheep were affected even more wretchedly .
There was hardly a part on them free of swellings , especially their jaws , so large that they protruded through the skin ... Both bones and gristle were as soft as if they had been chewed . ”
Half the horses and cattle and three - quarters of the sheep on the island died .
As famine took hold , social bonds began to fray .
To protect his remaining cattle , Steingrimsson slept in the cowshed “ since thieves were on the prowl . ”
In all , a quarter of Iceland 's population was to die of starvation , including Steingrimsson 's beloved wife of 31 years .
“ When I lost my wonderful wife ” , he writes , “ everything , so to speak , collapsed around me . ”
In Europe , the summer of 1783 had been unusually warm , the warmest recorded in England before 1995 .
White called the season “ an amazing and portentous one , full of horrible phenomena ” , and complained of the abnormal number of wasps .
The heat may have been a short - term greenhouse - gas effect from high concentrations of sulphur dioxide .
Or it may have just been natural variation .

What is more certain is that , high in the atmosphere , the volcanic gases reflected away some of the sun 's radiation even after the cloud had dissipated at lower levels .
This back - scattering was to have a bigger impact on the climate than the summer cloud itself .
The winters that followed the Laki eruption were freakishly cold .
At the time , some people suspected the volcano might be to blame .
Benjamin Franklin , then America 's ambassador to Paris , wrote to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester that “ [ the sun 's ] effect of heating the Earth was exceedingly diminished .
Hence the surface was early frozen .
Hence the first snows remained on it unmelted .
Hence the air was more chilled .
Hence perhaps the winter of 1783 - 84 was more severe than any that had happened for many years . ”
In speculating upon the cause , he wondered “ whether it was the vast quantity of smoke , long continuing to issue during the summer from Hecla in Iceland [ near Laki ] ” .
It was .
On average , temperatures in Europe during 1784 were about 2 °C below the norm of the second half of the 18th century ; and the closer to Iceland , the bigger the impact .
Iceland itself was almost 5 °C colder than normal and saw the longest period of sea ice around the island ever recorded .
Berlin and Geneva , about 1,300 miles away , were 2 º C below normal , whereas the anomaly in Vienna , 1,700 miles from Laki , was only 1.5°C .
Stockholm and Copenhagen , the nearest cities at just over 1,000 miles distant , saw temperatures drop by over 3°C .
Beyond Europe Laki's biggest influence seems to have operated over the greatest distances .
The light - scattering effects of volcanic gases in the upper atmosphere reduced the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth and disrupted the normal relationship between temperatures both at the upper and lower levels of the atmosphere , and between the poles and the equator .
These are the engines of the weather .
Disruptions to them weakened the westerly jet streams , altered the monsoons and affected the weather throughout the northern hemisphere .
The eastern United States suffered one of its longest and coldest winters , with temperatures almost 5 °C below average .
George Washington , who had just disbanded his victorious army and retired to Mount Vernon , complained that he was “ locked up ” there by snow and ice between Christmas Eve and early March , while James Madison wrote from his home in Virginia that “ we have had a severer season and particularly a greater quantity of snow than is remembered to have distinguished any preceding winter . ”
The St Lawrence river froze for a dozen miles far inland .
In Charleston , South Carolina , which nowadays grinds to a halt with a light dusting of snow , the harbour froze hard enough to skate on .
Most extraordinary of all , ice floes floated down the Mississippi , past New Orleans and out into the Gulf of Mexico .
The eastern United States recovered fairly quickly , but places farther afield were not so lucky .
Japan suffered one of the three worst famines in its history in 1783 - 86 , when exceptional cold destroyed the rice harvest and as many as 1 m people died .
Special crews had to be hired to clear the roads of the dead .
In Japan this famine is usually attributed to another volcanic eruption , that of Mount Asama , but its impact was small compared with Laki's .
Tree-ring evidence from the Urals , the Yamal peninsula in Siberia and Alaska all suggests northern areas had their coldest summer for 400 to 500 years .
The oral history of the Kauwerak tribe of north - western Alaska calls 1783 “ the year summer did not come ” ; the tribe was almost wiped out .
Because of disruption to the monsoons , rainfall in the Nile watershed was down by almost a fifth and in the Niger watershed by more than a tenth .
In his “ Travels through Syria and Egypt ” , Count Constantine Volney , a French orientalist , wrote that “ the [ Nile ] inundation of 1783 was not sufficient , great part of the lands therefore could not be sown for want of being watered .
In 1784 , the Nile again did not rise to favourable height , and the dearth immediately became excessive .
Soon after the end of November , the famine carried off , at Cairo , nearly as many as the plague . ”
By January 1785 , he says , a sixth of Egypt 's population had either perished or fled .
In Europe , the Laki eruption was not to leave an indelible mark .
Within a few years , weather patterns returned to normal and Europeans had forgotten the extraordinary “ dry fog ” .
But in retrospect , the eruption can be seen to exemplify certain truths about climate change .
Polluting gases can change global temperatures a lot ( in this case by cooling , not warming ) .
Volcanic gases can do as much damage as any amount of human activity .
But the poisonous cloud was only part of the story .
Weather patterns mattered too .
Stable anti-cyclones brought the gas to earth in Europe and stratospheric currents then spread it over a third of the globe .
And the connections between pollution and weather are complex and unpredictable : people at the time understood the link between the volcano and the haze , but not the connection with events the other side of the globe .
Societies are hit very differently : the impact was modest in most of Europe , but devastating in Egypt , Japan and Alaska .
Lastly , people react to environmental disruption in ways that are themselves disruptive .
As the Icelanders struggled to return to normal in the summer of 1785 , the country 's superintendent ordered the paupers of neighbouring districts to be moved to Steingrimsson 's area , though there was no food .
In desperation , he says , “ we held counsel and decided to head east to the beaches .
A single man who was there ahead of us , a farmer from Stapafell called Eirikur , had on that day clubbed 70 adult seals and 120 pups on the beaches .
I held a service in Kalfafell in the finest weather we experienced during that time where all of us gladly thanked God for His mercy in so richly providing for us in this barren land and so agreeably removing all the famine and death which otherwise awaited . ”

( CNN ) --
An Australian woman pleaded guilty Thursday to fatally stabbing her boyfriend because he objected to her listening to Bruce Springsteen 's music .
Bruce Springsteen is an award - winning American singer - songwriter .
The national news agency , Australian Associated Press , reported that the Supreme Court in the city of Brisbane sentenced Karen Lee Cooper to eight years in prison .
Cooper told arresting officers she " just got tired " of her boyfriend , Kevin Watson , bossing her around during their two - year relationship .
" I could n't even play Bruce Springsteen on my stereo .
Can you believe that ?
Can you believe that ? "
Cooper told police , according to the Courier Mail newspaper .
Later , in a formal police interview , she repeated her claims : " I mean , who does n't like Bruce Springsteen ?
I am 49 years old and I want to play my own music . "
Springsteen is an award - winning American singer - songwriter , best known for his lyrics about the struggles of the common man .
The couple had been drinking at their rental home the night of the stabbing two years ago when they began arguing over Cooper 's choice of music , the Australian Associated Press said .
Cooper 's lawyer told the court she experienced a " brain snap . "
She ran to the kitchen , grabbed a knife and stabbed Watson , 49 , after he said he did n't want her to listen to a Springsteen CD , the newspaper said .
Cooper took a handful of pills before calling police .
She told officers she hoped the pills would kill her before they arrived .
According to the press reports , Cooper regretted the stabbing and did not think her boyfriend deserved to die .

THE problem was Paola .
I met her at an Italian restaurant in my neighborhood in Brooklyn , where she was a devastatingly cute waitress and I a frequent customer  and not just because of the devastatingly cute waitress .
The food was good , too .
The restaurant was owned and operated and even staffed by actual Italians .
One time , Paola let on that she gave Italian lessons on the side .
I had studied in Florence in college and nurtured an abiding interest in Italian language , food and culture .
So , not wanting to be the creepy guy who asks the waitress out , I signed up for Italian lessons .
That way , I would just be the creepy guy who asks the tutor out .
That was way better .
After some stops and starts and wacky misunderstandings involving language , food and culture , we were in something like love and living together in a loft in Greenpoint , Brooklyn .
We broke up once , then got back together .
A few years into the relationship , I jotted down these thoughts : “ I need a better quality pen to write about Paola .
What kind of person is she ?
Besides the obvious .
The strength .
The beauty .
The individuality .
The fierceness of her intellect .
The confidence that may or may not be real .
How she straddles multiple worlds refusing to be either citizen or stranger in any .
Men look at her with something bordering on adoration .
She has the ability to show unrestrained joy and still look cool .
When she wears a certain hat , she looks like a woman out of time , which suits her well .
I need a better pen still . ”
7 Step Framework to Coding Skills Acquisition

WASHINGTON — I ’ve said it before , but it bears repeating : People in Washington really should get out more .
By “ Washington , ” I mean not just the city but the state of mind , and by “ get out , ” I mean spend time surrounded not just by a different geography but by a different demography as well .
If we did , the high - blown debates we have here — and by “ we , ” I mean politicians , lobbyists , advocates , bureaucrats , scholars , journalists and all the rest trapped in the Washington echo chamber — might bear more relation to what people who live outside our bubble think of as reality .
Case in point :
When former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated last week , Washington tied itself in knots trying to figure out which presidential candidates on the Democratic and Republican sides would benefit in the Iowa caucuses .
This was the kind of shocking event that could prove pivotal , said the conventional wisdom in Washington — with pro forma apologies , of course , for implying that Bhutto ’s death would actually be “ good , ” in terms of political advantage , for one campaign or another .
But when I was in Iowa last weekend , I failed to find Iowans for whom the tragic events in Rawalpindi were a political issue .
It ’s not that Iowans do n’t recognize why instability in Pakistan is important or why it might impact their lives .
It ’s just that they had put the shocking murder in what they considered its proper context .
Another example :
In Washington , it is conventionally wise to think of government gridlock as basically a good thing , even something of which most Americans approve .
To have a president from one party and a Congress controlled — or at least reined in — by the other , we tell ourselves , prevents too - abrupt shifts in policy .
Gridlock is supposed to force bipartisan consensus , which is held as a kind of Holy Grail , the only way to tackle the nation ’s biggest problems .
But tell that to Iowans — or residents of most states , for that matter — who either do n’t have health insurance or ca n’t get the insurance companies to pay their medical bills .
Tell it to Arizonans , who have pressed their state government to implement its own immigration policy — shouldering what is clearly a federal responsibility — because Washington ca n’t get its act together .
Tell it to military families , some in favor of the war in Iraq and some against , whose lives have been turned upside down by extended deployments with no end in sight .
There are n’t many people in Washington ( the state of mind ) who spend sleepless nights worrying about sons , daughters or other loved ones serving in Iraq .
Even though there are suburbs within 20 miles of the Capitol where illegal immigration is a passionate , hot - button issue , most in Washington think of the problem in academic terms .
And just about everyone in state - of - mind Washington has top - notch health insurance ; members of Congress enjoy a comprehensive plan that one might be tempted to call “ socialized medicine , ” since a large portion of the costs are borne by taxpayers .
We in Washington are increasingly isolated from the people in whose interest we claim to labor .
The economic gap between us and most of the country is widening to a chasm .
In most American cities , a $ 600,000 house in a leafy neighborhood would be considered an extravagance reserved for the wealthy .
Here , we ’d call it an incredible bargain .
The word “ change ” has had great resonance in the Iowa campaign .
In part , the yearning for change arises because George W. Bush has led the nation down so many dead - end paths .
But from the conversations I had with Iowans , it seemed clear to me that change is also shorthand for the disconnect between the Washington state of mind and the widespread expectation , hardly unreasonable , that this city ought to actually get something done every once in a while .
Whether it gets done after a bare - knuckles brawl or a chorus of “ Kumbaya ” really does n’t matter .
In Iowa , it felt weird to be part of an alien invasion of know - it - alls from Washington who descended to examine the locals as if they were specimens in a laboratory .
But we should do it more often , even when there is n’t a presidential campaign going on — as long as we stop listening exclusively to one another , and hear other voices as well .

WASHINGTON , March 25 ( Reuters ) - Iraq has emerged as a more stable country than Afghanistan , thanks to lower violence , the presence of a large U.S. - led international force and high oil prices , according to a report published on Tuesday .
The report by the British - based Jane 's Information Group ranked Afghanistan as the world 's third most - unstable country after the Gaza Strip and West Bank , and Somalia .
By contrast , Iraq was at No. 22 where it appeared among several African countries including Niger , Nigeria , Burundi and Equatorial Guinea .
The report , titled " Jane 's Country Risk Ratings , " was the first of its kind for the publisher and contained no comparison figures .
But a June 2007 ranking of failed states by Foreign Policy magazine called Iraq the world 's second - most unstable country with Afghanistan at No. 8 .
Meanwhile , the United States failed to rank among the top tier of the world 's most stable countries in the ratings , which measured 235 countries , territories and entities according to two - dozen stability factors .
Vatican City was ranked most stable , followed by Sweden , Luxembourg and Monaco .
But Jane 's judged the United States to be only the 22nd most stable country -- just below Australia and Portugal -- due to international drug trafficking and the proliferation of small arms within U.S. society .
" Iraq is more stable than Afghanistan , " said Christian Le Miere , managing editor of Jane 's Country Risk , which complied the ratings .
He said Iraq has benefiting from several stabilizing factors including the world 's highest number of international troops per capita , an economy buoyed by high oil prices and a sharp decline in violence .
" With the combination of international troops , the government can extend its will to any area under its administration , " he said .
" Compare that to Afghanistan , where the government has less control over its territory , the economy is made up by some estimates about 50 percent from opium and has very little to draw on for resources . "
Afghan violence has grown steadily over the last two years to the highest level since U.S. - led forces ousted Taliban rule after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 , despite the presence of 43,000 NATO - led troops .
But in Iraq , violence is down more than 60 percent since last summer when the Bush administration completed its buildup of forces known as " the surge . "
There are currently about 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq .
U.S. officials attribute the drop in violence to several factors including the troop build - up , a cease - fire by anti-U.S. radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al Sadr and the emergence of U.S. - allied Sunni tribesmen .
The Bush administration is now in the process of withdrawing five combat brigades from Iraq by July and could draw down more troops later in 2008 after an expected pause .

Dear Citizens of America ,
In view of your failure to elect a competent President and thus to govern yourselves , we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence , effective immediately .
Her Sovereign Majesty , Queen Elizabeth II , will resume monarchical duties over all states , commonwealths and other territories ( except Kansas , which she does not fancy ) , as from Monday next .
Your new prime minister , Gordon Brown , will appoint a governor for America without the need for further elections .
Congress and the Senate will be disbanded .
A questionnaire may be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed .
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency , the following rules are introduced with immediate effect :
1 . You should look up “ revocation ” in the Oxford English Dictionary .
Then look up “ aluminium , ” and check the pronunciation guide .
You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it .
2 . The letter ‘ U ’ will be reinstated in words such as ‘ colour ’ , ‘ favour ’ and ‘ neighbour . ’
Likewise , you will learn to spell ‘ doughnut ’ without skipping half the letters , and the suffix “ ize ” will be replaced by the suffix “ ise . ”
3 . You will learn that the suffix ‘ burgh ’ is pronounced ‘ burra ’ ; you may elect to spell Pittsburgh as ‘ Pittsberg ’ if you find you simply can’t cope with correct pronunciation .
4 . Generally , you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels ( look up “ vocabulary ” ) .
Using the same twenty - seven words interspersed with filler noises such as “ like ” and “ you know ” is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication .
5 . There is no such thing as “ US English . ”
We will let Microsoft know on your behalf .
The Microsoft spell - checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter ‘ u’ and the elimination of “ - ize . ”
6 . You will relearn your original national anthem , “ God Save The Queen ” ,
but only after fully carrying out Task # 1 ( see above ) .
7. July 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday .
November 2nd will
be a new national holiday , but to be celebrated only in England .
It will be called “ Come - Uppance Day . ”
8 . You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns , lawyers or therapists .
The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you ’re not adult enough to be independent .
Guns should only be handled by adults .
If you ’re not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist then you ’re not grown up enough to handle a gun .
9 . Therefore , you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous than a vegetable peeler .
A permit will be required if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public .
10 . All American cars are hereby banned .
They are crap and this is for your own good .
When we show you German cars , you will understand what we mean .
11 . All intersections will be replaced with roundabouts , and you will start driving on the left with immediate effect .
At the same time , you will go metric immediately and without the benefit of conversion tables …
Both roundabouts and metrification will help you understand the British sense of humour .
12 . The Former USA will adopt UK prices on petrol ( which you have been calling “ gasoline ” ) – roughly $ 8 / US per gallon .
Get used to it .
13 .
You will learn to make real chips .
Those things you call french fries are not real chips , and those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called “ crisps . ”
Real chips are thick cut , fried in animal fat , and dressed not with catsup but with malt vinegar .
14 . Waiters and waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers .
15 .
The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all .
Henceforth , only proper British Bitter will be referred to as “ beer , ” and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as “ Lager . ”
American brands will be referred to as “ Near - Frozen Gnat ’s Urine , ” so that all can be sold without risk of further confusion .
16 . Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as good guys .
Hollywood will also be required to cast English actors as English characters .
Watching Andie MacDowell attempt English dialogue in “ Four Weddings and a Funeral ” was an experience akin to having one ’s ear removed with a cheese grater .
17 .
You will cease playing American “ football . ”
There is only one kind of proper football ; you call it “ soccer ” .
Those of you brave enough , in time , will be allowed to play rugby ( which has some similarities to American “ football ” , but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like a
bunch of Jessies – English slang for “ Big Girls Blouse ” ) .
18 . Further , you will stop playing baseball .
It is not reasonable to host an event called the “ World Series ” for a game which is not played outside of America .
Since only 2.1 % of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders , your error is understandable and forgiven .
19 .
You must tell us who killed JFK .
It ’s been driving us mad .
20 .
An internal revenue agent ( i.e. tax collector ) from Her Majesty ’s Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all monies due , backdated to 1776 .
Thank you for your co-operation .

THE Socceroos got their World Cup qualifying campaign off to the best possible start tonight , playing their best football since their heroics in Germany to beat Qatar 3 - 0 at Telstra Dome .
In their first World Cup campaign through Asia , Australia 's stars put aside a limited preparation and their late arrivals from Europe to dominate the Qataris from start to finish .
Goals to Josh Kennedy , Tim Cahill and Mark Bresciano put the Socceroos three goals up inside the first 33 minutes as they played polished football reminiscent of their time under Guus Hiddink .

Soma Devi Dura needs medical treatment
None of the rest of Soma Devi Dura 's family speak Dura , despite being from the same ethnic group .
The only other person who could speak the language died last August .
Now Soma Devi Dura 's health is ailing at her home in the hills of western Nepal , and she has severely impaired sight and hearing .
Surprises
But the 82 - year - old is a rich source of songs and folklore in the Dura tongue .
In order to communicate with her husband , children and grandchildren she has to use other languages , because she is now believed to be the only surviving speaker of Dura , which belongs to the Tibeto - Burman language family .
The only other Dura speaker died in August
Languages decline like this when parents fail to pass them down or children lose interest in them .
But some scholars are striving to preserve Dura .
Kedar Nagila , who as a child played with Dura children who had already lost their language , has compiled 1,500 words and 250 sentences .
He wants to take Soma Devi to Kathmandu for medical treatment , and to interest Dura children in taking lessons in the language .
' Amazingly fluent '
Nepal has more than 100 tongues , several with fewer than 100 speakers each .
Research can throw up surprises .
Recently the three recorded speakers of another language , Kusunda , all died or disappeared .
But campaigners for indigenous rights went to western Nepal and found a mother and daughter speaking it , and an isolated woman in a different district .
They were brought together , and the woman was able to converse in Kusunda for the first time since 1940 , when she was 10 years old .
Linguistics Professor Madhav Prasad Pokharel said she was " amazingly fluent " .
Although he has been inspired by the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language , he admits that reviving these tiny Nepalese languages is unlikely .
But he argues fervently that they can and should be preserved and taught .
After one of the worst starts to any year in recent memory , talk of big opportunities and a second - half rebound is beginning to percolate on Wall Street .
The S&P 500 lost about 6 percent during January , the worst performance since 1990 .
With all that lost value , a few bulls are stirring .
The theory , care of the Wall Street Journal ( subscription required ) , goes like this : Horrible earnings today could spell a sizable recovery in second - half results as healthier firms outpace the worsening opinions of equity analysts .
Despite fourth - quarter earnings in the S&P falling nearly 20 percent , the financial and housing sectors are to blame for most of that drop .
Healthcare , tech , and energy all showed solid gains .
Last week the S&P roared back , thanks mostly to the Federal Reserve 's massive interest rate cuts .
So will that mini-rally continue ?
Bears beg to differ .
Merrill Lynch 's David Rosenberg says his team is " more than happy to take the other side of that debate , " citing the 2001 - 02 period , which saw " no fewer than six " small , monthlong rallies during a bear market .
The problem is that any big earnings recovery later in the year is also predicated on an economic one .
After January 's dismal reports of falling employment and a surprise slump in the service sector , that 's looking less likely .
Today , the Institute for Supply Management 's nonmanufacturing activity index fell to 41.9 from 54.4 , the lowest since the survey started in October 2001 .
All the index 's components , from jobs to new orders , plummeted as well .
Still , if you believe the best time to buy is when there 's blood in the streets , there 's some agreement from one of Wall Street 's most respected players .
Financier Wilbur Ross told the Financial Times ( subscription required ) recently that the biggest names in " vulture investing , " like Warren Buffett and Ron Perelman , might be ready to pounce on a host of battered investments .
Ross told the FT he 's eyeing the monoline insurers , the latest sector to get crushed under the wave of the U.S. housing recession .
MEXICO CITY  Biologist Karen Krebbs used to study bats at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument on the Arizona - Mexico border .
Then she got tired of dodging drug smugglers all night .
" I use night - vision goggles and you could see them very clearly , " Krebbs said of the caravans of men with guns and huge backpacks full of drugs , trudging through the desert .
After taking refuge in bushes or behind rocks on 10 or so occasions , Krebbs abandoned her research .
" I 'm just not willing to risk my neck anymore , " she said .
Along the U.S. - Mexican border , scientists like Krebbs say their work is under growing threat from drug traffickers and other criminals who have been pushed into remote areas by tighter U.S. border security .
Richard Felger , a botanist , said he stays away from remote mountains in the Mexican border state of Sonora after being robbed and threatened on research trips .
" I got kind of allergic to pistols being held to my forehead , " Felger said .
There are no statistics on how many scientists have been attacked or threatened , said Mark Frankel , director of the scientific freedom program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
But among researchers , stories of theft and armed robbery are common .
" In the last year it has gotten much worse , " said Jack Childs , who studies endangered jaguars in eastern Arizona with infrared cameras .
He loses one or two of the cameras every month to smugglers .
Childs has tried leaving notes and pictures of saints — even Jesús Malverde , the unofficial , folklore saint of drug traffickers — to try to persuade smugglers to spare his cameras , but to no avail .
Each camera costs $ 450 .
Scientists long have shared the border area with marijuana growers and immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally .
But tension is rising because of a crackdown on smugglers by the Mexican military , new border fences , patrols by unmanned planes , a buildup of U.S. Border Patrol agents and a turf war between cartels .
" It 's a kind of arms race , and biologists are stuck in the middle , " said Jim Malusa , who specializes in mapping desert vegetation .
" There has been a chilling effect on researchers . "
Michael Wilson , a botanist and director of research at the Drylands Institute in Tucson , said he avoids some parts of Mexico 's Sonora state after seeing opium poppies , which are not native to Mexico , and mules carrying loads of marijuana down from the mountains .
Opium resin is used to make heroin .
Wilson said he has noticed an increase of marijuana cultivation in recent years , and more people watching over the fields .
Some of his colleagues now carry guns , he said .
" There are a lot of researchers who have ducked out of doing research in Mexico , " Wilson said .
Scientists working at sea have also had their work disrupted .
Jeffrey Seminoff , an ecologist with the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service , said smugglers have robbed boat fuel from his researchers at gunpoint in the Gulf of California , leaving them just enough gas to get back to shore .
In May , Seminoff stumbled across a camouflaged drug boat in a cave near San Carlos , Sonora , while setting nets for sea turtles .
" They definitely had guns , so we just kind of backed off .
So one of our primary turtle capturing sites we had to abandon for the day , " he said .
One day can be a serious loss to researchers , who are often short of time and grant money .
Anglers are increasingly getting involved in drug smuggling because Mexican fisheries have collapsed , said Wallace J. Nichols , a marine biologist at the California Academy of Sciences .
He used to collect much information on sea turtle sightings from fishing boats off Baja California but now avoids boats that look too new .
The resulting paralysis is creating gaps in scientific knowledge , researchers complain .
Huge swaths of northwestern Mexico are now off - limits to science , said Andrés Búrquez , a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .
" The most serious problem is when you have to visit a specific place in the countryside , places of geological interest , " he said .
Residents " will say , ' You can go to A , B and C place , but not D. '
And it turns out that 's the place that interests you most . "
Dean Hendrickson , an ichthyologist at the University of Texas , says avoiding marijuana and poppy fields has set back his efforts to study mysterious species of Mexican trout in Chihuahua state .
" This sort of stuff definitely puts holes in our sampling , " Hendrickson said .
" The drug stuff is definitely affecting research . "
Hawley is Latin America correspondent for USA TODAY and The Arizona Republic Enlarge By Pat Shannahan , The Arizona Republic Karen Krebbs nets a bat at Arizona 's Chiricahua National Monument in May .
She since has abandoned research near the Mexican border .
" I 'm just not willing to risk my neck anymore , " Krebbs says .

Israelis may be suing their government , to get a chemical laser cannon , ASAP .
But the project that many observers believe offers the best hope of producing a working laser weapon is making steady progress .
A battlefield - strength version of the system may be ready for testing by the end of the year , according to its maker , Northrop Grumman .
Chemical - powered lasers , like the one the Israelis are hoping to get , produce massively - powerful laser blasts .
But the noxious stuff needed to produce all that power makes the weapons pretty much impractical in a war zone .
So the Defense Department is pouring money into solid - state , electric lasers instead .
In the past , these beams have been too weak to do soldiers much good .
But Northrop appears to be getting close to hitting what 's widely considered to be the threshold for military - grade beams : 100 kilowatts .
Northrop 's system combines a bunch of smaller lasers into a bigger one – Death Star - style , sorta .
The first of these eight " laser chains " is now done , the company says .
The rest will be ready for 100 kilowatt testing before 2008 is over .
" That will be a significant milestone ; but there will still be some way to go before Northrop 's concepts of laser air - defense vehicles or fighter raygun pods reach service , " Lew Page notes .
" Such vehicles will need at least half a megawatt of electric power ( the Northrop gear 's electro - optical efficiency is quoted at 20 per cent ) , so they wo n't be small or lightweight : more like heavy battle tanks , nowadays rather out of fashion . "
According to a new survey by the Center for Defense Information , the Pentagon is asking for $ 177 million in unclassified energy weapons research in 2009 .
The size of the classified budget is unknown .

Governor Schwarzenegger 's plan could prove too ambitious
With Congress stalled on enacting a nationwide plan , individual states are starting to take matters into their own hands .
In California , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has just won approval from legislators for a major healthcare reform which will expand coverage to most of the state 's uninsured .
It took nearly a year of sometimes fractious haggling , but legislators in America 's most populous state have done what many predicted they could not
They have approved a bill to extend health insurance to virtually everyone in the nation 's most populous state - all 36 million of them .
True , the measure has still to be approved by the state Senate and ratified in a popular vote , but it is nonetheless a considerable achievement .
A national template ?
A jubilant Arnold Schwarzenegger emerged to hail the vote a " giant step forward " .
LA 's Skid Row area has become notorious for ' patient dumping '
He believes the un-glamorously titled Health Care Security and Cost Reduction
Act could eventually provide a template for the entire nation .
But ironically , the greatest opposition to his plan comes from members of his own party .
Republican lawmakers point to California 's $ 14bn ( £ 7 bn ) deficit as evidence that the so - called Golden State cannot afford such an ambitious measure .
Other opponents argue that it will lead to tax increases - from a governor who previously vowed not to raise taxes .
The governor 's plan would require all Californians to obtain health insurance by 1 July 2010 - providing subsidies for those who would otherwise have struggled to pay the premiums .
It would promote preventive care and also compel insurance companies to spend 85 % of those premiums on patients - which is music to the ears of people like Maria Watanabe .
I thought that when you had insurance you had access to any treatment that you needed
Maria Watanabe , patient
Health :
Where presidential candidates stand
A few years ago crippling headaches prevented her from performing the most simple of tasks .
Ms Watanabe - who moved to Los Angeles from the Philippines - was denied a brain scan by her insurance company despite repeated requests from her doctor , only to be diagnosed with a tumour during a family visit to Japan .
" I thought that when you had insurance you had access to any treatment that you needed , " she told me , tears welling in her eyes .
" If I had n't gone to Japan maybe I would n't be here now .
I would never have had the chance to know what was causing me so much pain . "
Dickensian tableau
Just as the insured are sometimes denied coverage , so those without coverage sometimes find themselves dumped on the streets .
Rev Andy Bates has seen cash - strapped patients made destitute
Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles encompasses 50 square blocks of the city and is home to about 800 people sleeping rough .
Some , with no health insurance and no home , were literally dumped there by hospitals because they could not pay the bill .
Even in the Californian sunlight , it is a scene straight out of Dickens - a seething tableau of desperation and drug- addiction , figures huddled in dark corners or splayed out on the pavement .
I took a tour of the area accompanied by the Reverend Andy Bates , who runs a mission which offers food , housing and medical care to some of the area 's regulars .
In the course of a year and a half he documented more than a hundred examples of " patient dumping " on Skid Row .
He told me : " I 've seen a lot on these streets , but nothing compares to the woman who was dropped off in a hospital gown , an [ intravenous drip ] still in her arm , who died 10 minutes later in our reception area of pneumonia - discharged simply because she could n't afford to pay her hospital bill . "
Under Governor Schwarzenegger 's plan , employers , hospitals and cigarette smokers would share the cost of funding California 's healthcare reforms .
Lobby groups will inevitably attempt to derail the scheme , yet cost may prove the greatest obstacle .
There is widespread agreement in America that healthcare reform is badly needed , yet it is a massive task , and if the wealthiest state in the union cannot pull it off , any hope of a nationwide solution may start to seem bleak .
Want $ 20 million in cash ?
Google and the X PRIZE Foundation have it to give away – to the first team to build a privately funded space craft , land it on the moon , have it roam for at least 500 meters and send photographs and video back to Earth .
All by Dec. 31 , 2012 .
To be sure , this is not your father ’s sweepstakes .
But 10 teams of engineers , former NASA employees and aerospace experts have already registered to compete , and revealed their prototypes and plans at Google ’s Mountain View headquarters today .
“ The traditional industry is doubtful that anybody can do it and that ’s fine , ” said Dr. Peter Diamandis , chairman and chief executive officer of the X PRIZE Foundation .
“ But we have great faith in entrepreneurial ability and really believe someone will win the Google Lunar X Prize .
The competition was launched in an effort to use energy and resources from outside the Earth ’s biosphere to solve some of the Earth ’s problems .
Ultimate goals include being able to transmit carbon - free energy to the Earth ’s surface – around the clock – using solar power collectors made from lunar material , and gaining a deeper understanding of the solar system .
Already , the effort has sparked a lot of interest .
Since the competition was first announced just six months ago , 567 potential teams from 53 nations have requested registration packets .
Among them : Adil Jafry , an energy executive and father of two who admits he ’s not “ a technologist or a scientist .
I ’m a finance / math guy .
But I can learn . ”
Born in 1972 after all but one of NASA ’s Apollo missions , Jafry concedes his knowledge of space comes from the 26 books he bought from Amazon.com two months ago to bone up on space exploration and technology .
He is n’t done with “ Destination Space : Making Science Fiction a Reality , ” “ Space : The Free - Market Frontier , ” or the other titles he ’s picked up , but said he ’s at least skimmed them all .
“ This has really sparked my imagination , ” he said .
“ The amount of technology that ’s going to come out of this initiative is phenomenal . ”
Of course , there are some stumbling blocks .
For starters , there ’s the expense and time involved .
Many teams said they hoped they could keep their costs below the actual prize amount and will seek sponsors to come up with the millions of dollars in capital needed .
There ’s also the technology involved – after all , this is rocket science .
The first comprehensive analysis of human impacts on marine ecosystems shows that humanity has profoundly affected nearly half of the world 's oceans , with just a few spots remaining pure .
Pure is a loaded term – after all , humans are part of nature , too .
But however one defines the integrity of ecosystems , the bottom line is that humans change the oceans just as much as we change forests or prairies .
It 's just easier to see the changes when they 're not underwater .
Enter a team of researchers led by the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis ' Benjamin Halpern , who in a study published today in Science used satellite images and custom - made models to evaluate the oceanic impact of coastal development , fishing , fertilizer runoff , shipping traffic and other activities .
Their fine - grained analysis – precise to the square - kilometer scale – showed that just four percent of Earth 's oceans are still pristine ; coral reefs , seagrass beds , rocky reefs and continental shelves have been particularly hard hit , while soft - bottom shallows and the deep ocean have fared best .
The researchers say their map is just a scaffold for future research :
there are more possible impacts than the 17 measured , and the interconnection and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems are still being explored .
But it 's still a valuable first step in providing a framework by which the waters on which billions of people rely can be evaluated and managed .

The GM Volt , which runs off batteries that can be recharged from a wall outlet , or by a small gas engine under the hood .
A new concept car from General Motors could get 53 mpg on a propulsion system pioneered in submarines about a hundred years ago .
Rechargeable batteries power an electric motor that turns the wheels .
There 's also an engine , which can be used to charge the batteries .
The setup worked for the U.S. Navy during the Wilson Administration , so it just might also shine on 21st Century American highways .
At least that 's what GM apparently hopes , as it is reportedly intends to have the car in production by 2010 as an addition to the Chevy lineup .
" They have taken the way that the automobile industry thinks about hybrid cars , and turned it on its ear , " said Michelle Krebs , editor at Edmunds AutoObserver.com .
" If you do n't drive far , you may never need gasoline .
No other major car maker had done this . "
Most hybrid cars , she noted , retain a connection between the engine and the wheels , and use the electric motor to supplement the gasoline engine .
Batteries included
The keel of the Volt ( built on a four - door Chevy Cobalt chassis ) contains 16 kilowatt - hours worth of lithium ion batteries , which power a 120 - kilowatt motor , enough to accelerate the car from zero to 60 in 8.5 seconds , according to GM 's specs .
Leaving a 50 percent reserve , eight kilowatt hours should get you 40 miles of road travel , which is enough for many commutes .
Plugging into a 110 - volt outlet will recharge it in about six hours , assuming you need a full recharge of 8 kilowatt - hours .
Nationally , the average price for electricity is 10.94 cents per kilowatt hour , so " refueling " would cost 87.5 cents .
If you need to go more than 40 miles , the Volt has a small ( 1.3 - liter , 3 - cylinder ) engine that cuts in , powering a generator that recharges the battery while you are driving .
With a charged battery and a full tank with 12 gallons of gas , you are supposed to be able to go 640 miles .
That 's 53 miles per gallon .
Run silent , run deep
Diesel - electric submarines , such as were used in World Wars I and II , used similar arrangements , albeit it with diesel rather than gas engines .
The engines could be used to charge the batteries while on the surface , and battery - powered motors ran the submarine while submerged .
But thanks to its crew of several dozen specialists , the submarines had more power options .
For instance , they could run off the engines alone or charge the batteries while standing still .
The submarines could not , however , be recharged through a wall receptacle , like the Volt .
The Volt was introduced last year as a concept car .
" An auto company usually brings out a concept car prior to the decision to build it , " said GM spokesperson Carolyn Normandin .
" While we have not announced production , we have put together contracts to partner with the firms that make the batteries .
That shows we are interested in advancing it — there is a lot of passion behind it , since it is an exciting idea . "
Krebs said GM still has technical problems it needs to solve before launching the Volt , such as heat dissipation from the batteries .
Statement of Pres. George Bush , Sept. 12 , 2001
I just completed a meeting with our national security team , and we 've received the latest intelligence updates .
The deliberate and deadly attacks , which were carried out yesterday against our country , were more than acts of terror .
They were acts of war .
This will require our country to unite in steadfast determination and resolve .
Freedom and democracy are under attack .
The American people need to know we 're facing a different enemy than we have ever faced .
This enemy hides in shadows and has no regard for human life .
This is an enemy who preys on innocent and unsuspecting people , then runs for cover , but it wo n't be able to run for cover forever .
This is an enemy that tries to hide , but it wo n't be able to hide forever .
This is an enemy that thinks its harbors are safe , but they wo n't be safe forever .
This enemy attacked not just our people but all freedom - loving people everywhere in the world .
The United States of America will use all our resources to conquer this enemy .
We will rally the world .
We will be patient .
We 'll be focused , and we will be steadfast in our determination .
This battle will take time and resolve , but make no mistake about it , we will win .
The federal government and all our agencies are conducting business , but it is not business as usual .
We are operating on heightened security alert .
America is going forward , and as we do so , we must remain keenly aware of the threats to our country .
** Those in authority should take appropriate precautions to protect our citizens .
But we will not allow this enemy to win the war by changing our way of life or restricting our freedoms .**
This morning , I am sending to Congress a request for emergency funding authority so that we are prepared to spend whatever it takes to rescue victims , to help the citizens of New York City and Washington , D.C. , respond to this tragedy , and to protect our national security .
I want to thank the members of Congress for their unity and support .
America is united .
The freedom - loving nations of the world stand by our side .
This will be a monumental struggle of good versus evil , but good will prevail .
Thank you very much .

Nafisa with her child in a hospital in Herat .
Nafisa with her child in a hospital in Herat .
Nafisa is hospitalized with her child in a local hospital in Herat province in Western Afghanistan .
She says her husband attacked her like a hungry tiger and bat her nose and then cut off her ear by a knife .
She showed her child who is also burnt by her husband .
Nafisa says : “ I ’ve lived ten painful years with my husband and he always beats me … .
My husband also poured hot water over my child and she is also seriously injured . ”
Nafisa begs Afghan government and human rights group to help her get divorce from her addicted husband .
Local office of the Independent Human Rights Commission of Afghanistan in Herat confirmed the incident and told reporters that her husband has escaped .
In the last days of December , in a similar incident the ear and nose of a woman named Nazia was cut by her coward husband in the Ghor province .
These two heart - wrenching stories are among the hundreds of cases of violence against women that has got the media ’s attention .
The piece of news was published in a time when weeks ago on the International Human Rights Day celebration in Herat province by the Independent Human Rights Commission , in an extremely disgusting manner it was declared that the conditions of women had improved and the cases of violence against women had decreased by fifty percent !
Unfortunately , in a warlord - blighted and mafia country the people who commit these crimes live in full amnesty and are not handed over to the law as the rulers themselves are corrupt and involved in cases of violence against women .
On 30th of January of this year , a 25 year old woman named Pakhtana burned herself in front of the Supreme Court of Laghman province after seeing the indifference of the court towards the case of her husband ’s abusive behavior towards her .
When he 's expecting visitors , Steve James watches out the windows so he can catch the look on their faces when they see his house for the first time .
" It 's always the same , " he say .
" There 's an intense stare and total mystification , as if they can't quite believe what they are seeing . "
This may be because James 's house is made of straw and has a turf roof covered in flowers .
James is passionate about eco homes and deeply proud of the cottage , which huddles by a loch near Dumfries .
His kitchen is made from a cedar that blew over in a Glasgow park .
His sink came from a skip .
To one side is a Moroccan marbled shower room , to the other are sofas and a log - burning stove .
He sleeps in a galleried bedroom .
A compost loo and rainwater filtration system complete the picture .
The total cost : £ 4,000 .
" Actually , you could make it for less than that , " James says .
" I 'd cut the wood myself next time instead of going to the sawmill .
That would knock off a thousand . "
He finds the whole concept of mortgages quite amusing .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
His home is strong , warm and utterly watertight .
The only maintenance is a lime wash on the walls every year or two .
The turf roof repairs itself .
" I 'm building a water wheel next , " James says .
" In the meantime , I 'm getting power from a car battery that my partner , Eli , charges for me at her house .
You'd be amazed what you can run from that battery – a digital recording studio , a stereo , tools , lights and a laptop . "
James , 52 , a software engineer , took 10 months to build his house , finishing it in November last year .
Now , he 's set up a website about straw - bale homes , runs eco-engineering courses and takes commissions making straw - bale buildings ; the latest is a changing room for a Hull primary school .
The benefits run much deeper than simply wanting to save cash and the planet .
" Now that it 's built , the initial buzz has grown into a sort of permanent primeval satisfaction .
I sit here , it 's warm and quiet and there 's snow flying past the windows , and I think : yes , this is what it 's all about . "
Straw bales can be used to make all kinds of buildings .
If you 're just building a summer house , you may not need planning permission .
The best way to get started is to go on a course or help someone else build a straw - bale house ; James 's website can put you in touch with someone .
But it 's not hard to do it yourself , he says .
" Straw is perfect for a beginner .
It 's easy to work with and you can make your house any shape you want .
You can use straw to make any kind of buildings – from a four - storey office block to a house I know , which is a spiral .
Go mad , have fun , start living ! "
It 'll help to follow these seven steps .
But you will need a bit of DIY sense – and some manual labour from your friends .
Steve James 's website is at www.envisioneer.net
1. Build the foundations
I made a solid , 2 ft - high base from rocks .
It 's sort of like building a solid dry - stone wall – you do n't need mortar .
Take time to get the rocks to fit together well , but it 's good to leave gaps ; this will ventilate the straw and keep it dry .
2 . Add the wooden floor
You need a wooden frame on which to lay your flooring and build the walls .
I used flat reclaimed timbers as joists , laying them in a grid and nailing them together .
To create a curve at the front , I used thick plywood .
The whole thing just sits on the stones – the straw - bale walls will hold it down .
3 . Assemble the roof frame
Make the roof frame , so that it 's ready to go on as soon as the walls are up .
Start with a sturdy frame the same shape as the base .
Attach the rafters and fix them together in a tepee shape .
It 's easiest to hold it all together with screws .
4. Walls and windows
I used 200 oat - straw bales to make my house .
They cost £ 1 each .
First , lay a complete layer of bales around the edge of the base .
Using twine , stitch these to the wooden base .
Build upwards , stacking the bales like bricks .
Drive thin , pointed wooden stakes through them at intervals to hold them together .
I got the walls up in five days – with help from friends .
You can cut the straw to fit any shape you like , and stuff extra bits in any gaps .
All my windows came from skips .
I laid a polythene membrane between the frames and the straw , to protect the frames from damp .
5 . Get the roof on
Using plenty of manual labour , lift the roof frame into position .
Use some stakes to attach it to the straw walls .
I built a galleried bedroom into the roof space , laying a tree - trunk through the span of the roof to support the bedroom floor .
I nailed on wooden slats in overlapping rows on top of the roof and covered it in natural rubber pond liner .
Then a layer of turf went on top , along with a handful of flower seeds .
6 . Render the outside
I used a mix of gravel , sand and water from the loch , and added quicklime .
This makes hot lime render , which you can slap on while it 's warm and make interesting shapes with .
My partner Eli used it to make sculptures at the corners .
7 . The interior
For the flooring , a nearby sawmill cut some leftover trees from our local forest into planks , and I nailed them to the joists .
I used linseed oil to protect and polish them .
I made the kitchen window sills , shelves and work surfaces from a tree that blew over in a park in Glasgow .
It was a Lebanon cedar – beautiful .
The Belfast sink came from a skip .
I made the stove myself , using old paving slabs .
It heats the whole house with very little firewood , and it makes killer pizzas .
Conservative crowd boos McCain on immigration ; cheers warning to Iran , ' no earmarks ' pledge David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Thursday February 7 , 2008

Print This Email This Republican presidential favorite Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) spoke Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington , D.C. , at which fellow candidate Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) also spoke , as well as Vice President Dick Cheney , who ( as RAW STORY earlier reported ) steered clear of directly commenting on McCain 's front - runner status .
McCain 's speech was an overt attempt to appeal to rankled conservatives concerned with his sometimes moderate Senate voting record .
Criticism of McCain from the far right has grown as the Republican nomination seems more and more within his reach .
Acknowledging his critics , McCain said , " Surely , I have held ... positions that have not met with widespread agreement from conservatives .
I wo n't pretend otherwise , nor would you permit me to forget it . "
The remark drew laughter from the crowd .
" On the issue of illegal immigration , a position which ... "
McCain began to say before the audience heartily booed and then cheered , " a position which obviously still provokes the outspoken opposition of many conservatives , I stood my ground , aware that my position would imperil my campaign .
" I respect your opposition , " continued McCain , " for I know that the vast majority of critics to the bill base their opposition in a principled defense of the rule of law .
... I have pledged that it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first . "
He repeated his promise to loud applause .
" I will stand on my convictions , my conservative convictions , " McCain stressed , " and trust in the good sense of the voters , and in my confidence , that conservative principles still appeal to a majority of Americans , Republicans , independents , and Reagan Democrats . "
He was again answered favorably by the audience .
Using a deliberately incorrect term favored by President Bush to describe the party on the left , McCain said , " Whoever the Democrat [ sic ] nominee is , they would govern this country in a way that will , in my opinion , take this country backward to the days when government felt empowered to take from us our freedom to decide for ourselves the course and quality of our lives ... "
He then criticized Senate Democrats for the " shameful and dangerous " blocking of the controversial extension of surveillance legislation known as FISA , a denunciation which drew sustained applause .
The Arizona senator also accused Democratic opponents Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of wanting to increase the size of government , which McCain says he intends to reduce .
He also proclaimed to cheers , " I will not sign a bill with earmarks in it , any earmarks in it . "
Addressing the war in Iraq , McCain charged that Clinton and Obama " will withdraw our forces from Iraq based on an arbitrary timetable designed for the sake of political expediency and which recklessly ignores the profound human calamity and dire threats to our security that would ensue . "
He then talked about Iran , again decrying his adversaries : " Those senators wo n't recognize and seriously address the threat posed by an Iran with nuclear ambitions to our ally Israel in the region .
" I intend , " he continued , " to make unmistakably clear to Iran : we will not permit a government that espouses the destruction of the state of Israel as its fondest wish , and pledges undying emnity to the United States , to possess the weapons to advance their malevolent ambitions , " a declaration that again drew loud applause .
But , he said , '' to talk of a detention center within our plant is not correct . ''
'' This was a very sad and bitter time , '' he added , '' and no one can defend what happened .
But to attempt to place responsibility on the company for things that happened at the level of government seems to me to be a bit absurd . ''
Based in part on Mr. Troiani's account , a federal prosecutor here filed a criminal complaint against Ford Argentina this month and ordered an investigation into the company 's conduct under the junta that ruled this country .
It charges that Ford and its senior executives '' managed , participated in or covered up the illegal detention '' of Mr. Troiani and nearly two dozen other employees .
In an interview , Mr. Troiani said : '' Jail was pure terror because people were disappearing all the time and you did n't know if you were going to be the next to be killed .
A lot of time has passed , but the truth is that Ford and its executives colluded in the kidnapping of its own workers , and I think they should be held responsible for that . ''
Over the next year , he says , he was repeatedly beaten , tortured and deprived of sleep and food .
The case is an outgrowth of similar charges made against Mercedes - Benz , today a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler .
A total of 16 workers at its plant in a suburb of Buenos Aires were abducted either at home or on the job from 1976 to 1977 .
All but two are assumed to have been killed .
The Mercedes - Benz hearings have been going on for four years , propelled largely by the effort of a German journalist , Gabriele Weber , who has published her findings in a book in German , '' The Disappeared of Mercedes - Benz . ' '
But the inquiry has received relatively little attention here because most Argentines are focused on the country 's current economic collapse and are not eager to reopen an even more painful chapter of their history .
The majority of people are at least somewhat uncomfortable with the idea of a machine like a red - light camera writing traffic tickets on its own .
Realizing this , cities that install ticket cameras always assure concerned citizens that the tickets will not be automated and that an officer will look at each ticket that comes through and make sure that a mistake was n’t made .
In theory , it sounds like a legitimate protection for motorists against unfair tickets .
In practice , because of the large volume of tickets that the cameras generate and limited staffing ( to boost camera profitability ) , the officers supervising the ticketing process end up just trying to get through as many tickets as possible in the shortest amount of time .
This inevitably leads to simple errors that cause innocent people to spend hours in court fighting tickets that they would never have received had an actual officer been there to give the ticket instead of a machine .
King 5 News in Seattle , Washington uncovered an clear example of this in action :
Arnie Henyan knows all about those cameras and the tickets that come with them .
“ The first one was dated May 28 , and I got it in early June , ” he said .
“ Three months later , I got another one …
Early January , I received a third one , from the city of SeaTac .
Same car , same plate . ”
The tickets were issued to his son , who owns a 1998 Honda Coupe with the license 470 - MOI .
Arnie fought the tickets , insisting his son was innocent .
“ I kind of laughed , because it ’s an impossibility , ” Henyan said .
“ He ’s in Iraq .
Has been since April . ”
How did this happen three times with officers reviewing every ticket by hand ?
So how did the sergeant get ticketed while at war ?
If you look closely at the photo taken by the red light camera : the license plate is actually 470 - MDI – not MOI .
Officers approve all tickets before they go out .
But both Lakewood and SeaTac misread the “ D ” for an “ O . ”
And they missed another clue :
The photos show a silver sedan running a red .
“ It ’s a silver car and my son ’s is black .
It ’s a four - door car and my son ’s is a two - door coupe , ” Arnie Henyan said .
The defense offered by Lakewood Police Department :
Lakewood police say not all that car data is sent to them for the verification process .
“ Our officers are approving hundreds of these every week , ” said Lt. Heidi Hoffman , of Lakewood police .
“ I think it could improve if the verification system showed more complete vehicle registration data on the screen that our officers are using to process these citations . ”
This is not acceptable .
If the police department does n’t have the staff and resources to safeguard the public from unfair tickets , they should never have installed the cameras .
It ’s easy for camera promoters to say , “ Well , if you get an unfair ticket , you can always go fight it in court and it will be dismissed . ”
But in reality , there is a cost to an individual when they are forced to fight an unfair ticket .
The process involves extra paperwork , a trip to court , and taking off time from work .
That ’s why many times people just decide it ’s less of a hassle to write a check even when they ’ve done nothing wrong .
The bottom line is that an innocent driver should never have to fix the government ’s mistake .
Especially not on their own time .
And especially not when it could have easily been avoided if the city ’s focus had been on safety instead of automatic revenue generators like red - light ticket cameras .

Having done some research on the a similar product ( the iRam by GigaByte ) I doubt that you will see speeds of 8000 time faster than a 10,000 RPM drive , because , as other have stated above , you are still going through some sort of drive interface and bus .
Data - throughput speeds are limited by both of these ( Sata on PCIx is 3 Gbps and PCI is 1.5 Gbps ) .
In fact on just moving data back and forth on a product like this , should show no or little improvement ( according to reviews of the iRam , that is the case atleast ) .
Where a product like this should show its muscle is an application that requires lots of small , fast read / writes .
Why ?
Because it can do multiple read / writes at a time ; no waiting for the last operation to complete .
So this is more suited to housing files like a database ( in fact the only implementation of the iRam I have seen successfully speed up operation in any signifigant manner is on database calls ) .

The hydra game
Andrej Bauer
,
Today I lectured about the Hydra game by Laurence Kirby and Jeff Paris ( Accessible Independence Results for Peano Arithmetic , Kirby and Paris , Bull .
London Math . Soc. 1982 ; 14 : 285-293 ) .
For the occasion I implemented the game in Java .
I am publishing the code for anyone who wants to play , or use it for teaching .
About the game
A hydra is a finite tree , with a root at the bottom .
The object of the game is to cut down the hydra to its root .
At each step , you can cut off one of the heads , after which the hydra grows new heads according to the following rules :
If you cut off a head growing out of the root , the hydra does not grow any new heads .
Suppose you cut off a head like this :
Delete the head and its neck .
Descend down by 1 from the node at which the neck was attached .
Look at the subtree growing from the connection through which you just descended .
Pick a natural number , say 3 , and grow that many copies of that subtree , like this :
My program grows $ n$ copies at step $ n$ of the game , which is one possible variant of the game .
There are spoilers ahead , so before you read on you should play the game with the Hydra applet ( your browser must support Java ) and try to win .
Is it possible to win ?
How should you play to win ?
Here is a surprising fact :
Theorem 1 : You can not lose !
The proof uses ordinal numbers .
To each hydra we assign an ordinal number :
A head gets the number $ 0 $ .
Suppose a node $ x$ has sub - hydras $ H_1 , \ldots , H_n$ growing from it .
To each sub - hydra we assign its ordinal recursively and order the ordinals in descending order : $ \alpha_1 \geq \alpha_2 \geq \ldots \geq \alpha_n$ .
The ordinal assigned to the node $ x $ is $ \omega^ {\alpha_1} + \omega^{\alpha_2} + \cdots + \omega^{\alpha_n}$ .
For example , the ordinal corresponding to the hydra from the first picture above is $ \omega^{\omega ^3 + 1} + 1 $ .
The hydra in the second picture gets the ordinal $ \omega^ {\omega ^ 2 \cdot 4 + 1} + 1 $ .
By chopping off a head we strictly decrease the ordinal .
Because there are no infinite strictly descending sequences of ordinals , the hydra will eventually die , no matter how you chop off heads .
But Theorem 1 is not the punchline .
The punchline is this :
Theorem 2 ( Kirby and Paris ) :
Any proof technique that proves Theorem 1 is strong enough to prove that Peano arithmetic is consistent .
Consistency of Peano arithmetic is Hilbert ’s second problem , which was solved by Gentzen in 1936 .

Larry Lessig may battle Washington Corruption from the inside .
Last last month , the Stanford Professor officially bid farewell to his longstanding fight for Free Culture , reiterrating that he 's dead set on fixing America 's money - happy political system .
At the time , Lessig was vague in describing this crusade , but word has now arrived that he is considering a run for Congress .
Over the past few weeks , some Friends of Larry have taken to the web , urging Lessig to run for Congress in an April special election .
A vacancy has opened up in California 's 12th district ( covering San Mateo county and a bit of San Francisco county ) , following the death of Representative Tom Lantos .
Former colleague John Palfrey , of Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society , launched a " Draft Lessig for Congress " Facebook group , attracting more than 2,000 social networking Larry lovers , and others soon sprung for their own DraftLessig.org " domain .
When we contacted Lessig yesterday morning to ask what he thought of all this , we did n't get answer .
But today , he told the world he is " seriously " considering a Congressional campaign .
Lessig says he wo n't make his final decision until " about " March 1 .
That would give him a month to prepare for the fight .
But he 's launched a new website and a very Lessig online video to show just how serious he is .
The video confirms ( yet again ) that he 's determined to change the political landscape .
" In my view the most exciting part of the debate around change is the idea of changing how Washington works , changing the influence of money in Washington , " Lessig says .
" Not an influence that comes through bribes , but an influence that is produced by the economy of influence that money now has in Washington . "
Sounds like a born politician to us .
But Lessig wants to make sure you understand that this run-for - Congress idea was n't his .
It was someone else's .
" Many others have said there is one thing I can do , " the video continues , " They 've been pushing me to consider taking the step to enter Congress itself . "
And before he makes a decision , he wants to know how many others would join the bandwagon .
" I will only be able to run for Congress , if you show your support right now .
I need to see your support right now - to understand if there is enough support for this idea to make this campaign worth it . "
Standing in his way is the local Democrat front - runner , former California State Senator Jackie Speier - who was famously shot five times by followers of Jim Jones just before they drank their Kool Aid .
She has already announced that she will run for Lantos ' seat .
And although Lessig has yet to announce , he has already questioned Speier 's old school fund - raising techniques .
" For thirty years she has lived in public service .
Indeed , so powerful has her service been , a train has been named after her : the Jackie Speier Express , " Lessig says .
" So nothing in this campaign would be a criticism of that extraordinary public service by this extraordinary public servant .
" But there is an important difference between Jackie Speier and me .
This is a difference in the ethic in how she runs her campaigns , for she takes money for the interests she regulates . "
He 's definitely a politician . ®

Report : 1 in every 100 Americans behind bars Associated Press

Print This Email This Report : 1 in every 100 Americans behind bars Total is far more than any other country in the world By DAVID CRARY Associated Press NEW YORK 
For the first time in history , more than one in every 100 American adults is in jail or prison , according to a new report tracking the surge in inmate population and urging states to rein in corrections costs with alternative sentencing programs .
The report , released today by the Pew Center on the States , said the 50 states spent more than $ 49 billion on corrections last year , up from less than $ 11 billion 20 years earlier .
The rate of increase for prison costs was six times greater than for higher education spending , the report said .
Using updated state - by - state data , the report said 2,319,258 adults were held in U.S. prisons or jails at the start of 2008  one out of every 99.1 adults , and more than any other country in the world .
The steadily growing inmate population " is saddling cash - strapped states with soaring costs they can ill afford and failing to have a clear impact either on recidivism or overall crime , " said the report .
Susan Urahn , managing director of the Pew Center on the States , said budget woes are prompting officials in many states to consider new , cost - saving corrections policies that might have been shunned in the recent past for fear of appearing soft on crime .
" We 're seeing more and more states being creative because of tight budgets , " she said in an interview .
" They want to be tough on crime , they want to be a law - and - order state  but they also want to save money , and they want to be effective . "
The report cited Kansas and Texas as states which have acted decisively to slow the growth of their inmate population .
Their actions include greater use of community supervision for low - risk offenders and employing sanctions other than reimprisonment for ex-offenders who commit technical violations of parole and probation rules .
" The new approach , born of bipartisan leadership , is allowing the two states to ensure they have enough prison beds for violent offenders while helping less dangerous lawbreakers become productive , taxpaying citizens , " the report said .
While many state governments have shown bipartisan interest in curbing prison growth , there also are persistent calls to proceed cautiously .
" We need to be smarter , " said David Muhlhausen , a criminal justice expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation .
" We 're not incarcerating all the people who commit serious crimes  but we 're also probably incarcerating people who do n't need to be . "
According to the report , the inmate population increased last year in 36 states and the federal prison system .
The largest percentage increase  12 percent  was in Kentucky , where Gov. Steve Beshear highlighted the cost of corrections in his budget speech last month .
He noted that the state 's crime rate had increased only about 3 percent in the past 30 years , while the state 's inmate population has increased by 600 percent .
The Pew report was compiled by the Center on the State 's Public Safety Performance Project , which is working directly with 13 states on developing programs to divert offenders from prison without jeopardizing public safety .
" For all the money spent on corrections today , there has n't been a clear and convincing return for public safety , " said the project 's director , Adam Gelb .
" More and more states are beginning to rethink their reliance on prisons for lower - level offenders and finding strategies that are tough on crime without being so tough on taxpayers . "
The report said prison growth and higher incarceration rates do not reflect a parallel increase in crime or in the nation 's overall population .
Instead , it said , more people are behind bars mainly because of tough sentencing measures , such as " three - strikes " laws , that result in longer prison stays .
" For some groups , the incarceration numbers are especially startling , " the report said .
" While one in 30 men between the ages of 20 and 34 is behind bars , for black males in that age group the figure is one in nine . "
The nationwide figures , as of Jan. 1 , include 1,596,127 people in state and federal prisons and 723,131 in local jails  a total 2,319,258 out of almost 230 million American adults .
The report said the United States is the world 's incarceration leader , far ahead of more populous China with 1.5 million people behind bars .
It said the U.S. also is the leader in inmates per capita ( 750 per 100,000 people ) , ahead of Russia ( 628 per 100,000 ) and other former Soviet bloc nations which make up the rest of the Top 10 .
Scientists at the Britannia Royal Navy College are working hard to make the idea of an invisible ship a reality using metamaterials that refract light in such a way that it " bends " around an object , making it appear as if it were invisible .
This would only account for viewing with the naked eye however — naturally radar cloaking would be an important part of the equation .
However , it appears that this technology may be able to accomplish a lot more .

Chris Lavers , a senior lecturer in remote sensing and sensors technology at the college believes that nanomaterials could help render the next generation of ships invisible to the naked eye , radar , and even heat seeking missiles — all while being completely quiet and impossible to detect based on their impact on the Earth 's magnetic field .
This is n't the first time we have heard about invisibility cloaking using similar methods , so here 's hoping that something actually comes of it in the near future .

Chef Paul Prudhomme Shot - Thank Goodness For Thick Skin
Cajun chefliterally dodged a bullet today while cooking at a golf course in Louisiana .
While doing what he does best , the chef said he felt something hit his arm and lo and behold it was a .22 caliber bullet .
Lucky for Paul he has really thick skin and the bullet did n't even cause a flesh wound .
The other scenario could be the fact that .22 caliber bullets are able to travel up to two miles - so he may have been at the two mile mark .
I am going with the thick skin .
What police were first calling a shooting turned into a simple complaint .
The police said they would never be able to tell where it came from .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares soared as much as 16 percent Wednesday after the government - sponsored lenders ' regulator removed limits on the growth of the companies ' mortgage portfolios .
The news , which could free the companies to become more active in buying mortgages amid a sharp decline in the housing market and a slowdown in the secondary markets for mortgage - related securities , overshadowed the bigger - than - expected fourth - quarter loss that Fannie Mae ( FNM ) reported earlier in the day .
Fannie shares fell as much as 8 percent in early trading Wednesday before rallying on the regulatory move .
James Lockhart , head of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , said he would lift the firms ' mortgage caps Saturday .
He cited the progress both Fannie and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) have made in putting years of accounting problems behind them .
" Fannie Mae published its timely , audited financial statement for 2007 today and Freddie Mac anticipates publishing its statement tomorrow , " Lockhart said in a midmorning statement .
" These steps constitute an important milestone in remediation of their respective operational and control weaknesses that led to multi- year periods when neither company released timely , audited financial statements . "
Lockhart also said OFHEO will discuss reducing capital requirements at the companies .
Since both Fannie and Freddie were found earlier this decade to have been manipulating their accounting to smooth earnings growth and boost management bonuses , OFHEO has been requiring that they hold 30 percent more capital in a bid to cushion against future losses .
But with house prices falling and private investors having fled the market for mortgage securities , many legislators have been advocating an expanded role for Fannie and Freddie in buying mortgages .
They argue that freeing the companies to do so will help to stabilize the housing market and reduce the possibility of a shock to the economy .
The companies ' portfolios were capped two years ago at $ 727 billion for Fannie and $ 713 billion for Freddie .
In September , OFHEO loosened the limits slightly , to $ 735 billion for each company .
Now there is no cap .
Investors cheered the prospect of renewed portfolio growth at the companies - despite the stark commentary on the housing market in Fannie Mae 's annual results .
Fannie lost $ 3.56 billion , or $ 3.80 a share , for the quarter ended Dec. 31 , reversing the year - ago profit of $ 604 million , or 49 cents a share .
The latest - quarter loss reflected a $ 3.2 billion writedown of the value of Fannie 's credit derivatives portfolio , which the firm uses to hedge against interest rate risk on its mortgage holdings , and a $ 2.8 billion provision for credit losses , which are rising as house prices fall and the economy slows .
Analysts had been anticipating a poor quarter , with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch downgrading the stock to sell from neutral in recent days .
But the size of Fannie 's fourth - quarter loss exceeded even skeptics ' estimates .
Goldman , for instance , had been forecasting a fourth - quarter loss of $ 1.75 a share at Fannie .
Unlike most public companies , which publish their quarterly financial results on their Web sites and issue press releases through wire services , Fannie made its quarterly numbers available at the end of a 98 - page appendix to its 162 - page annual report , which was filed Wednesday morning with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The filing indicates that Fannie expects to endure more losses in the coming year .
" We are experiencing high serious delinquency rates and credit losses across our conventional single - family mortgage credit book of business , especially for loans to borrowers with low credit scores and loans with high loan - to - value ( ' LTV ' ) ratios , " Fannie writes on page 24 of its 10 - K filing .
" We expect these trends to continue and that we will experience increased delinquencies and credit losses in 2008 as compared with 2007 . "
Fannie says 2008 losses could worse if the economy heads into recession .
Fannie 's poor numbers suggest Freddie 's fourth - quarter report Thursday morning will be ugly as well .
Analysts on average expect Freddie to announce losses of $ 2.34 a share , although Goldman expects an even steeper loss of $ 3.70 a share .
For now , with the government stepping in to ease the housing market 's pain , investors might not care .
Those of us who are players in financial markets know very well that the system is rigged in favor of those at the top and against those at the bottom and in the middle .
Because of a substantial body of work over a career , the market is a little bit fairer .
Because of Eliot Spitzer , average American investors in the market are a little more protected .
Those most corrupt forces in the market are a little more investigated .
The guilty are a little more prosecuted and the potentially corrupt are a little more deterred because of Eliot Spitzer .
Yes , what he did in this latest fiasco was shameful , and no doubt he will pay some price — and he should .
Yet watching the crowing and high - fiving on CNBC and from some on Wall Street , they are crowing and high - fiving not because they care about average investors , but because they have largely opposed reform and protection for average investors , and prosecutions of those who rip off average investors .
So : Let ’s boo for his involvement with prostitution but give him a standing ovation for his defense of honest markets , his support for honorable investing , his advocacy of greater disclosure , and his prosecution of crooks .

I was skeptical , at first , of speculation over the cutting of two cables linking the Middle East with the Internet , which had it as part of some Vast Neocon Conspiracy to isolate the region prior to a US military assault .
However , when two more cables  this time , in the Persian Gulf  were mysteriously cut , I began to wonder .
In a piece headlined " Cable cutter nutters chase conspiracy theories , " The Register goes out of its way to laugh off the prospect that what we are witnessing is a military operation , or the prelude to one , sniffing " there ’s little more than suspicions to work with " since we ’ve yet to reach the damaged cables .
Yet , given the sort of government we are dealing with  a regime that lied us into one war , and is not - so - subtly trying to finagle us into yet another one  why should n’t we be suspicious ?
We ’d have to be crazy not to be .
The Economist follows suit , sneering at " internet conspiracy theories " and denouncing the whole brouhaha as an " online frenzy " that is " way out of line . "
Yet one has to wonder : four cable cuts in the past week ?
I ’m with Steven Bellovin , a computer science professor at Columbia University , who avers :
“ As a security guy , I ’m paranoid , but I do n’t understand the threat model here .
On the other hand , four accidental failures in a week is a bit hard to swallow , too .
Let ’s hope there will be close , open examination of the failed parts of the cables . ”
First it was supposed to be a ship ’s anchor that caused the damage , and yet the Egyptians have said there were no ships in the vicinity , which they regularly monitor : besides which , that entire area near Alexandria is off - limits to all shipping .
Another reason to suspect a deliberate act : this politically - sensitive region is an Internet choke - point , as ABC News points out .
" The route connecting Europe to Egypt , and from there to the Middle East " is tenuous :
" Today , just three major data cables stretch from Italy to Egypt and run down the Suez Canal , and from there to much of the Middle East .
( A separate line connects Italy with Israel . )
A serious cut here is immediately obvious across the region , and a double cut can be crippling . "
Yet theories that this incident prefigures a US attack on Iran do n’t comport with the facts : Iran , far from being isolated by the cuts , may have enjoyed better connectivity as a result of the events .
The areas hardest hit were Kuwait , Egypt , and especially Pakistan  this last being a likelier target for isolation than Iran , and certainly more current
Another , and far more plausible , theory is that the seemingly coordinated cuts resulted from efforts to tap into the cables  a spying operation .
Go here for an exhaustive and very convincing case for viewing this as " special warfare . "
The Register cites Prof. Bellovin , but fails to note the real gist of his remarks .
While he ’s skeptical of the above - cited link , which posits a scenario whereby the USS Jimmy Carter , present whereabouts unknown , uses its specially designed facilities to tap directly into the cables , Bellovin poses an alternative scenario :
" If if was n’t a direct attempt at eavesdropping , perhaps it was indirect .
Several years ago , a colleague and I wrote about link - cutting attacks .
In these , you cut some cables , to force traffic past a link you ’re monitoring .
Link - cutting for such purposes is n’t new ; at the start of World War I , the British cut Germany ’s overseas telegraph cable to force them to use easily - monitored links .
One of the messages they intercepted  and cryptanalyzed  was the Zimmerman telegram , which asked Mexico to join Germany in attacking the US , in exchange for financial support and recovery of Texas , New Mexico , and Arizona .
Instead , public outrage in the US contributed to the decision to enter the war against Germany . "
" The problem with this scenario , " he adds , " is that the benefit is short - lived : the cables will be repaired in a few weeks . "
Yes , but long enough to have accomplished  what ?
We ca n’t know , of course , but Prof .
Bellovin certainly raises some interesting possibilities , none of which can be discounted by clueless journalists who sniff at " conspiracy theories "  as if we have no reason whatsoever to suspect covert action , by the US or whomever , in that area of the world .
As Prof .
Bellovin and a co-author point out in this paper on the subject : " Attacks on the routing system , with the goal of diverting traffic past an enemy - controlled point for purposes of eavesdropping or connection - hijacking , have long been known . "
Given the context in which these cable cuts are occurring  heightened tensions in the region , and not only with Iran 
I think it is probable that they are deliberate , and that the diversion of internet traffic for purposes of eavesdropping is clearly the intent .
After all , ask yourself this question : which is more plausible , an " accidental " cutting of four cables in one week in an area of the world which is the current focus of US military and diplomatic efforts , or the scenario outlined by Prof.
Bellovin ?
None of this is at all surprising .
The US government currently claims the right to spy on Americans , in their own country , as well as when they ’re in communication with overseas individuals .
They do n’t hide this , but proclaim it from the rooftops : does anyone doubt they are capable of commandeering the world ’s internet cable network in order to utilize it for their own purposes ?
You do n’t have to quaff the " conspiracy theorist " Kool - Aid to find this credible : a dose of realism will do .

Some gamers have chosen to call it " creepy " and " disgusting . "
Media outlets , those even belonging to the videogame press itself , have misrepresented it as " Holocaust DS " or a " Nazi torture game . "
The truth of the matter is that Luc Bernard 's proposed DS game , Imagination Is The Only Escape , is none of these things .
In fact , the DS game that may never be represents something that many gamers have wanted for years -- the evolution of gaming , and the chance for videogames to tackle sensitive issues , subjects deeper than " here are some aliens , shoot them please . "
The sad thing is that people have already made up their minds about Imagination Is The Only Escape before taking even a moment 's time to learn what it 's about .
Talking to Luc , who is also creating the WiiWare exclusive Eternity 's Child , you can see that he is not a " creepy " or " disgusting " individual , but a passionate man with no intention of being controversial .
Is he hotheaded ?
Yes he is , and he minces no words in defending his art , either -- but would n't you be just the same if your work had been twisted out of all context by press and market alike ?
Luc wanted to set a few things straight , especially following the New York Times article that has raised awareness of his game and unfortunately caused contexts to be lost by others .
With talk circulating that Nintendo has slammed down the breaks and put paid to Imagination appearing on its handheld , a situation Luc straight - up states is false , the time is crucial for Bernard to clear the air about Imagination Is The Only Escape , and he has taken that time with us .
Read on for the full story behind the so - called " Holocaust " game .
Although the NY Times dubbed it a " game about Nazis , " this certainly is n't IITOE 's intention .
The premise is , in fact , a dark yet affecting story of a young child living through the horrors of the Nazi regime and hiding within his own internal world to try and block out harsh reality -- using imagination as his escape , if you will .
From the general summary alone , the potential for a touching and affecting narrative is there , and nothing suggests the gratuitous shock value that some people have already perceived .
" Now , IITOE was NEVER planned to be controversial , " Luc explains .
" It was planned to be an educational game that was fun at the same time ... I did research on the Holocaust with survivors and loads of history books .
I spent a whole year studying it . "
The general contention with this game seems to be the idea that Luc is making light of the Holocaust , which is n't his intent .
While he states the title is meant to be fun , Bernard also wants to teach children how very real and very frightening this period of history was , but through a medium that they can digest better than any text book -- videogames .
It 's a sound strategy , one that should be applauded rather than reviled .
Most of us would have been taught about Hitler 's regime in school , but I doubt many of us found it very compelling .
IITOE wants to be the game that makes kids care about these issues .
Bernard was so intent on avoiding misplaced controversy that he thoroughly researched the atrocities of the Nazi regime , as well as worked with people from the Jewish community to make sure he was approaching the subject with the right degree of tact .
" I have been working on game design with a Jewish mother named Tracy Miller to make sure everything was good , " IITOE 's creator explains .
" But for some reason people seem offended just by the text at the bottom of the screen that shows history facts ! "
" A lot of the Jewish community have support for this game , however a lot of neo Nazis hate it on forums , and have said it will never come out . "
Bernard also contests the rumors about Nintendo outright blocking the game 's release .
" Right now all the comments on the Internet about Nintendo not letting it come out are not true , " he reveals .
" I have n't heard that from Nintendo , [ they 're ] just misquotes . "
" I 'm not even sure Nintendo is aware of this game , and I will make many people play it before it is even released .
The game has no violent scenes at all , the only thing that might be violent is the text but the text is fucking reality . "
Bernard is very eager to let the world know that the stories about it being " Holocaust DS " could n't be further from the truth , and it 's just a game " about a child set during that dark time of history . "
Bernard also added that despite the stupidity of the mainstream press and what it would like to present , there is more support for the game than people against it .
He feels that those reporting on his work thus far are attempting to paint it as something universally despised , regardless of the fact that a good few gamers and members of the Jewish community are behind his work .
" I 'm not trying to make cash off this either since I would like to donate to help against the Darfur fucking genocide .
It 's just to show that games can evolve and it's not just Super Mario saving the fucking princess . "
Gamers state many times that they want videogames to evolve , to take that step from puerile distraction to respected entertainment and art .
Gamers claim that they are sick of macho - man " gritty " shooters with all the narrative depth of a sheet of cardboard .
Now is the time to actually prove whether or not you want videogames to become more than throwaway , intellectually unfulfilling endeavors .
We have a game with balls , right here and now , that wants to take the medium into a place universally considered far too touchy for some " mere " game to handle .
I think any game that wants to break that glass ceiling deserves our support , do n't you ?
Is Luc asking a lot to expect Nintendo to allow this game on its platform ?
Yes he is .
Should it be so much to ask , however ?
No , it really should n't be .
Books , TV shows and movies are all " allowed " to talk about the Holocaust .
Videogames deserve to do so as well .
When a game like Imagination Is The Only Escape , which does n't even promote a sliver of violence , is considered too risque ' , it only shows how prehistoric everybody 's views on games are , and highlights just how badly things need to change if we ever want to see companies bold enough to bring us more than Madden and a hundred FPS ' .
Imagination
Is The Only Escape is a game we should all be backing , even if the odds are against it .
We should be showing the world and letting companies like Nintendo know we want games to tackle a wide and interesting variety of subject matter .
Games can be brave and daring as well , and we should be daring enough to give them a chance .
Luc is no Rockstar Games .
He 's not out to shock people .
He just wants to show what games can do .
Is he really so wrong for that ?
Paul Buchheit on listening to users :
I wrote the first version of Gmail in one day .
It was not very impressive .
All I did was stuff my own email into the Google Groups ( Usenet ) indexing engine .
I sent it out to a few people for feedback , and they said that it was somewhat useful , but it would be better if it searched over their email instead of mine .
That was version two .
After I released that people started wanting the ability to respond to email as well .
That was version three .
That process went on for a couple of years inside of Google before we released to the world .
Startups do n't have hundreds of internal users , so it 's important to release to the world much sooner .
When FriendFeed was semi-released ( private beta ) in October , the product was only about two months old ( and 99.9 % written by two people , Bret and Jim ) .
We 've made a lot of improvements since then , and the product that we have today is much better than what we would have built had we not launched .
The reason ?
We have users , and we listen to them , and we see which things work and which do n't .
Listening to users is a tricky thing .
Users often do n't know what they want , and even if they did , the communication is likely to get garbled somewhere between them and you .
By no means should you ignore your users , though .
Most people will silently and forever walk away if your software or website does n't meet their needs .
The users who care enough to give you feedback deserve your attention and respect .
They 're essentially taking it upon themselves to design your product .
If you do n't listen attentively and politely respond to all customer feedback , you 're setting yourself up for eventual failure .
It 's rude not to listen to your users .
So how do we reconcile this with the first rule of usability -- Do n't Listen to Users ?
To discover which designs work best , watch users as they attempt to perform tasks with the user interface .
This method is so simple that many people overlook it , assuming that there must be something more to usability testing .
[ It ] boils down to the basic rules of usability : Watch what people actually do .
Do not believe what people say they do .
they do .
Definitely do n't believe what people predict they may do in the future .
I think Paul had it right , but it 's easy to miss .
The relevant phrase in Paul 's post is we see which things work , which implies measurement and correlation .
There 's no need to directly watch users ( although it never hurts ) when you have detailed logs showing what they actually did .
Collect user feedback , then correlate it with data on what those users are actually doing :
Do n't just implement feature requests from " user representatives " or " business analysts . "
The most common way to get usability wrong is to listen to what users say rather than actually watching what they do .
Requirement specifications are always wrong .
You must prototype the requirements quickly and show users something concrete to find out what they really need .
Acting on user feedback alone is questionable .
No matter how well intentioned , you 're guessing .
Why guess when you can take actions based on cold , hard data ?
Acting on user feedback and detailed usage metrics for your application or website -- that 's the gold standard .
Consider Valve software 's hardware survey .
A particularly vocal set of gamers might demand support for extremely high widescreen resolutions such as 1920 x 1200 or 2560 x 1600 .
Understandable , since they 've spent a lot of money on high - end gaming rigs .
But what resolutions do most people actually play at ?
Based on this survey of 1.3 million Steam users , about 10 % of gamers have high resolution , widescreen displays .
There are other reasons you might want to satisfy this request , of course .
Those 10 % tend to be the most dedicated , influential gamers .
But having actual data behind your user feedback lets you vet the actions you take , to ensure that you 're spending your development budget wisely .
The last thing you want to do is fritter away valuable engineering time on features that almost nobody is using , and having usage data is how you tell the difference .
Valve also collects an exhaustive set of gameplay statistics for their games , such as Team Fortress 2 .
We 've traditionally relied on things like written feedback from players to help decide which improvements to focus on .
More recently , Steam has allowed us to collect more information than was previously possible .
TF2 includes a reporting mechanism which tells us details about how people are playing the game .
We 're sharing the data we collect because we think people will find it interesting , and because we expect to spot emergent problems earlier , and ultimately build better products and experiences as a result .
The very first graph , of time played per class , illustrates one problem with Team Fortress 2 in a way that I do n't think any amount of player feedback ever could .
Scout 17.5 % Engineer 17.3 % Soldier 15 % Demoman 10.5 % Sniper 10.1 % Heavy 8.5 % Spy 8 % Pyro 7 % Medic 5.5 %
The medic class is severely underrepresented in actual gameplay .
I suppose this is because Medics do n't engage in much direct combat , so they 're not as exciting to play as , say , a Demoman or Soldier .
That 's unfortunate , because the healing abilities of the medic class are frequently critical to winning a round .
So what did Valve do ?
They released a giant set of medic - specific achievements to encourage players to choose the Medic class more often .
That 's iterative game design based on actual , real world gameplay data .
Using detailed gameplay metrics to refine game design is n't new ; Bungie ran both Halo 2 and 3 through comprehensive usability lab tests .
In April , Bungie found a nagging problem with Valhalla , one of Halo 3's multiplayer levels : Player deaths ( represented in dark red on this " heat map " of the level ) were skewing toward the base on the left , indicating that forces invading from the right had a slight advantage .
After reviewing this image , designers tweaked the terrain to give both armies an even chance .
Again -- try to imagine how you 'd figure out this fundamental map imbalance based on player feedback .
I 'm not sure if it 's even possible .
Make sure your application or website is capturing user activity in a useful , meaningful way .
User feedback is important .
Do n't get me wrong .
But never take action solely based on user feedback .
Always have some kind of user activity data to corroborate and support the valuable user feedback you 're getting .
Ignoring your user feedback may be setting yourself up for eventual failure , but blindly acting on every user request is certain failure .
After the recent furor over the weapons included with Battlefield : Bad Company that apparently are only available as a separate purchase , Electronic Arts emailed Game|Life to point out that things are n't exactly as they seem .
The weapons , they claim , are not all mere cash grabs .
Instead , they are a combination of content to be released via " promotional programs " and weaponry to be included with Bad Company 's collector 's edition release .
The tags currently attached to the weapons saying " Buy this weapon on Xbox Live Marketplace " refer to gamers ' ability to purchase the weapons even if they miss the promotional events or only purchase the standard edition of the game , EA says .
Five of the guns the beta currently has tagged as for sale on Xbox
Live Marketplace are actually going to be packed into the upcoming " Gold
Edition " of the game , a special version that includes additional content for a higher price tag than the standard release .
Those weapons will also be available to players of the regular edition from Xbox Live Marketplace .
The remaining five are to be released by EA through a series of pre-launch " free of charge promotional events . "
Details on the Gold Edition and the planned pre-launch promotional campaign should be coming soon .

Nabila Mango , a therapist who works in San Francisco , flew home in December after a trip to the Middle East and says customs agents detained her and asked her to identify everyone she had met and all the places she 'd slept .
Amir Khan , a tech consultant from Fremont , says he 's questioned for hours each time he returns from abroad and has been asked whether he hates the U.S. government .
After receiving more than 20 such complaints in the past year , mostly from South Asians and Muslims , two legal organizations sued the Homeland Security Department on Thursday for information on its policies of questioning and searching returning travelers .
" When the government searches your books , peers into your computer and demands to know your political views , it sends the message that free expression and privacy disappear at our nation 's doorstep , " attorney Shirin Sinnar of the Asian Law Caucus said at a news conference after filing the suit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco .
The Asian Law Caucus and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said they asked Homeland Security 's Customs and Border Protection division for its policies Oct. 31 and have yet to receive any documents , despite a 20 - day deadline for a response from the government under the Freedom of Information Act .
The groups want to know what policies guide customs agents in asking political or religious questions , what happens when a traveler refuses to answer or wants a lawyer , and what standards exist for agents who want to search or copy material from laptop computers , cell phones and other electronic devices .
Courts have allowed federal agents more leeway in searches at borders and airports than elsewhere , and some rulings have allowed customs agents to search laptops and cell phones without evidence the devices ' owners have done anything wrong .
Sinnar said she considers the searches of electronic devices legally questionable , and that singling out travelers by race or religion would raise serious constitutional concerns .
Homeland Security spokeswoman Laura Keehner declined to comment on the lawsuit but said laptops can be seized and searched " when they contain information in violation of U.S. criminal law " - for example , if they are being used in terrorism , drug smuggling or child pornography .
She would not discuss agents ' inquiries into travelers ' politics or religion .
Mango , 64 , a therapist at the Tenderloin Health Clinic in San Francisco , is a Palestinian - born U.S. citizen who has lived in the United States since 1965 .
She said she was the only Arab - looking passenger on her Dec. 27 flight from Frankfurt , Germany , and the only one detained by customs agents at San Francisco International Airport .
During the 60 to 90 minutes she was held , the agents demanded details of people she had encountered and places she had gone in her three - week trip , the names and addresses of relatives in Jordan and information about her U.S. - born adult daughter , Mango said .
They leafed through Arab - language books in her luggage , lost interest when they discovered the books were about music theory , and erased cell - phone messages from her daughter , who was waiting outside the airport , she said .
" I was really traumatized , " Mango said .
" I was worried about the safety of my daughter , my family , my friends . "
Khan , 32 , a U.S. citizen born in Pakistan , said he 's been detained five times at U.S. airports since 2003 and questioned for a total of 20 hours .
Agents have asked him what he thinks of the government , whether he attends mosques and why he has certain sums in his bank account , have examined his credit cards in private , and once ordered him to log onto his computer and make his files accessible , he said .
" I was told I have no rights , " he said .
Once , before he became a citizen , he said , " an officer told me that if I did n't answer all his questions , he would take my green card . "
Another incident involved a Tunisian actor who was invited to the Arab Film Festival in San Francisco .
Lotfi Abdelli , star of an anti-terrorism film called " Making Of , " landed in San Francisco on Oct. 7 and was detained at the airport for five hours , the festival 's Carol Bisharat - Sani said .
She said he reported that agents confiscated his cell phone and questioned him at length about Islam and terrorism .
By the time Abdelli arrived at the festival , Bisharat - Sani said , he was ready to return home .
" He had some lofty ideas , maybe from movies , about what the United States was like , " she said .
" But he was greeted and treated like a terrorist . "
The lurking Ron Paul
Polls commissioned by the Las Vegas Review - Journal and Reno Gazette - Journalshow former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney with a comfortable lead in the Republican race in Nevada , with Texas Rep. Ron Paul trailing far behind insingle digits .
But do n't be surprised if Paul challenges the other presumed frontrunners -
Rudy Giuliani , Mike Huckabee and John McCain - for second or third place , given how those three have shown little interest in Nevada .
And caucuses - unlike primaries - tend to attract only the most passionate
and knowledgeable , which certainly describes Paul 's backers .
Droves of Paul supporters packed a casino ballroom Tuesday night when the
Clark County Republican Party elected its slate of leaders .
One Ron Paul supporter , driving an SUV , blocked Romney backers at a rally Thursday .
The SUV had several Paul bumper - stickers and a handwritten note :

While Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton duke it out in Texas and Ohio on Tuesday , Mr. Obama has trounced his Democratic rival in another arena : trading cards .
Presidential trading cards , released by the Topps Company on Feb. 6 and featuring the candidates ’ likenesses and autographs , are fetching high prices on eBay this week .
An Obama card , one of 15 made by Topps , sold for $ 3,122 , and a Clinton card , one of 18 , sold for $ 1,325 .
Bids for a card featuring an embedded autograph by Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , were holding steady at $ 1,200 in an auction on Monday evening .
Image A Senator Barack Obama trading card sold for $ 3,122 online .
The cards are a bonus tucked into packs of Topps Baseball Series 1 for 2008 , which retail for $ 1.99 , said Clay Luraschi , the company ’s baseball brand manager .
Once in a while , it ’s worth taking a moment to realize how very , very odd Republicans can be .
There ’s a new rule at the Republican National Committee .
Refer to the two leading Democratic presidential candidates simply as “ Barack ” and “ Hillary ” and you ’ll be fined $ 10 .
The reason : Using first names makes the candidates sound more likable but calling them “ Senator Obama ” and “ Senator Clinton ” makes them sound more distant and bureaucratic .
“ I do n’t think people are actually being fined , ” says one insider .
But everyone is being “ encouraged ” to follow the rule .
It ’s like a swear jar in which people who use profanity are supposed to be put money in a pot every time they use profanity .
It ’s supposed to be a deterrent .
Only at the RNC , the swear jar is a humanizing - Democrats jar .
No , I usually do n’t understand Republicans , either .

In the summer of every presidential election year , political parties in the United States typically conduct national conventions to choose their presidential candidates .
At the conventions , the presidential candidates are selected by groups of delegates from each state .
After a series of speeches and demonstrations in support of each candidate , the delegates begin to vote , state - by - state , for the candidate of their choice .
The first candidate to receive a preset majority number of delegate votes becomes the party 's presidential candidate .
The candidate selected to run for president then selects a vice presidential candidate .
Delegates to the national conventions are selected at the state level , according to rules and formulas determined by each political party 's state committee .
While these rules and formulas can change from state - to - state and from year - to - year , there remain two methods by which the states choose their delegates to the national conventions : the caucus and the primary .
The Primary
In states holding them , presidential primary elections are open to all registered voters .
Just like in general elections , voting is done through a secret ballot .
Voters may choose from among all registered candidates and write - ins are counted .
There are two types of primaries , closed and open .
In a closed primary , voters may vote only in the primary of the political party in which they registered .
For example , a voter who registered as a Republican can only vote in the Republican primary .
In an open primary , registered voters can vote in the primary of either party , but are allowed to vote in only one primary .
Most states hold closed primaries .
Primary elections also vary in what names appear on their ballots .
Most states hold presidential preference primaries , in which the actual presidential candidates ' names appear on the ballot .
In other states , only the names of convention delegates appear on the ballot .
Delegates may state their support for a candidate or declare themselves to be uncommitted .
In some states , delegates are bound , or " pledged " to vote for the primary winner in voting at the national convention .
In other states , some or all delegates are " unpledged , " and free to vote for any candidate they wish at the convention .
The Caucus
Caucuses are simply meetings , open to all registered voters of the party , at which delegates to the party 's national convention are selected .
When the caucus begins , the voters in attendance divide themselves into groups according to the candidate they support .
The undecided voters congregate into their own group and prepare to be " courted " by supporters of other candidates .
Voters in each group are then invited to give speeches supporting their candidate and trying to persuade others to join their group .
At the end of the caucus , party organizers count the voters in each candidate 's group and calculate how many delegates to the county convention each candidate has won .
As in the primaries , the caucus process can produce both pledged and unpledged convention delegates , depending on the party rules of the various states .
How Delegates are Awarded
The Democratic and Republican parties use different methods for determining how many delegates are awarded to , or " pledged " to vote for the various candidates at their national conventions .
Democrats use a proportional method .
Each candidate is awarded a number of delegates in proportion to their support in the state caucuses or the number of primary votes they won .
For example , consider a state with 20 delegates at a democratic convention with three candidates .
If candidate " A " received 70 % of all caucus and primary votes , candidate " B " 20 % and candidate " C " 10 % , candidate " A " would get 14 delegates , candidate " B " would get 4 delegates and candidate " C " would get two delegates .
In the Republican Party , each state chooses either the proportional method or a " winner - take - all " method of awarding delegates .
Under the winner - take - all method , the candidate getting the most votes from a state 's caucus or primary gets all of that state 's delegates at the national convention .
Key Point :
The above are general rules .
Primary and caucus rules and methods of convention delegate allocation differ from state - to - state and can be changed by party leadership .
To find out the latest information , contact your state 's Board of Elections .
Types of Delegates
Most of the delegates from each state are selected at the “ district - level ” to represent specific geographic areas , usually the state ’s congressional districts .
Other delegates are “ at - large ” delegates are chosen to represent the entire state .
Within both the district - level and at - large delegates , there are other types of delegates whose obligations and duties vary according to the rules of their political party .
Democratic Party Pledged Delegates

Pledged delegates in the Democratic Party are required to express a preference for either one of the party ’s presidential candidates or an uncommitted preference as a condition of their selection .
Under current party rules , delegates pledged to a specific candidate are encouraged — but not required — to vote for the candidate they had been selected to support .
Democratic Party Unpledged Delegates
Unpledged delegates in the Democratic Party are not required to pledge their support to any of the party ’s presidential candidates .
Often called “ superdelegates , ” unpledged delegates include members of the Democratic National Committee , Democratic members of Congress , Democratic governors , or distinguished party leaders , including former presidents and vice presidents .
They are free to support any of the presidential candidates .
Republican Party Automatic Delegates

Three members of each state ’s Republican National Committee are sent to the convention as automatic delegates , meaning they are exempt from the regular selection process .
Automatic delegates make up about 7 % of all delegate and are either “ bound ” to a particular candidate or “ unbound . ”
Bound delegates are obligated to express support for particular candidate as determined their state ’s primaries or caucuses .
Unbound delegates are free to express support for any candidate , regardless of the caucus or primary results in their state .
Pledged Republican Delegates
In the Republican Party , pledged delegates may either be bound delegates or unbound delegates who have been pledged to a candidate " by personal statements or even state law , but according to RNC rules , may cast their vote for anyone at the convention , ” according to the Congressional Research Service .
More About the Democrat ’s Superdelegates
In the Democratic Party only , certain delegates to the Democratic National Convention are designated as “ superdelegates ” who selected automatically rather than through their states ’ traditional primary or caucus systems .
Unlike regular “ pledged ” delegates , the superdelegates are free to support and vote for any party candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination .
As a result , they can effectively supersede the results of the Democrat Party primaries and caucuses .
The superdelegates , who make up about 16 % of all democratic convention delegates , include elected officials — like U.S. Representatives , Senators , and governors — and high - ranking party officials .
Since it was first used in 1982 , the superdelegate system has been a source of controversy in the Democratic .
This reached a boiling point during the 2012 campaign when several superdelegates publicly announced that they would support Hillary Clinton while the state primary elections were still being held .
This angered supporter of Bernie Sanders , who felt party leaders were unfairly attempting to tip the scales of public opinion in favor of Clinton , the eventual nominee .
As a result , the party has adopted new superdelegate rules .
Beginning with the 2020 convention , the superdelegates will not be allowed to vote of the first ballot unless the outcome is not in doubt .
In order to win the nomination on the first ballot , the leading candidate must win the votes of a majority of the regular pledged delegates awarded through the primaries and caucus leading up to the Democratic Convention .
To be clear , there are no superdelegates in the Republican Party nomination process .
While there are Republican delegates who are automatically chosen to attend the party convention , they are limited to three per state , consisting of the state chairman and two district - level committee members .
In addition , they are required to vote for the winner of their state ’s primary election , just like the regular pledged delegates .
A ' barcode ' gene that can be used to distinguish between the majority of plant species on Earth has been identified .
This gene , which can be used to identify plants using a small sample , could lead to new ways of easily cataloguing different types of plants in species - rich areas like rainforests .
It could also lead to accurate methods for identifying plant ingredients in powdered substances , such as in traditional Chinese medicines , and could help to monitor and prevent the illegal transportation of endangered plant species .
The team behind the discovery found that DNA sequences of the gene ' matK ' differ among plant species , but are nearly identical in plants of the same species .
This means that the matK gene can provide scientists with an easy way of distinguishing between different plants , even closely related species that may look the same to the human eye .
The researchers made this discovery by analysing the DNA from different plant species .
They found that when one plant species was closely related to another , differences were usually detected in the matK DNA .
The researchers , led by Dr Vincent Savolainen , dual appointee at Imperial College London 's Department of Life Sciences and the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , carried out two large - scale field studies : one on the exceptionally diverse species of orchids found in the tropical forests of Costa Rica , and the other on the trees and shrubs of the Kruger National Park in South Africa .
Dr Savolainen and his colleagues in the UK worked alongside collaborators from the Universities of Johannesburg and Costa Rica who played a key role in this new discovery .
Using specimens collected from Costa Rica , Dr Savolainen and colleagues were able to use the matK gene to identify 1,600 species of orchid .
In the course of this work , they discovered that what was previously assumed to be one species of orchid was actually two distinct species that live on different slopes of the mountains and have differently shaped flowers adapted for different pollinating insects .
In South Africa the team was able to use the matK gene to identify the trees and shrubs of the Kruger National Park , also well known for its big game animals .
Dr Savolainen explains that in the long run the aim is to build on the genetic information his team gathered from Costa Rica and South Africa to create a genetic database of the matK DNA of as many plant species as possible , so that samples can be compared to this database and different species accurately identified .
" In the future we 'd like to see this idea of reading plants ' genetic barcodes translated into a portable device that can be taken into any environment , which can quickly and easily analyse any plant sample 's matK DNA and compare it to a vast database of information , allowing almost instantaneous identification , " he says .
Although Dr Savolainen concedes that such technological applications may be some years away from realisation , he says the potential uses of the matK gene are substantial : " There are so many circumstances in which traditional taxonomic identification of plant species is not practical - whether it be at ports and airports to check if species are being transported illegally , or places like Costa Rica where the sheer richness of one group of plants , like orchids , makes accurate cataloguing difficult . "
The matK gene may not , however , be able to be used to identify every plant species on Earth .
In a few groups of species , additional genetic information may be required for species - level identification because hybridization - where species cross-breed and genetic material is rearranged - may confuse the information provided by matK .
This research was funded by the Defra Darwin Initiative , the Universities of Johannesburg and Costa Rica , the South African National Research Foundation , the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , and the Royal Society .
Joan Ruddock , Minister for Climate Change and Biodiversity said : " This is a great breakthrough that could save many endangered plants .
The Defra - funded Darwin Initiative has a reputation for producing real and lasting results and I congratulate everyone involved in this project which could have huge benefits for plant identification and conservation in the future . "
US admits waterboarding terror suspects style = ” width : 145 px ; height : 185 px ” height = ” 185 ″ alt =” watertorture.jpg ”
Wednesday , 6 February 2008
Â© 2008 Independent News and Media Limited
Senate Democrats demanded a criminal investigation into waterboarding by government interrogators after the Bush administration admitted for the first time that the tactic was used on three terror suspects .
In congressional testimony , CIA director Michael Hayden became the first administration official to publicly acknowledge the agency used waterboarding on detainees following the September 11 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Waterboarding involves strapping a suspect down and pouring water over his cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
It has been traced back hundreds of years , to the Spanish Inquisition , and is condemned by nations around the world .
“ We used it against these three detainees because of the circumstances at the time , ” Mr Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee .
“ There was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were inevitable .
And we had limited knowledge about al Qaida and its workings .
Those two realities have changed . ”
Hayden said Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri were waterboarded in 2002 and 2003 .
Mr Hayden banned the technique in 2006 , but National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell told senators during the same hearing yesterday that waterboarding remained in the CIA arsenal – so long as it had the specific consent of the president and legal approval of the attorney general .
That prompted Senator Dick Durbin , the Senate ’s number two Democrat and a member of the Judiciary Committee , to call on the Justice Department to open a criminal inquiry into whether past use of waterboarding broke any law .
The Pentagon has banned its employees from using waterboarding to extract information from detainees and FBI Director Robert Mueller said his investigators did not use coercive tactics in interviewing terror suspects .
Senator Durbin , already frustrated with attorney general Michael Mukasey ’s refusal last week to define waterboarding as a form of torture – as critics have – said he would block the nomination of the Justice Department ’s second in command if the criminal inquiry was not opened .
It was a particularly sharp threat by Senator Durbin , who represents Illinois – the same state that US District Judge Mark Filip of Chicago , the deputy attorney general nominee , calls home .
“ In light of the Justice Department ’s continued non-responsiveness to Congress on the issue of torture , including your disappointing testimony on waterboarding last week , I have reluctantly concluded that placing a hold on Judge Filip ’s nomination is my only recourse for eliciting timely and complete responses to important questions on torture , ” Senator Durbin wrote in a letter to Mr Mukasey yesterday .
He added : “ A Justice Department investigation should explore whether waterboarding was authorized and whether those who authorized it violated the law . ”
Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse declined to comment except to say that the department “ is reviewing the letter carefully ” .
Human Rights
Watch , which has been calling on the US government to outlaw waterboarding as a form of illegal torture , called Mr Hayden ’s testimony “ an explicit admission of criminal activity ” .
Joanne Mariner , the group ’s counterterrorism director , said it “ gives the lie ” to the administration ’s claims that the CIA had not used torture .
“ Waterboarding is torture , and torture is a crime , ” she said .
Critics say waterboarding has been outlawed under the United Nations ’ Convention Against Torture , which prohibits treatment resulting in long - term physical or mental damage .
They also say it should be recognised as banned under the US 2006 Military Commissions
Act , which prohibits treatment of terror suspects that is described as “ cruel , inhuman and degrading ” .
The act , however , does not explicitly ban waterboarding by name .
During his own Senate appearance last week , Mr Mukasey refused to declare waterboarding illegal , prompting Democrats to accuse him of potentially allowing the harsh interrogation tactic to be used in the future .

The website gathered out of copyright musical scores
In February 2006 , a part - time Canadian music student established a modest , non-commercial website that used collaborative wiki tools , such as those used by Wikipedia , to create an online library of public domain musical scores .
Within a matter of months , the International Music Score Library Project ( IMSLP ) featured more than 1,000 musical scores for which the copyright had expired in Canada .
Within two years - without any funding , sponsorship or promotion - the site had become the largest public domain music score library on the internet , generating a million hits per day , featuring over 15,000 scores by over 1,000 composers , and adding 2,000 new scores each month .
In mid-October this year the IMSLP disappeared from the internet .
Universal Edition , an Austrian music publisher , retained a Canadian law firm to demand that the site block European users from accessing certain works and from adding new scores for which the copyright had not expired in Europe .
The company noted that while the music scores entered the public domain in Canada 50 years after a composer 's death , Europe 's copyright term is 20 years longer .
The legal demand led to many sleepless nights as the student struggled with the prospect of liability for activity that is perfectly lawful in Canada .
The site had been very careful about copyright compliance , establishing a review system by experienced administrators who would only post new music scores that were clearly in the Canadian public domain .
Notwithstanding those efforts , on 19 October , the law firm 's stated deadline , the student took the world 's best public domain music scores site offline .
This case is enormously important from a public domain perspective .
Michael Geist
There is little doubt that the site was compliant with Canadian law .
Not only is there no obligation to block non-Canadian visitors , but the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that sites such as IMSLP are entitled to presume that they are being used in a lawful manner .
The site would therefore not be subject to claims that it authorised infringement .
Further , while there have been some suggestions that the site also hosted works that were not in the Canadian public domain , Universal Edition never bothered to provide the IMSLP with a complete list of allegedly infringing works .
Although IMSLP is on safe ground under Canadian law , the European perspective on the issue is more complicated .
There is no question that some of the site 's music scores would infringe European copyright law if sold or distributed in Europe .
However , the IMSLP had no real or substantial connection - the defining standard for jurisdiction - with Europe .
Indeed , if Universal Edition were to file a lawsuit in Austria , it is entirely possible that the Austrian court would dismiss it on the grounds that it cannot assert jurisdiction over the Canadian - based site .
Geist : Making sites comply with all laws is an impossible task
This case is enormously important from a public - domain perspective .
If Universal Edition is correct , then the public domain becomes an offline concept , since posting works online would immediately result in the longest copyright term applying on a global basis .
Moreover , there are even broader implications for online businesses .
According to Universal Edition , businesses must comply both with their local laws and with the requirements of any other jurisdiction where their site is accessible - in other words , the laws of virtually every country on earth .
It is safe to say that e-commerce would grind to a halt under that standard since few organisations can realistically comply with hundreds of foreign laws .
Thousands of music aficionados are rooting for the IMSLP in this dispute .
They ought to be joined by anyone with an interest in a robust public domain and a viable e-commerce marketplace .

If you need information , the Internet offers a wealth of resources .
But if you 're hunting down a person or a thing , a computer 's not much help .
That may soon change .
Electronic tags promise to create what some call the " Internet of things , " in which objects and people are connected through a virtual network .
To see what this future world would be like , a pilot project involving dozens of volunteers in the University of Washington 's computer science building provides the next step in social networking , wirelessly monitoring people and things in a closed environment .
Beginning in March , volunteer students , engineers and staff will wear electronic tags on their clothing and belongings to sense their location every five seconds throughout much of the six - story building .
The information will be saved to a database , published to Web pages and used in various custom tools .
The project is one of the largest experiments looking at wireless tags in a social setting .
The RFID Ecosystem project aims to create a world that many technology experts predict is just on the horizon , said project leader Magda Balazinska , a UW assistant professor of computer science and engineering .
The project explores the use of radio - frequency identification , or RFID , tags in a social environment .
The team has installed some 200 antennas in the Paul Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering .
Early next month researchers will begin recruiting 50 volunteers from about 400 people who regularly use the building .
" Our goal is to ask what benefits can we get out of this technology and how can we protect people 's privacy at the same time , " Balazinska said .
" We want to get a handle on the issues that would crop up if these systems become a reality . "
Many businesses already use RFID tags to track products in the supply chain .
Now the tool is moving to other areas .
Some transit agencies use radio tags in bus and train passes .
The new U.S. passports incorporate RFID tags .
Technology experts predict that RFID tags will soon be incorporated in consumer devices , such as cell phones , laptops and music players .
Each tag , which looks a bit like a thin , flexible credit card , costs about 20 cents to produce .
A specialized reader can scan the card through any non-metal barrier and from up to 30 feet away , depending on the type of tag .
RFID tags are miniature computer chips that contain far more information than a barcode .
Also , you can write to an RFID tag -- meaning the signal could not only identify the item , but what group it belongs to , when it was last seen , and other information .

The technology has already proven its use in tracking goods .
A manufacturer can identify a cart of hamburger patties and know which plant it came from , when it shipped out and a history of its temperature during transit .
UW computer - science staff members have already requested to participate in the study so that they will be able to track their equipment as it is moved through the building .
But for people , the technology 's power raises questions .
An RFID card can be read from a distance and without the wearer 's knowledge .
The associated databases archive vast amounts of information .
" What if RFID readers were everywhere , and everything had RFID tags ?
What are the pluses and minuses ?
What do you do with all that data ? " said Gaetano Borriello , a UW professor of computer science and engineering .
" In computer science , we try to create a future world that does n't exist yet .
We 'd like to get some experience rather than just conjecture about this . "
The researchers received human subjects approval to conduct the trial .
Each participant will be able to control who can see his or her data , and can delete any data or opt out of the study at any time without explanation or penalty .
Researchers also note that they have not placed any RFID readers near bathrooms or eating areas , because these are considered personal spaces .
Study volunteers will be interviewed periodically .
The researchers will be assessing both positive aspects , such as keeping track of everything from where you lost your laptop charger to where your friends are meeting for coffee , and negative aspects in terms of loss of privacy .

" Even if you wanted to study just privacy , or just utility , you 'd have to study the other as well , " said Evan Welbourne , a UW doctoral student in computer science and engineering .
" People are more likely to give out information if there 's a benefit to them .
You can't really separate issues of privacy from issues of utility . "
Research members have been testing the system on themselves .
Over the past year , all 10 members of the group have worn the tags on their necks and placed them on certain belongings .
Balazinska set the system so that she can't see her students , but she allows them to access her data .
The students occasionally used the alerts to catch their adviser on her way out of the building .
Many members of the team reported using the database to find out where they had left their belongings .
The pilot study will incorporate two new student - developed features that aim to exploit the system 's potential benefits .
One invention is a tool that records a person 's movements in Google Calendar .
Study participants can set the system to instantaneously publish activities on their Web calendar , such as arrival at work , meetings or lunch breaks .
" It 's a perfect memory system that records all your personal interactions throughout the day , " Welbourne said .
" You can go back a day later , a month later , and see , ‘ What did I do that day ? ' or , ' Who have I spent my time with lately ? ' "
Another tool is a friend finder , named RFIDder ( pronounced " fritter " ) .
This sends instant alerts to participants ' e-mail addresses or cell phones telling them when friends are in certain places .
With RFIDder , each user can specify who is allowed to see their data .
They can change the settings at any time , and can easily turn it off whenever they do n't want to be found .
The system will link to Twitter , an online blog that lets people post their whereabouts online .
" We want to observe how a group of people uses these tools , whether they find them useful , how they adapt them , " Balazinska said .
Researchers are also devising ways to deal with the many technical challenges involved in sorting RFID data .
As data floods in , the researchers would like to make sense of it .
They also want to develop a main database where people can find the information they need , but can't abuse it by looking at too much of other people 's personal information .
Proposals include systems that would impose a cost for looking up certain types of information , or that would let people see who is accessing their data .
A major research focus is extracting information from imperfect data .
Metal can block the RFID signal and using the data to figure out people 's actual position is tricky .
Current systems combine artificial intelligence and database techniques to produce usable information , Balazinska said .
" This is a major project that has many facets , " Balazinska said .
" We worry that these technologies are being implemented too quickly , and with this system we want to explore it in a controlled environment , to inform the public and policymakers about issues we might face . "
The project is funded by the National Science Foundation , Microsoft Research and the UW 's College of Engineering .
It 's starting to look like the tide is turning in our favor on this afternoon 's cloture vote for the amnesty - laden FISA bill .
Keep the pressure up , folks , we might win this one !
According to the Clinton and Obama campaigns , both senators will be present to vote against cloture .
Sen .
Rockefeller has already said he 'll vote against cloture on his own bill .
This diary declares that a staffer for Dick Durbin says he 'll support Dodd 's filibuster , which ought to mean he 'll vote against cloture .
Bill Nelson ( FL ) supports
Dodd 's amendment and may be coming around to voting against cloture .
We 've also learned that Salazar 's staff is hoping he 'll vote against cloture .
It 's time to assemble as much information as possible about what you 've learned from your calls to Senatorial offices about where each of the Democrats stand in regard to cloture .
Please use the comments here for that purpose .
And keep up the calls and emails .
Below is a list of the main Democrats we need to persuade .
Many of these phone numbers are either being shut down ( like Mikulski's ) , or jammed with calls .
So if you can't get through in DC , and you 've tried several times already , take a different route to making your voice heard - try calling one of the Senator 's offices back home .
And if you do , report here what numbers you 've gotten through on and how willing the home - state staffers are to take down information .
And remember too that you need to be polite but firm .
Do n't let staffers brush your concerns off .
If they are dismissive , add a note in the comments here .
The Senate offices are the people 's offices as well .
You have a right to make your opinion known , and I doubt many senators will want to see their own offices being singled out for treating constituents badly .
Bayh ( 202 ) 224-5623
Carper ( 202 ) 224-2441
Inouye ( 202 ) 224-3934
Johnson ( 202 ) 224-5842
Landrieu ( 202)224-5824
McCaskill ( 202 ) 224-6154
Mikulski ( 202 ) 224-4654
Nelson ( FL ) ( 202 ) 224-5274
Nelson ( NE ) ( 202 ) 224-6551
Pryor ( 202 ) 224-2353
Salazar ( 202 ) 224-5852
In addition , here is a general clearinghouse for calling or e-mailing your own Senators .
You can also use the tools created by CREDO and EFF if you prefer .
UPDATE 1 : It looks as if Arlen Specter is going to vote against cloture .
If John McCain is absent while campaigning in Florida , it may not be possible for the Republicans to gain the 60 votes they need .
That remains unclear , however , so keep the phones ringing .
Now is the time to press the advantage home .
If the Republican side begins to slip visibly , it will be a lot easier to move the quavering " moderates " into the right column .
And the more who line up against cloture , the stronger that opposition to telecom amnesty will appear to be .
Appearances matter when you 're trying to round up votes .
UPDATE 2 : Sen .
Mikulski reportedly will vote against cloture as well .
The momentum on our side is building .

I find it quite ironic that while conservatives are all about cutting spending at home , they now claim that one of the keys to good governance in Iraq is increased government spending .
( Even Mike O'Hanlon now thinks that this is an important benchmark ) .
I guess we should n't worry about things like this :
Jobless men pay $ 500 bribes to join the police .
Families build houses illegally on government land , carwashes steal water from public pipes , and nearly everything the government buys or sells can now be found on the black market .
So basically .
Insuring poor and middle income children in the United States = government waste .
Stealing billions of dollars from the Iraqi government = progress in the " war on terror " .

Let us abandon Congress , which means let us abandon the U.S. Constitution that establishes Congress .
When a business project is losing money , any rational owner either fixes it up , sells it , or abandons it .
I know of no evidence that Congress or the Constitution can be fixed up .
The opposite evidence , a continuously malfunctioning organization , is reported daily in every Act of Congress .
To fix up Congress properly for 300 million diverse Americans would require an impossibility : a political consensus concerning the acceptable law of the land .
This law would be a minimalist affair that is not even remotely held as a fervent desire in the hearts and minds of most Americans .
I conclude that Congress and the Constitution are broken and ca n’t be fixed .
We should abandon them .
The country is not broken .
The people with all their many skills , their knowledge , their economy , their drives , their associations , and so on remain intact .
We merely need to rid ourselves of an unnecessary and counter - productive encumbrance .
The country will function better without Congress and the Constitution than with it .
The abandonment might proceed by various Declarations of Independence made by various groups .
There is no telling what sorts of political entities might emerge from such a process .
Yet there are several sure results of such a fracturing of the U.S.
It would result in a much higher degree of political competition and choice than at present .
In a situation in which there is no unifying political monopoly , as represented by Congress and the Constitution , no individual group could enforce counter - productive laws for long .
People could move away from jurisdictions that thwarted them to jurisdictions that favored the realization of their goals .
The processes of migration to favorable environments have a long history of fostering human progress .
They have occurred often in U.S. and world history .
They are occurring now .
They involve people and capital .
They involve new agreements and laws .
They involve the implementation of new technologies .
They involve new economies building up .
All these processes are frustrated when Congress imposes laws and mandates across all sorts of people and jurisdictions , across technologies , and across capital flows .
Congress is strangling the competition , migration , movements , and capital flows that are essential to full - fledged progress .
It is replacing them with restriction , prevention , constriction , and retardation .
The Congressional process is producing a society ruled by an elite whose only interest is in itself , in its own power , privilege , wealth , and rule .
Congress is ruining the country .
Congress has just passed a bill , signed by President Bush , that bans the incandescent light bulb .
I hope that this bill proves to be a fatal error on the part of Congress .
I hope it sparks the overdue revolution in the American political system that I hope for .
Since the light bulb is an item that reaches every person in America , as pervasive an item as tea once was to another set of revolutionaries , perhaps Americans will awake to the stranglehold that Congress has on all of us .
My hopes are not high because every person also uses paper money , and the political processes that took Americans away from gold and into an ever - depreciating legal tender have not occasioned a revolution .
Nevertheless , I hope , if only to make crystal clear that nothing less than such a revolution , which will of course require a revolution in the hearts and minds of millions of Americans , can unlock the submerged and suppressed energies that are the consequences of that true and unique American ideal of freedom that once propelled this country into the forefront of all the world ’s countries and made it an attractor for millions upon millions of immigrants anxious to better themselves and escape the strangleholds of their native lands .
Has not our nation now become one of those lands now exercising a dominion and stranglehold upon its own people that suffocates and suppresses ?
When a Congress forces every American to use an expensive " compact fluorescent light " ( CFL ) that contains high levels of mercury and that imposes significant health hazards and outrageous cleanup costs when a bulb is merely broken or shattered , is not the time long past for every single person to realize that the American political system is beyond saving ?
Nothing less will do but to abandon Congress and the U.S. Constitution .
The forces of progress will overtake Americans in one way or another and show up Congress for the throwback that it is .
While Congress worries about saving energy by regulating the light bulb , the Toshiba Corporation is marketing a new micro nuclear reactor .
It can provide electric power at substantial savings to ordinary grid costs .
Many more such innovations await us .
This is an example of the migration of technology and capital we welcome in a free economy .
It is the very opposite of the mastodon that Congress is .
Congress is an outmoded , useless , and dysfunctional organization , trampling everything it steps upon , geared only to the emoluments , favors , and privileges of those parasites who traverse its widening circle of money and influence peddling .
Congress is simply a ring of tax money , lobbyists , influence - peddlers , favor - seekers , and corrupt politicians who feed their own appetites with the money stolen from income - producing Americans .
We the People absolutely do not need such a beast that crushes us and frustrates our every move .
As this beast grows more powerful , it increasingly surrounds and confines all potential political competition .
Thwarting the forces of migration and progress , Congress distorts the economy it rules by a wave of its laws .
Congress doubles corn prices and boosts food prices while subsidizing the inefficient production of ethanol fuel , a fuel that promises to harm automobile engines in devious and hidden ways .
Congress passes the " America Competes Act , " which continues the government ’s attack on freedom and free markets .
How can a clumsy politically - driven law make any claim whatsoever to boosting competition ?
How can such a process driven by coerced taxpayer funding and politically - driven favoritism do anything but retard competition ?
Here is a law that continues to nationalize science and divert it to politically - favored ends .
There could not be a more dangerous , wasteful , and anti-competitive law than one that throws more money at the National Science Foundation , the Department of Energy ’s Office of Science , NASA , and NOAA .
All the government propaganda about freedom is belied by this law ’s " Establishing a President ’s Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation and competitiveness in the public and private sectors . "
Even a minimal understanding of free markets tells us that such a council is totally absurd .
It will do nothing but seed a center for economic control .
Years after socialism and communism have been discredited , our government via its Congress is engaged in an open , yet stealthy , advancement of the controlled and planned economy !
How many thousand cuts does it take before we realize that Congress is advancing an agenda in the U.S. that is against progress and for its own centralized and monopolistic power ?
Congress has signed its own death warrant by such mad and outrageous tyrannies .
They have been going on for decades .
They only become more and more bold and repugnant .
Abandon Congress , I say .
Abandon this beastly organization of crafty deviousness and greed that disguises itself as America ’s savior .
Abandon Congress !
Away with it .
Be done with it .
It has no saving grace .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
I ’d like to tell you a little story , if I may , from way , way back in 2002 .
( The exact date is lost to the mists of time , but the year is pretty solid . )
Like a lot of stories , it ’s little bit long ; but unlike some stories , it ’s true .
As the engineering staff at Netscape prepared a new release of Mozilla , the browser off which we branched Navigator , those of us in the Technology Evangelism / Developer Support ( TEDS ) team were testing it against high - ranked and partner sites .
On a few of those sites , we discovered that layouts were breaking apart .
In one case , it did so quite severely .
It did n’t take much to see that the problem was with sliced images in layout tables .
For some reason , on some sites they were getting pushed apart .
After a bit of digging , we realized the reason : the Gecko engine had updated its line - layout model to be more compliant with the CSS specification .
Now images always sat on the baseline ( unless otherwise directed ) and the descender space was always preserved .
This was pretty new in browserdom , because every other browser did what browsers had always done : shrink - wrapped table cells to an image if there was no other cell content .
The only problem was that behavior was wrong .
Fixing the flaws in the CSS implementation in Gecko had broken these sites ’ layouts .
That is , it broke them in standards mode .
In quirks mode , Gecko rolled its behavior back to the old days and did the shrink - wrap thing .
We got in touch with the web team at one of the affected sites , a very prominent social networking site ( of a sort ) of the day , and explained the situation .
We already knew they could n’t change their DOCTYPE to trigger quirks mode , because that would break other things they were doing .
We could n’t offer them a simple CSS fix like td img {vertical - align : bottom ;} , because their whole layout was in tables and that would throw off the placement of all their images , not just the sliced ones .
All we could offer was an explanation of the problem and to recommend they class all of their sliced images and use CSS to bottom them out , with assurances that this would cause no change in other browsers .
Their response was , in effect : “ No .
This is your problem .
Every other browser gets this right , and we ’re not mucking around in our templates and adding classes all over just because you broke something . ”
The truth , of course , was that we were actually fixing something , and every other browser got this wrong .
The truth was not relevant to our problem .
It seemed we had a choice : we could back out the improvement to our handling of the CSS specification ; or we could break the site and all the other sites like it , which at the time were many .
Neither was really palatable .
And word was we could not ship without fixing this problem , whether by getting the site updated or the browser changed .
Those were the options .
Let me reiterate the situation we faced .
We :
Had improved standards support in the browser , and then Found sites whose layouts broke as a result
Whose developers point - blank refused to alter their sites
And we had to fix the problem
We could n’t back out the improvement ; it affected all text displayed in the browser and touched too many other things .
We could n’t make the site ’s web team change anything , no matter how many times we told them this was part of the advance of web standards and better browser behavior .
Two roads diverged in a yellow web , and we could choose neither .
So we found a third way : “ almost standards ” mode , a companion to the usual modes of quirks and standards .
Yes , this is the reason why “ almost standards ” mode exists .
If I remember the internal argument properly , its existence is largely my fault ; so to everyone who ’s had to implement an “ almost standards ” mode in a non-Gecko browser in order to mirror what we did , I ’m sorry .
We made “ almost standards ” mode apply to the DOCTYPE found on the offending site — an XHTML DOCTYPE , I should point out .
While we were at it , we rolled in IBM ’s custom DTD .
They were using it make their site validate while doing all kinds of HTML - invalid stuff , and they were experiencing the same layout problem .
And lo : a third layout mode was born .
All because some sites were badly done and would not update to accommodate our improvements .
We did it so as not to break a small ( but popular ) portion of the web while we advanced our standards support .
( By the way , it was this very same incident that gave birth to the article “ Images , Tables , and Mysterious Gaps “ . )
Now take that situation and multiply it by a few orders of magnitude , and you get an idea of what the IE team faces .
It ’s right where we were at Netscape : caught between our past mistakes and a site ’s refusal to accommodate our desire to improve support for open standards .
Some have said that Microsoft is in a unique position to take leadership and spread the news of improved standards and updating old sites to its customers .
That ’s true .
But what happens when a multi-billion dollar partner corporation refuses to update and demands , under the terms of its very large service contract and its very steep penalty clauses , that a new version of IE not break ( for whatever value of “ break ” you like ) its corporate intranet , or its public e-commerce site ?
It only takes one to create a pretty large roadblock .
For all we did in publishing great content to DevEdge , proactively helping sites to update their markup and CSS and JS to work with Gecko ( while not breaking in other browsers ) , and helping guide the improvement of standards support in Gecko , we could not overcome this obstacle .
We had to work around it .
Looking back on it now , it ’s likely this experience subconsciously predisposed me to eventually accept the version targeting proposal , because in a fairly substantial way , it ’s what we did to Mozilla under similar conditions .
We just did it in a much more obscure and ultimately fragile manner , tying it to certain DOCTYPEs instead of some more reliable anchor .
If we could have given that site ( all those sites ) an easy way to say “ render like Mozilla 0.9 ” ( or whatever ) at the top of every page , or in the server headers , they might have taken it .
But had we offered and they refused , putting us back to the choice of backing out the improvements or changing the browser , would we have set things up to default to the specific , known version of Mozilla instead of the latest and greatest ?
The idealist in me likes to think not .
The pragmatist in me nods yes .
What else could we have done in that circumstance ?
Shipped a browser that broke a top - ten site on the theory that once it was in the wild , they ’d acquiesce ?
Even knowing that this would noticeably and , in a few cases , seriously degrade the browsing experience for our users ?
No .
We ’d have shipped without the CSS improvement , or we ’d have put in the targeting with the wrong default .
We did n’t have version targeting , but we still made the same choice , only we hinged it on the DOCTYPE .
A short - term fix for a short - term problem : yes .
Yet had we not done it , how long would Netscape / Mozilla ’s standards support have suffered , waiting for the day that we could add that improvement back in without breaking too many sites that too many people would notice ?
Years , possibly .
So we put in a badly implemented type of version targeting , which allowed us to improve our standards support more quickly than we otherwise would have , and it has been with us for the more than half a decade since .
So maybe I ’m more sympathetic to the IE predicament and their proposed solution because I ’ve been there and done it already .
Not to nearly the same degree , but the dilemma seemed no less daunting for all the difference in scale .
It ’s something worth keeping in mind while evaluating what I ’ve said on this topic , and whatever I will say in the future .
Bush 's policy on terror suspect detainees has been criticised
What is the significance of this announcement ?
It had long been thought that the US was holding at least some suspected terrorists in secret CIA prisons , not least since the whereabouts of some prominent figures such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were unknown for years .
Mr Bush 's announcement officially acknowledges that the secret CIA detention programme exists and that it uses " an alternative set of procedures " to elicit information from suspects trained to resist interrogation .
He said he could not reveal the what the methods were because " it would help the terrorists learn how to resist questioning " .
He added that the interrogation techniques did not constitute torture , which he said he had not authorised and would never authorise .
And he detailed what he said were a number of plots against the United States and its allies that had been prevented because of information gleaned from CIA interrogations .
Why did President Bush acknowledge the existence of the CIA programme now ?
He himself said he was doing so because the questioning of the 14 suspects in CIA custody was complete and the men were now being transferred to US military custody at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The administration had been planning to try at least some of the Guantanamo Bay detainees by military commission , but the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that there was no legal framework for doing that .
Mr Bush has now proposed legislation that would allow the military trials to go ahead , but the clock is ticking - Congress is sitting for only a few more weeks before they recess to campaign for mid-term elections , scheduled for 7 November .
The president also had one eye on the fifth anniversary of 9/11 , saying the families of those killed in the attacks had waited long enough for justice .
He said the US wanted to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other suspects to trial .
Why have the secret prisons been controversial ?
Word of the secret prisons was leaked to the Washington Post newspaper , which reported that the US had set up " black sites " abroad for the interrogation of high - value suspects .
The European Parliament called for an investigation in light of the suspicion that some of the detention centres were in Europe , while the US Senate demanded information from the country 's director of national intelligence .
Human rights groups also criticised the alleged secret detention programme as being beyond the rule of law and not affording sufficient protection to detainees .
The US allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross to have access to Guantanamo Bay , but not to the secret CIA prisons .
What happens next ?
The 14 suspects mentioned in Mr Bush 's 6 September speech - including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Ramzi Binalshibh and Abu Zubaydah - have already been transferred to Guantanamo Bay .
Mr Bush hopes to get legislation quickly through Congress to authorise military tribunals of the detainees , but it is not clear whether or not that is realistic .
Every member of the House of Representatives and one in three senators is running for re-election in November .
No candidate will want to be seen as soft on defence , but Mr Bush is a fairly unpopular figure in the US at the moment , so it is also not necessarily to a candidate 's advantage to be too closely linked to him .
And even members of Mr Bush 's own Republican party - such as Senator John McCain - are already expressing doubts about details of the president 's proposals , such as barring defendants from seeing all the evidence against them .
Meanwhile , the secret CIA detention programme will continue to exist , even with no - one in custody , the president said , because having it in the future " for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life - saving information " .
An excerpt from Minstrel : A Novella
1 …
The weatherman on Channel 5 had said that the temperature would reach upwards of one hundred ten degrees , which meant that the mayor ’s office would announce a code red heat index .
And so when Isaiah Williams climbed on the bus and attempted to put his quarter into the slot with his one free hand , the driver ’s gloved one waved it away , obeying the mandate of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority .
Even though he was receiving treatment usually reserved for senior citizens , Isaiah did n’t sit down in the sideways seats that faced each other , but with both hands dragged the leather guitar case down the aisle , and sat in the back , alone .
He closed his eyes , inhaled , and listened to the bus ’s rumbling as the brakes exhaled at the stoplight .
He figured that they would have amps at the studio .
It would not be a large studio .
There would be mirrors and a long , metal bar on the far wall because there is a ballet class on the weekends .
There would be hardwood floors with blue mats because there is a karate class for elementary school kids in the afternoon , and a women ’s self - defense class at night .
Perhaps to defend against people who looked like him , he mused .
They would not own it , but they could afford to rent it , and they could afford their own amps .
He was sure of that .
He opened his eyes , looked out the window , and saw houses with trees that were planted in the front yards but reached across the street towards one another and blocked the burdensome sun from the finishes of the cars below .
On the sidewalks were blonde women in sweatsuits with iPods on their hips and the leashes of golden retrievers in their hands .
The bus rumbled to a stop beside a small Bank of America , and the doors opened as Isaiah stepped down the stairs , then pulled his bass guitar case off with him .
He scratched his head , his finger running between the long , thin cornrows that curled around his skull and draped down his spine .
Despite the weather warning , he wore his baggy carpenter blue jeans , but because of it , a very loose - fitting XXL Bob Marley T - shirt that hung upon his tall , lanky frame .
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded up sheet of newsprint cut out from the underground newspaper called the CityPaper .
It read :

Isaiah had circled “ Existentialist ” and “ Post - punk . ” “ Existentialist ” because he had read Albert Camus ’s The Stranger for English class and found Meursault to be intriguing .
“ Post - punk ” because he had heard that term used to describe Bloc Party , a British band .
Not the kind with oily hair falling over their ears and two - piece suits that do n’t quite fit right .
The kind that like to wear their collared shirts tucked in and with the sleeves rolled up , but no neckties , or perhaps simple T - shirts that wrap around them with sleeves that reach inches below their shoulders .
When Kele Okereke , with skin like pine bark , and dreads like a willow , lead sings , he sounds like a young boy who has learned something about the world that he does not like , and will see to it that it is changed once he grows older .
He had downloaded their album at school and brought it home on two Zip disks to listen to in his room .
Isaiah ’s left knee would bounce up and down until he was forced to stand up and roll his hips and knees like pistons when he listened to their “ post - punk art rock ” sound , his upper body ricocheting from one pose to another , and then rocking back again .
He would continue this rocking and rolling until he heard the door to his room creaking open .
He would turn and see his father , a bespectacled bald man with a grim goatee , wearing a necktie and an ID card in a lanyard , rolling his eyes and shaking his head .
His father did not download , but bought Motown compilation CDs that he rarely listened to , content to carefully arrange them in alphabetical order on the shelves beside his own computer .
So , each night , after Samuel Williams checked in on his son after arriving home from work , he would then go to his room and turn on Newshour , and Isaiah would turn down the volume on his computer ’s speakers .
At least they both supported public broadcasting .
His father had heard The Refugee All - Stars of Sierra Leone play on The Kojo Nnamdi Show a month before , and had recorded the stream onto a CD and given it to him .
Isaiah put it in his computer drive and soon felt his shoulders tilt up and down in time with their reggae - like rhythm , his lips soundlessly responding to the lead singer ’s calls .
As soon as he had finished listening to it , he took it to his father ’s bedroom and handed it back to him .
But his father ’s hands were always busy dealing cards for solitaire .
He never took it back without first giving the preamble to one of his long black history lectures .
“ You know , boy , ” he would begin .
“ The style of music your band plays was n’t just influenced by the ones in sequined bellbottoms and afros .
It goes even further back .
Back past the speakeasies where the men wore loud suits and fedoras with long feathers and the women ’s lipstick and nails were so red they could ride in the backseat and just turn around to signal that the vehicle was coming to a stop .
Back behind the fields where eyes sunk beneath hats of straw as they lowered themselves to reach into the leaves to pull out what was inside and whispered songs into the soil while they were down there .
Back in the wake of the ships carrying those uprooted , whose lips were sealed but whose feet stamped the wooden planks hoping they could force themselves back in and somehow get back home .
Back home , where though they had been betrayed by their own they could find solace beneath the sun that gave gifts , not burdens . ”
Instead of asking an intelligent follow - up question to further the discussion as Kojo Nnamdi would do , Isaiah would , at that point , say , “ This has been another black history barrage with Samuel Williams .
Stay in school , so that he does n’t take it upon himself to educate you . ”
And defeated , his father would sigh and say , “ Fine , son , fine .
You can go , for now .
I ’m through with you . ”
He ’d written “ smooth jazz ” in the corner , as a note to himself , to remind himself to watch for any evidence of the commission of the offense .
He hoped they did not turn out to be guilty of being a smooth jazz band .
Smooth jazz bands , he knew , do not play jazz because they enjoy jazz .
They play jazz so that people will find them intriguing , because everyone says that they enjoy jazz .
They play jazz at jazz clubs with “ No smoking ” signs and autographed photos of Kenny G on the walls .
Bands that play smooth jazz are not the only smooth jazz bands .
Any band that puts out an album on CD with a DVD as a “ limited edition ” is a smooth jazz band .
A band that plays a set that is shorter than its opening act because it only has one album and has n’t written line one for its new album is a smooth jazz band .
A rapper ’s entourage , whose members do little more than march around on stage and shout along with the end of every rhyme , that is a smooth jazz band .
Michael Bolton is a smooth jazz band .
Isaiah already knew he would get into the band .
Or , at least , that he had the requisite talent , skill , and experience to play with them .
The question was if they would turn down their noses long enough to be able to see it , for he knew that the band he had formed before had been known all over the city , or at least the parts of the city that mattered .
Where the bouncers did n’t worry about your cheap , cotton - polyester clothes , just as long as there was no metal underneath them .
Where smooth jazz was contraband .
His guitar case handle tight in his hand , he began to walk down the street , looking again at the address he had been given from his phone conversation with whoever called himself “ str8edgejunkie . ”
Even before he had finished writing it , he had clearly drawn the neighborhood in his mind .
He knew he would cross even streets and pass coffee shops on the lobby floors of high - rise buildings with windows for walls , displaying all the laptops the patrons feverishly typed ( but never spilled their lattes ) on .
He knew he would not see any fried chicken carry - outs with barred windows , surrounded by long since faded posters advertising the new Kool Moe Dee album .
He might see some of the friends he had made ( “ acquaintances , ” his father always called them ) from school , since it was only a few blocks from the high school that his father had ( begrudgingly ) allowed him to take the subway across town to attend .
He would not see any of the friends ( “ hoodlums , ” his father always called them ) that he grew up with .
The building he had been searching for was a two - story building with walls of yellow bricks , shoved between a dry cleaners and a video store .
Isaiah entered and squeezed through a narrow corridor to a metal door plastered in chipping blue paint with a window just big enough for his face to be seen from the other side .
He pushed it open .
Across the hardwood floor with a rolled up blue mat in the corner , he saw his own reflection , severed at the waist by a metal bar attached to the mirror .
In the middle of the room , three boys stood hunch - shouldered beside the drum set , muttering to each other with the same affected , aloof voice that had filled the halls of Isaiah ’s high school .
They turned and tilted their heads up in his direction .
Isaiah stepped over a tangled web of cables that came from outlets in the walls and approached them .
The ad was n’t kidding .
They were dressed so differently from another , Isaiah thought they could have been in a three - tour - bus pileup on the highway , and had to exchange insurance info before they could continue on to whatever battle of the bands they were headed for .
Except they were all wearing Chuck Taylor All - Stars .
The first was a punk , all in black from head to toe , in a studded belt , safety pins in the sleeves of his T - shirt , eyebrow and lip rings , and a checkered flat cap on a mass of restless black hair .
“ Sup ? ” he asked .
“ I ’m Aidan . ”
The emo kid waved briefly , the sleeves of his wrinkled white , collared shirt rolled up , and peered at Isaiah through brown , unkempt bangs and horn - rimmed glasses without lenses .
“ Hey … ” he muttered .
“ I ’m Cameron . ”
The last one sat behind the drum set , which obscured the faded blue jeans but not the black T - shirt with the yellow smiley face on it , under red hair , draped back to make room for long , similarly colored sideburns .
Isaiah was less certain about him , but he settled on “ alt - country . ”
“ Nice shirt , ” the alt - country kid said .
“ Thanks . ”
“ I ’m Zeke . ”
Aidan looked down at Isaiah ’s case .
“ You said on the phone you play bass , right ? ”
“ Yeah , ” said Isaiah .
“ So … I guess you ’re str8edgejunkie , huh ? ”
Aidan nodded .
Isaiah handed him the flyer , Aidan chuckled when he saw what Isaiah had circled , and handed it back .
“ Cool .
Glad you could make it . ”
“ No problem .
So , I guess you guys have up been in this studio all day , then . ”
“ Yeah , ” said Aidan .
“ You ’ve been here , standing in a circle like this , faking like you ’re all equal , like the Knights of the Round Table , when really , your instruments are all trying to out - blare each other , assert dominance over each other , because might makes right . ”
“ Yeah . ”
“ And you all are the core of the band because you already know what each other ’s true voices sound like and determined that only the most grandiose terms would apply .
And that ad in the CityPaper was a clarion call to all other grandiose - thinking , restless thanes seeking honor and glory on the field of battle . ”
“ Yeah . ”
“ So you have all been standing and stomping here , pausing only at the sound of that metal door behind me making semicircular skid marks in the floor , with each newcomer swaggering in , knowing how badly this test will wear away at his number two pencil but not having an accurate account of just how much lead he ’s got . ”
“ No , ” said Aidan .
“ No ? ”
“ You ’re the first to call and the first to take the bold step of descending into the pit we ’ve been digging in here .
Perhaps you are the only one with just the right amount of insanity to even tune into our frequency . ”
“ Oh , ” said Isaiah .
He then wondered if this white boy had even noticed that he had written the words “ smooth jazz ” in the corner in sarcastic ink .
He wondered if they were speaking the same language .
“ Well , you guys must have plenty of insanity to want to form this kind of supergroup .
Where ’d you get it from ? ”
Cameron pushed the glasses back up the bridge of his nose .
“ Well , I was in an electronic synth - rock band .
Not to be confused with synth - pop .
It was not for dancing in dark rooms with checkerboard floors .
Not for those people wearing oversized neckties , swinging their hairspray - contaminated sweat everywhere .
On stage , our lead singer was a vile redheaded temptress right out of a black and white detective movie and our guitarist played music that could have been the voice of The Internet Pedophile in Peter and the Wolf .
I did the synthesizers , to balance out the creepy feeling he invoked , and I also did regular maintenance on the drum machine .
We were called Land Line .
The music we made was always really cool , but I listened to a lot of other stuff .
Especially since I grew up next door to an obnoxious , causeless rebel who spent his afternoons in his garage with a bunch of others who could barely read their tablatures what with all the hair over their eyes . ”
“ Hey , fuck you , ” said Aidan .
“ Do n’t listen to Cameron .
He ’d have you believe that hardcore punk is spoiled children trying to hide their petulant rants about how unfair their parents are behind the guise of biting political commentary , and … he would be right ninety - nine percent of the time .
But Burning Chrome was the exception .
We did n’t try to compensate for our lack of melody and chord knowledge with screaming .
Our lead guitarist played solos like a man in a padded room , rolling around on stage like he was trying to get out of his straitjacket .
Our drummer could be heard for miles and sent the citizens of Tokyo running .
I played rhythm guitar and sang .
Eventually I met this kid in my music class at school , who handed me his noise - cancelling headphones like they were his recipe for homemade hydroponics .
So I put them on , and was amazed to hear lap steel guitar without a hint of conservative propaganda , or odes to Chevrolet pickup trucks . ”
“ Hell no .
Strictly Ford , ” said Zeke .
“ We were an alternative country - rock collective with way too many members , called Ethanol .
Everyone was versatile , except me .
Our vocalist played acoustic guitar , our acoustic guitarist played harmonica , our harmonica player played the keyboard , our keyboardist played the fiddle , our fiddler played bass , our bassist played lap steel , and our lap steel guitarist sang vocals .
Solve for x . ”
“ You ’re the drummer , ” said Isaiah .
“ Guilty as charged .
Get my cell at Folsom ready , ” he said .
“ What about you ?
Do n’t tell us you ’re just carrying that case around just for show . ”
“ Yeah , man , ” said Aidan .
“ What do you usually play ? ”
They were all watching him .
He knew that what they were waiting to hear was the record of his own travels , the sound of his own footsteps , taps , and stomps upon pedals , in equal trade for their own .
But it was not the time to give it to them .
Isaiah relaxed his grip on the handle of his case .
He set it down on the floor , beside theirs .
“ I was in a go - go band , ” he said .
Zeke nodded , slowly .
“ Go - go ? ” he asked .
“ Sweet . ”
“ All right , ” said Aidan .
“ Let ’s get set up and get started . ”
Aidan went to the corner of the room , opened up a leather case , and lifted out a Gibson Les Paul with an explosive red , orange , and yellow design , and the letters “ TW / OR ” written on the body in Wite - Out , which Isaiah correctly presumed to be the protest against Congressional rule of DC , standing for “ Taxation Without Representation . ”
He plugged it into a Peavey combo amplifier , twisted a few dials , started stroking , and out of it came a few yips and a long , longing howl that slowly faded as if it had dissipated into the clouds of a night sky .
“ Okay , good . ”
Cameron approached the silver Yamaha DGX520 88 - note keyboard sitting atop its stand and switched it on .
His fingers then stroked the stickers that he had slapped onto its front — the tye - dye decorated peace sign , the yellow equals sign on the blue field signifying gay equal rights , and various stickers advertising local tour dates for various indie electronica groups .
He tapped the keys , then turned to the others and pushed his glasses back up onto his face .
Zeke twirled his sleek , finished drumsticks and used them to smack the dots above the letters in the faded “ Zildjian ” that appeared on the crash cymbal .
His foot tapped on the pedal that flung the beater into the kick bass , and the other pedal that clapped the hi-hat cymbals together .
Finally , he struck the Pearl snare , tracing the lines in the worn canvas .
He stretched his neck , and gripped the sticks in both hands , his knee still bobbing up and down , his foot inches from the bass pedal .
“ We ’re just gonna jam for a little bit , first , ” Aidan said .
“ Isaiah .
Why do n’t you start us off with a nice , funky riff and we ’ll , ah … splash some cologne on it . ”
At this , he put his hand out , his forefinger and thumb forming the barrel and action of a pistol , pointed it at the ground and then shook it .
Isaiah unlocked his leather case and pulled out a dark blue four - string Fender Precision Bass .
There were no marks or stickers on it , or anything else that could have made it any less aerodynamic , or depreciated its value .
He lifted it out of its case slowly , leaving behind several sheets of paper towels that made up an extra layer of insulation .
He lifted the strap over his head and dropped it on his shoulder , and looked around at the others , all of them ready to play their instruments .
His was n’t quite as sleek as theirs .
Their instruments , he decided , had been bought for them by their parents .
His was a gift from his Uncle Jerome , who ’d bought a new one for himself to play in that smooth jazz band .
The one he joined , not the one he formed .
The smooth jazz band that sounded like it plagiarized the air - conditioned music in a department store .
Not the one with the drummer who made sparks fly from his cymbals and the horn player who could store a winter ’s supply of hazelnuts in his cheeks .
Not that band .
That band was his old band .
Now he was in a smooth jazz band .
Isaiah plugged his uncle ’s bass into a nearby Crate combo amp .
His right hand started teasing the strings of his guitar as the left twisted the knobs at the top until it moaned to his liking .
Though his eyes were fixed to the headstock as he tuned , he could feel the band still watching him , waiting .
He lowered his right hand over the pickups and quickly rolled and unrolled it into a fist to force out the fatigue of gripping the leather case , and then his fingers dripped over the strings while his left hand bit into the meaty spaces between the bone - like frets .
He pulled ,
He plucked ,
He popped .
The white boys watched as
He pulled ,
He plucked ,
He popped .
The white boys watched as
He pulled ,
He plucked ,
He popped , and when they joined in
They strummed ,
They strolled ,
They struck a couple of matches ,
They strummed ,
They strolled ,
They started a wildfire that
They sparked ,
They stoked .
They scorched .
Brought it back again .
His eyes closed as his head bobbed to the rumbling of the amp on the wood .
He opened them briefly and saw Aidan ’s closed eyes looking up at the ceiling , while his lips mouthed words he might have been considering as candidates for lyrics .
Cameron ’s shoulders see - sawed up and down while his waist slid from side to side and his head softly turned from side to side .
Zeke slammed his feet on the ground as the toms and snare were punished by the sticks that he gripped between tense , white knuckles .
Cologne is pretty flammable , Isaiah thought .
After the final flourish , Isaiah watched how they watched him again , and they all saw on each other ’s slightly reddened , heavily - breathing faces the possibilities , their rabidly blinking eyes darting around as if counting the leaves on all the branches of all the trees in Rock Creek Park .
He saw that their noses had been down the whole time .
Isaiah smirked .
He took it upon himself to voice their concerns .
“ So what do we call ourselves ? ”
They looked at one another , and then Cameron , looking down at the floor , put his hand up , requesting silence .
“ How about … ” He cleared his throat .
“ The Lobbyists ? ”
By the time their jam session had concluded , the sky had turned red , the sun behind trees , houses , and streetlamps .
Isaiah carried the leather case , the blue bass nestled back into its paper towel bed , back to the bus stop , and climbed on .
The air conditioning of the bus slowly chilled the sweat on his back that he had accumulated from carrying the case down the street .
He could not hear the bus ’s rumbling .
It was drowned out by the sizzling sounds made in the not - large studio , still cooking in his head .
Isaiah had to admit , The Lobbyists were clearly not a smooth jazz band , but a rock band .
A rough rock band .
When he got off , he dragged the case over the uncut grass on the front lawn , up the concrete stairs to the porch , through the living room with the sofa covered in plastic and prints of ( White ) Jesus on the wall with the lines from John 3:16 , and ( Black ) Jesus on the other wall with that poem about the footsteps in the sand .
He went down the wooden stairs to the basement where the 27 - inch screen and XBox were hooked up at the moment , but only because no one was practicing there anymore .
No one needed an outlet now .
No one needed an outlet now , so the XBox stayed plugged in and hooked up , but one of the controllers was still in Malik ’s keyboard bag .
No one would bring a CD with the name of some band from College Park written on it in felt tip marker for Dante to study the beat , for he had already packed his drum set up in his Oldsmobile and gone to his apartment twelve blocks away .
No one would bring a yellow flyer from Bar Nun still warm and wet with the time of their set , their name in a list that usually ended with Backyard Band or Suttle Thoughts .
No one would bring the lyrics of a Linkin Park song heard on the Top 40 station along with an old Grandmaster Flash LP so that Victor could re-mix and - mash it .
Victor would not be scratching for them anymore .
He had left his turntables there , sitting next to the TV and the Xbox .
Isaiah had stopped returning Victor ’s mother ’s calls after she had asked him if he could bring them by .
She finally sent Victor ’s half - brother Ronald over to pick them up , while Isaiah was out .
Isaiah left a key for Ronald .
He would not be there when the turntables were taken away .
He would be getting off the bus in front of the not - large studio being rented by whichever of them had put that ad in the CityPaper , whoever it was that he had called and given his name to in return for an audition .
He had gone to that audition and played with them , on the bass given to him by his Uncle Jerome .
They had been Isaiah , Malik , Dante , Victor .
They rented almost everything they had , though they felt like it was their own .
The only things they bought were a few cords .
The microphones and the PAs and the amps had belonged to the clubs , and the cars that had taken them to their gigs had belonged to their parents , who took turns attending each show for their safety .
They were a band that went by many names , partly because they could never agree on the ones that they tried to give themselves .
At every show there was always something singular about how they played , some florid metaphor that someone used to describe them , and pointed out to them , so they would just shrug their shoulders and go with it , until the next show , until someone gave them their new name , or a name they had been given , translated into the dialect of Shaw , or Anacostia , or Brightwood , or whatever neighborhood their travels had taken them to .
And yet , wherever they went , the people knew who they were .
They played music that could have an R&B singer , a rapper , or a dancehall deejay toasting over it , accompanied by a keyboard or an organ , a saxophone or a lead guitar , though it required a drum kit as well as congas .
They played music that demanded that its listeners put down their drinks and stand up .
They played go - go .
Isaiah could have said this when they had asked him , but he had kept it back to honor Isaiah , Malik , Dante , Victor , to keep their names unsoiled .
It was not until he saw the guys pick up their instruments that he knew he had to take the audition seriously .
And he ’d played perfectly .
Now he realized that achieving that level turned everything he had ever done before into a kind of failure .
And now he felt a heavy debt upon his head .
A debt that he , Isaiah , the artist , owed to The Lobbyists , for disparaging their name before he had even heard it , and for refusing to give them Isaiah , Malik , Dante , Victor ’s names .
And then there was the debt that he , Isaiah , son of Samuel , owed to Isaiah , Malik , Dante , Victor for waiting until he was in the presence of the dearly purchased guitar , keyboard , and drum kit before making his dear uncle ’s cheap bass guitar truly priceless .
Isaiah laid his guitar case against the wall and climbed back up the stairs to the kitchen .
He looked inside the refrigerator and pulled out a gallon of milk , raised it to his lips , and as he stepped towards the door to the dining room , stopped , turned around , and slowly tiptoed towards the cupboard to get a glass .
“ Wrong cupboard , boy , ” his father said , from the dining room .
“ Those are the good glasses . ”
“ Hey , Dad , ” said Isaiah , reaching for the other cupboard .
“ How was work ? ”
“ Productive , ” he said .
“ What did you do all day ? ”
Isaiah walked into the dining room .
His father was still wearing his suit from work , his necktie loosened , and a lanyard still around his neck with an ID card that read , “ Samuel Williams – D.C. Department of Health and Human Services . ”
His jacket lay on the back of his chair , and his wingtips lay on top of the scattered pages of the Washington Times on the floor .
He was reading the Sports section of the , the pages laying neatly on the tablecloth , his elbows on top of them .
Beside his newspaper was the television remote , a glass of melting ice and an empty bottle of Miller Genuine Draft .
Washington Post
“ I had an audition for a new band , ” he said , as he sat down .
“ A new band ?
Is it a blues band ? ”
“ No . ”
“ A jazz band ? ”
“ No . ”
“ A marching band ? ”
“ No . ”
“ Not another go - go band ? ”
His face screwed up into an affected visage of disgust , then fell out of character , back to reading his paper .
“ No , ” said Isaiah , grinning .
“ An indie rock band . ”
“ An indie rock band ? ”
He looked at his son through the upper half of his bifocals .
“ What you want to be in a rock band for , boy ?
What ’s them songs they always singing ?
You want to be on American Idol or some shit ? ”
Isaiah put his head in his hands .
“ No , Dad .
That ’s not what you do on American Idol . ”
“ Do n’t go on Showtime at the Apollo , now , boy .
They ’ll boo you offstage , and then you ’ll have to call me and I ’ll have to come pick you up .
And I ’ll embarrass you .
I ’ll see to it . ”
“ We ’re not going on Showtime at the Apollo , Dad . ”
“ So you got in the band ? ” asked his father .
“ They let your black ass in their band . ”
“ Yes , Dad .
They did . ”
His father sighed and turned the page of the newspaper .
Michael Wilbon had written a column about the Redskins .
“ Okay , son , ” he said .
“ I ’m through with you . ”
Isaiah walked out of the dining room and climbed the stairs to his room .
He could hear his father pick up the remote and turn on the TV .
The opening fanfare of Newshour was playing .
2 …
Four days later , Isaiah went to the first practice session .
For most of the afternoon , The Lobbyists ’ instruments stayed dry in their cases , while Isaiah , Aidan , Cameron , Zeke sat in a circle on the floor , discussing what direction the band should go .
They all agreed that they wanted to make music that none of them had ever made before .
Cameron had brought his laptop and a microphone so that they could record what they played .
Aidan had brought a spiral notebook full of incomplete , scratched out lyrics and doodles of prospective band logos .
They listened to Aidan sing the lyrics he had written to the tunes of their favorite songs , then deconstructed the melodies , hacked them down to their core riffs and beats , and then imagined how their favorite bands would cover them .
Then they picked up their instruments and played them .
They revised the lyrics to fit the rhythms , and vice - versa .
At the end of the day , with three hit B - sides for seven different bands , they shook their fists at the gods for cursing them with such eclectic tastes and poor long division skills .
Then they looked at their watches and cell phones and realized it was not yet 2:00 pm .
“ All right , fuck it , ” said Aidan .
“ I ’m hungry .
Is anyone else hungry ? ”
“ Yeah , ” said Zeke .
“ Let ’s go to Chipotle . ”
They loaded their instruments and amps into Aidan ’s van and piled in .
Cameron sat up front with Aidan , while Zeke and Isaiah sat on the floor with the instruments .
They began to drive down the street , past Woodrow Wilson High School , the District of Columbia Public School that everyone in the car except for Cameron , attended .
“ What school are you at , Cameron ? ” asked Isaiah .
“ Georgetown Day School my whole life , ” said Cameron .
“ Started in Pre-kindergarten right up to the eighth grade , then came over to the high school campus not far from here .
I was with the same incestuous enclave of uniformed pedants year after year , sitting in the same classrooms with computers on every desk so that we did not have to risk jeopardizing our chances at Harvard by looking at each other — even though we were all mirror images of one another anyway . ”
“ What about you guys ? ” asked Isaiah .
“ I went to Janney , then Deal , ” said Aidan .
“ Pretty standard around these parts .
Almost everyone who goes to Wilson started out at Janney , indoctrinated by the same bunch of soulless disciplinarians , then pushed along the assembly line until it is time for college and we split up across the country and lose touch with each other .
So if you see us self - segregating in our bullshit little cliques , all of us sitting outside on the stands at the football field smoking our smuggled - in cigarettes , it is not because we do not associate with minorities .
It ’s because our parents have done such a good job of subtly hinting that it ’s not in our best interests . ”
“ My mom pretty much home - schooled me until ninth grade , then I came to Wilson , ” said Zeke .
“ My lunches consisted of vegetables grown entirely in our backyard with the occasional tofurkey sandwich .
Once my neighbors got home from school , though , I got to go over and play video games and marvel at other technological advances such as the incandescent light .
Of course , my mother would always Scotchgard me with her teachings before I would go over , explaining that I should not activate any electronic devices myself unless there was someone available to make certain my soul was not pulled away from the loving embrace of mother nature for too long . ”
“ Where did you go to school before Wilson , Isaiah ? ” asked Cameron .
“ I started out at Rudolph Elementary until sixth grade , then I went to Paul Public Charter School , ” he said .
“ We always managed to violate the separation of church and state by singing old Negro spirituals in music class , apparently a method of breaking our spirits by removing our sense of agency and making us think only God could decide our fates , so that we would not organize an escape during recess .
Black History Month tended to last from Kwanzaa to St. Patrick ’s Day , starting with a packet of Kwanzaa assignments to do during Holiday break , then thirty days of Martin Luther King speeches , then , the big three - thousand word report on important , non-Republican figures in black history , ending with the scenes from Gone With The Wind with Hattie McDaniel in them . ”
“ Yeah , ” said Aidan .
“ Social control , man .
Everyone wants your head on their mantel . ”
Isaiah could hear the offhandedness in his voice , affected to sound young enough to rebel against all of adult society , but old enough to be nonplussed by it .
The insistence that their experiences were just different branches of the same tree .
He watched as Aidan reached into the ashtray and picked up the iPod he had left lying there , connected to the car stereo .
He clicked on Minor Threat .
When Isaiah heard the song , he decided to have a bit of fun with them .
“ Is this the one with ‘ Guilty of Being White ’ on it ? ” asked Isaiah .
He remembered the lyrics .
I ’m sorry for something I did n’t do …
“ Yeah , yeah it is , ” said Aidan .
He turned down the volume .
“ Wait … So you know Minor Threat ? ”
Lynched somebody , but I do n’t know who …
“ I ’ve heard some of their stuff , ” said Isaiah .
He had their complete discography on his computer .
“ So what do you think of ‘ Guilty ’ ? ” asked Aidan .
You blame me for slavery a hundred years before I was born … Guilty of being white …
“ It ’s an okay song , ” said Isaiah .
He showed the rear view mirror a daring grin .
“ Yeah , personally , I think Ian MacKaye was a lot better in Fugazi , ” said Aidan .
I ’m a convict of a racist crime …
“ Oh yeah , ” said Isaiah .
“ It does n’t get any better than Repeater . ”
“ Definitely , ” said Aidan .
I ’ve only done 19 years of my time … Guilty of being white …
Once Aidan had safely shifted the conversation from Ian MacKaye ’s younger , angrier band to his older , wiser one , Isaiah knew that he could not reveal to the rest of The Lobbyists the story of his band , because he could not be certain that they would understand the risk involved in the telling — that they would listen to his words but hear only what they expected was the truth .
He could not be certain whether anything he said would make them see any clearer what he was describing , or if his words would simply refine the ideas that their parents had passed down to them , that their Eurocentric textbooks ( even as they themselves described them ) had preached to them , with which their televisions had bombarded them .
He knew that he had been wrong about them after leaving the studio the day before , but he did not yet know whether they were wrong about him , or whether they would be less wrong about him after the words left his mouth and became a part of their minds and became theirs to interpret .
And he knew that first he would have to receive the blessing of his old band .
To inform them , and take whatever condemnation they would lay upon him , perform whatever acts of contrition they demanded of him .
Only then could he walk into the house of his new brothers and still be accepted in the house of the old .
When they reached their preferred fast - food chain , they climbed out of the van and went in to order their burritos , then sat down to eat them .
“ You ever heard of Bad Brains ? ” asked Aidan .
“ No , ” said Isaiah .
“ Who are they ? ”
“ They ’re considered the first ever hardcore band .
They formed here in DC in the late seventies , ” said Aidan .
“ They basically invented hardcore , but switched back and forth between that and reggae between tracks on their albums .
People disputed whether they qualified more as one or the other , as if one part was some kind of mask and the other was their real flesh .
I may not have been alive back before they were banned from performing here in DC , but I do n’t think that one of them was a mask .
It was more like they had two souls inside them .
But they were n’t split personalities jockeying for total control of one body , they were more like unmarried parents , not divorced , with joint custody of the children .
And they would come to each other ’s houses to pick the kids up every week .
I do n’t even know if such an arrangement is legal , but perhaps that is part of the reason why the powers that be decided to ban them from this city . ”
Isaiah nodded .
“ Yeah .
Maybe . ”
Aidan did n’t have to say it , but the image of four bearded black men , dreadlocks pouring from their heads was vivid in his mind .
Maybe Aidan had n’t mentioned it because he thought it better to sound color - blind .
Or maybe there was just something more solid , more heartfelt , more clench - fisted about Aidan ’s somewhat clumsy way of saying “ You might be interested in this band whose members happen to be black ” without sounding like he was saying “ Hey , black guy , here ’s some black history for you to get your black on with , ” that he had heard so often from his friends ( “ acquaintances ” ) at school .
The shame he felt at not knowing of them faded when he realized his father probably did n’t know of them either .
Thanks , man , Isaiah thought .
They ate their burritos and talked of other DC bands that they had made themselves deaf with .
Isaiah left satisfied with what they had accomplished in their first practice session .
When he returned home , his father had already started stirring the marinara , and Isaiah picked up the cheese grater .
He answered his father ’s questions about the band , describing the convergence of styles that they were inching towards .
His father nodded and grunted , understanding his son ’s words .
They sat down and ate lasagna , and afterwards , washed the dishes .
His father went upstairs to his room to play computer solitaire while watching CNN , while Isaiah went downstairs to the basement to practice playing the bass .
He played the choppy , bouncing bass lines that they had practiced , his mind trying to recreate them , forcing his fingers to follow along .
Then , without warning , his fingers went off the tracks and began to play the swerving rhythms of what his old band had played .
When he realized this , his hands completely derailed .
He did n’t know how long he spent in the basement , sitting on the floor , staring at the silent guitar in his idle hands , but seeing his old band on stage .

Kentucky lawmaker Tim Couch has proposed a bill that would criminalize anonymous Internet posting .
Web site and forum operators would be forced to collect and publicly disclose identifying information about all of the visitors who post content on their sites .
Failing to do so would lead to a fine of $ 500 for the first offense and $ 1,000 for each subsequent offense .
The bill , which extends Chapter 369 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes , would mandate collection of the complete name , mailing address , and e-mail address of all visitors who post Internet content .
Web sites would have to display names next to all relevant content and establish procedures that enable anyone to obtain the rest of the information .
The bill stipulates that mailing address and e-mail address only have to be supplied to supplicants in cases where someone has posted " false or defamatory " information .
Case law has unambiguously established that state regulation of the Internet constitutes a violation of the Commerce Clause .
Couch 's proposal also likely falls afoul of the Constitutionally - guaranteed right to freedom of speech .
If passed , Couch 's proposal would be doomed to a swift demise in the courts .
In addition to serious legal obstacles , Couch 's bill would also face insurmountable implementation challenges .
Web site operators have no means with which to validate the identification information they receive from users or guarantee its accuracy .
If it were even legally permissible , a state - wide ban on anonymous posting would have little impact because it would not be enforceable against web sites outside of the state of Kentucky .
Indeed , such a law would likely compel site operators to move their web sites out of Kentucky .
Finally , the proposal itself is ideologically antithetical to American culture and values .
Anonymous publication is a time - honored tradition that has figured prominently in America 's literary and political landscape .
Early American political philosophy was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine 's anonymous pamphlet Common Sense , and by Cato's Letters , which were anonymously published by British writers John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon .
Some of America 's greatest literary works have also been published under pseudonyms — for instance the works of Mark Twain , who we know today as Samuel Clemens .
Couch — who says that he has been the victim of anonymous Internet criticism himself — acknowledges that the bill is probably unconstitutional and claims that his goal is to draw attention to Internet bullying , which he says is a serious concern for many young people in his district .
He does not intend to rally support for the proposal .
" I think right now ( online posting ) is pretty much just on its own .
It 's a machine that 's going to go its own way , " Couch told the Lexington Herald - Leader .
" The state can try to pass some rules , but I do n't really think it would do anything . "
Proposing an inane , unconstitutional , and unenforceable law seems like a poor way to raise awareness of an issue .
It looks like Couch needs some remedial education in civics and constitutional law , and I 'm sure plenty of anonymous critics on the Internet will have similar opinions to share .

A dozen years after California voters ushered in the age of legal medical marijuana by supporting Proposition 215 , the legal use of the herb for medicinal purposes has spread to 11 other states -- Alaska , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington -- but in recent years , progress has been excruciatingly slow .
2005 Coalition for Medical Marijuana - NJ press conference
The last statewide initiative to go to voters failed in 2006 in South Dakota -- the only state where voters have rejected an initiative legalizing medical marijuana -- and last year , it took Herculean efforts by New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson ( D ) to revive and rescue the medical marijuana bill there , making the Land of Enchantment the only state to be added to the list of medical marijuana states in 2007 .
( Rhode Island legislators , who had passed a sunsetted bill in 2006 , made it permanent last year . )
This year , serious efforts to pass medical marijuana laws at the state house are underway in several more states , with most of the efforts being run by local groups backed by either the Marijuana Policy Project ( MPP ) or the Drug Policy Alliance ( DPA ) .
Here 's a look at the states where there has been or will be action at the state house on medical marijuana :
Alabama : A medical marijuana bill was introduced last week by Rep. Laura Hall ( D ) , but has yet to be assigned a bill number .
This will mark the second year in a row that Alabama legislators have had a medical marijuana bill before them .
There will be hearings this year , said Loretta Nall , executive director of Alabamians for Compassionate Care , the local group coordinating the effort to pass the bill .
One of those who will testify is Jacki Phillips , whose son , Michael Phillips , had testified in support of medical marijuana in the past .
Michael Phillips , who throughout his life suffered from seizures related to brain tumors , died last December in a New Orleans hotel room during the DPA conference .
" I 'm going to tell those lawmakers that the system killed my son , " said Phillips .
" I truly believe that if he could have gotten the marijuana and it had been regulated like other seizure medicines , he would be alive today .
I 'm not asking them to legalize it for potheads , " she said , " I 'm a Southern Baptist and I believe God gave you a brain to use , but using marijuana for medical purposes would help a lot of people . "
Marijuana did n't stop Michael Phillips ' seizures , his mother said , " but it gave him the chance to function on a normal level for a period of time . "
When he smoked marijuana , she said , he would still have seizures , but their frequency and intensity was greatly reduced .
Connecticut : After seeing a medical marijuana bill pass the legislature there last year only to be vetoed by Gov. Jodi Rell ( R ) , activists there have found little traction on the issue this year as the legislature debates other criminal justice and drug policy issues .
" We were emboldened last year and then deeply disappointed that people still essentially have to commit a crime to get access to medicine , " DPA policy director Gabriel Sayegh told the Hartford Business Journal earlier this month .
But despite little progress this year , " there is no doubt we are going to continue with this , " he vowed .
Illinois : A medical marijuana bill , SB 2865 , has passed committee votes and is now headed to the Senate floor , but its
House companion bill , HB 5938 , lost a committee vote this week .
Still , that does n't mean the measure is dead .
" Unlike many states , losing a committee vote does n't kill your bill , " said MPP 's Mirken , who spent part of this week at the state capitol in Springfield accompanying patients as they lobbied legislators .
MPP and local reform groups IDEAL ( Illinois Drug Education and Legislative Reform ) and Illinois Compassion Action Network are keeping the pressure on .
This week , MPP released a poll showing 68 % support for medical marijuana in the state .
Kansas :
The first effort at passing a medical marijuana bill in Kansas , supported by the Kansas Compassionate Care Coalition and former Republican Attorney General Robert Stephan , ended a couple of weeks ago , bottled up in committee by a hostile committee chair .
While disappointing , that is hardly surprising , given the torturous legislative process facing any new bill .
Kansans should not be disheartened that they did not achieve victory in their first try , said MPP 's Mirken .
" It has been a multi - year struggle in all the states that have passed these laws , " he said .
" It 's no surprise that it will take more than one year in Kansas . "
Minnesota : Last year , a medical marijuana bill passed the state Senate , but died of inaction in the House in the face of veto threats from Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty .
But MPP and local affiliate Minnesotans for Compassionate Care are again working with friendly legislators .
A Republican House member , Rep. Chris DeLaForest , is cosponsoring a House bill this year .
Minnesota's is a two - year legislative session , so that means only a House bill must pass this year , provided it is congruent with the already passed Senate bill .
" We are sitting in the House waiting for it to be brought up , " said Mirken .
" We 're hoping it will pass and the governor will see the light . "
New Jersey :
For the fourth consecutive year , a medical marijuana bill , AB 804 has been introduced by Assemblyman Reed Gusciora ( D - Mercer ) and a companion bill has been introduced in the state Senate .
DPA 's New Jersey office is working the legislature , but there seems little likelihood the Senate will act .
" The Senate has always been the hold - up , " said Ken Wolski , RN , executive officer of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana - New Jersey .
" Although Gov. Corzine has said he would sign a bill if it gets to his desk , the Assembly does n't really want to mess with it if the Senate wo n't move on it , so here we are . "
New York : A medical marijuana bill , SO4768 , initially introduced last year was reintroduced in January .
It passed the Assembly last year , but was referred at that time to the Senate Health Committee where it has languished ever since .
Given the turmoil in Albany in the wake of this week 's resignation of Democratic Gov. Eliot Spitzer , said MPP 's Mirken , it will take awhile for the dust to settle .
" We 're trying to figure out how the Spitzer follies will change the situation , " he said .
" While we have some hopes for New York , at this point , medical marijuana is not on the top of anybody 's agenda . "
One optimistic sign , said Mirken , was that the new governor , David Paterson , is on much better terms with Republican Senate majority leader Joseph Bruno .
Another is that , like Minnesota , New York has a two - year session , so a bill will not have to again pass the Assembly .
The medical marijuana movement has mowed its way through most of the low - hanging fruit of the initiative states and now faces the long , hard slog through the legislative process if it wants to get more states on board .
While it is less expensive to attempt to win in the legislature than at the ballot box , it is also much more difficult and complicated .
" A lot of politicians are needlessly skittish about the politics of this , " said Mirken .
" If it were just a vote on the merits , it would pass today .
Everywhere , we can produce polling numbers to show these guys a medical marijuana vote is not going to hurt them , but there is a deeply ingrained fear of being portrayed as soft on drugs , and that 's very difficult to overcome .
It 's a real struggle , " he said .
When pressed on where victories might come this year , Mirken was careful .
" I 'd say there was a fighting chance in Illinois , Minnesota , and New York , but in an election year , politicians are more timid than usual , " he offered .
The real best shot this year , he said , is likely Michigan , where an initiative has been approved for the November ballot .
Fox host ' for Tasing anyone in Code Pink ' after Hillary heckled

A Fox News morning host has a novel idea to handle those pesky Code Pink protesters who disrupt political events and Congressional hearings : 50,000 volts of electricity .
Brian Kilmead shared his ever - so - evolved views on crowd control Monday morning in a Fox & Friends discussion of a Code Pink - disrupted Hillary Clinton speech .
His answer to annoying anti-war types ?
Tasers or Billy clubs .
 They should Tase this guy ,  Kilmead says .
 At one point with security so high and tensions on edge , dont you think they re going to get at the very least Tased or beaten to a pulp by somebody ?
These people look threatening .
Kilmead 's Taser - lust came one day after a 20 - year - old Maryland man died after being shocked by police .
The other hosts argue for some restraint when dealing with feisty , pink - clad protesters .
 Why should they tase him ?
Hes not resisting arrest ,  co-host Steve Doocy says , injecting some much - needed rationality into the conversation .
The protest - of - the moment , came during a recent Clinton speech in Los Angeles on global warming .
 Were you invited to speak here this afternoon ? 
Clinton scolds the protester as he is removed by security .
The Fox hosts used the disruption to remind viewers of Code Pinks habit of disrupting Capitol Hill hearings , and they re-played the famous dont Tase me bro sound - bite from a University of Florida student earlier this year .
The students screams seemed to delight the hosts , and Kilmead clearly wanted to hear more of them .
 I would be for Tasing anyone in Code Pink ,  he says .
 Im pro-Pink Tasing .
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on November 19 , 2007 .
The Rocky Mountain West , which helped give Democrats the White House and control of the U.S. Senate , has emerged as a key 2012 battleground as President Obama works to win back independents and others disaffected by the last two years of high unemployment , soaring deficits and expansive government growth .
Obama achieved a breakthrough in 2008 , carrying Nevada , Colorado and New Mexico and coming close to winning Montana , a state Democrats lost overwhelmingly in the two previous presidential campaigns .
Since then , he has worked to solidify his support , appointing Westerners to important positions such as Interior secretary , and avoiding issues such as gun control and mining reform that had hurt previous Democrats .
Even so , Obama ’s approval ratings have fallen across the region .
That has not only complicated the president ’s reelection effort , but threatens fellow Democrats like Montana Sen .
Jon Tester , who will likely share the ballot in 2012 and face one of the toughest reelection fights in the country .
It was Tester ’s narrow 2006 victory that helped Democrats seize control of the Senate .

His Republican opponent , Rep. Denny Rehberg , is now more likely to utter Obama ’s name — and not in a good way — than the Democratic senator , which suggests how much the ground has shifted since the last presidential race .
Asked whether he would stand alongside Obama if he campaigned in Montana , as he did in 2008 , Tester suggested not .
“ I ’ll stand with [ Brian ] Schweitzer .
I ’ll stand with Max [ Baucus ] , ” Tester said of the state ’s Democratic governor and senior U.S. senator .
He had just finished a day of events that included visits to two union halls , a radio call - in show , a business round table at the Chamber of Commerce and a speech to a joint session of the Legislature .
“ I ’ll stand with people that I addressed today , on either side of the aisle , if they want to stand with me , ” Tester said .
“ That ’s who I look to . ”
For years , the Rocky Mountain West was Republican territory .
But over the last decade , it has become perhaps the most politically competitive region in the country .

All of the states the president won will likely be in play again next year , even as Democrats hope to expand the competition to Arizona , which Obama ceded to home - state Sen. John McCain in 2008 .
There could also be hard - fought U.S. Senate races in Nevada , New Mexico and Arizona as well as Montana .
Voters in the interior West have a deep and abiding hostility toward Washington ( although they welcome the abundant federal dollars that flow their way ) .
They directed that animosity toward Republicans in 2006 and 2008 after turning on President George W. Bush , in large part because of the war in Iraq .
“ It ’s not like the West suddenly became Democratic , ” said Floyd Ciruli , a political pollster in Denver .
“ They were willing to give Obama a chance . ”
But , he said , “ Once Obama looked like he was part of a liberal Washington establishment , advocating lots of programs and lots of spending , he immediately lost Republicans and he mostly lost unaffiliated voters . ”

The president ’s moves since the midterm election — compromising with Republicans on tax cuts , promising to roll back regulations , focusing more on deficit reduction — have probably boosted his standing with the centrist voters he needs to win back , Ciruli and other analysts said .
Tester , like many Western Democrats , has a strategy that is both simpler and more complex : distancing himself — physically and culturally — as much as possible from Washington .
He is certainly no one ’s idea of a slick politician .
His suits look slept - in .
His belly tumbles over his belt .
His flat - top buzz cut was fashionable — if ever — back in the 1950s .
But Tester ’s unvarnished appearance reflects Montana ’s political culture ; the worst thing a politician can do here is take on airs , which explains why no one blinked when the senator whipped off his red paisley tie in front of business leaders at the Chamber of Commerce and stuffed it in his jacket pocket ( he was through with the day ’s TV appearances ) .

“ We still believe we ’re small enough and neighborly enough we want to see and touch and feel our representatives , ” said David Parker , who teaches politics at Montana State University .
“ If they ’re perceived as strangers , they get in trouble . ”
That is why Tester and Rehberg , a six - term incumbent and the only Republican in statewide office , both emphasize their accessibility .
The senator returned home all but four weekends last year , making an eight - to 10 - hour journey from Washington to his farm in Big Sandy .
Rehberg held 75 “ listening sessions ” with voters , at least one in each of the state ’s 56 counties .
That also explains why each side claims the other candidate is different from what he seems — and more like an outsider .
“ He ’s got a conservative haircut , ” Erik Iverson , a Rehberg strategist , said of Tester .
“ But he ’s a liberal . ”
Announcing his candidacy , Rehberg called Tester a “ yes man for Barack Obama , ” saying he sides with the administration on 97 % of votes .
He singled out Tester ’s support for the healthcare bill and 2009 economic stimulus , both of which Rehberg opposed .
“ It ’s contrary to what Montanans want , ” said Rehberg , who helped lead House efforts to cut off funding for the healthcare bill .

Tester defends both .
The healthcare legislation was a start toward repairing an out - of - control system , he told radio listeners , and contains “ a lot of good stuff . ”
Any problems , he said , can be fixed .
The stimulus bill , he told state lawmakers , “ pulled our nation away from the ledge of a catastrophic depression … .
The only thing failed about it … was a vote against it . ”
While supporting Obama on perhaps the two most important initiatives of his administration , Tester diverges from many in his party with his staunch support of gun rights and uncompromising stance on illegal immigration , an independence that plays well at home , if not on the far left .
“ I represent Montana , ” he said , dismissing critics .
If “ liberal ” is an epithet in Montana and much of the West , so too is “ extreme . ”
Independents nearly equal Democrats and Republicans in much of the region , and they tend to shun ideologues .
That is one reason for November ’s Senate results in Nevada and Colorado , where Democrats defeated “ tea party ” loyalists Sharron Angle and Ken Buck .
Advertisement
In Montana , Democrats already have seized on two of Rehberg ’s recent statements to portray him as being outside the mainstream .
They cited his jocular salute — “ President Bachmann , where are you ? ” — when Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , a tea party favorite , appeared at a GOP dinner in Helena .
And they jumped on his suggestion that a federal judge belongs on the endangered species list for upholding Washington management of the state ’s gray wolf population ; they said the comment was especially insensitive after the killing of a judge in the Tucson shootings .
The Rehberg camp brushed aside the criticism .
But strategists said there was a danger for any candidate — whether seeking the White House or running for the Senate — who strays too far from the center .
Westerners “ do n’t want anyone to the extreme left .
They do n’t want anyone too far right , ” said Katy Atkinson , a GOP strategist in Denver .
“ They want someone whose first loyalty is to principle , as opposed to party . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
At the Quail Lakes Baptist Church in Stockton , California , the parishioners at weekly prayer group meetings seek spiritual support for everything from health issues to marital problems to job losses .
A foreclosure sign is seen in Antioch , California , Nov. 27 , 2007 .
Many houses of worship around the United States are seeing the impact of the deepening crisis , particularly in urban areas hard hit by homeowner defaults .
Clergy are speaking out on the topic at religious services and trying to coordinate assistance for their members and the community at large .

These days , many people also are praying about their mortgages .
“ There are many people in this community who are losing their homes or in danger of losing their homes , and there are some who have just seen their mortgage payments go through the roof , ” said the Rev. Marc Maffucci , the church ’s pastor .
Stockton , a city about 80 miles east of San Francisco that was founded as a gateway for gold miners in the mid-1800s , has one of the highest foreclosure rates of any large U.S. metropolitan area as its once - hot housing market has gone cold .
Maffucci said his congregants have sought help through group prayer as well as his private counsel on how to cope .
Many houses of worship around the United States are seeing the impact of the deepening crisis , particularly in urban areas hard hit by homeowner defaults .
Clergy are speaking out on the topic at religious services and trying to coordinate assistance for their members and the community at large .
While the financial fallout of the mortgage meltdown has been well documented , the moral dimensions have not been widely discussed , religion experts say .
They say they are particularly troubled on a moral level by the explosion of subprime mortgages , which allowed lower - income people with weak credit to buy homes based on attractive teaser interest rates that now are resetting to levels they cannot afford .
Subprime lending is not unethical under Judeo - Christian tradition -- and it can serve a good societal purpose by allowing those who have been down on their luck to get access to capital , said David Miller , executive director of the Center for Faith and Culture at Yale Divinity School .
He and others , though , said that subprime lenders have a duty to charge fair interest and that they also have a moral responsibility not to extend credit to those they know cannot pay it back .
“ One of the interesting questions that should be asked of subprime mortgage lenders , is , ‘ would you take this loan out on your own home ? ” said Gary Moore , a financial adviser in Sarasota , Florida , who writes about religion and investing .
“ That ’s the Golden Rule .
But I bet there ’s not 1 in 100 that did .
If more of them just thought about that for a minute , it would have prevented a lot of this . ”
At the same time , religion experts say that many homebuyers may have acted immorally by living beyond their means and that borrowers are required to try to make good on their debts .
They cite a verse in the Book of Psalms that says : “ The wicked borrows and does not pay back . ”
The housing crisis has deeply troubled the Rev. Michael Surufka , of the Catholic Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus in Cleveland , Ohio ’s Slavic Village neighborhood , another area hurt by high foreclosures .
He said the neighborhood drew numerous property “ flippers ” in recent years who bought dirt - cheap homes , made cosmetic improvements , then inflated prices well above market value based on rigged appraisals .
Homes then were sold to unwitting buyers who could not afford the mortgages .
“ If Dante were to rewrite ‘ The Inferno , ’ I think there would be another ring in his hell for unscrupulous property flippers , ” said Surufka , who has discussed the housing crisis frequently in his weekend homilies .
“ It is not only a social and economic crisis , it ’s evil , ” he said .
“ Not to sound too pedantic about it , but people elsewhere in the country are making huge amounts of money by destroying neighborhoods like ours . ”
IMMORALITY OF EXCESS
On Chicago ’s South Side , the Rev. Reginald Williams Jr. at the Trinity United Church of Christ says he has been dismayed by what he sees as the immorality of the housing market ’s excesses .
The church , a primarily black congregation , has a long - standing housing ministry that provides education and advocacy for people at risk of foreclosure ,
Lenders who preyed on low - income minorities for high - interest mortgages came up with “ a slick way to make money and to really enslave people , ” said Williams , an associate pastor .
“ The immorality is further magnified when it ’s particularly geared at a certain race . ”
Lessons about debt and financial struggles are found throughout the Bible .
There is a biblical prohibition on charging interest on loans -- the making money by lending money -- although today most Jews and Christians view the charging of some interest as acceptable .
In Christianity , Martin Luther in the 1500s and other Protestant reformers played a big role in liberalizing views on the charging of interest .
In Islamic finance , there is an official prohibition on interest - based borrowing and lending .
That has helped investment funds that adhere to Islamic principles to largely avoid the subprime meltdown because they do not hold traditional banking stocks .
The subprime crisis is likely interpreted differently across the spectrum of Muslim thought , said John Voll , a professor of Islamic history at Georgetown University .
He said some conservative Muslims might argue that the mess shows that an “ interest - based system is not only immoral but does n’t work . ”
He said though that more liberal Muslim thinkers might say that the situation shows that interest - based lending can lead to abuses , but is not necessarily immoral .
In the Bible , there is also mention of loan forgiveness , something particularly timely as the government has brokered a plan with mortgage lenders to give relief to struggling homeowners who took out adjustable rate subprime loans that are set to go up sharply .
In biblical times “ every seventh year , you were supposed to forgive any money that has n’t been repaid to you , ” said Moore , the financial adviser , referring to a passage in Deuteronomy .
There is also a biblical concept of the Jubilee year , in which every 50 years all property should be returned to its original owners .
The idea , he said , is to give those who have struggled a fresh start and not be bound forever by their debts .
Back at Quail Lakes church in Stockton , Maffucci said that the housing crisis continues to reverberate .
Some in his community are in danger of default , and others who worked in the housing industry and now are jobless .
He said that at almost every Wednesday morning prayer session he attends there are requests for prayers for someone struggling with issues such as how to scrape together a loan payment .
He has provided counsel to some of his better - off congregants who got overextended in real estate and now are working to pare back their lifestyles .
For others who have gotten behind on their mortgage bills , though , there is little that can be done .
“ I think they understand their options are somewhat limited .
They are going to make the payments or they are not , ” he said .
“ They are really praying for wisdom at that point . ”
Ian Hickson , the Google employee tasked with creating the next generation of acid test , has completed his work , which is now available for public consumption at its new home , acidtests.org .
Unlike the first acid test , which focused on the box model , and the second acid test , which covered a broad variety of basic HTML and CSS features , Acid3 covers 100 of the nooks and crannies of HTTP , HTML , CSS , ECMAScript , SVG and XML , all through the medium of DOM scripting , a critical requirement for any modern web application .
Ian Hickson is also the primary author of the HTML5 specification , which started life as a spec. called ‘ Web Apps 1.0 ’ , and as such has lots of application ‐related features such as client‐side storage and enhanced forms .
Ian wrote 64 of the tests , with the remaining 36 being submitted by both browser vendors and interested web developers .
Work started on the new acid test almost as soon as the IE developer team posted notification that IE8 passes Acid2 .
As was widely criticised around the ’net recently , it was revealed Internet Explorer 8 would now only pass the test if the server was modified to output a special HTTP header .
It is not known to css3.info at this time whether the header would be required for IE8 to achieve compliance in the new test .
Aug. 14 , 2007  --
A week after being assailed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for being soft on illegal immigration as mayor of New York , Rudy Giuliani today unveiled the details of his plan to solve the United States ' immigration problem .
His campaign is aggressively pushing back on Romney 's attack to paint their GOP rival as a hypocrite on this issue .
" We can end illegal immigration , " Giuliani vowed to an audience of roughly 300 at a community center in Aiken , S.C. , Tuesday morning .
" I promise you , we can end illegal immigration . "
Listed as one of his " 12 commitments " to the American people , Giuliani promised to secure the borders and identify every noncitizen in the United States , noting the more than 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States .
" That 's a lot of people to walk over your border without being identified , " he said .
The two - term mayor proposed requiring the deportation of any illegal immigrant who commits a felony , building both a physical and a high - tech border fence , deploying a larger and better - trained border patrol , implementing a tamperproof identity card for all foreign workers and students with a single national database of noncitizens to track their status .
The core of Giuliani 's policy will rely on the implementation of a system he calls BorderStat .
The system would be modeled after New York City 's CompStat program , which Giuliani 's administration used to reduce crime by measuring which tactics are working effectively and which are not .
Illegal immigration is a hot - button issue among rank - and - file Republican voters , whose opposition to the bill supported by President Bush and Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , contributed to its ignominious defeat in the U.S. Senate and McCain 's current struggles on the campaign trail .
When Candidates Attack
The unveiling of Giuliani 's immigration policy comes just days after Romney said New York was " at the top of the list " of " sanctuary cities " in the Unites States and accused Giuliani of obstructing the nation 's immigration laws while mayor .
A " sanctuary city " is a term of art for a municipality where city officials have decided not to deny city services such as hospitals or public schools to illegal immigrants , and absent other law enforcement concerns to not devote police resources to implementing federal immigration laws .
Some cities officially declare themselves officially to be sanctuary cities , others – such as New York -- implement policies that afford them that designation .
During a Bettendorf , Iowa , campaign stop , Romney said that Giuliani " said this was going to be a city with protection , it would provide protection for illegals …
He instructed city workers not to provide information to the federal government that would allow them to enforce the law .
New York City was the poster child for sanctuary cities in the country and I think that 's the wrong way to go . "
" Frankly , that designation would not apply to New York City , " responded Giuliani .
" What you got to look at in fairness to is the overall results – and no city in terms of crime , safety , dealing with illegality of all different kinds has done a better job than New York City . "
In 1996 while mayor , Giuliani sued the federal government for new provisions in federal immigration laws that would encourage government employees to turn in illegal immigrants seeking benefits from the city .
Giuliani said educating the children of illegal immigrants made sense .
" The reality is that they are here , and they 're going to remain here .
The choice becomes for a city what do you do ?
Allow them to stay on the streets or allow them to be educated ?
The preferred choice from the point of view of New York City is to be educated . "
Romney , who toured the U.S. - Mexico border Monday , is determined to make this a major issue he wields against Giuliani , who leads in national polls but is behind Romney in first - in - the - nation caucus state Iowa .
Sanctuary Cities Under Romney
But Giuliani's campaign said that Romney 's aggressive charge on this issue is inconsistent with Romney 's record .
While governor of Massachusetts from 2003 until 2007 , three cities in Romney 's home state – Somerville , Cambridge , and Orleans -- either declared or reissued declarations stating that they are in essence sanctuary cities .
" Why should the American people believe Gov. Romney has the right kind of executive experience for America when he claims he was powerless to take action against the three sanctuary cities in Massachusetts who refused to enforce illegal immigration laws ? " asked Jim Dyke , a senior Giuliani campaign strategist .
" If there were ' statutes ' or ' formulas ' standing in Romney 's way , then why did n't he take action to change them ? "
But it is n't only his Republican opponents who question Romney 's sincerity on this issue .
" Romney 's being a hypocrite on this issue , " said Joseph Curtatone , the Democratic mayor of Somerville since 2004 .
" I did not receive any mandate , any communication , anything at all from him about this .
If it 's so important to him why did n't he have the state police enforcing it ? "
Curtatone , president of the Massachusetts Mayors Association , adds that his May 2006 declaration of Somerville as a " city of hope " committed to providing services to illegal immigrants was just official recognition of what exists everywhere in his state .
" I do n't know of any community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts -- whether by official declaration or by their action -- who has not adopted the same policy , " he said .
I never heard Gov. Romney bring it up one way or another . "
Romney aides talk about the governor 's agreement with the federal government to allow Massachusetts state troopers to arrest and seek the deportation of illegal immigrants .
What they do n't emphasize , however , is the fact that that agreement was reached in the closing days of his term , in December 2006 , and was immediately rescinded by his replacement , Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick .
The 30 state troopers initially assigned to receive specialized training from the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency never received their training .
" This is a pretty weak argument to make as part of their rebuttal , " Romney spokesman Kevin Madden told ABC News , " mainly because it serves to underscore the governor 's posture about enforcement and the joint federal - state approach .
… The governor 's effort to deputize state troopers was part of his belief that enforcement requires a joint state - federal approach .
That differs from Mayor Giuliani who has said it's the federal government 's sole responsibility . "
Other Romney critics questioning his commitment to this issue point out that , though Romney decried as " amnesty " the 2007 immigration reform measure that failed in the Senate , in 2005 and 2006 , Romney voiced support for the more liberal versions of the bill .
A Boston Globe investigation indicated that illegal immigrants from Guatemala did landscaping at Romney 's mansion for a decade , with nary an inquiry from the governor about their immigration status .
And according to the Pew Hispanic Center , Massachusetts ' illegal immigrant population exploded during Romney 's one gubernatorial term .
Beyond the squabble over this issue are two campaigns eager to use the issue to further the negative narratives that have emerged about each .
Giuliani wants voters to see Romney as a flip - flopper who will do or say anything and renounce any past view -- whether on abortion , gay rights , or immigration policy -- to get elected .
Romney wants voters to see Giuliani as a Manhattan liberal .
The ' Know - Nothings '
In addition to introducing a team of advisers on the issue , the Giuliani campaign provided to reporters old communications from the mayor going back a quarter century – calling the documentation " The Rudy Rewind " -- indicating his frustration with the federal government 's inability to deal with the illegal immigration policy effectively .
In one November 1981 missive , for example , then - Associated Attorney General Giuliani wrote to Immigration and Naturalization Services district counsel Nina Rao Cameron , expressing frustration that " for too long those in positions of leadership in the [ Justice ]
Department have ignored the immigration area – policy , law and budget .
Reversing this lack of emphasis and tackling problems long neglected are necessary . "
( CLICK HERE TO SEE THAT LETTER )
In a transcript from a March 1995 press conference with then California Gov. Pete Wilson , Giuliani decried the INS 's ineffectiveness when it came to deported illegal immigrants who had committed or stood accused of committing crimes .
" So literally sitting at the INS is a pile maybe this big of names of people who have committed crimes and last year they got around to deporting seven to eight hundred of them .
So before there are obligations placed on us to turn over the names of children in school or their parents or people who use public hospitals , I 'd like to see the Immigration and Naturalization Service dealing with people who commit crimes . "
But Giuliani does not and has never employed the rhetoric of , say , Rep. Tom Tancredo , R - Colo. , who has made opposing " amnesty " a charge on the campaign trail .
A year after his press conference with Wilson , upset with the anti-immigrant tone from many Republicans – presumably including Wilson – Giuliani said in a speech ( LINK ) that " the anti-immigration movement now sweeping the country is no different than earlier anti-immigration movements that have surfaced periodically in American history .
We need only look back at the ' Chinese Exclusionary Act ' or especially at the ' Know - nothing ' movement that swept America in the mid-19th century . "
Giuliani quoted Abraham Lincoln , saying , " When the know - nothings get control , instead of reading ' All men are created equal , ' the Declaration of Independence will read , ' All men are created equal , except Negroes , and foreigners and Catholics . "
Giuliani these days emphasizes border control and casts immigration as a national security issue in light of Sept. 11 .
" Real immigration reform must put security first because border security and homeland security are inseparable in the terrorists ' war on us , " Giuliani has said .
" The first responsibility of the federal government is to protect our citizens by controlling America 's borders , while ending illegal immigration and identifying every noncitizen in our nation . "
( CNN ) -- Saddam Hussein let the world think he had weapons of mass destruction to intimidate Iran and prevent the country from attacking Iraq , according to an FBI agent who interviewed the dictator after his 2003 capture .
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in an unknown location in Iraq after his capture in 2003 .
According to a CBS report , Hussein claimed he did n't anticipate that the United States would invade Iraq over WMD , agent George Piro said on " 60 Minutes , " scheduled for Sunday broadcast .
" For him , it was critical that he was seen as still the strong , defiant Saddam .
He thought that ( faking having the weapons ) would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq , " said Piro .
During the nearly seven months Piro talked to Hussein , the agent hinted to the Iraqi that he answered directly to President Bush , CBS said in a posting on its Web site .
" He told me he initially miscalculated ... President Bush 's intentions .
He thought the United States would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four - day aerial attack , " Piro said .
" He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack . "
" He did n't believe the U.S. would invade ? " Correspondent Scott Pelley asked .
" No , not initially , " Piro answered .
Once it was clear that an invasion was imminent , Hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks , Piro said .
" And at that point , it would go into what he called the secret war , " the agent said , referring to the insurgency .
But Piro said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of Hussein 's plan .
" Well , he would like to take credit for the insurgency , " he said .
Hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that , Piro said .
" He wanted to pursue all of WMD ... to reconstitute his entire WMD program . "
Hussein said he was proud he eluded U.S. authorities who searched for him for nine months after the U.S. - led invasion , Piro said .
" What he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us , " Piro said .
" He told me he changed ... the way he traveled .
He got rid of his normal vehicles .
He got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with , really just to change his signature . "
Hussein was hanged in 2006 .

COMMANDER WARNS OF AL - QAIDA THREAT TO US

WASHINGTON ( AP ) – Al - Qaida terrorists may be plotting more urgently to attack the United States to maintain their credibility and ability to recruit followers , the U.S. military commander in charge of domestic defense said Thursday .
Air Force Gen. Gene Renuart , chief of the U.S. Northern Command , told reporters he has not seen any direct threats tied to the U.S. presidential elections .
But he said it would be imprudent to think that such threats are not there .
“ We need only to look at Spain and see that they ’re certainly willing to try to do something that is significant that could affect an election process , ” Renuart said .
“ I think it would be imprudent of us to let down our guard believing that if there ’s no credible threat that you know of today , there wo n’t be something tomorrow . ”
While he said that U.S. authorities have thwarted attacks on a number of occasions , he said terrorist cells may be working harder than ever to plot high - impact events .
He did not point to any specific intelligence that authorities have received but said the “ chatter ” they are hearing “ gives me no reason to believe they ’re going to slow down ” in their efforts to target the U.S .
“ If an organization like that is to maintain credibility and continue to grow more of its extremists , it has to show tangible results , ” Renuart said .
“ So I think there may be a certain sense of urgency among that organization to have an effect .
So it would tell me that they ’re trying harder . ”
Of the more than a dozen daily events that Northern Command responds to – ranging from natural disasters to threats – two or three may have the potential to be terrorist incidents , he said .
The chatter , which included public audio and video tapes released on the Internet by al - Qaida leaders , suggests that they are looking for a way to have a big impact again , he said .
Pressed for details , he said the chatter was more common but “ whether that ’s louder or more ominous , I ’m not sure I ’m ready to draw that conclusion . ”
He did , however , repeat his assertion – which he first made last July – that he believes there are al - Qaida cells or sympathizers within the United States .
President Bush , in a speech , also said the United States remained under threat from terrorists .
Marking the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Homeland Security Department , Bush said that in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks “ it was hard to imagine that we would reach this milestone without another attack on our homeland . ”
Yet he said , “ On this anniversary , we must also remember that the danger to our country has not passed .
Since the attacks of 9/11 , the terrorists have tried to strike our homeland again and again .
We ’ve disrupted numerous planned attacks – including a plot to fly an airplane into the tallest building on the West Coast and another to blow up passenger jets headed for America across the Atlantic Ocean . ”
Bush said the lesson is clear : “ The enemy remains active , deadly in its intent – and in the face of this danger , the United States must never let down its guard . ”

Autoweek and Fourtitude were able to enjoy some seat time in the Audi R8 V12 TDI LeMans concept before its official unveiling in Geneva last week .
Their drive was short ( about an hour with a 50 mph speed limit imposed by Audi's boffins ) , but their time at the airport adjacent to Sebring International Raceway has made an impression .
The crimson beast we saw in Geneva was the same concept that was displayed in Detroit , simply sporting a new paint job , but spending quality time with the R8 V12 TDI revealed a few interesting tidbits about the concept .
First , the firewall behind the driver and passenger had to be extended by some six - inches to accommodate the oilburner and although claimed torque output is somewhere in the 737 lb. - ft. range , the few journos asked to take part only got to experience 442 lb. - ft. of twist – a good thing considering that the transmission mated to the engine is an A4 case with modified internals .
While the performance was impressive , the short gearing and shorter redline ( not disclosed ) seemed to make all that grunt superfluous in first and second , but Audi is expecting the R8 V12 TDI to return around 24 mpg and meet the 2014 Euro 6 emissions standards if , and when , it goes on sale .
While the Autoweek piece only provided the " 50/50 " quote in the title , the Fourtitude article is far more entertaining and informative -- well worth a read
For most people the third time is the charm , but in the case of Time columnist Joe Klein writing about proposed changes to the nation 's spying laws , even his third draft gets it wrong .
After being called to task last week for writing a dangerously misinformed column on changes to the nation 's spying laws , Klein concedes that he might have made a mistake when he said a House bill would " require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court , an institution founded to protect the rights of U.S. citizens only . "
But then again , he thinks maybe he did n't .
I may have made a mistake in my column this week about the FISA legislation passed by the House , although it 's difficult to tell for sure given the technical nature of the bill ’s language and fierce disagreements between even moderate Republicans and Democrats on the Committee about what the bill actually does contain .
In his two follow - up blog posts , Klein compounds his errors and valiantly argues he is right that the Dems are coddling terrorists because a bill passed by the House says that if the NSA targets a foreigner or group of foreigners who will likely communicate with someone inside the United States , the spies need to get court approval .
Klein says this gives foreign terrorists the same rights as Americans .
But this restriction is only true when the nation 's spies are wiretapping fiber optic cables , telecom switches and web mail providers INSIDE the United States .
Klein continues to miss this most crucial distinction in the debate , which is why THREAT LEVEL , paraphrasing Klein 's column , continues to believe that Klein is well beyond stupid .
He 's dangerous .
Outside the United States , such wiretapping is n't even defined as surveillance , and it never has been .
If the NSA is listening in on cell phone calls in Iraq , they do n't need a warrant nor do they need court approval of their techniques .
If the Iranian cell phone user they are listening in on calls an American , they do n't have to stop and get a warrant .
Instead they follow long - established minimization procedures that disguise the American 's name , unless there 's a good reason not to .
Wiretapping inside America is the whole reason various bills are being debated .
After a secret spying court decided last spring that the government 's wiretapping inside America without having particularized warrants was illegal , the Administration began pushing for new powers from Congress .
The administration then scared Congress into rush passage of a bill that massively expanded the government 's spying powers outside and inside the United States , without any real expansion of oversight .
But Klein can't grasp this simple point , which may be why he defends himself by saying that bills are hard to read and details are unimportant :
We are talking about relatively obscure and unimportant technical details and my larger point — that a bipartisan , veto - proof House FISA was possible , but was opposed by the Democratic leadership — is still true .
The House 's so - called Restore Act AMENDS the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which regulates wiretapping of U.S. persons ( citizens and visa holders ) inside the United States .
The Restore Act does not replace FISA .
Thus when one reads the word " surveillance " in the bills or their summaries , you must keep in mind that FISA does n't consider targeting foreigners or drift net listening over the Pacific as " surveillance " so long as the ears are outside the United States .
So when you read the word " surveillance " in the Restore Act or its summary , you have to remember that FISA has a complex definition of surveillance , that largely boils down to surveillance = 1 ) getting the contents of American 's communications regardless of where the listening happens or 2 ) listening - in from locations on American soil ( with some exceptions for radio communications ) .
Everything else ?
Not surveillance .
The larger point here is that Klein thinks the Restore Act restricts traditional government surveillance powers , when it actually expands them .
For instance , the Restore Act says that the government has get a ' basket warrant ' to listen in on groups of foreign bad guys if they might communicate with U.S. persons .
But you have to remember that 's only about wiretaps inside the United States .
So if you read the Democrat 's summary of the Restore Act , it says it " Creates a Program of Court Authorized Targeting of Non-U.S. Persons Outside the United States . "
That sounds really restrictive unless you think of it as " creates a program of court - authorized orders to domestic communication companies to wiretap non-Americans outside the United States . "
In short , the Restore Act is about what the NSA can do with or without court approval inside AT&T 's phone switches , on Comcast 's internet lines , on Yahoo's web mail , on AOL 's Instant Messenger and on Ebay 's Skype .
It 's not about what the NSA can do by wiretapping underseas fiber optic cables or bribing their way to getting taps on the cell phone towers in Syria .
Here 's an example of how the Restore Act – the bill Klein says proves Dems want to give terrorists rights – actually expands surveillance powers .
Under the Restore Act , the NSA could order Gmail to turn over all email communications that go from one foreign IP address to another foreign IP address , without getting a court order .
The NSA could also order AT&T to let it build a spying room that would let it monitor the company 's massive internet backbones , where the NSA 's equipment would filter out communications that it believed to belong to Americans .
Here 's the language that lets them do so :
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act , a court order is not required for electronic surveillance directed at the acquisition of the contents of any communication between persons that are not known to be United States persons and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information , without respect to whether the communication passes through the United States or the surveillance device is located within the United States .
That 's a massive expansion of traditional government surveillance powers inside the United States .
By comparison , the Senate Intelligence bill give the Executive branch even more power to turn the nation 's communication infrastructure into a giant spying machine , and has less court oversight than the House bill .
( It adds more oversight than the Protect America Act and slightly curtails the powers handed over in that bill . )
Yet Klein says the Senate bill , with its expansive domestic spying powers and immunity for the governement 's partners in a secret and likely illegal spying operation , " could have set an important , if belated , precedent for the limits of executive power . "
Passing a virtual surveillance wish list that has a bit more oversight than the president would like and dismissing legal challenges to the executive branch 's unilateral targeting of Americans for wiretapping strikes a blow for limiting executive power ?
Who gave this man a column ?
Finally , Klein 's continues to bungle how the Senate Intelligence bill would give immunity to telecoms who helped with the Bush administration 's secret wiretapping of Americans .
( The House bill has no provisions , and the Senate bill may no longer either because of the Judiciary Committee ) .
In his first blog post about his column , Klein writes that immunity would be " selective immunity to those telecoms who can provide written proof that they were acting in response to a direct order from the government .
That seems fair to me . "
In fact , it does do that – but if telecoms had such orders , they could have already shown them in secret to the judge and be out of their legal mess already .
Klein misleads his readers about the breadth of immunity by omitting that the immunity provision also applies to companies who simply got requests for help , not legal orders directing them to turn over billions of call records .
No one serious thinks the companies should be sued if they got a legal order .
Remember that former Qwest CEO Joseph Nacchio said he repeatedly asked for such an order before helping the NSA , but the government did n't want to do so .
Such an order could have put the administration on the hook for a program that a Republican appointee lawyer later found to be without any sound legal basis - i.e. illegal .
In his second post , Klein mostly gets it right , describing the same provision as " immunity for telecoms who allowed access to information , after receiving a direct written request from the government , in a way that would be legal under the new law . "
Actually what the Attorney General has to show a judge is 1 ) that the government requested that the telecoms give access to their domestic networks or call records , and 2 ) that the government told the telecoms that the government thought its own spying program was legal .
The note does n't have to say that the government believed that the telecom 's participation was legal .
Klein now has two blog posts and one column ( printed in Time magazine ) that are all shot through with errors .
Collectively , Klein 's postings paint a deceiving caricature of people who are concerned about letting the government turn the nation 's telecommunication systems into giant microphones – something that was explicitly rejected in the wiretapping compromises that followed the excesses of Nixon , the CIA and J. Edgar Hoover .

NY Times ' hits ' McCain over melanoma ' secrecy ' Ron Brynaert
Published : Saturday March 8 , 2008
|
Print This Email This On Saturday night , The Drudge Report jumped upon an article posted at the New York Times website slated for Sunday 's paper entitled " On the Campaign Trail , Few Mentions of McCains Bout With Melanoma . "
" Along with his signature bright white hair , the most striking aspects of Senator John McCains physical appearance are his puffy left cheek and the scar that runs down the back of his neck , " writes Lawrence K. Altman M.D. in Sunday 's Times .
" The marks are cosmetic reminders of the melanoma surgery he underwent in August 2000 .
Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , sometimes tells audiences that he has ' more scars than Frankenstein . ' "
The paper notes that McCain 's " operation was performed mainly to determine whether the melanoma , a potentially fatal form of skin cancer , had spread from his left temple to a key lymph node in his neck ; a preliminary pathology test at the time showed that it had not . "
" In 1999 , during Mr. McCains first race for president , he gave the public an extraordinary look at his medical history  1,500 pages of medical and psychiatric records that were amassed as part of a United States Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war , " Altman writes .
" This reporter , who is a physician , interviewed the senators doctors in 1999 with his permission . "
Altman complains that now it 's a different matter .
" But this time around , Mr. McCain has yet to make his full medical records or his physicians available to reporters , " writes Altman .
" At least three times since March 2007 , campaign officials have told The New York Times that they would provide the detailed information about his current state of health , but they have not done so .
The campaign now says it expects to release the information in April . "
He adds , " So Mr. McCains prognosis for the recurrence of melanoma can be gauged only by talking to experts not connected with his case .
Those experts say his prospects appear favorable . "
William Galston , an elections expert at the Brookings Institution , recently quipped to the Times Online , " McCain is the quintessential white candidate  so white that he gets melanoma if he stays in the sun . "
Blogger Ed Driscoll complains about the " New York Times Hit On McCain , " and adds that " in 2004 , there were even fewer mentions -- especially by the Times - - of the cancer scare suffered by " Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry .
" The New York Times ' campaign against Republican nominee John McCain is getting into full swing , but it has a certain wistful quality .
Like this headline ...
If only the voters cared more about melanoma ! " the Powerline blog mocks , before deciding that " there does n't seem to be much of a story here . "
From the left , Andy Ostroy asked at his blog on Friday , " Do we not have the right to know more about the seriousness of this , and perhaps other , health conditions of what would be a 72 - year - old president ? "
According to a press release , " Lawrence K. Altman , M.D. , is one of the few full - fledged medical doctors working as a full - time daily newspaper reporter .
He has been a member of The New York Times science news staff since 1969 . "
Altman 's biography adds that he " holds medical licenses in the states of Washington , California and New York , is a clinical professor at the New York University Medical School .
He is a Master of the American College of Physicians , a Fellow of the American College of Epidemiology and the New York Academy of Medicine and a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences . "
The Times was recently criticized by Republicans , and even some Democrats , for reporting on rumors that McCain was romantically involved with a lobbyist , and the story was even used by the Republican presidential candidate 's campaign to garner donations .
The fundraising letter read , " Well , here we go .
We could expect attacks were coming ; as soon as John McCain appeared to be locking up the Republican nomination , the liberal establishment and their allies at the New York Times have gone on the attack .
Todays front - page New York Times story is particularly disgusting - an un-sourced hit - and - run smear campaign designed to distract from the issues at stake in this election .
With John McCain leading a number of general - election polls against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , the New York Times knew the time to attack was now , and they did .
We will not allow their scurrilous attack against a great American hero to stand . "
On Friday , McCain had a heated exchange with another Times reporter on his campaign plane , as wide - eyed reporters watched , over a meeting he had with then - presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004 about becoming the Democrat 's running mate .
The candidate appeared to grow agitated , although he never raised his voice .
Fox News broadcast video of the exchange .

A Tory councillor has claimed that there should be compulsory sterilisation for parents on benefits .
John Ward prompted comparisons with Adolf Hitler and calls for his resignation after attacking " professional spongers " who he claims " breed for greed " .
He has removed the original comments from his website blog and said he was sorry if he caused any problems .
But Mr Ward , a 58 - year - old bachelor , has since published a defiant claim that he was " exposing easily demonstrable truths " .
He added that " a pushy cold caller at the door got me so irate and upset that I did n't finish what I was doing correctly " .
The row erupted with an entry on his Internet blog after Shannon Matthews was recently found alive in a relative 's home after being missing for 24 days .
Mr Ward , who has sat on Medway Council in Kent for eight years , focused on how the nine - year - old 's mother Karen has seven children by five fathers .
He wrote : " This is yet another example of ' Breakdown Britain ' , much of which stems from the Government - encouraged change away from the hard - working and decent family structure to an increasingly self - indulgent immoral and state - funded lazy lifestyle .
" Children become just a means toward that end , and are of themselves of little if any further significance in this new society .
" I think there is an increasingly strong case for compulsory sterilisation of all those who have had a second ( or third , or whatever ) child while living off state handouts .
" It would clearly take a lot of social pressures off all concerned , thus protecting the youngsters themselves to some degree , and remove the incentive to ' breed for greed ' - i.e. for more public subsidy of their lifestyle ( a well - known dodge , worth ever greater amounts to countless thousands of professional spongers ) .
" With over - population being the root cause of so much that negatively impacts Planet Earth , the very last thing the world needs is to encourage excessive breeding . "

So happy : Karen Matthews and Craig Meehan share a kiss outside their Dewsbury home after Shannon was found alive
At the weekend , Mr Ward , a retired supermarket worker , had at first tried to play down the row .
He said : " The whole idea was to get people to think about issues .
" Also , I 'm half - blind and missed out a word , I should have written ' consideration ' .
I 'm sorry if it has caused any problems . "
Then his defiant new entry followed in which he said he will " weather the storm ahead " and continue " exposing easily - demonstrable truths " .
But Medway Labour deputy leader Glyn Griffiths said : " If the Conservatives care about their image they should expel him immediately .
There is no place for this in mainstream politics . "
Labour councillor Bill Esterson added : " It 's the sort of thing Nazis did in Germany . "
Medway Liberal
Democrat leader Geoff Juby said : " He is on a different planet .
He should move to China where they have a one - child policy . "
Local trade union leader Brian Kelly added : " He makes a strong case for someone to politically sterilise him . "
A spokesman for Medway Conservatives said Mr Ward was simply voicing his own opinions .
Last night , a spokesman for Conservative Central Office said : " These remarks are abhorrent and the Conservative Party disassociates itself from them . "
With the GOP primary in South Carolina coming tomorrow , the temptation for culture - war pandering is apparently a little too strong for some candidates .
“ You do n’t like people from outside the state coming in and telling you what to do with your flag , ” Mr. Huckabee , a former governor of Arkansas , told supporters in Myrtle Beach , according to The Associated Press .
“ In fact , ” he said , “ if somebody came to Arkansas and told us what to do with our flag , we ’d tell them what to do with the pole ; that ’s what we ’d do . ” [… ]
And a radio advertisement paid for by an independent group used the flag issue to attack Mr. McCain , of Arizona , and praise Mr. Huckabee .
“ John McCain assaults our values , ” it said .
“ Mike Huckabee understands the value of heritage . ”
First , I can appreciate the fact that McCain is vulnerable on the issue .
Before the 2000 campaign , McCain did n’t support the Confederate flag .
Before the South Carolina primary , he switched , endorsing the flag .
After the primary , he switched back , saying his pre-primary position was an “ act of political cowardice . ”
If Huckabee wants to point that out , it ’s certainly fair game , but that clearly was n’t the message yesterday .
Second , Huckabee certainly has a unique approach to federalism .
On the one hand , the federal government should have minimal input on state laws .
On the other , Huckabee wants to redo the Constitution to bring it in line with “ God ’s standards , ” limiting states ’ rights on marriage equality and reproductive rights .
And third , in the 21st century , do we still need to use a Civil War battle flag as red meat for far - right Republicans ?
Federal officials have indicated that they are likely to close the Pacific salmon fishery from northern Oregon to the Mexican border because of the collapse of crucial stocks in California ’s major watershed .
That would be the most extensive closing on the West Coast since the federal government started regulating fisheries .
“ By far the biggest , ” said Dave Bitts , a commercial fisherman from Eureka , Calif. , who is at a weeklong meeting of the Pacific Coast Fisheries Management Council in Sacramento .
“ The Central Valley fall Chinook salmon are in the worst condition since records began to be kept , ” Robert Lohn , regional administrator for the National Marine Fisheries Service in Portland , Ore. , said Wednesday in an interview .
“ This is the largest collapse of salmon stocks in 40 years . ”
Gebrselassie has set 26 world records during his career
The marathon world record holder suffers from asthma and missed the 2007 London Marathon because of the problem .
The 34 - year - old will now try to qualify for Ethiopia in the 10,000 m at Beijing .
" The pollution in China is a threat to my health and it would be difficult for me to run 42 km in my current condition , " Gebrselassie told Reuters .
" But I 'm not pulling out of the Olympic event in Beijing all together .
I plan to participate in the 10,000 m event . "
But Gebrselassie 's agent said the Ethiopian will make a final decision on whether to run the Beijing marathon after the Hengelo meeting on 24 May in Holland , when he will know if he has qualified for the Olympics 10,000m .
" Haile wants to do everything possible for his country , " agent Jos Hermens told the Associated Press .
" With three Ethiopians , they could get gold , silver and bronze .
" And if you look deep into his heart , he wants another marathon record . "
The International Olympic Committee has voiced concerns over the issue of air pollution in Beijing .

Haile is absolutely right why run this distance in those conditions

If contingency measures do not have the desired affect then endurance events could be delayed for a few hours or rescheduled for another day .
Last year Britain 's Paula Radcliffe called in pollution experts to help her plans to run in the Games marathon .
At the time her husband and manager Gary Lough told BBC Sport that Radcliffe , who suffers from exercise - induced asthma , may have to change her medication in China .
" She may have to adapt her doses or medication but as long as we 've done enough research and thought about it , it hopefully wo n't be an issue , " he said .
" There 's no point in us being especially concerned , because pollution 's not really something you can control . "

Bill Moyers finds parallels with the degradation of rampant steroid use in baseball to how degraded our country has become by those seeking quick ways to short cut and short circuit level playing fields .
You do n't get a level playing field with performance enhancing drugs , any more than you get an honest government with political action committees and bundled contributions , or a fair economy with some derivatives , hedge funds , and private equity managers taxed at rates lower than their janitors .
You get a level playing field only when the fans demand it .
Suppose people stopped attending games in large numbers , stopped watching on TV , stopped buying the products hyped by the icons .
The leveling would happen , or baseball as a money - making business would die .
It 's not likely to happen .
If we can't organize to stop a brutal , bloody war in Iraq , or rectify an economic system that divides us further every day , we can hardly expect collective action from baseball fans .
There was a lesson in George Mitchell 's report that I 'm not sure even he recognized .
The day Americans do n't feel strongly enough about the need for level playing fields to fight for them -- the day when cutting corners and seeking an edge become the national pastime -- is the day democracy will be lucky even to find a seat in the bleachers .
' Yes We Can ! ' Obama Beats Clinton in S.C. Primary Large African - American turnout carries Obama to victory in S.C .
Jan. 26 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama , vying to become the nation 's first black president , has won the South Carolina primary today , boosted by a record turnout of African - American voters .
Obama overwhelmingly beat Sen. Hillary Clinton with 55 percent support to her 27 percent , and former Sen. John Edwards , trailing with 18 percent support , with almost all preccints reporting .
" Tonight , the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of Iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of South Carolina , " Obama said to supporters tonight .
" We have the most votes , the most delegates , and the most diverse coalition of Americans we 've seen in a long , long time , " Obama told supporters , who cheered " Yes we can ! "
In a direct swipe at Clinton 's campaign , Obama said , " There are real differences between the candidates .
We are looking for more than just a change of party in the White House , " he said .
" We 're looking to fundamentally change the status quo in Washington ... and right now , that status quo is fighting back with everything it 's got ; with the same old tactics that divide and distract us from solving the problems people face , " Obama said .
Clinton left South Carolina tonight for Nashville , Tenn. , where she sought to minimize her loss and emphasize the upcoming Super - Duper Tuesday votes Feb .
5 .
" I want to congratulate Sen. Obama tonight , " Clinton told supporters .
" Now the eyes of the country turn to Tennessee and the other states that will be voting Feb.5 and of course the state of Florida that will be voting Tuesday . "
Yet to win any primary contest thus far , John Edwards lost again tonight , another crushing blow to the former senator , who was born in South Carolina and won the state in 2004 .
Congratulating Obama and Clinton tonight , Edwards told supporters , " Our campaign from the very beginning has been about one central thing , and that is to give voice to millions of Americans who have absolutely no voice , " Edwards said .
African - American Voters Boost Obama
This is the second win in the nomination battle for Obama , who won the Iowa caucuses earlier this month , but this is his first win in a state with a sizable African - American population .
Women and African - Americans , courted heavily by the candidates , turned out in very large numbers to vote in what became a bitter Democratic primary marked by rhetoric about race and gender .
Exit poll results indicate 55 percent of Democratic primary voters this year were black -- the highest turnout among African - Americans in any Democratic presidential primary for which data is available , reports ABC News ' Gary Langer .
Women accounted for six in 10 voters , similar to their 57 percent turnout rate in 2004 .
Obama won the support of 78 percent of black voters , compared with 19 percent for Hillary Clinton and just two percent for John Edwards .
Whites , meanwhile , divided more closely among the three candidates , though Obama notably failed to attract more than a quarter of their votes , reports Langer .
Clinton and Edwards were even among whites , with Clinton winning white women , Edwards , white men .
Clinton started out strong in the state , but began to trail Obama in December .
In recent weeks her campaign has tried to lower expectations , positioning her as the underdog in the race , and largely leaving her husband , former President Bill Clinton , to campaign for her in the Palmetto State .
' Jesse Jackson Won South Carolina '
Even before Obama 's victory , the Clinton campaign was already spinning the results , discounting the notion of an Obama victory , reports ABC News ' David Wright .
" Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in 84 and ' 88 , " former President Bill Clinton told reporters outside a polling station in Columbia Saturday .
" Jackson ran a good campaign .
And Obama ran a good campaign here . "
Wright reports Clinton rejected any suggestion he or his wife were guilty of race - baiting in South Carolina .
" Man , you 've never been in many campaigns if you think this was ugly , " Bill Clinton said .
" This was a cakewalk . "
But in a campaign dominated by talk of race , South Carolinians went into the polls with the economy on their minds ; just over half called it the most important issue in their vote .
South Carolina has the fourth - highest unemployment rate in the nation , and has lost more than 90,000 manufacturing jobs over the last decade .
Obama : Media Focused ' Maniacally ' on Race
Early on , the Obama campaign sought out African - Americans , employing a large staff in the state and organizing in churches , beauty parlors and barber shops .
The Clinton campaign , too , fought hard for black women voters , who tend to turn out reliably at the polls .
But Obama complained the media 's focus on race has been excessive .
" The press has been very focused , almost maniacally , on the issue of race here in South Carolina , " Obama told ABC News ' Kate Snow on Saturday 's " Good Morning America Weekend " edition .
" But as we move forward after this contest , I 'm very confident that we are going to continue to build the kind of coalitions that we 've been seeing all across the country . "
The junior senator from Illinois dismissed the notion he has been marginalized , in the words of Associated Press writer Ron Fournier , as " the black candidate , by the Clinton machine . "
" I think it'd be hard to argue that I have been marginalized , when I won Iowa , which was 94 percent white .
We were almost tied in New Hampshire , a state that has an all - white population .
And in Nevada , I was able to win , actually , the biggest votes , uh , margins , in those northern areas that are predominantly white , rural , conservative areas , " Obama said .
Former President Clinton made headlines this week when he chastized CNN reporter Jessica Yellin for challenging him about comments he made about race and gender .
Clinton Camp Plays Expectations Game
Campaigning Saturday morning in Columbia with her daughter , Chelsea , Hillary Clinton popped into a Shoney 's restaurant and urged people to vote .
Sitting down beside an 8 - year - old boy named Messiah , who was playing a video game , Clinton leaned in and said , " So this guy , what 's he doing ? " reports ABC News ' Eloise Harper .
Looking at the game , he said , " Beatin ' up the evil people . "
Clinton paused and said , " Can I have him come with me ? "
Nearby , Bill Clinton ate grits and eggs with his wife 's supporters at Bert 's Grill and Diner , and visited a voting station down the road , reports ABC News ' Sarah Amos .
Race Shifts to Florida
Behind the scenes , Clinton 's campaign sent out a memo to reporters that tried to minimize the impact of the South Carolina contest .
" Regardless of today 's outcome , the race quickly shifts to Florida , where hundreds of thousands of Democrats turn out to vote Tuesday , " wrote Clinton Communications Director Howard Wolfson .
In a sign of how bad the blood is between the two campaigns , Obama 's spokesman Bill Burton quickly sent a memo of his own .
" It should not be surprising given recent events that the Clinton campaign would in one breath say the election is about winning delegates and then tout their success in states that do n't award any delegates in the next breath , " Burton wrote .
That type of back - and - forth bickering between the Obama and Clinton campaigns allowed Edwards , who had moved up slightly in the polls in recent weeks , to argue he was the only " grown - up " in the race , running ads showing his rivals attacking one another at Monday night 's debate .
" Vote for somebody who 's actually focused on the problems that you 're faced with , from jobs to health care to ending the war in Iraq , as opposed to two candidates who are spending all their time and energy tearing each other down .
I 'm about building South Carolina up , not about tearing people down , not about tearing politicians down , " Edwards said Saturday , campaigning in Charleston .
The loss in his home state may have driven a stake through the former senator 's presidential chances , but Edwards told ABC News ' David Muir Friday he 's going to continue to fight through Feb .
5 .
Edwards advisers reportedly believe he could play kingmaker if his two rivals end up short on delegates .
On primary day the Clinton campaign launched a series of anti-Edwards robotic calls in South Carolina , reminding voters that Edwards once worked for a hedge fund that , the call stated , has been " profiting " from subprime lending and home foreclosures .
" You should also know that John Edwards made nearly a half a million dollars working for a Wall Street investment fund , " the Clinton campaign call said , " A fund that 's been profiting on foreclosing on the homes of families , including 100 homes right here in South Carolina . "
In a race that has increasingly become a delegate war leading up to the Super - Duper Feb.5 primaries and caucuses , Obama won an estimated 25 delegates tonight , Clinton won an estimated 12 and John Edwards received 8 delegates .
Obama 's campaign received another boost this weekend with the endorsement of Caroline Kennedy , the last surviving member of President John F. Kennedy 's immediate family .
" Over the years , I 've been deeply moved by the people who 've told me they wished they could feel inspired and hopeful about America the way people did when my father was president , " Caroline Kennedy writes in a New York Times op - ed Sunday .
" This sense is even more profound today .
That is why I am supporting a presidential candidate in the Democratic primaries , Barack Obama . "
Arguing a " new wind " is at his back , Obama heads to Georgia and Alabama , states his campaign believes he can win , reports ABC News ' Sunlen Miller .
The victory tonight gives Obama some much needed momentum before Tuesday 's Florida primary and before voters in more than 20 states have their say Feb .

The Difference Between Frugal and Cheap
Yesterday I was reading a post at Gather Little by Little about frugality .
I scrolled down to read the comments , and Paidtwice commented , “ … I aspire to be frugal and sometimes I think I hit cheap instead ; ) . ”
I think a lot of people struggle with the difference between frugal and cheap .
I know I do sometimes .
How far is too far in your attempt to be frugal ?
Let ’s play a game : Frugal or Cheap ?
How would you rate each of the following situations ?
Re-using plastic margarine tubs to store leftover food .
Taking extra ketchup packets from a restaurant , so you do n’t have to buy ketchup for home .
Taking an old rocking chair out of a dumpster to re-finish for use in your home .
Re-gifting a wedding present .
Leaving no tip for a waitress , because you ca n’t afford to tip .
Serving leftovers when you have people over for dinner .
Shopping at Goodwill for your children ’s clothes , when you can afford to buy brand new .
Asking family members to chip in for Thanksgiving Dinner .
Buying a second - hand carseat .
Buying only loss leaders when you go shopping .
Picking tomatoes from your neighbor ’s garden when it ’s apparent they have far more than one family could use .
I ’ve heard some real life variations of all of these situations .
I ’ll let you know what I think , and then you can tell me what you think .
Re-using plastic margarine tubs to store leftover food .
I think this is frugal .
It ’s making good use of what resources you have .
I probably would n’t re-use these containers for long term storage in the freezer , because that ’s not what they were designed to do , and my food might taste funny .
But I think for basic storage in the refrigerator , re-using plastic margarine tubs is a frugal move .
Taking extra ketchup packets from a restaurant , so you do n’t have to buy ketchup for home .
Cheap .
Restaurants provide ketchup packets for meals bought at the restaurant .
So use as many as you need for the meal you bought , but do n’t take extra packets just for home use .
Taking an old rocking chair out of a dumpster to re-finish for use in your home .
Frugal , as long as your city does n’t have laws against dumpster diving .
If you can make the discarded rocking chair usable again , taking it keeps it out of the landfill .
Definitely a frugal use of resources and the environment .
Re-gifting a wedding present .
It depends .
If it ’s a present you think the couple will like , it can be frugal .
It becomes cheap , however , when you give it to a couple that is friends with the person who gave the gift to you .
That even goes beyond cheap and turns into tacky .
Leaving no tip for a waitress , because you ca n’t afford to tip .
Cheap .
If you ca n’t afford to leave a tip , you ca n’t afford to eat at that restaurant .
Serving leftovers when you have people over for dinner .
Frugal , as long as the leftovers are good .
Please do n’t serve moldy macaroni and cheese .
I might have called this cheap a few months ago , but a friend of mine told me a story that changed my mind .
My friend said that when she was new in town , this couple had invited her over for dinner .
She did n’t know it at the time , but the couple was really struggling financially .
They served leftovers .
Everyone had a great time , and my friend felt welcome in the new community .
Having people over for dinner is about relationships , not about showing off your fancy dishes .
If you can only afford leftovers , serve them .
You ’re not cheap .
You ’re frugal .
Shopping at Goodwill for your children ’s clothes , when you can afford to buy brand new .
Frugal .
I ’ve heard the argument that this is cheap , but I do n’t think so .
If you choose to buy secondhand clothes , so you can afford to take your family to the beach , that ’s a frugal use of your money .
It ’s all about your priorities and where you choose to spend your money .
If new clothes are n’t a priority , feel free to buy secondhand .
Asking family members to chip in for Thanksgiving Dinner .
It depends .
If your family is collectively deciding who is hosting Thanksgiving , and your house would be perfect , but you ca n’t afford to buy everything , I think it ’s fine to ask for financial help at that point .
It becomes cheap when you hit your family members up for donations as they leave your house on Thanksgiving Day .
Buying a second - hand carseat .
Cheap , unless you know the person selling the carseat VERY WELL , and you know without a doubt that the carseat has been well taken care of and has never been in an accident .
Do n’t risk your children ’s lives just to save a few bucks .
That ’s cheap and dangerous .
Buying only loss leaders when you go shopping .
Frugal .
The stores make the rules , and if you ’re abiding by the rules , buy loss leaders and use coupons to the extent that ’s allowed .
It ’s definitely good stewardship to save as much as you can when grocery shopping .
You might even find you can buy enough to give to someone who needs a little extra help .
Picking tomatoes from your neighbor ’s garden when it ’s apparent they have far more than one family could use .
Hopefully you already know the answer to this one .
It is never OK to pick your neighbor ’s tomatoes without their permission .
I do n’t care how many they have .
It ’s cheap .
And wrong .
The bottom line is , when your “ frugality ” begins to impact other people in a negative way , it becomes cheap .
Not leaving a tip impacts the waitress in a negative way , when she ’s given you exceptional service .
Re -gifting a wedding present when you know there ’s a good chance that the original giver will find out about it might cause hurt feelings .
Do n’t do it .
It ’s fine to try to save as much money as you can .
I know a lot of people make a game of it , and it can get rather addicting .
Just keep in mind that people are more important than a few bucks saved .
If you keep your relationships in mind above all else , you wo n’t have to worry about crossing the line from frugal to cheap .
Hi < insert TV station here > ,
Just a quick note to let you know that I unplugged my TV today and canceled my cable .
I ’ve realized that I do n’t need you any more .
I ’ve realized that you ’re hurting my country and I ’m finished helping you do it .
I ’ve been watching your coverage of the elections recently and I ’ve come to the conclusion that you do n’t serve my interests .
I do n’t blame you .
In fact , I understand it .
You ’re trying to maximize profits for your shareholders .
This is as it should be .
However , I do n’t need entertainment from my news source .
I need substantive discussion of issues that affect my family ’s future .
To be frank , I do n’t care about Britney ’s breakdown or Paris ’ panties .
So here ’s how it ’s going to play out .
I thought maybe you ’d like to know .
While you ’re ostensibly a news station , you actually try to provide me with entertainment .
And you do that badly .
I ’ve joined up with Netflix and when I want to be entertained , I watch DVDs on my computer .
So I do n’t need you for in - home entertainment .
I get much of my news from social news sites , so when your station does put something out that ’s interesting or substantive , I get to see it anyway .
My advantage is that I do n’t have to sit through the rest of your stuff to get to anything good .
Also , I recently discovered a show called “ The Young Turks ” on the Brave New Films site .
Their coverage of the South Carolina election results was fantastic .
Admittedly , I wanted Cenk to shut up while Obama was speaking , but I posted that comment and I ’m sure it was read .
Maybe next time he ’ll interrupt less .
The interviews with various commentators and bloggers were right on the money .
They cut straight to the heart of the issues I was interested in .
It was the best election coverage I ’ve ever seen .
I enjoyed it greatly and felt that I learned a lot .
Check out their upcoming coverage of Super Tuesday .
You might also learn something .
In addition to all this there ’s sources like NPR and Democracy Now .
So , not only do I not need you for entertainment , it turns out that I do n’t need you for news either .
Finally , you ’re actively damaging the country I live in .
The country I love .
Your coverage of the ongoing nomination process has been extremely poor .
Your debates have been designed to create disagreement so you can replay the sound bites ad nauseum .
Your debates should have been designed to probe the candidates on issues that matter to the citizens .
Oh , and the way you selected the candidates you thought were viable and then skewed the coverage in their favor was reprehensible .
The bulk of the candidates hold similar positions on many key issues .
Why ignore the lesser known candidates with different ideas ?
Ideas that the American people are clamoring for ?
You ’re hurting my country and it will not stand .
I understand that you ’re catering to what ’s exciting because that ’s what drives your ratings .
I ’m not mad at you , I ’m just saying you ’re done whoring my eyeballs to the highest bidder .
My eyeballs and I are breaking up with you .
We ’re switching you off .
You ’ve been unplugged .
I ’m also trying to encourage others to do the same .
I ’m sure most older people will ignore the call .
Most of them probably wo n’t even hear the call ( we do n’t really move in the same circles ) .
But in your prized younger demographic groups , you ’ve dramatically miscalculated both our anger and our resolve .
We do n’t need you .
We do n’t want you .
We are switching you off and you will eventually starve .
I ’d like to tell you there ’s a way for you to fix this , but I honestly do n’t much care if you do .
As more and more young people start to understand the economic power they wield , your profits will dwindle .
Others will see this opportunity and make money catering to it .
It has started out as a niche .
The niche will grow .
Mostly I just wanted to tell you that while you ’re entitled to do what makes you the most money , you ’re not going to be making money from me anymore .
And I think you ’ll be surprised .
I ’m not alone .

Graffiti ( or spray paint ) often regarded by others as unsightly damage or unwanted vandalism .
But some times , the boring wall is supplied with a true piece of graffiti art , making it a joy for the eyes .
A new game from Atari , Getting Up , is based on tagging .
I made a collection of pictures showing these fine spray paint creations .
By looking at them and studying the details , you could boost your ( Photoshop ) design inspiration .
If you 're not in to design , just sit back and enjoy this amazing form of art .
Please take note that I 'm not showing any graffiti tags or space spray paint in this article .
Those can be pretty inspiring too .
Beautiful graffiti art

So you 've rocked out at a summer 's worth of heavy metal music festivals , and now you want to know why you still hear feedback .
That ringing or buzzing in the ear is likely a symptom of hearing loss resulting from excessively loud noises .
But tinnitus ( the perception of a sound without external stimuli ) can also accompany infections , earwax buildups , vertigo , large doses of aspirin , and even a tumor on the acoustic nerve .
Of course , your phantom buzz might indicate nothing more than aging ears .
Experts are n't sure what physiological process creates the noise , only that it chimes in for a number of afflictions .
If you suffer chronic tinnitus , try not thinking about it !
Clinical observations suggest that simply focusing on unrelated thoughts can reduce activity in the auditory cortex and lessen the perceived loudness .

Did you know that there 90 million dogs registered as pets ?
That ’s close to 40 percent of all households in America .
Of these registered pet dogs , a significant percentage are large , extra large , and even XXL breed .
With all of these large dogs running around , you will naturally need to be sure that you have a safe place for your pet to call home .
If you own a big dog , you ’re going to need an oversized kennel .
It ’s no fun for your pet if you have to sequester them in a tiny little cage that they can’t even stand or lie down in .
It ’s a much better idea to get them a cage that is sized big enough to house them in a comfortable fashion .
It ’s also a great inspiration to find them a kennel that is strong enough to stand up to a good amount of wear and tear while you move .
For all of these reasons , I ’ve come to your aid .
I ’ve put together a list of large , extra large , and XXL dog crates that are guaranteed to meet all the needs of your favorite four legged friend .
My # 1 Recommended Large Dog Crate
As it turns out , my number one recommended large dog crate is the Midwest Life Stages model .
I came to this recommendation for a number of reasons .
Number one , it ’s built to last .
It wo n’t tear up easily during a move and it ’s too strong for your dog to chew up .
It ’s handy , portable , attractive to look at , and easy to monitor your dog in .
Finally , it ’s priced very reasonably once you consider all of the advantages that come with it .
For these reasons , it earns my highest recommendation .
Midwest Life Stages
Very easy to assemble in a very short amount of time
Made of extremely durable high gauge steel
Includes a removable floor grate to make cleaning easy
A pair of heavy duty side bolt latches keep the cage secure
The reason I picked the Midwest Life Stages as my favorite large dog crate is easy to see .
It includes all of the features listed above plus plenty more .
The main point of interest is its heavy duty gauge steel construction .
However , there are other advantages to take note of .
You should also be interested in the fact that this particular crate is the perfect choice for owners of big dogs .
Meanwhile , the removable floor grate ensures that you ’ll never have to worry about the crate getting too dirty for your dog to live comfortably in .
Runner Ups
While the Midwest Life Stages is most definitely my favorite dog kennel for large breeds , it ’s also important to note that there are some other models on the market .
These models may represent an even better fit for the needs of some buyers .
I ’m gracious enough to give plenty of space to these runner ups and their various features .
I believe that , once they have been given a fair hearing , you will be able to choose the model that is best for your own dog .
Let ’s look at these runner ups and their pros and cons .
Midwest Ultima Pro
You ’ll be interested to know that Midwest makes a large variety of crates besides the Life Stages .
For example , many people swear by the Ultima Pro .
This unique large dog crate does come with a wealth of features , such as the ability to be folded down into a convenient smaller size .
This model comes with a divider panel , removable plastic floor grate , and other features that may catch your eye .
Assembly can be finished in a short time .
Owners of larger dogs will also appreciate the fact that this particular model is definitely priced affordably .
Pros The Ultimata Pro is sized generously at 49L x 29.75W x 34.75H inches
At a weight of just under 57 pounds , it ’s not hard to move
It ’s made of extremely thick and durable wire gauge
It ’s easy to monitor your dog and feed them snacks through the double - latch entry point Cons
It ’s a bit pricier than some comparable large dog crate models
This crate does n’t come with caster wheels to roll it on to your car or moving van with
MidWest Homes for Pets XXL
The Midwest Homes for Pets XXL model is , in some ways , a better fit for a select group of large pet owners than my favorite choice , the Midwest Life Stages .
This is all the more true if your large pet happens to be a Great Dane .
If this is the case , then you ’re going to need an ultra - plus sized model like this one .
The Midwest Homes for Pets XXL model lives up to its name by being the ultimate crate for these breeds .
It ’s made of the usual high quality steel but comes with a few extra security features that are sure to make it attractive to owners of very large breeds .
It comes in a specially engineered double door configuration .
Both doors are held fast with 3 heavy duty secure slide - bolt latches .
These doors are further secured with a drop - pin assembly that is designed to keep them shut during the time the crate is in transit .
Pros Steel gauge with thick wire mesh construction
Generously sized at 54L x 37W x 45H inches
Includes the standard removable floor plate to make cleaning simple and easy
Fully ventilated to allow your dog plenty of air Cons
At a weight of 80.2 pounds , this model is a bit on the heavy side
Assembly takes a bit of time and effort , with at least 2 people required
Petmate ProValu
The Petmate ProValu is a great choice for large to XXL large breeds .
It ’s a good fit for German Shepherds , Siberian Huskies , and the like .
For this reason , some customers may prefer it to other crates that are better suited to extremely large breeds like the Great Dane .
However , this particular model can be purchased in a variety of sizes , giving it a versatility that some of the others on this list do not possess .
If you ’re looking for long time durability , the Petmate ProValu is a very worthy candidate .
Its e-coat finish is highly resistant to rust while its durable metal construction will keep it in good shape during even the most eventful move .
I should also let you know that it comes with a divider panel that you can use to store two pups at once should the need arise .
For these reasons , this is a very handy dog crate .
Pros Comes in a variety of sizes from extra small ( 19 X 12 X 14 ) to Extra Large ( 48 X 30 X 32 )
5 - point precision lock system keeps the crate secured in 5 different areas
Corners are rounded to prevent injuries to your dog
Comes with a standard removable plastic pan for quick cleaning Cons Available in a variety of sizes is a pro but also a con if you do n’t make sure that you are ordering the right size for your pet
Can be somewhat pricier than other comparable models
Amazon Basics
When it comes to finding a truly worthy large dog crate on a budget , you can always get a good deal from Amazon .
The AmazonBasics dog crate gives you a lot of crate for your money and is an excellent addition to the runner ups on this list .
It comes in several sizes so you will need to pay special attention to the dimensions when you order .
The AmazonBasics dog crate comes with a standard array of features that include a removable plastic floor pan for quick and simple cleaning .
It also includes a divider panel that allows you to store several puppies or change the dimensions to include different pets at different times .
Finally , the crate is priced extremely reasonably .
All of these features make the AmazonBasics a model well worth your attention .
“ The Trials of Henry Kissinger ” proposes that the former Secretary of State could be and perhaps should be tried as a war criminal .
Some of the specific accusations against Kissinger will likely be familiar to the viewer , particularly his role in the Nixon administration ’s bombing of Cambodia .
More interesting is the analysis of Kissinger ’s possible link to the overthrow of Chilean leader Allende and insertion of dictator Pinochet .
To attempt to provide documentation for these assertions , filmmaker Eugene Jarecki interviews numerous journalists and politicians , including Alexander Haig and William Safire .
In addition , abundant Kissinger memos from the Nixon administration , some only recently declassified , are dissected .
Much of this material is quite compelling ; however , the film never ultimately connects all the dots in a convincing manner .
Perhaps the major difficulty is the documentary ’s seeming inspiration - writings by Vanity Fair writer , Christopher Hitchens .
Viewers may recognize Hitchens as one of the talking heads who populate political shows .
Unfortunately , Hitchens is not known as being particularly even - handed , and the documentary presents material from him too early and prominently to be taken seriously .
In addition , the material on Chile is presented in the introduction as a key piece of evidence , but the full discussion of the Chile situation is shuffled to the end of the documentary and given relatively little time .
The net feeling is that the evidence for Kissinger ’s link to Chile is weak , which undermines the entire film .
Overall , this documentary is interesting and thought - provoking .
In particular , the delineation of the current world view regarding war criminals could provoke some debate .
However , the film ’s allegation that Kissinger is a war criminal is ultimately not established , at least in this viewer ’s mind .

Dec 1953 Church of Scientology , Church of American Science and Church of Spiritual Engineering incorporated in Elizabeth , New Jersey by L. Ron Hubbard .
Co-signatories were Mary Sue Hubbard , L. Ron Hubbard Jr. and Henrietta Hubbard .
2 Jan 1957 The Internal Revenue Service grants a tax exemption to the Church of Scientology of California ( CSC ) .
18 July 1967 The Internal Revenue Service revokes CSC 's tax - exempt status , citing three reasons :
Scientology practitioners are profiting from the " non-profit " Church ;
The Church 's activities are commercial ;
The Church is serving the private interests of L. Ron Hubbard ( a practice known as inurement ) .
Scientology denounces the revocation , declares its intention to ignore the decision and withholds payment of taxes for the next 26 years .
Ref : Church of Scientology of California vs IRS , 24 Sept 1984 judgement
20 April 1973 L. Ron Hubbard devises the Snow White Program for Scientology 's intelligence agency , the Guardian 's Office ( GO ) , in an effort to root out and remove " false files " about the Church and Hubbard held by governments around the world .
This becomes a sophisticated worldwide espionage operation targetting 17 governments and three international organisations .

The agent is to obtain employment with the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of taking from that agency all documents which dealt with Scientology , including those concerning pending litigation initiated by Scientology against the United States Government .
A number of Scientologists are interviewed as prospective agents .
However , none are found to be suitable .

May 1975 " Project Horn " is devised by Greg Willardson ( Deputy Deputy Guardian for Information ) and the order to implement it given to Meisner .
Its aim is to " provide a cover for PR [ Public Relations ] and legal for the way they obtained IRS docs . "
This project further implements Guardian Order 1361 , Target 6 , which already provides for the creation or a " suitable cover " to disguise the true manner in which stolen documents have been obtained from the IRS so that the Public Relations Bureau can use them without fear of being connected to the thefts .
Meisner is ordered to steal documents concerning organizations other than Scientology .
Thus , whenever any stolen IRS documents are later released , those other organizations will also be perceived as having received them and their publication will not point to the Church of Scientology alone .
Additionally , the project orders the theft of IRS stationery so it might be used by the GO to draft false letters from a fictitious IRS employee disgruntled with the organization .
Wolfe is tasked with the actual thefts and accomplishes them successfully .

The GO gets wind of a major financial audit to be made by the IRS of the Church of Scientology of California .
Accordingly , the GO decides to obtain as much inside information as possible on the IRS ' " line of attack " .
Meisner devises " Project Beetle Cleanup " for obtaining " all DC IRS files on LRH , Scientology , etc. , in the Intelligence section , OIO [ Office or International Operations ] , and SSS [ Special Services Staff ] " .
The project proposes the placement of " FSMs " ( Field Staff members , or agents ) in the " required areas or good access developed " , and further that " Pitts " ( the code name for Nancy Douglass - a GO agent who had infiltrated the Drug Enforcement Agency ) and " Silver " ( Wolfe ) attempt to obtain employment at the Internal Revenue Service Intelligence Division and Office of International Operations respectively .

The Church 's new intelligence agency , the Office of Special Affairs ( which superceded the discredited Guardian 's Office ) , strikes back at the IRS with the creation of a front group - " The National Coalition of I.R.S. Whistle - blowers " .
According to ex-OSA member Stacy Young , Scientology 's aim was to undermine the agency 's credibility .
The group 's president , Paul J. DesFosses , says Scientology provided substantial financing , but denies that the church ran the group , which helped fuel Congressional hearings in 1989 into accusations of corruption at the I.R.S. Kendrick L. Moxon , a longtime church lawyer , acknowledges that the coalition was founded by Freedom Magazine .

The halibut has always been a popular fish in Norway .
We know that man has fished halibut since the stone age .
Illustrations of halibuts were engraved into stone by proud fishermen .
The big halibut was a fish surrounded by mystery and superstition .
In those days it is likely to believe that the halibut was caught by using harpoons .
They may also had used hooks made of bone .
Except from the spawning period , big halibuts can bee found in shallow waters .
A big halibut gives the fisherman an unforgettable fight and one fish is enough to feed several families .
Fishermen used hooks ( on lines and long lines ) and harpoons for hundreds of years , but in the 1930 ’s a new fishing gear was introduced to the fishermen in the northern part of Norway .
In 1936 the first Norwegian halibut - nets were made .
The Norwegian government paid the costs for making and trying out ten nets .
The nets were set on deep water in Lofoten and the result was outstanding .
During the autumt the same year 60 vessels participated in this fishery .
The catches were very good , but by the end of the year the halibut “ disappeared ” from the fishing ground .
The fishermen moved their nets to other fishing grounds .
It was a success .
Equipped with their new nets , the fishermen set their gear on every known spawning ground .
The increase in the catches were unbelievable .
Using nets for one month gave a better result than fishing with long lines for a whole year .
Nothing lasts forever , and the adventure in the north lasted only for a few months .
The halibuts were gone .
Where did they go ?
The halibuts had not gone anywhere – the fishermen had taken them all .
Norwegian scientists and the government responded quickly .
In 1937 a minimum size limit was introduced and it was not allowed to fish with nets in the spawning period .
The catches in 1937 were depressing .
The number of halibuts entering the spawning grounds were low .
The grown halibuts – seeking the limited spawning grounds by instinct – had been an easy prey for the fishermen .
Some fishing grounds were “ dead ” .
In other spawning areas only a few halibuts spawned .
A halibut is about 10 years old the first time it spawns .
You do n’t have to be a scientist to figure out that it took decades to rebuild the stocks .
Even today , 70 years later , the stocks – both in the north and especially in the south of Norway – are too small .
Some halibuts in the south is caught to be tagged .
Every year the scientists learn more about the halibut .
Knowledge is essential to make us understand the halibut and how the stock respond to the pressure from fishing and changes in its environment .

Lost is an awesome show .
But every now & then I wonder just what the writers were thinking …
10 . Nikki & Paulo
Yes , they were by far the two most annoying characters in television history .
I ’m glad to see them gone .
But , with Patchy resurrecting all the time , Locke cured of paralysis , Rose cured of cancer , and Christian Shepherd sitting around in Jacob ’s cabin …
Might we see Nikki and Paulo again too ?
Say it is n’t so !
I for one am hoping the immortality theory is not true .
9. Libby ’s Death
Guess I ’ll never know why she was stalking Hurley at the mental institution .
Great way too create a really compelling mystery and then destroy it .
8. Eko ’s “ Smoky ” Encounter
This left something to be desired .
Sure , the morphing of Eko ’s brother into Smoky was really cool and helped us realize many of the Losties ’ hallucinations were actually Smoky appearances .
But the next scenes where Smoky was tossing Eko around like a ragdoll were unfulfilling , to say the least .
Sometimes Smoky looks and acts way too much like the water creature on “ The Abyss ” to be taken seriously .
7. Hurley ’s Diet
Hurley would n’t be the same – or as much fun – if he were skinny .
But Hurley really should be losing some weight on the island .
He was sneaking Dharma food for awhile , but is n’t that long over ?
6. Fake Smoky Appearance
Big goof .
Lost viewers everywhere discovered that in the pilot episode , a “ smoke monster ” was seen hitting the airplane turbine shortly before it exploded .
Much speculation ensued about this find .
Sadly , the producers later confirmed it was a CGI effect left in the show in error .
You can see it here :
5. Charlie : Death by Stupid
Charlie ’s death was sad .
But the saddest part was that it did n’t have to happen .
He could have run to the other side of the door and shut it .
There was plenty of time .
4. The Lost Experience
OK , a lot of people will disagree with me on this .
Sure , The Lost Experience kept us entertained one summer .
But the revelations ended up being very out of place .
The solution it offered to Hurley ’s numbers was unsatisfying and has never been mentioned on the actual show .
Does anyone still believe that was really the answer ?
3. Locke ’s Bizarre Trust of Ben
Seriously Locke , grow a brain !
Ben shot him and left him for dead in a mass grave .
Ben admitted to gassing all those Dharma people and thus committing mass murder .
He ’s insane .
Yet Locke continues to release him and actually believe him .
Utter stupidity .
Why does Locke insist on trusting liars ?
2. Lack of Curiosity Killed the Cat
How many times have we yelled at our TV screens because Locke did n’t follow up on a mystery when he was with an “ other ” or Jack seemed to care more about Kate and Sawyer than the smoke monster that was killing people ?
There were plenty of times the Losties did n’t share vital information with one another or “ forgot ” to ask Danielle or an Other about a question that was bugging all of us .
Sure , Locke finally asked Ben what the smoke monster was .
And Ben said he had no idea .
But really Locke , of all the people you could ask , you choose Ben ?

It ’s my new blog ( although I ’ll still update this one from time to time ) .
Rather than improving motorist safety , red - light cameras significantly increase crashes and are a ticket to higher auto insurance premiums , researchers at the University of South Florida College of Public Health conclude .
The effective remedy to red - light running uses engineering solutions to improve intersection safety , which is particularly important to Florida ’s elderly drivers , the researchers recommend .
The report was published this month in the Florida Public Health Review , the online journal of the college and the Florida Public Health Association .
“ The rigorous studies clearly show red - light cameras do n’t work , ” said lead author Barbara Langland - Orban , professor and chair of health policy and management at the USF College of Public Health .
“ Instead , they increase crashes and injuries as drivers attempt to abruptly stop at camera intersections .
If used in Florida , cameras could potentially create even worse outcomes due to the state ’s high percent of elderly who are more likely to be injured or killed when a crash occurs . ”
Red - light cameras photograph violators who are then sent tickets in the mail .
Hillsborough County Commissioners unanimously agreed earlier this month to install the cameras at several major intersections in the county .
The devices could be adopted by more cities and counties if Florida legislators pave the way by changing a state law this spring .
The USF report highlights trends in red - light running in Florida , summarizes major studies , and analyzes the automobile insurance industry ’s financial interest in cameras .
Among the findings :
-- Traffic fatalities caused by red - light running are not increasing in Florida and account for less than 4 percent of the state ’s yearly traffic deaths .
In contrast , more than 22 percent of the state ’s traffic fatalities occur at intersections for reasons other than red - light running .
--
The injury rate from red - light running crashes has dropped by a third in less than a decade , indicating red - light running crashes have been continually declining in Florida without the use of cameras .
-- Comprehensive studies from North Carolina , Virginia , and Ontario have all reported cameras are significantly associated with increases in crashes , as well as crashes involving injuries .
The study by the Virginia Transportation Research Council also found that cameras were linked to increased crash costs .
-- Some studies that conclude cameras reduced crashes or injuries contained major “ research design flaws , ” such as incomplete data or inadequate analyses , and were conducted by researchers with links to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
The IIHS , funded by automobile insurance companies , is the leading advocate for red - light cameras .
Insurers can profit from red - light cameras , since their revenues will increase when higher premiums are charged due to the crash and citation increase , the researchers say .
Langland - Orban said the findings have been known for some time .
She cites a 2001 paper by the Office of the Majority Leader , U.S. House of Representatives , reporting that red - light cameras are “ a hidden tax levied on motorists . ”
The report concluded cameras are associated with increased crashes , the timings at yellow lights are often set too short to increase tickets for red - light running , and most research concluding cameras are effective was conducted by one researcher from the IIHS .
Since then , studies independent of the automobile insurance industry continue to find cameras are associated with large increases in crashes .
Red - light running can be reduced by engineering improvements that address factors such as signal visibility and timings , wet roads and traffic flow , the USF researchers say .
The researchers suggest local governments follow the state ’s lead in designing roads and improving intersections to accommodate elderly drivers , which would ultimately benefit all drivers .

So I ’m doing a Google search for “ John McCain ” last night and the first link I see is his campaign Web site .
I click and land on a page where there ’s a rather prominent YouTube video of Bill Clinton .
Bill Clinton ?
I figure it must be a pretty damning video , more Clinton bashing from the right , etc .
In fact , it ’s a very nice video of our former president saying all sorts of kind words about John McCain :
Is n’t that special .
So I go back to Google to double check the link and what do I find ?
It ’s not a Google link at all .
It ’s a Web ad on Google for the McCain campaign :
Now , I suppose it ’s possible that someone else is buying Web ads in order to promote Bill Clinton ’s kind words for McCain .
But there ’s no getting around the fact that it ’s McCain ’s own campaign
Web site that ’s using a big ole video of Bill Clinton , complimenting John McCain , as a way of drumming up votes for old John .
And I ’ve got to imagine that McCain is n’t using Bill Clinton ’s praise to attract conservative votes – they hate Bill Clinton .
He ’s doing it to win independents .
It was only a matter of time before John McCain moved to the middle and abandoned conservatives , again .
But I did n’t think he was going to do it before he even had the primary sewn up .
And I sure never imagined he ’d use Bill Clinton ’s praise as a badge of honor .
The conservatives are gonna go nuts .
Although indeterminate sentencing had many flaws , one of its virtues was that it gave the state a means of controlling the size of the prison population .
If prisons grew too full , the parole board could release inmates who no longer seemed to pose a threat to public safety .
Governor Reagan used the Adult Authority to reduce the size of California 's inmate population , giving thousands of prisoners an early release and closing one of the state 's prisons .
By the mid-1970s , however , the Adult Authority had come under attack from an unusual coalition of liberals , prisoners , and conservative advocates of law and order .
Liberals thought that the Adult Authority discriminated against minorities , making them serve longer sentences .
Prisoners thought that it was unfair ; after all , they were still in prison .
Conservatives thought that it was too soft , allowing too many criminals back on the street too soon .
And no one put much faith in the rehabilitative effects of prison .
In 1971 seventeen inmates and seven staff members were killed in California prisons .
The following year thirty - five inmates and one staff member were killed .
California was one of the first states in the nation to get rid of indeterminate sentencing .
The state 's new law required inmates to serve the sentence handed down by the judge , with an allowance for " good time , " which might reduce a prison term by half .
The law also amended the section of the state 's penal code that declared the ultimate goals of imprisonment : the word " rehabilitation " was replaced by the word " punishment . "
In 1976 the bill was endorsed and signed into law by a liberal Democrat , Governor Jerry Brown .
As liberalism gave way to demands for law and order , California judges began to send a larger proportion of convicted felons to prison and to give longer sentences .
The inmate population started to grow .
Sentencing decisions made at the county level , by local prosecutors and judges , soon had a major impact on the state budget , which covered the costs of incarceration .
Tax cuts mandated by Proposition 13 meant that county governments were strapped for funds and could not maintain local jails properly or pay for community - based programs that administered alternative sentences .
Offenders who might once have been sent to a local jail or a halfway house were now sent to a state prison .
California 's criminal - justice system slowly but surely spun out of control .
The state legislature passed hundreds of bills that required tough new sentences , but did not adequately provide for their funding .
Judges sent people to prison without giving any thought to where the state would house them .
And the Department of Corrections was left to handle the flood of new inmates , unable to choose how many it would accept or how many it would let go .
In 1977 the inmate population of California was 19,600 .
Today it is 159,000 .
After spending $ 5.2 billion on prison construction over the past fifteen years , California now has not only the largest but also the most overcrowded prison system in the United States .
The state Department of Corrections estimates that it will need to spend an additional $ 6.1 billion on prisons over the next decade just to maintain the current level of overcrowding .
And the state 's jails are even more overcrowded than its prisons .
In 1996 more than 325,000 inmates were released early from California jails in order to make room for offenders arrested for more - serious crimes .
According to a report this year by the state 's Little Hoover Commission , in many counties offenders who are convicted of a crime and given sentences of less than ninety days will not even be sent to jail .
The state 's backlog of arrest warrants now stands at about 2.6 million — the number of arrests that have not been made , the report says , largely because there 's no room in the jails .
According to one official estimate , counties will need to spend $ 2.4 billion over the next ten years to build more jails — again , simply to maintain the current level of overcrowding .
The extraordinary demand for new prison and jail cells in California has diverted funds from other segments of the criminal - justice system , creating a vicious circle .
The failure to spend enough on relatively inexpensive sanctions , such as drug treatment and probation , has forced the state to increase spending on prisons .
Only a fifth of the felony convictions in California now lead to a prison sentence .
The remaining four fifths are usually punished with a jail sentence , a term of probation , or both .
But the jails have no room , and the huge caseloads maintained by most probation officers often render probation meaningless .
An ideal caseload is about twenty - five to fifty offenders ; some probation officers in California today have a caseload of 3,000 offenders .
More than half the state 's offenders on probation will most likely serve their entire term without ever meeting or even speaking with a probation officer .
Indeed , the only obligation many offenders on probation must now fulfill is mailing a postcard that gives their home address .
California parole officers , too , are overwhelmed by their caseloads .
The state 's inmate population is not only enormous but constantly changing .
Last year California sent about 140,000 people to prison — and released about 132,000 .
On average , inmates spend two and a half years behind bars , and then serve a term of one to three years on parole .
During the 1970s each parole agent handled about forty - five parolees ; today each agent handles about twice that number .
The money that the state has saved by not hiring enough new parole agents is insignificant compared with the expense of sending parole violators back to prison .
About half the California prisoners released on parole are illiterate .
About 85 percent are substance abusers .
Under the terms of their parole , they are subjected to periodic drug tests .
But they are rarely offered any opportunity to get drug treatment .
Of the approximately 130,000 substance abusers in California 's prisons , only 3,000 are receiving treatment behind bars .
Only 8,000 are enrolled in any kind of pre-release program to help them cope with life on the outside .
Violent offenders , who need such programs most of all , are usually ineligible for them .
Roughly 124,000 inmates are simply released from prison each year in California , given nothing more than $ 200 and a bus ticket back to the county where they were convicted .
At least 1,200 inmates every year go from a secure housing unit at a Level 4 prison — an isolation unit , designed to hold the most violent and dangerous inmates in the system — right onto the street .
One day these predatory inmates are locked in their cells for twenty - three hours at a time and fed all their meals through a slot in the door , and the next day they 're out of prison , riding a bus home .
Almost two thirds of the people sent to prison in California last year were parole violators .
Of the roughly 80,000 parole violators returned to prison , about 60,000 had committed a technical violation , such as failing a drug test ; about 15,000 had committed a property or a drug crime ; and about 3,000 had committed a violent crime , frequently a robbery to buy drugs .
The gigantic prison system that California has built at such great expense has essentially become a revolving door for poor , highly dysfunctional , and often illiterate drug abusers .
They go in , they get out , they get sent back , and every year there are more .
The typical offender being sent to prison in California today has five prior felony convictions .
The California legislature has not authorized a new bond issue for prison construction since 1992 , deadlocked over the cost .
Meanwhile , the state 's " Three Strikes , You 're Out " law has been steadily filling prison cells with long - term inmates .
Don Novey , the head of the California Correctional Peace Officers Association ( CCPOA ) , helped to gain passage of the law .
He now worries that if California 's prison system becomes much more overcrowded , a federal judge may order a large - scale release of inmates .
Novey has proposed keeping some nonviolent offenders out of prison , allowing judges to give them suspended sentences and a term of probation instead .
He has also advocated a way to save money while expanding the penal system : build " mega- prisons . "
California already builds and operates the biggest prisons in the United States .
A number of California prisons now hold more than 6,000 inmates — about sixtimes the nationwide average .
The mega-prisons proposed by the CCPOA would house up to 20,000 inmates .
A few new mega- prisons , Novey says , could satisfy California 's demand for new cells into the next century .
Correctional officials see prison overcrowding as grounds for worry about potential riots , bloodshed , and court orders ; others see opportunity .
" It has become clear over the past several months , " Doctor R. Crants said earlier this year , " that California is one of the most promising markets CCA has , with a burgeoning need for secure , cost - effective prison beds at all levels of government . "
In order to get a foothold in that market , CCA announced it would build three prisons in California entirely on spec — that is , without any contract to fill them .
" If you build it in the right place , " a CCA executive told The Wall Street Journal , " the prisoners will come . "
Crants boasted to the Tennessean that California 's private - prison industry will be dominated by " CCA alone . "
Executives at Wackenhut Corrections think otherwise .
Wackenhut already houses almost 2,000 of California 's minimum - security inmates at facilities in the state .
The legislature has recently adopted plans to house an additional 2,000 minimum - security inmates in private prisons .
Wackenhut and CCA have opened offices in Sacramento and hired expensive lobbyists .
The CCPOA vows to fight hard against the private - prison companies and their anti-union tactics .
" They can build whatever prisons they want , " Don Novey says .
" But the hell if they 're going to run them . "
One of the new CCA prisons is rising in the Mojave Desert outside California City , at a cost of about $ 100 million .
The company is gambling that cheap , empty prison beds will prove irresistible to California lawmakers .
The new CCA facility promises to be a boon to California City once the inmates start arriving .
The town has been hit hard by layoffs at Edwards Air Force Base , which is nearby .
Mayor Larry Adams , asked why he wanted a prison , said , " We 're a desperate city . "
Alexis de Tocqueville 's Democracy in America is one of the most famous books ever written about the politics and culture of the United States .
The original purpose of Tocqueville 's 1831 journey to this country is less well known .
He came to tour its prisons on behalf of the French government .
The United States at the time was renowned in Europe for having created a whole new social institution : the penitentiary .
In New York and Pennsylvania prisons were being designed not to punish inmates but to reform them .
Solitary confinement , silence , and hard work were imposed in order to encourage spiritual and moral change .
At some penitentiaries officials placed hoods over the heads of newcomers to isolate them from other inmates .
After visiting American prisons Tocqueville and his traveling companion , Gustave de Beaumont , wrote that social reformers in the United States had been swept up in " the monomania of the penitentiary system , " convinced that prisons were " a remedy for all the evils of society . "
The historian David J. Rothman , author of The Discovery of the Asylum ( 1971 ) , has noted one of the ironies of America 's early - nineteenth - century fondness for prisons .
The idea of the penitentiary took hold at the height of Jacksonian democracy , when freedom and the spirit of the common man were being widely celebrated .
" At the very moment that Americans began to pride themselves on the openness of their society , when the boundless frontier became the symbol of opportunity and equality , " Rothman observes , " notions of total isolation , unquestioned obedience , and severe discipline became the hallmarks of the captive society . "
More than a century and a half later political rhetoric about small government and the virtues of the free market is being accompanied by an eagerness to deny others their freedom .
The hoods now placed on inmates in the isolation units at maximum - security prisons are not intended to rehabilitate .
They are designed to protect correctional officers from being bitten or spat upon .
The standard justification for today 's prisons is that they prevent crime .
The rate of violent crime in the United States has indeed been declining since 1991 .
The political scientist James Q. Wilson , among many others , believes that the recent rise in the nation 's incarceration rate has been directly responsible for the decrease in violent crime .
Although the validity of the theory seems obvious ( murderers and rapists who are behind bars can no longer kill and rape ordinary citizens ) , it is difficult to prove .
Michael Tonry , a professor of law and public policy at the University of Minnesota , is an expert on international sentencing policies and an advocate of alternative punishments for nonviolent offenders .
He acknowledges that the imprisonment of almost two million Americans has prevented some crimes from being committed .
" You could choose another two million Americans at random and lock them up , " Tonry says , " and that would reduce the number of crimes too . "
But demographics and larger cultural trends may be responsible for most of the decline in violent crime .
Over the past decade Canada 's incarceration rate has risen only slightly .
Nevertheless , the rate of violent crime in Canada has been falling since 1991 .
Last year the homicide rate fell by nine percent .
The Canadian murder rate has now reached its lowest level since 1969 .
Christopher Stone , the head of New York 's Vera Institute of Justice , believes that prisons can be " factories for crime . "
The average inmate in the United States spends only two years in prison .
What happens during that time behind bars may affect how he or she will behave upon release .
The lesson being taught in most American prisons — where violence , extortion , and rape have long been routine — is that the strong will always rule the weak .
Inmates who display the slightest hint of vulnerability quickly become prey .
During the 1950s and 1960s prison gangs were formed in California and Illinois as a means of self - protection .
Those gangs have now spread nationwide .
The Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood have gained power in Texas prisons .
The Gangsta Killer Bloods and the Sex Money Murder Bloods have emerged in New York prisons .
America 's prisons now serve as networking and recruiting centers for gang members .
The differences between street gangs and prison gangs have become less distinct .
The leaders of prison gangs increasingly direct illegal activity both inside and outside .
A 1996 investigation by the Chicago Tribune found that gangs had gained extraordinary control over the state prisons in Illinois : formal classes at the Stateville prison law library had taught the history and rules of the Maniac Latin Disciples ; a leader of the Gangster Disciples had at various times kept cellular phones , a color television , a stereo , a Nintendo Game Boy , a portable washing machine , and up to a hundred pounds of marijuana in his cell .
Many of the customs , slang , and tattoos long associated with prison gangs have become fashionable among young people .
In cities throughout America , the culture of the prisons is rapidly becoming the culture of the streets .
The spirit of every age is manifest in its public works , in the great construction projects that leave an enduring mark on the landscape .
During the early years of this century the Panama Canal became President Theodore Roosevelt 's legacy , a physical expression of his imperial yearnings .
The New Deal faith in government activism left behind huge dams and bridges , post offices decorated with murals , power lines that finally brought electricity to rural America .
The interstate highway system fulfilled dreams of the Eisenhower era , spreading suburbia far and wide ; urban housing projects for the poor were later built in the hopes of creating a Great Society .
" The era of big government is over , " President Bill Clinton declared in 1996 — an assertion that has proved false in at least one respect .
A recent issue of " Construction Report , " a monthly newsletter published by Correctional Building News , provides details of the nation 's latest public works : a 3,100 - bed jail in Harris County , Texas ; a 500 - bed medium - security prison in Redgranite , Wisconsin ; a 130 - bed minimum - security facility in Oakland County , Michigan ; two 200 - bed housing pods at the Fort Dodge Correctional Facility , in Iowa ; a 350 - bed juvenile correctional facility in Pendleton , Indiana ; and dozens more .
The newsletter includes the telephone numbers of project managers , so that prison - supply companies can call and make bids .
All across the country new cellblocks rise .
And every one of them , every brand - new prison , becomes another lasting monument , concrete and ringed with deadly razor wire , to the fear and greed and political cowardice that now pervade American society .

BUSH’S BAILOUT PLAN ….
From today ’s LA Times story about George Bush ’s new plan to deal with the subprime mortgage mess :
Seeking to gird the nation ’s economy against a potential tidal wave of foreclosures , the Bush administration will release a plan today that is expected to block many mortgages from adjusting to higher rates for as long as five years .
Administration officials acknowledged privately Wednesday that the plan was likely to face objections from low - income borrowers who wo n’t be helped … .
Bush ’s plan wo n’t help low - income borrowers ?
That ’s a shocker , is n’t it ?
Atrios provides some more detail on what the requirements are to qualify for Bush ’s plan , and the two key ones that will exclude most low - income borrowers are :
Must not have missed a payment
Must own a home worth more than their mortgage
The lower your income , the more likely you are to have missed a payment already , and the lower your income the more likely you are to have been sold a no - down loan that ’s already left you underwater due to falling housing prices .
Net result : no help for low - income folks .
Like Atrios , I ’ve become increasingly unsure that any kind of broad - based bailout plan can work — or work well , in any case — but if you ’re going to do it everyone ought to have a shot at getting help .
Bush ’s plan , conversely , pretty transparently does n’t care about anyone with a modest income .
Not part of his base , I guess .

This rant was written because a nice girl finally snapped .
I 've read the tribute to the nice guys ; this is my response .
This is my tribute to the nice girls .
To the nice girls who are overlooked , who become friends and nothing more , who spend hours fixating upon their looks and their personalities and their actions because it must be they that are doing something wrong .
This is for the girls who do n't give it up on the first date , who do n't want to play mind games , who provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they 've heard a thousand times .
This is for the girls who understand that they are n't perfect and that the guys they 're interested in are n't either , for the girls who flirt and laugh and worry and obsess over the slightest glance , whisper , touch , because somehow they are able to keep alive that hope that maybe ... maybe this time he 'll have understood .
This is an homage to the girls who laugh loud and often , who are comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots , who care more than they should for guys who do n't deserve their attention .
This is for those girls who have been in the trenches , who have watched other girls time and time again fake up and make up and fuck up the guys in their lives without saying a word .
This is for the girls who have been there from the beginning and have heard the trite words of advice , from " there are plenty of fish in the sea , " to " time heals all wounds . "
This is to honor those girls who know that guys are just as scared as they are , who know that they deserve better , who are seeking to find it .
This is for the girls who have never been in love , but know that it's an experience that they do n't want to miss out on .
For the girls who have sought a night with friends and been greeted by a night of catcalling , rude comments and explicit invitations that they 'd rather not have experienced .
This is for the girls who have spent their weekends sitting on the sidelines of a beer pong tournament or a case race , or playing Florence Nightingale for a vomiting guy friend or a comatose crush , who have received a drunk phone call just before dawn from someone who does n't care enough to invite them over but is still willing to pass out in their bed .
This is for the girls who have left sad song lyrics in their away messages , who have tried to make someone understand through a subliminally appealing profile , who have time and time again dropped their male friend hint after hint after hint only to watch him chase after the first blonde girl in a skirt .
This is for the girls who have been told that they 're too good or too smart or too pretty , who have been given compliments as a way of breaking off a relationship , who have ever been told they are only wanted as a friend .
This one 's for the girls who you can take home to mom , but wo n't because it 's easier to sleep with a whore than foster a relationship ; this is for the girls who have been led on by words and kisses and touches , all of which were either only true for the moment , or never real to begin with .
This is for the girls who have allowed a guy into their head and heart and bed , only to discover that he 's just not ready , he 's just not over her , he 's just not looking to be tied down ; this is for the girls who believe the excuses because it 's easier to believe that it's not that they do n't want you , it 's that they do n't want anyone .
This is for the girls who have had their hearts broken and their hopes dashed by someone too cavalier to have cared in the first place ; this is for the nights spent dissecting every word and syllable and inflection in his speech , for the nights when you 've returned home alone , for the nights when you 've seen from across the room him leaning a little too close , or standing a little too near , or talking a little too softly for the girl he 's with to be a random hookup .
This is for the girls who have endured party after party in his presence , finally having realized that it was n't that he did n't want a relationship : it was that he did n't want you .
I honor you for the night his dog died or his grandmother died or his little brother crashed his car and you held him , thinking that if you only comforted him just right , or said the right words , or rubbed his back in the right way then perhaps he'd realize what it was that he already had .
This is for the night you realized that it would never happen , and the sunrise you saw the next morning after failing to sleep .
This is for the " I really like you , so let 's still be friends " comment after you read more into a situation than he ever intended ; this is for never realizing that when you choose friends , you seldom choose those which make you cry yourself to sleep .
This is for the hugs you 've received from your female friends , for the nights they 've reassured you that you are beautiful and intelligent and amazing and loyal and truly worthy of a great guy ; this is for the despair you all felt as you sat in the aftermath of your tears , knowing that that night the only companionship you 'd have was with a pillow and your teddy bear .
This is for the girls who have been used and abused , who have endured what he was giving because at least he was giving something ; this is for the stupidity of the nights we 've believed that something was better than nothing , though his something was nothing we'd have ever wanted .
This is for the girls who have been satisified with too little and who have learned never to expect anything more : for the girls who do n't think that they deserve more , because they 've been conditioned for so long to accept the scraps thrown to them by guys .
This is what I do n't understand .
Men sit and question and whine that girls are only attracted to the mean guys , the guys who berate them and belittle them and do n't appreciate them and do n't want them ; who use them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest will be made .
Men complain that they never meet nice girls , girls who are genuinely interested and compelling , who are intelligent and sweet and smart and beautiful ; men despair that no good women want to share in their lives , that girls play mindgames , that girls love to keep them hanging .
Yet , men , I ask you : were you to meet one of these genuinely interested , thrillingly compelling , interesting and intelligent and sweet and beautiful and smart girls , were you to give her your number and wait for her to call ... and if you were to receive a call from her the next day and she , in her truthful , loyal , intelligent and straightforward nice girl fashion , were to tell you that she finds you intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend , would you or would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the " stalker chick " you 'd met the night prior , who called you and wore her heart on her sleeve and told the truth ?
And would you , or would you not , refuse to make plans with her , speak with her , see her again , and once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once more for this " nice girl " who you just cannot seem to find ?
Because therein lies the truth , guys : we nice girls are everywhere .
But you 're not looking for a nice girl .
You 're not looking for someone genuinely interested in your intermural basketball game , or your anatomy midterm grade , or that argument you keep having with your father ; you 're looking for a quick fix , a night when you can pretend to have a connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the condom you were using during it .
So do n't say you 're on the lookout for nice girls , guys , when you pass us up on every step you take .
Sometimes we go undercover ; sometimes we go in disguise : sometimes when that girl in the low cut shirt or the too tight miniskirt wo n't answer your catcalls , sometimes you 're looking at a nice girl in whore 's clothing - - we might say we like the attention , we might blush and giggle and turn back to our friends , but we 're all thinking the same thing : " This is n't me .
Tomorrow morning , I 'll be wearing a teeshirt and flannel shorts , I 'll have slept alone and I 'll be making my hungover best friend breakfast .
See through the disguise .
See me . "
You never do .
Why ?
Because you only see the exterior , you only see the slutty girl who welcomes those advances .
You do n't want the nice girl .. so do n't say you 're looking for a relationship : relationships take time and energy and intent , three things we 're willing to extend - - but in return , we 're looking for compassion and loyalty and trust , three things you never seem willing to express .
Maybe nice guys finish last , but in the race they 're running they 're chasing after the whores and the sluts and the easy - targets ... the nice girls are waiting at the finish line with water and towels and a congradulatory hug ( and yes , if she 's a nice girl and she likes you , the sweatiness probably wo n't matter ) , hoping against hope that maybe you 'll realize that they 're the ones that you want at the end of that silly race .
So maybe it wo n't last forever .
Maybe some of those guys in that race will turn in their running shoes and make their way to the concession stand where we 're waiting ; however , until that happens , we still have each other , that silly race to watch , and all the chocolate we can eat ( because what 's a concession stand at a race without some chocolate ? )
Sometimes the nice girl gets sick of waiting

Foreword
This installment has been updated from the original 2004 version to incorporate additional research on earlier changes to the CPI .
The source for most of the information in this installment is the Bureau of Labor Statistics , which generally has been very open about its methodologies and changes to same .
The BLS Web site : www.bls.gov contains descriptions of the CPI and its related methodologies .
Other sources include my own analyses of the CPI data and methodological changes over the last 30 years as well as interviews with individuals involved in inflation reporting .
______
Payments to Social Security Recipients Should be Double Current Levels
Inflation , as reported by the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) is understated by roughly 7 % per year .
This is due to recent redefinitions of the series as well as to flawed methodologies , particularly adjustments to price measures for quality changes .
The concentration of this installment on the quality of government economic reports will be first on CPI series redefinition and the damages done to those dependent on accurate cost - of - living estimates , and on pending further redefinition and economic damage .
The CPI was designed to help businesses , individuals and the government adjust their financial planning and considerations for the impact of inflation .
The CPI worked reasonably well for those purposes into the early - 1980s .
In recent decades , however , the reporting system increasingly succumbed to pressures from miscreant politicians , who were and are intent upon stealing income from social security recipients , without ever taking the issue of reduced entitlement payments before the public or Congress for approval .
In particular , changes made in CPI methodology during the Clinton Administration understated inflation significantly , and , through a cumulative effect with earlier changes that began in the late - Carter and early Reagan Administrations have reduced current social security payments by roughly half from where they would have been otherwise .
That means Social Security checks today would be about double had the various changes not been made .
In like manner , anyone involved in commerce , who relies on receiving payments adjusted for the CPI , has been similarly damaged .
On the other side , if you are making payments based on the CPI ( i.e. , the federal government ) , you are making out like a bandit .
In the original version of this background article , I noted that Social Security payments should be 43 % higher , but that was back in September 2004 and only adjusted for CPI changes that took place after 1993 .
The current estimate adjusts for methodology gimmicks introduced since 1980 .
Elements of the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) had their roots in the mid-1880s , when the Bureau of Labor , later known as the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) , was asked by Congress to measure the impact of new tariffs on prices .
It was another three decades , however , before price indices would be combined into something resembling today ’s CPI , a measure used then for setting wage increases for World War I shipbuilders .
Although published regularly since 1921 , the CPI did not come into broad acceptance and use until after World War II , when it was included in auto union contracts as a cost - of - living adjustment for wages .
The CPI found its way not only into other union agreements , but also into most commercial contracts that required consideration of cost / price changes or inflation .
The CPI also was used to adjust Social Security payments annually for changes in the cost of living , and therein lay the eventual downfall to the credibility of CPI reporting .
Let Them Eat Hamburger
In the early 1990s , press reports began surfacing as to how the CPI really was significantly overstating inflation .
If only the CPI inflation rate could be reduced , it was argued , then entitlements , such as social security , would not increase as much each year , and that would help to bring the budget deficit under control .
Behind this movement were financial luminaries Michael Boskin , then chief economist to the first Bush Administration , and Alan Greenspan , Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
Although the ensuing political furor killed consideration of Congressionally mandated changes in the CPI , the BLS quietly stepped forward and began changing the system , anyway , early in the Clinton Administration .
Up until the Boskin / Greenspan agendum surfaced , the CPI was measured using the costs of a fixed basket of goods , a fairly simple and straightforward concept .
The identical basket of goods would be priced at prevailing market costs for each period , and the period - to - period change in the cost of that market basket represented the rate of inflation in terms of maintaining a constant standard of living .
The Boskin / Greenspan argument was that when steak got too expensive , the consumer would substitute hamburger for the steak , and that the inflation measure should reflect the costs tied to buying hamburger versus steak , instead of steak versus steak .
Of course , replacing hamburger for steak in the calculations would reduce the inflation rate , but it represented the rate of inflation in terms of maintaining a declining standard of living .
Cost of living was being replaced by the cost of survival .
The old system told you how much you had to increase your income in order to keep buying steak .
The new system promised you hamburger , and then dog food , perhaps , after that .
The Boskin / Greenspan concept violated the intent and common usage of the inflation index .
The CPI was considered sacrosanct within the Department of Labor , given the number of contractual relationships that were anchored to it .
The CPI was one number that never was to be revised , given its widespread usage .
Shortly after Clinton took control of the White House , however , attitudes changed .
The BLS initially did not institute a new CPI measurement using a variable - basket of goods that allowed substitution of hamburger for steak , but rather tried to approximate the effect by changing the weighting of goods in the CPI fixed basket .
Over a period of several years , straight arithmetic weighting of the CPI components was shifted to a geometric weighting .
The Boskin / Greenspan benefit of a geometric weighting was that it automatically gave a lower weighting to CPI components that were rising in price , and a higher weighting to those items dropping in price .
Once the system had been shifted fully to geometric weighting , the net effect was to reduce reported CPI on an annual , or year - over - year basis , by 2.7 % from what it would have been based on the traditional weighting methodology .
The results have been dramatic .
The compounding effect since the early - 1990s has reduced annual cost of living adjustments in social security by more than a third .
The BLS publishes estimates of the effects of major methodological changes over time on the reported inflation rate ( see the " Reporting Focus " section of the October 2005 Shadow Government Statistics newsletter — available to the public in the Archives of www.shadowstats.com).
Changes estimated by the BLS show roughly a 4 % understatement in current annual CPI inflation versus what would have been reported using the original methodology .
Adding the roughly 3 % lost to geometric weighting — most of which not included in the BLS estimates — takes the current total CPI understatement to roughly 7 % .
There now are three major CPI measures published by the BLS , CPI for All Urban Consumers ( CPI - U ) , CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers ( CPI - W ) and the Chained CPI - U ( C - CPI - U ) .
The CPI - U is the popularly followed inflation measure reported in the financial media .
It was introduced in 1978 as a more - broadly - based version of the then existing CPI , which was renamed CPI - W . The CPI - W is used in calculating Social Security benefits .
These two series tend to move together and are based on frequent price sampling , which is supposed to yield something close to an average monthly price measure by component .
The C - CPI - U was introduced during the second Bush Administration as an alternate CPI measure .
Unlike the theoretical approximation of geometric weighting to a variable , substitution - prone market basket , the C - CPI - U is a direct measure of the substitution effect .
The difference in reporting is that August 2006 year - to - year inflation rates for the CPI - U and the C - CPI - U were 3.8 % and 3.4 % , respectively .
Hence current inflation still has a 0.4 % notch to be taken out of it through methodological manipulation .
The C - CPI - U would not have been introduced unless there were plans to replace the current series , eventually .
Traditional inflation rates can be estimated by adding 7.0 % to the CPI - U annual growth rate ( 3.8 % +7.0 % = 10.8 % as of August 2006 ) or by adding 7.4 % to the C - CPI - U rate ( 3.4 % + 7.4 % = 10.8 % as of August 2006 ) .
Graphs of alternate CPI measures can be found as follows .
The CPI adjusted solely for the impact of the shift to geometric weighting is shown in the graph on the home page of www.shadowstats.com.
The CPI adjusted for both the geometric weighting and earlier methodological changes is shown on the Alternate Data page , which is available as a tab at the top of the home page .
Hedonic Thrills of Using Federally Mandated Gasoline Additives
Aside from the changed weighting , the average person also tends to sense higher inflation than is reported by the BLS , because of hedonics , as in hedonism .
Hedonics adjusts the prices of goods for the increased pleasure the consumer derives from them .
That new washing machine you bought did not cost you 20 % more than it would have cost you last year , because you got an offsetting 20 % increase in the pleasure you derive from pushing its new electronic control buttons instead of turning that old noisy dial , according to the BLS .
When gasoline rises 10 cents per gallon because of a federally mandated gasoline additive , the increased gasoline cost does not contribute to inflation .
Instead , the 10 cents is eliminated from the CPI because of the offsetting hedonic thrills the consumer gets from breathing cleaner air .
The same principle applies to federally mandated safety features in automobiles .
I have not attempted to quantify the effects of questionable quality adjustments to the CPI , but they are substantial .
Then there is " intervention analysis " in the seasonal adjustment process , when a commodity , like gasoline , goes through violent price swings .
Intervention analysis is done to tone down the volatility .
As a result , somehow , rising gasoline prices never seem to get fully reflected in the CPI , but the declining prices sure do .
How Can So Many Financial Pundits Live Without Consuming Food and Energy ?
The Pollyannas on Wall Street like to play games with the CPI , too .
The concept of looking at the " core " rate of inflation - net of food and energy - was developed as a way of removing short - term ( as in a month or two ) volatility from inflation when energy and / or food prices turned volatile .
Since food and energy account for about 23 % of consumer spending ( as weighted in the CPI ) , however , related inflation cannot be ignored for long .
Nonetheless , it is common to hear financial pundits cite annual " core " inflation as a way of showing how contained inflation is .
Such comments are moronic and such commentators are due the appropriate respect .
Too - Low Inflation Reporting Yields Too -High GDP Growth
As is discussed in the final installment on GDP , part of the problem with GDP reporting is the way inflation is handled .
Although the CPI is not used in the GDP calculation , there are relationships with the price deflators used in converting GDP data and growth to inflation - adjusted numbers .
The more inflation is understated , the higher the inflation - adjusted rate of GDP growth that gets reported .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Six men being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , will go before military commissions and could face the death penalty if it is judged they were involved in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , a general said Monday .
The men will be treated like members of the U.S. military during their judicial proceedings , he said .
The proceedings will be dictated by the Military Commissions Act , which Congress passed to handle arrestees in the war on terror .
The act requires that the detainees have access to lawyers as well as to any evidence presented against them .
They also will have the right to appeal a guilty verdict , potentially through a civilian appeals court and perhaps the U.S. Supreme Court , according to the act .
The government plans to make the proceedings as public as possible , said Brig Gen .
Thomas Hartmann .
Watch Hartmann outline the charges »
What is murkier , however , is whether a military prosecutor will be able to use any information or confessions gleaned through controversial tactics like waterboarding , an interrogation technique designed to simulate drowning .
That will be up to a judge to decide , Hartmann said .
" It 's our obligation to move the process forward to give these people their rights , " he said .
" We are going to give them rights that are virtually identical to the rights we provide to our military members . "
Despite Hartmann 's guarantees , Charles Swift , a former U.S. Navy attorney , said the process will not afford detainees an adequate defense .
He also raised concerns that trying and executing the men unfairly could make them martyrs in the eyes of extremists .
" The losers will be the American public unless some fundamental changes are made very quickly , " he said .
Hartmann , the legal adviser to the military commission trying the men , announced Monday that the government will seek the death penalty against the six detainees , including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
Prosecutors hope to try the men together .
Among the charges leveled against the men are murder and conspiracy " in violation of the law of war , " attacking civilians and terrorism .
Four of the suspects will also be charged with hijacking , Hartmann said .
The 169 charges allege a " long - term , highly sophisticated plan by al Qaeda to attack the United States of America , " he said .
Though the proceedings will not be televised , Hartmann said the government intends to keep the proceedings as open as possible except when classified information is presented that could compromise national security .
Watch how waterboarding could play a role in the trials »
" I 've been advised by the prosecutors that relatively little amounts of evidence will be classified , but it 's still a possibility , and we have rules and procedures and rules of evidence in place to deal with that , " Hartmann said .
" There will be no secret trials . "
The suspects are accused of helping plan the September 11 attacks in which hijackers flew two jets into the World Trade Center in New York and another jet into the Pentagon in Washington .
Another hijacked plane crashed near Shanksville , Pennsylvania .
According to the 9/11 Commission Report , 2,974 people were killed in the attacks , not including the 19 hijackers .
Charged along with Mohammed are :
Mohammed al - Qahtani , the so - called 20th hijacker in the 9/11 attacks ;
Ramzi bin al - Shibh , accused of being an intermediary between the hijackers and al Qaeda leaders and finding flight schools for the hijackers ;
Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali , alleged to have sent approximately $ 127,000 to hijackers and arranging travel for nine of them ;
Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi , accused of providing the hijackers with money , clothes and credit cards ;
Walid bin Attash , who is accused of training two of the 9/11 hijackers and assisting in the hijacking plan .
Mohammed , bin Attash , al - Shibh and Ali will also be charged with hijacking or hazarding an aircraft , Hartmann said .
See the suspects and what they 're accused of »
Judge Susan Crawford will decide whether to approve the charges and prosecutors ' request to seek the death penalty , Hartmann said .
The detainees would then enter pleas within 30 days .
A military commission would be assembled within 120 days at the U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
If Crawford approves the charges , it will mark the first time that Guantanamo detainees have been charged in the September 11 attacks .
About 380 foreign nationals are being held at Guantanamo .
The detainees ' lawyers have repeatedly complained that their clients are being denied due process .
The U.S. Supreme Court has twice expressed reservations about how the government handles detainees at the U.S. naval base .
In 2006 , the high court ruled the Bush administration 's use of military tribunals was unconstitutional because the system did not allow terror suspects to challenge their detention .
Congress last year passed the Military Commissions Act , which provided terror suspects with a limited right to appeal convictions and reduced the jurisdiction of federal courts .
According to the act , the detainees will be allowed to see all evidence against them , call defense witnesses and cross-examine prosecution witnesses .
If Crawford approves seeking the death penalty in the cases , the 12 - member military commission must unanimously find the detainees guilty .
The detainees will be allowed to appeal guilty verdicts in the Court of Military Commission Review , then the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals and then the U.S. Supreme Court .
Several legal and political challenges will be presented during the proceedings , and CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it could be five years before the trials are complete .
Watch why the trials could prove to be difficult »
" One thing 's clear about Guantanamo is that the next president is going to have to resolve this , " Toobin said .
One hurdle lies in seeking the death penalty .
Key U.S. allies like Australia and Britain have blasted the U.S. for seeking the death penalty and have vowed to fight efforts to execute any of their national held at Guantanamo .
Most countries join Australia and Britain in their opposition to capital punishment .
Another issue expected to stall the process is whether prosecutors will be able to use information gathered using controversial interrogation techniques .
On February 5 , CIA Director Michael Hayden for the first time publicly confirmed Mohammed and two other terror suspects were subjected to waterboarding .
The technique was used on top al Qaeda detainees in the aftermath of the attacks to " help us prevent catastrophic loss of life of Americans or their allies , " Hayden said .
After Monday 's announcement , Hayden , in a memo obtained by CNN , wrote CIA employees to laud the decision to try the detainees and called it " a crucial milestone on the road to justice for the victims of 9/11 . "

NYT : ' It is time for the US to leave Iraq ' RAW STORY
Published : Sunday July 8 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an editorial today , the New York Times calls for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq , " without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit . "
The Times writes that it has become " clear that the president had neither the vision nor the means to " build a stable and unified Iraq , and that the " surge " as failed to mitigate the sectarian violence that continues to rage in the country .
" The political leaders Washington has backed are incapable of putting national interests ahead of sectarian score settling , " writes the NYT .
" Additional military forces poured into the Baghdad region have failed to change anything . "
The paper argues that continuing to fight in Iraq " is wrong , " and that despite President Bush 's repeated claims that Iraq is a front line the war on terror , it is actually a " dangerous diversion from the life - and - death struggle against terrorists . "
The editorial concludes that withdrawal of US troops from Iraq is the only responsible course of action .
Excerpts follow : # The United States has about 160,000 troops and millions of tons of military gear inside Iraq .
Getting that force out safely will be a formidable challenge .
The main road south to Kuwait is notoriously vulnerable to roadside bomb attacks .
Soldiers , weapons and vehicles will need to be deployed to secure bases while airlift and sealift operations are organized .
Withdrawal routes will have to be guarded .
The exit must be everything the invasion was not : based on reality and backed by adequate resources .
...
Accomplishing all of this in less than six months is probably unrealistic .
The political decision should be made , and the target date set , now .
... President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have used demagoguery and fear to quell Americans  demands for an end to this war .
They say withdrawing will create bloodshed and chaos and encourage terrorists .
Actually , all of that has already happened  the result of this unnecessary invasion and the incompetent management of this war .

It 's baaaack !!
Yes , " comparable worth , " which faded out around the same time the Bay City Rollers were disbanding , is making a comeback , under the euphemism " pay equity " .
To wit : the Fair Pay Act of 2007 .
Introduced by Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) in April ( Illionois Sen. and Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is one of 15 co-sponsors ) the Act notes the existence of wage differentials between men and women .
This is true ; according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , in 2005 female full - time wage and salary workers made 81 % of what men did .
What is more dubious , though , is the assumption that is the heart of the Fair Pay Act : that discrimination is the reason for all or most of the difference .
And the act 's remedies are absurdly misguided , injecting the federal government into the most routine pay decisions .
In the first edition of my favorite economics textbook , there was a section on " comparable worth . "
Eventually , my editor suggested I take it out , on the grounds that economic logic had finally killed off this bad idea .
But like Lord Voldemort in the first Harrry Potter book , the idea was weakened , but not dead .
Here is what Fortune is now reporting :
And here is what I wrote about the topic ten years ago in that first edition :
Should engineers get paid more than librarians ?
This question is at the heart of the debate over comparable worth , a doctrine according to which jobs deemed comparable should be paid the same wage .
Advocates of comparable worth point out that traditionally male occupations have higher wages than traditionally female occupations .
They believe that these occupational differences are discriminatory against women .
Even if women were paid the same as men for the same type of work , the gender gap in wages would persist until comparable occupations were paid similar wages .
Comparable - worth advocates want jobs rated according to a set of impartial criteria -- education , experience , responsibility , working conditions , and so on .
Under this system , comparably rated jobs would pay the same wage .
A librarian with a master 's degree , ten years of experience , and a forty - hour workweek , for instance , would be paid the same as an engineer with a master 's degree , ten years of experience , and a forty - hour workweek .
Most economists are critical of comparable - worth proposals .
They argue that a competitive market is the best mechanism for setting wages .
It would be nearly impossible , they claim , to measure all of the factors that are relevant for determining the right wage for any job .
Moreover , the fact that traditionally female occupations pay less than traditionally male occupations is not by itself evidence of discrimination .
Women have in the past spent more time than men raising children .
Women are , therefore , more likely to choose occupations that offer flexible hours and other working conditions compatible with childrearing .
To some extent , the gender gap in wages is a compensating differential .
Economists also point out that comparable - worth proposals would have an important unintended side effect .
Comparable - worth advocates want the wages in traditionally female occupations to be raised by legal decree .
Such a policy would have many of the effects of a minimum wage , which we first discussed in Chapter 6 .
In particular , when the wage is forced to rise above the equilibrium level , the quantity of labor supplied to these occupations would rise , and the quantity demanded would fall .
The result would be higher unemployment in traditionally female occupations .
In this way , a comparable - worth law could adversely affect some members of groups that the policy is aimed at helping .
The debate over comparable worth continues .
The courts have usually rejected the claim that occupational wage differences are discriminatory .
Nonetheless , the comparable - worth movement has had some political success .
For example , in 1985 , a government employees union sued the state of Washington for discrimination using a comparable - worth argument .
The case came before Circuit Court Judge Anthony Kennedy , who later became a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court .
Kennedy decided against comparable worth , writing that " neither law nor logic deems the free market system a suspect enterprise . "
Despite their defeat in the courts , however , the advocates of comparable worth ultimately got what they wanted .
The state of Washington eventually succumbed to political pressure and adopted a comparable - worth system for paying state employees .
( Fortune ) -- Weaker - than - expected earnings will force Citigroup , Wachovia , Bank of America and Wells Fargo to cut their dividends this spring , says Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney .
" Our argument is simple .
Banks under our coverage are dangerously approaching earnings levels that simply will not support such high relative payouts , " Whitney wrote in a report released Friday .
" Beginning with 1Q08 results , to be reported in two weeks time , banks will seriously address their ability to maintain their current dividend levels . "
Last October , Whitney made a name for herself by correctly predicting that Citi ( C , Fortune 500 ) would have to slash its dividend and sell assets so that it would have enough Tier 1 capital , the amount of cash a bank must have on its books in order to meet regulatory requirements .
Since that report , she has made several other correct and bearish calls on the state of the financial sector .
The dividend issue is particularly important for investors and the broader market now because , at a time when financial stocks have been hammered , many investors are holding onto them simply because they pay such rich dividends .
Bank stock dividends currently are hovering at an average of 6 % , the highest since 1990 , which some believe is a decent consolation prize for those waiting for the stocks to recover .
But if dividends are cut due to ailing financial health , investors who have been patient holders may dump the stocks .
To cut , or not to cut ?
Whitney 's argument is two - fold :
First she points out that the biggest banks hold structured bonds that have all been downgraded by the ratings agencies .
In fact , Moody's , Fitch , and S&P have downgraded about $ 370 billion in securities and are racing to find and downgrade more hidden shaky paper .
Rules require banks to hold more capital in reserve against assets with lower ratings , so it follows that the banks will have to increase their Tier 1 capital levels .
Second ,
Whitney says because of the increased write downs on these bad assets , earnings will be substantially lower than anyone has so far estimated .
" For example , we estimate that Citigroup will actually earn $ 1.43 per share shy of its dividend payment this year .
In other words , C will pay out $ 1.43 per share more than it earns this year .
How anyone , let alone C's management and the board , can believe that its dividend is safe given this earnings scenario is beyond our comprehension , " she writes .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup , Wells Fargo ( WFG ) and Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) all declined to comment on the report .
However , it should be noted that Citi has been acting aggressively to address its precarious capital position .
According to its annual earnings report filed this February , it has raised $ 30 billion in qualified Tier 1 capital since last November ( which is the same amount Whitney said back in October that Citi would need ) .
At this point it looks like the bank is marginally overcapitalized .
As it points out in its annual report , " To be ' well capitalized ' under federal bank regulatory agency definitions , a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6 % , a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10 % , and a Leverage Ratio of at least 3 % . "
According to that report , it has a Tier 1 ratio of 7.12 % , a total capital ratio of 10.7 % , and a leverage ratio of 4.03 % .
The bank is also taking further steps to sell assets , which would reduce the amount of Tier 1 capital it is required to have .
Citi's numbers may look strong , but let 's remember that ex-CEO Charles Prince was adamant last fall that its dividend was safe .
It slashed that payout to shareholders by 41 % in January .
And with the stock down more than 2 % after Whitney 's pronouncement , it looks like investors have put their money on her .

What do look for when it comes to urban photography websites ?
Urban photography does n’t have to mean perfectly framed parks and stoic skyscrapers .
Some of the best urban photos feature bizarre abandonments , so - called ‘ non-photograph or even subversive and illegal subjects .
Here are ten sites that span the spectrum and that anyone who loves urban photographs should know and bookmark !
Non-Photography – No Rules Street Photography :
What is nonphotography ?
Well , in a way it is anti-photography , no-rules street photography .
It eschews strict definition , and is stylistically as impressive as it is diverse .
Nitsa ’s favorite nonphotographs show all kinds of possibilities outside of normal compositional approaches .
Sleepy City – Abandonments
Photography :
There are a number of forums , blogs and other websites dedicated to cataloging urban explorations in tunnels , deserted buildings and other off - limits urban no - man ’s - lands .
However , Sleepy City dot
Net has a particularly great collection of tagged images from urban adventures .
Opacity – Artful Abandonments : Like Sleepy City , Opacity focuses mostly on urban ruins and abandonments , though the approach taken is quite different .
Whereas Sleepy City focuses more on the adventure and shooting pictures when and where one can , Opacity emphasizes the art and beauty of these spaces .
Wooster Collective – Street Art Photography : Few sites are as frequently updated with amazing graffiti from around the world as WoosterCollective .
Artists and observers submit images of street art of all kinds , with an emphasis on graffiti ( illegal and illegal ) which are then posted with a short blurb or backstory
Strictly No Photography – Forbidden Photos :
This is a great user - submitted content site where anyone can upload images , or more specifically : pictures taken in places people are n’t allowed to take pictures in .
One of their best sets can be found at the bottom of the page – images of signs that , ironically enough , forbid photography .
Urban Dirty – Free Stock Textures : Urban Dirty collections and makes available stock images of urban textures of all kinds .
They offer them at various sizes and categorized under a number of tags .
These are interesting intrinsically , but they ’re also a great resource for avid Photoshoppers .
Dmoz Urban Photographers :
The DMOZ directory lists a few dozen interesting sites of specifically urban photographers , from portfolios to blogs .
Some of these are regionally based , others are stylistically themed , but all of them are accompanied by helpful and short taglines describing their contents .
Flickr Urban Photography : Flickr has a number of urban photography groups with a range of interests , from the urban decay and abandoned collections , to urban negatives ( focusing on overlooked urban objects ) and urban fragments ( no people , just architectural objects ) .
Epic Edits Site List – 87 More Photo Sites : Epic edits has also compiled a lengthy list of photoblogs and other photography websites , from amateur to professional in content .
This list also contains a great many feeds of regularly updated sites , for people who want to add photography to their regular RSS reads .
WebUrbanist – Urban Arts and Culture : Of course , for anyone new to the site , WebUrbanist is a great resource for discovering lesser known street artists and urban photographers .
If you want to be a featured artist or know someone who should be , please feel free to contact us .

For the first time , researchers reveal that like humans , other primates such as the male putty - nosed monkey ( Cercopithecus nictitans ) can express different messages by combining sounds into different sequences .
The ability to string different words together to express complex ideas was a milestone in the development of language that researchers figure occurred relatively late in human evolution .
Now for the first time , scientists reveal a primate other than humans can also express a variety of messages by combining sounds into different sequences .
The finding suggests this level of language might have occurred far earlier in evolution than before thought .
Researchers focused on putty - nosed monkeys ( Cercopithecus nictitans ) in Nigeria .
They studied alarm calls the males made .
Dangerous work
" To study alarm - calling behavior , I once dressed up as a leopard and approached a group of sooty mangabeys , " recalled psychologist and primatologist Klaus Zuberbühler at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
" The monkeys detected me , got very agitated , alarm - called at high rates , and a number of males approached in the low canopy … aggressively displaying their large canines .
At this point I was glad to be able to change species ( by taking off my costume ) and reveal myself .
They looked at me with puzzlement , and then ran away silently .
It felt good to be a human ! "
At other times , fieldwork was less amusing .
" Kate Arnold , the lead researcher , spent Christmas and New Year in the hospital in intensive care , because she contracted heavy malaria on her way back from the field site to Scotland , " Zuberbühler said .
" Fieldwork in remote places in Africa is difficult for a number of reasons . "
By three years of hard work trailing male putty - nosed monkeys , the researchers found the primates produced series of alarm calls that differed depending on the threat involved .
For instance , a series of calls made up of " pyows " are a common response to leopards , while series of " hacks " followed by " pyows " are given to crowned eagles .
By playing back recordings of calls at monkeys , Zuberbühler , Arnold and their colleagues unexpectedly found that males could arrange hacks and pyows to convey at least three different kinds of information to other monkeys — the event they witnessed , the identity of callers , and even whether they intended to travel .
Scientists had suggested that stringing different sounds together into complex ideas occurred relatively late in human evolution , speculating that such combinations only happened when doing so became easier than adding new signals to a large , unwieldy repertoire .
" Our research shows that these assumptions may not be correct , " Zuberbühler said .
" Putty - nosed monkeys have very small vocal repertoires , but nevertheless we observe meaningful combinatorial signaling . "
Why they do it
Most primates are actually limited in the number of signals they can physically produce because of their lack of tongue control .
" The only way to escape this constraint may be to combine the few calls they have into more complex sequences , " Zuberbühler said .
" In other words , it may be ' harder ' for non-human primates to evolve large repertoires than to evolve the ability to combine signals .
Hence , the evolution of combinatorial signaling may not be driven by too many signals but rather by too few . "
Since the ancestors of humanity genetically diverged from ancestors of these monkeys some 25 million years ago , these findings suggest that some of the core abilities required for human language may be much older than had been thought .
Still , " it is not clear at this point whether the communication system we describe is an isolated case — a freak of nature , so to speak — or whether it represents a more general pattern underlying primate vocal behavior , " Zuberbühler said .
" There are over 200 species of primates , but only a very small number of species has been studied with regards to their communication skills . "
Zuberbühler and Arnold detail their findings in the March 11 issue of the journal Current Biology .

Communities secretary Hazel Blears said town halls would develop information packs for newcomers to help them fit in and avoid " behaving in a way that is out of step with the normal way of doing things or in extreme cases , against the law " .
Guidance includes advice on accessing local services , including English language classes , as well as social rules such as " not littering , not spitting and queuing in shops " .
The move is part of a range of policies being promoted by the government to help councils respond to increasing change in their local community , following a ten - month review by the Commission on Integration and Cohesion .
Blears said : " As a government we have a role in ensuring that the diversity which is a real strength of this country is successfully managed and does n't lead to problems in the way that people live and get along together . "
But council chiefs insist the real source of community tensions is the lack of funding to accommodate surges of new migrants in certain areas .
The council umbrella body , the Local Government Association , said some councils were already providing " welcome packs " to help migrants access services and live harmoniously with locals .
The LGA chair , Sir Simon Milton , blamed tensions on the funding levels put in place to deal with a significant influx of newcomers , which he said put a strain on public services .
Milton said : " The speed and scale of migration combined with the shortcomings of official population figures , is placing pressure on funding for services like children 's services and housing .
This can even lead to unnecessary tension and conflict .
" The problem is that the money that is being generated is n't necessarily finding its way back down to the local level .
Official statistics on how many migrants are coming and where they are going are inadequate .
" No - one has a real grasp of where or for how long migrants are settling so much needed funding for local services is n't getting to the right places . "
Blears said the government had made £ 50 m available over the next three years to support local authorities in responding to local need .
Other plans unveiled by the government today include specialist cohesion teams to provide advice and support to local authorities , particularly in areas facing rapid change or experiencing migration for the first time .
The government will publish further advice later in the year to help councils draw up " action plans " for their area .
Blears said : " It is at the local level that changes are felt most keenly .
But we are also clear that strong direction from government is needed if we are going to make managing those changes easier . "
" We are providing the resources and support that will help local authorities promote integration between new and settled communities and manage the impact of population change .
Our recent Round Up contributer Jon Perr caught this potential blockbuster :
PERRspectives :
This past week , the Bush administration added insult to injury over its illegal program of NSA domestic surveillance .
During the very time Congress was debating codifying President Bush 's lawbreaking by revising the FISA law many of his allies have been afraid to publicly challenge as unconstitutional , Alberto Gonzales ' DOJ was raiding the home of a former Justice official to identify the person who first brought the illicit program to light .
As Michael Isikoff details in Newsweek , a team of FBI agents raided the home of Thomas M. Tamm , a veteran prosecutor and former official of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review ( OIPR ) within DOJ :
The agents seized Tamm 's desktop computer , two of his children 's laptops and a cache of personal files .
Tamm and his lawyer , Paul Kemp , declined any comment .
So did the FBI .
But two legal sources who asked not to be identified talking about an ongoing case told NEWSWEEK the raid was related to a Justice criminal probe into who leaked details of the warrantless eavesdropping program to the news media .
The raid appears to be the first significant development in the probe since The New York Times reported in December 2005 that Bush had authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on the international phone calls and e-mails of U.S. residents without court warrants .
Even as Alberto Gonzales ' was feebly deflecting perjury charges by apologizing for " creating confusion " wit his comments about " no serious disagreement " in 2004 within the administration over its NSA homeland spying scheme , the Attorney General was dispatching the FBI to investigate one of those purportedly disagreeable officials .

Ron Paul released a video yesterday in which he urged his supporters to stick with the campaign even though John McCain has been all but crowned as the Republican nominee .
“ Keep going and keep fighting , ” Paul implores .
Paul says that he will devote a larger share of his time to defending his congressional seat from a strong primary challenge , but after that ’s taken care of on March 4 , he will pursue the nomination all the way to the convention .
The hope is that he will collect enough delegates so that either a “ surprise ” will happen and he ’ll somehow get the nomination , or he will be able to “ play a vital role ” in giving the nomination to someone else .
For the time being , Paul suggests a new project .
“ We ought to make a grand display .
We ought to have a true march to show what our numbers are , ” he says .
A truly impressive “ march on Washington ” would mean the “ media ca n’t ignore us . ”
He might want to rethink that — the media had an awfully easy time ignoring hundreds of thousands of anti-war protesters before the Iraq War .
My libertarian friend ( a big Ron Paul supporter ) dropped me an email and suggested that Paul use his cash haul to fund libertarian candidates in a couple key House races , and maybe even a Senate race or two .
A couple libertarian House members likely would n’t have much of an effect , considering the size of the Democratic majority in that body , but a single libertarian senator ( need n’t be a “ Big L ” Libertarian , just a “ small l ” libertarian ) could have enormous sway , assuming the close margin of the Senate holds .
Tiny minority parties in many other countries stay relevant this way — they partner with larger parties in exchange for key concessions .
The problem is , there is n’t an army of libertarian candidates out there .
According to Sean Haugh , Political Director of the Libertarian Party , there are 80 announced candidates for U.S. House and nine for U.S. Senate ( three in Texas ) that are libertarians .
In some states , those candidates have to register under different names in order to get on the ballot , but Haugh counts them as ideological allies .
“ We ’ve never elected anybody to Congress , ” says Haugh .
“ And there ’s not really one running that I would name where I could say they ’re going for the win .
We focus more on local office .
We take a real grassroots approach to this .
Those folks are running to make sure there is a libertarian choice on the ballot . ”
But while the enthusiasm and the dollars Ron Paul has churned up may not lead to more libertarian leadership in Washington , it will lead to more libertarianism nationwide .
“ Ron Paul ’s done a fantastic job for us , ” says Haugh .
“ The main thing is to get people active in politics for liberty and the Constitution .
He ’s done a really amazing job on getting out people who had given up on politics and giving them a reason to be involved . ”
He says that the Libertarian Party ranks have not swelled because of Paul ’s influence .
“ In fact , it was the opposite , ” says Haugh .
“ A lot of libertarians went off to work on the Ron Paul campaign .
A lot of our people switched their party affiliation to Republican so they could vote for him .
But I try to look at the big picture . ”
And no matter what kind libertarian you are , Ron Paul has been good for the big picture .

In linear lambda calculus , you must use each bound variable exactly once in a term .
A term with a single bound variable is a full binary tree of applications in which one of the leaves is the bound variable , so it makes sense to ask , “ which leaf ? ”
Three combinators are universal for the free linear lambda calculus on a countable set of types .
In the description below , means “ applied to ” Note the position of the term in each case :
identity
cut
braid
A full binary tree of applications is either a leaf or an application of a left subtree to a right subtree .
says that this leaf is the variable in question ; says that the variable is in the right subtree ; and says it ’s in the left subtree .
So , for example , in the linear lambda term
appears in the left subtree , so applying abstraction elimination once gives
Now is on the right ; eliminating again in the bracketed term gives
Now is on the left ; eliminating again in the bracketed term gives
And finally , we replace with
to get a term with no bound occurrences of The “ I - terminated ” list of combinators we added , in this case tells us exactly where in the tree the variable appeared .
In the ( nonlinear ) lambda calculus , the variable may appear in either branch or not at all .
The and combinators are a universal basis for this calculus , and can be interpreted as
the variable may appear in either subtree , since
the variable may appear in either subtree , since the variable does not appear in this subtree , since
the variable does not appear in this subtree , since this leaf is a copy of the variable , since
Martin Taylor ( out of shot ) is sent off as Eduardo receives treatment
Eduardo went down in the third minute of the Premier League encounter and Taylor was shown a straight red card .
" The tackle was horrendous and this guy should never play football again , " Wenger told BBC Sport .
But Blues boss Alex McLeish responded : " Martin 's not a dirty player .
He 's distraught over Eduardo's injury . "
Eduardo , 24 , remained lying on the pitch for seven minutes as medical staff attended to him before he was stretchered off and taken to Selly Oak Hospital .
In slow motion these tackles look bad but he's not a malicious player - Eduardo was just too quick for him
McLeish on Taylor
Wenger hit out at the way he feels his team have been targeted by opponents .
" It goes with the idea that to stop Arsenal you have to kick Arsenal and that kind of thing was waiting to happen , " he said .
" Many people have got away with too many bad tackles .
We 've escaped a few times but it 's just not acceptable .
If that is football it 's better to stop it .
" The worst thing you hear after is that 'he 's not the kind of guy who usually does that ' , but you need to only kill one person one time - it 's enough . "
McLeish , however , sprang to the defence of his player .
Martin Taylor is adamant there was no malicious intent and he is deeply upset by the extent of Eduardo 's injury
Birmingham statement
" The referee 's done his job , it 's a sending off , but Taylor 's not a malicious player . "
Birmingham released a statement later on Saturday saying the club were " saddened that such a fantastic game of football has been marred by a serious injury "
It added : " Martin Taylor is adamant there was no malicious intent in the tackle and he is deeply upset by the extent of Eduardo 's injury .
" Having reviewed the incident , this ( no malicious intent ) is clearly the case .
The club and Martin Taylor would like to send their very best wishes to the player for a speedy recovery . "
The minimum is his season is over and we are scared that it is much longer
Wenger on Eduardo
The Brazilian - born striker now looks certain to miss out on Croatia 's participation at Euro 2008 in June .
" It was a massive shock for the team .
They 've seen what kind of state he was in , " Wenger added .
" He 's a fantastic guy and to see him in such pain and the shape of his leg was very difficult for the players .
" We hope he comes back quickly but the minimum is his season is over and we are scared that it is much longer . "
Wigan boss Steve Bruce , who signed Taylor from Blackburn when he was Blues boss in February 2004 , said his former player would never intentionally hurt anyone .
" Martin Taylor is the biggest , gentlest man , " said Bruce .
" There will be nobody more upset and sickened than him , there is not a bad bone in his body .
" He would never , ever do anything malicious .
He has mis-timed the tackle , and I 've seen it .
Some would say it is not even a yellow card . "
A forecast made by Denmark - based Saxo Bank , chaos will take a grip on the world in 2008 .
Oil prices will skyrocket to 175 dollars per barrel , the Chinese market will collapse by 40 percent , whereas the U.S. will suffer a 25 - percent setback .
All this will happen because of the mortgage crisis in the USA which already slows down the U.S. economy .
High oil prices can bring only good to Russia , though .
On the other hand , even if the above - mentioned forecast comes true , Russia will face serious problems in its economy too .
It is worthy of note that the majority of Saxo Bank ’s previous forecasts for 2007 have proved to be true to fact .
On New Year ’s
Eve most people recollect the outgoing year and hope for the best .
However , Saxo Bank experts seem to be an exception from this nice tradition .
David Karsbol , the head of market strategy for the bank , said that the forecast had not been made to intimidate people .
“ It gives a reason to think about the future of the market , ” he said .
Saxo
Bank experts believe that oil prices will hit the level of 175 dollars per barrel in 2008 , whereas grain prices will double .
The U.S. and the Chinese markets will collapse by 25 and 40 percent respectively by the end of the summer of 2008 .
Every third of ten U.S. large building companies will go bankrupt .
The British economy will also start declining .
The bank has its forecast on the new U.S. president too .
The bank predicts that Ron Paul , the Texan Republican , will take the office in 2008 .
I thought this article was worth a reprint .
I am looking into why the Saxo bank made that prediction and wanted my readers to see this and have a look at the work to come .
I am betting that they are predicting on the fact that Ron Paul has the most visible on the ground support of any other candidate and that is the kind of support that you can take to the bank .
Until house prices stop falling , it wo n’t be clear how many more people will default on their mortgages .
Even homeowners who stay current on their mortgage payments will be affected .
With the value of their largest asset dropping , many will decide to spend less and save more , aggravating the economic slowdown .
On Tuesday , the Conference Board reported that Americans were more pessimistic about the economy ’s direction over the next six months than at any point since the bad old days of the 1973 oil embargo .
In many ways , it would be better if the housing correction would happen more swiftly and sharply .
The pain might be worse , but it would be over quickly .
We seem to understand this principle when we ’re removing a bandage .
Why , then , is it so much harder with housing ?
Because houses are almost perfectly engineered to trick owners into overvaluing them .
For starters , people have an obvious emotional connection to their house .
After you have raised a family or enjoyed long meals with friends there , you are naturally going to place a higher value on it than a dispassionate buyer would .
It ’s your home .
In normal times , buyers and sellers can still come to an agreement because inflation allows sellers to feel that they have made a nice return on their house .
People do n’t sell houses frequently , so the sale price of a house is almost always higher than it was when the current owner bought it , just as the price of food , haircuts and everything else tends to rise over a five - or 10 - year span .
Because of leverage  the fact that people buy houses mostly on credit  these inflation - driven price increases turn into true investment gains .
In the wake of the biggest housing boom on record , it ’s understandably hard to accept a new reality .
Robert Glinert , a real estate agent in the Los Angeles area , said he has recently been saying no to almost half the sellers who have asked him to represent them .
Their initial asking price is just too unrealistic .
“ People say , ‘ I do n’t care about the market  my home is still worth what I paid for it in 2006 , ’ ” Mr. Glinert told me .
“ And I say , ‘ To you .
Only to you . ’ ”
Not only should n't companies that helped the government 's warrantless spying on American citizens be given retroactive amnesty , the government should establish a national commission — similar to the 9/11 Commission –to subpoena documents and testimony in order to find out – and publish – what exactly the nation 's spies were up to during their five year warrantless , domestic surveillance program .
In other words , House Democrats are n't planning a compromise on telecom amnesty and are actually going on offense to find a way to learn more about President Bush 's five - year secret " Total Information Awareness " program .
At least that 's what 's suggested by a 119 - page draft bill being circulated by the leaders of the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees as answer to the Administration - backed Senate spying bill .
The bill proposes a way for the government to issue blanket surveillance orders in order to force American telecom and internet providers to give the government a copy of every phone call , email or instant message that is believed to involve a foreigner .
That mimics the Senate version and largely legalizes the president 's warrantless wiretapping program .
However , the bill restates – as the 30 - year old spying law stated – that the law is the only route for the government to conduct electronic surveillance inside the United States .
Bush opposes that language and says he has the power as Commander in Chief to spy inside America without any Congressional or court oversight .
The bill also requires two audits of the warrantless wiretapping program – a bipartisan National Commission and an Inspector General review of the warrantless wiretapping program .
House Democrats are also seeking to block the administration from using the ' state secrets ' privilege to block telecoms from showing federal judges – even in chambers – the letters given to them by the federal government about the legality of the program .
Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act which the companies are being sued for violating , the companies could escape the lawsuits if they have a signed letter from the Attorney General , signed under oath , that the surveillance has " no substantial likelihood " of acquiring the content of a U.S. person 's communication and the surveillance is targeted at communication means used exclusively by foreign powers ( this is the foreign embassy exception ) .
The companies claim that they have no defenses against the suits filed against them because the government says the letters are too - classified for even federal judges to see .
The groups suing the companies doubt the letters comply with the requirements of the nation 's spying laws and say they would be fine with the telecoms showing those letters in court .
UPDATE - Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Kevin Bankston – who has been the San Francisco - based group 's emissary to D.C. – says he 's very pleased with the proposal :
The house has apparently agreed with what we have been saying all along – the only meaningful compromise is a solution to the state secrets problem The House has answered the telecoms ' core complaint that they cannot defend themselves in court … and cleared the way for the litigation to proceed fairly and securely .
The Administration says the companies participated in good faith .
Now the companies can do what we wanted them to do all along – tell their story to a judge .
This bill also does not move the cases out of federal district court into the secret spying court , as has been championed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - California ) , and which many have speculated would be the compromise .
Bush has threatened , however , to veto any bill that does n't give total retroactive amnesty to the telecoms , even if that veto rejects spying powers he himself says are vital to national security .
THREAT LEVEL has n't had time to parse the entire bill yet and could use help seeing what is and is not in the fine print .
The bill summary says :
FISA Amendments Act
Bill Summary
March 11 , 2008
The revised House legislation to amend FISA grants new authorities for conducting electronic surveillance against foreign targets while preserving the requirement that the government obtain an individualized FISA court order , based on probable cause , when targeting Americans at home or abroad .
The House bill also strongly enhances oversight of the Administration ’s surveillance activities .
Finally , the House bill does not provide retroactive immunity for telecom companies but allows the courts to determine whether lawsuits should proceed .
Title 1 : Surveillance Authorities • Provides for surveillance of terrorist and other targets overseas who may be communicating with Americans .
• Requires the FISA court to approve targeting and minimization procedures – to ensure that Americans are not targeted and that their inadvertently intercepted communications are not disseminated .
These procedures must be approved prior to surveillance beginning – except in an emergency , in which case the government may begin surveillance immediately , and the procedures must be approved by the court within 30 days .
( This may be extended if the court determines it needs more time to decide the matter ) .
• Provides prospective liability protection for telecommunications companies that provide lawful assistance to the government .
• Requires a court order based on probable cause to conduct surveillance targeted at Americans , whether inside the United States or abroad .
• Requires an Inspector General report on the President ’s warrantless surveillance program .
• Prohibits “ reverse targeting ” of Americans .
• Explicitly establishes FISA Exclusivity – that FISA is the exclusive way to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance inside the U.S.
Any other means requires an express statutory authorization .
• Sunsets these authorities on December 31 , 2009 ( same as the PATRIOT Act sunset ) .
Title 2 : Litigation Procedures for Telecommunication Company Liability •
Does not confer retroactive immunity on telecom companies alleged to have assisted in the President ’s warrantless surveillance program .
• Provides telecom companies a way to present their defenses in secure proceedings in district court without the Administration using “ state secrets ” to block those defenses .
Title 3 : National Commission on Warrantless Surveillance • Establishes a bipartisan , National Commission – with subpoena power – to investigate and report to the American people on the Administration ’s warrantless surveillance activities , and to recommend procedures and protections for the future .

The Iraq and Afghanistan wars have certainly been costly in terms of lives lost , with thousands of U.S. military personnel dead , and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Afghans who have been killed .
But the economic costs are far greater than most people imagine , with the combined operational costs for both wars exceeding $ 1 trillion .
This out of control war spending has robbed our communities of money that would be better spent on job creation , schools , healthcare and other services that are desperately needed during this recession .
In addition , our federal discretionary budget is so top - heavy with spending on “ defense ” that it weakens our actual security .
The biggest security challenges we face are unemployment , foreclosures , and wrongheaded attempts to balance budgets on the backs of working families and children .
The biggest security challenges we face are unemployment , foreclosures , and wrongheaded attempts to balance budgets on the backs of working families and children .
Just as peace is more than the absence of war , national security is more than planes and bombs , it ’s jobs and schools .
Let ’s stop war spending , cut the defense budget and put those dollars into meeting human needs .
The American Friends Service Committee ’s Cost of War project develops exhibits , resources and actions to highlight the economic cost of the wars and demand that Congress shift war funding to support human needs here and real solutions in Iraq and Afghanistan .
CIA Destroyed Interrogation Tapes
The New York Times has learned the CIA destroyed interrogation tapes of two al - Qaeda detainees .
The videotapes showed agency operatives in 2002 subjecting terror suspects — including Abu Zubaydah , the first detainee in C.I.A. custody — to severe interrogation techniques .
They were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that tapes documenting controversial interrogation methods could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy , several officials said .
Both the Judge in the Moussaoui case and the 9/11 Commission had requested the tapes :
The recordings were not provided to a federal court hearing the case of the terror suspect Zacarias Moussaoui or to the Sept. 11 commission , which had made formal requests to the C.I.A. for transcripts and any other documentary evidence taken from interrogations of agency prisoners .
The C.I.A. confirmed the destruction today when the Times informed the agency it would be publishing an article about the tapes tomorrow .
The CIA defends its actions but destruction of evidence and withholding information about the existence of evidence is a serious no - no .
This could be a significant story .

But after losing momentum to Mr. Obama in February , she is now viewed by many party leaders as an obstacle to the fight ahead  even as she continues to argue that she is the best candidate , by dint of her experience , to carry the party ’s flag into the “ wartime election ” fight against a Vietnam hero and national security pro like Mr. McCain .
Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers say there is no party elder who has the stature or power to pressure her to bow out , aside from her husband , former President Bill Clinton .
And he more than anyone wants her to keep running .
The nomination is not determined by the number of states won , but Mr. Obama ’s inability to win major battleground states beyond Missouri , Minnesota , Wisconsin , and his home state , Illinois , is a concern of some Democrats  especially since Ohio and Florida have become must - wins in presidential elections .
Mrs. Clinton has been enjoying her first real burst of momentum lately , thanks to her new advertisements and speeches questioning Mr. Obama ’s abilities in a crisis , raising the fact that he has not convened his Senate subcommittee to hold hearings on the Afghanistan war .
A potentially embarrassing trial of a former Obama friend and contributor has begun .
And major Clinton fund - raisers said that one big victory on Tuesday night would be enough to energize donors and keep $ 1 million or more flowing in daily .
“ Each time people think we ’re down , like after Iowa , or South Carolina , or the February primaries , Hillary has found ways to come back up , ” said Jonathan Mantz , the national finance director of the Clinton campaign .
The results will also embolden her campaign ’s efforts to persuade the Democratic Party to factor in the delegates from Florida and Michigan , her advisers say .
The party counted out those states after they moved up their primaries ; Mrs. Clinton stayed on the ballot in both and “ won ” them in January  despite having no real competition in Michigan and no real campaign in Florida .
In a sign of her thinking , she shouted out to them in her Ohio victory speech Tuesday night .
The Lincoln Bedroom Guest List WASHINGTON ( AllPolitics , Feb. 25 ) --
Here 's the full list of most of those who have stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom since President Bill Clinton took office , courtesy of The Associated Press .
Not included are the president 's relatives and their guests -- 35 in all -- and First Daughter Chelsea Clinton 's guests -- 72 total .
Some of the interesting names on the list are singer Barbra Streisand , catalogue retailer Lillian Vernon , playwright Neil Simon , film director and producer Steven Spielberg , former Chrysler chairman Lee Iaccoca , the Rev. Billy Graham , Apple Computer co-founder Steven Jobs , nutrition guru Dean Ornish , and , not least , actress Jane Fonda and her husband , CNN honcho Ted Turner .
The list is divided into : Arkansas friends ( 370 of them ) ; longtime friends ( 155 of them ) ; friends and supporters ( 111 of them ) ; public officials and dignitaries ( 128 total ) ; and arts and letters ( 67 total ) .
Those invited because of their political support are largely in the " friends and supporters " section .
But many of those on the list identified as " Arkansas friends " or " longtime friends " are also major donors to Clinton or the Democratic Party , such as Robert Farmer , who served as finance committee chairman of Clinton 's 1992 campaign , and billionaire John Kluge .

Until the wind changes
Which book , though ...?
As you may have deduced , it 's the blog 's 7th birthday today .
On February the 9th 2001 , I started writing this thing .
And now , 1,071,213 words later , it is still going . ( , as Mary Poppins said . )
One thing we 've decided to do , as a small celebratory birthday thing is , initially for a month , make a book of mine available online , free , gratis and for nothing .
Ah , that 's up to you .
What I want you to do is think -- not about which of the books below is your favourite , but if you were giving one away to a friend who had never read anything of mine , what would it be ?
Where would you want them to start ?
Click below on the cover of the book you 'd like to see out there , online , for free .
We 'll keep the voting up for a week , and then announce ( and Harper Collins will post , to be read ) the winning book .
Labels : birthdays , free book , the kind of post in which I do n't do anything cute in the labels , voting
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has begun issuing subpoenas in the case of a Missouri teenager who hanged herself after being rejected by the person she thought was a 16 - year - old boy she met on MySpace , sources told The Times .
The case set off a national furor when it was revealed that the “ boyfriend ” was really a neighbor who was the mother of one of the girl ’s former friends .
Local and federal authorities in Missouri looked into the circumstances surrounding 13 - year - old Megan Meier ’s 2006 death in the town of Dardenne Prairie , an upper - middle - class enclave of about 7,400 people , located northwest of St. Louis .
But after months of investigation , no charges were filed against Lori Drew for her alleged role in the hoax .
Prosecutors in Missouri said they were unable to find a statute under which to pursue a criminal case .
Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney ’s office in Los Angeles , however , are exploring the possibility of charging Drew with defrauding the MySpace social networking website by allegedly creating the false account , according to the sources , who insisted on anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the case .
The sources said prosecutors are looking at federal wire fraud and cyber fraud statutes as they consider the case .
Prosecutors believe they have jurisdiction because MySpace is headquartered in Beverly Hills , the sources said .
It ’s still unclear who created the fictitious account .
In a police report , Drew told authorities she , with the aid of a temporary employee , “ instigated and monitored ” a fake profile prior to Megan ’s suicide , “ for the sole purpose of communicating ” with the girl and to see what the girl was saying about Drew ’s daughter .
The grand jury issued several subpoenas last week , including one to MySpace and others to “ witnesses in the case , ” sources said .
One source did not know who else had received subpoenas ; the other declined to provide that information .
Thomas P. O’Brien , the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles , declined to comment .
Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for O’Brien , also declined to comment .
MySpace officials could not be reached for comment , nor could Drew or her husband , Curt , be reached .
Attorney Jim Briscoe , who represents Lori Drew , said : “ We have no knowledge of . . . anything dealing with a grand jury anywhere dealing with this case .
. . .
The only comment I have is we ca n’t comment on rumors from anonymous sources . ”
The news came as a shock to Tina and Ron Meier , Megan ’s parents .
Both said they were unaware of the grand jury and had not been contacted by the U.S. attorney ’s office in Los Angeles .
“ If MySpace is considered the victim , fine .
I do n’t care at this point , ” said Tina Meier , 37 .
“ We ’ve been begging for someone -- anyone -- to pick up this case .
If the Drews can be charged -- and even get the chance to be convicted -- it would be a day I could be happy with . ”
Cyber - bullying has become an increasingly creepy reality , with the anonymity of video games , message boards and other online forums offering an outlet for cruel taunts .
Former federal prosecutor Brian C. Lysaght said such a prosecution would be “ not as much of a reach as it might appear at first glance . ”
In recent years , he said , Congress has passed a series of statutes that make criminal conduct involving the Internet federal offenses .
Still , it could be difficult to draw the line between constitutionally protected free speech and conduct that is illegal .
Laurie Levenson , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles , said the idea of using a fraud charge to tackle the unusual case was “ an interesting and novel approach . ”
“ But I doubt it ’s really going to lead to the type of punishment people really want to see , which is this woman being held responsible for this girl ’s death , ” she said .
Levenson , a former federal prosecutor , said that if the grand jury brings an indictment , it could raise 1st Amendment issues and questions about how to fairly enforce such a law on the Internet , where pseudo - identities are common .
“ This may be a net that catches a lot of people , ” she said .
Kurt Opsahl , a senior staff attorney who specializes in privacy and free speech issues for the legal advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation , said the potential of this case to set legal precedent criminalizing online speech is worrying .
“ The right to speak freely online is hugely important .
Whistle - blowers create pseudonyms , ” Opsahl said .
“ So do many people who anonymously report on corporate or government bad practices . ”
In the neighborhood where the Meiers and the Drews live , protecting the 1st Amendment has not been the main concern .
Teenagers and furious neighbors have protested in front of the Drews ’ one - story , white house .
Virtual vigilantes have posted the Drews ’ home address , phone numbers , e-mail addresses and photos on websites such as RottenNeighbor.com .
Tina and Ron Meier , high school sweethearts , have struggled to deal with their daughter ’s death ; the couple is getting divorced .
Their youngest daughter , Allison , now 11 , splits her time between the two .
The mounting tension and heated emotions worried community leaders enough that they are having the St. Charles County Sheriff ’s Department regularly patrol the suburban neighborhood .
Late last year , Dardenne Prairie ’s Board of Aldermen passed a law that makes cyber harassment a misdemeanor -- with a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail or a $ 500 fine or both for each violation .
A number of area communities have passed similar measures .
And Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt pulled together an Internet task force , which put the final touches on a proposal Tuesday that would make it a felony crime for adults who use online technology to harass children .

Times staff writers Molly Hennessy - Fiske and Ted Rohrlich contributed to this report .
The prevalence of autism in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury - based preservative thimerosal in 1999 , suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder , according to a study released Monday .
The analysis found that from 2004 to 2007 , when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3 to 5 year olds , the autism rate continued to increase in that group from 3.0 to 4.1 per 1,000 children .
“ If mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism , then the number of . . . affected kids should have diminished once they were no longer exposed to thimerosal , ” said Dr. Robert Schechter , lead author of the study and a medical officer at the state Department of Public Health .
“ That is not what we found . ”
The study , published in the Archives of General Psychiatry , is the latest in a series that has investigated the connection between thimerosal and autism .
The vast majority have found no association .

The latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups , which have long blamed mercury , a neurotoxin , for the disorder .
“ This study presents a greatly oversimplified explanation of a very complex problem , ” said Claire Bothwell , chairwoman of the board at the National Autism Assn. , which works on behalf of families with autism .
“ Rising numbers do not confirm that thimerosal never had a role . ”
Autism is a severe developmental disorder in which children seem isolated from the world around them .
There is a broad spectrum of symptoms , marked by poor language skills and an inability to handle social relations .
Over the last two decades , the number of cases has boomed across the country for still - unexplained reasons .
Psychiatrists estimated that 20 years ago there were 0.2 to 0.5 cases for every 1,000 children .
Last year , the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were 6.6 cases per 1,000 schoolchildren , based on a study of 8 - year - olds .

The latest study was based on data from the state Department of Developmental Services , which provides services to about 36,000 people with autism and has one of the best reporting systems in the country .
The researchers looked at all reported cases in the state starting with children born in 1989 .
They found the number of cases per 1,000 children has been steadily increasing from that point to March 2007 , the end point of the study .
In a commentary accompanying the study , Dr. Eric Fombonne called the data “ a clear and unambiguous test . ”
“ Parents of autistic children should be reassured that autism in their child did not occur through immunizations , ” wrote Fombonne , a psychiatrist at Montreal Children ’s Hospital who was not involved in this study .
He has provided advice to vaccine manufacturers in the past but has received no research funding from them , he said .

Steve M. Edelson , an experimental psychologist who is director of the Autism Research Institute , a nonprofit organization in San Diego , said the study , along with evidence from previous research , argued against thimerosal as the major culprit in autism .
But he added that thimerosal may still play some role .
Edelson said such large - scale analysis could overlook smaller groups of children , who for whatever reason have a particular vulnerability to mercury .
He said more solid evidence can only come from laboratory studies , such as postmortem analyses of the brains of autistic children .
The National Autism Assn. criticized the study , saying that some children may still be exposed to mercury through either flu shots or trace amounts in other vaccines .
The group also said that some vaccines containing thimerosal had expiration dates as late as 2005 and may have been used up to that point .

See my Braid 0.4 post for informations about how to upgrade .
Updated to work with the latest version ( 0.3.1 )
Braid is a tool made by Cristi Balan and is a simple tool to help track vendor branches across different SCMs .
It was originally named giston , and was providing functionality similar to piston for git .
Braid , however , will work with most SCMs as both source and host .
Warning , Braid is still under development and may change in the future .
To start you need to get and install , on a linux like my ubuntu you can do it by writing :
mihai@mihai - laptop : ~$ sudo gem install main open4 mihai@mihai - laptop : ~$ git clone git://github.com/evilchelu/braid.git braid mihai@mihai - laptop :~$ cd braid mihai@mihai - laptop : ~$ sudo ruby setup.rb
For this example I will use it to install rspec ( the development version ) on a Rails project .
Go to your project root and type :
mihai@mihai - laptop :~/ Web / piku$ git config -- global mirror .
summary true mihai@mihai - laptop :~/ Web / piku$ braid add http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec
-- type svn vendor / plugins / rspec braid : Creating work branch ' braid / track ' braid : Checking out work branch ' braid / track ' .
braid : Adding svn mirror from ' http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec' into ' vendor / plugins /rspec ' using local branch ' master ' .
braid : Setting up remote branch and fetching data mihai@mihai - laptop : ~/ Web / piku$ git merge braid / track
You do the same to install rspec_on_rails :
mihai@mihai - laptop :~/ Web / piku$ braid add http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails
-- type svn vendor / plugins / rspec_on_rails braid : Creating work branch ' braid / track ' braid : Checking out work branch ' braid / track ' .
braid : Adding svn mirror from ' http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails' into ' vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails ' using local branch ' master ' .
braid : Setting up remote branch and fetching data mihai@mihai - laptop : ~/ Web / piku$ git merge braid / track
That installed rspec , now just type
mihai@mihai - laptop :~/ Web / piku$ ruby script / generate rspec
and you are ready to spec .
Have fun testing and using git .
To update to the latest version your plugins just type
mihai@kodo :~/ Web/ piku$ braid update
and to update just rspec use
mihai@kodo :~/ Web/ piku$ braid update vendor / plugins / rspec
Braid stores the meta information in a file called .
braids
mihai@kodo :~/ Web / piku$ cat . braids --- vendor / plugins / rspec : local_branch : braid / svn/vendor / plugins /rspec type : svn branch : master remote : http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails : local_branch : braid/svn/vendor / plugins /rspec-on-rails type : svn branch : master remote : http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rspec_on_rails

The Maxablaster is a 38 - million - candlepower flashlight that was made at home by ( mad ? ) optics engineer Ralf Ottow .
Replacing a commercial flashlight 's bulb with a plasma - powered mercury arc bulb , the Maxablaster creates a highly focused beam of light with a high UV content not so different from a star .
Advertisement
So UV - filtering glass was added to block the potentially harmful rays — though evidently this thing is still plenty bright enough to burn skin , as it has Ottow 's on at least one occasion .
In real world application , the flashlight can illuminate a cloud that 's four miles in the air , or scare the neighbors by lighting up their house from the same distance .
One things for sure : when the vampires finally come out of hiding ( a few hundred years after the robot apocalypse ) we 're calling this guy .

And then we 're gonna be all like , " I see your Schwartz is as big as mine . "

Clinton spent $ 3.8 million on strategist in single month
Some of Hillary Clinton 's supporters are vexed over her latest campaign finance reports , which reveals she spent $ 100,000 on party platters and groceries for the Iowa caucuses and $ 3.8 million in a single month on a strategist 's firm .
Obama , however , has spent more overall -- and $ 1.8 million on campaign buttons alone .
According to the filing , detailed in the New York Times , Clinton paid strategist Mark Penn and his company $ 3.8 million for " fees and expenses " in January alone .
In sum , the firm has billed $ 10 million in total , which included expenditures on direct mail .
The Times said other Democratic strategists called this sum " stunning . "
" Nearly $ 100,000 went for party platters and groceries before the Iowa caucuses , even though the partying mood evaporated quickly , " the paper 's reporters wrote .
" Rooms at the Bellagio luxury hotel in Las Vegas consumed more than $ 25,000 ; the Four Seasons , another $ 5,000 .
And top consultants collected about $ 5 million in January , a month of crucial expenses and tough fund - raising . "
They also paid communications consultant Howard Wolfson $ 267,000 in January .
His total tab to the campaign passed $ 700,000 last month , including debts to him , the reporters said .
By contrast -- Obama 's communications director -- Robert Gibbs , is paid $ 144,000 a year .
Read the full Times story here .
Obama meanwhile , has spent $ 1.8 million on buttons " and other paraphernalia , " according to a second report .
Obama has dished out $ 138.2 million to Clinton 's $ 120.9 million through Jan. 31 , according to the filings .
Another great format war ended this week , with Blu - Ray to 70 % of released films and , according to the Financial Times , HD - DVD left with one major studio .
HD - DVD owners are either mildly put out , or happy they can now pick up HD movies for a few dollars as they ’re tossed out by major retailers .
We ’ve been here before : whether RealPlayer versus Windows Media , BSD versus Linux , or boxers versus briefs .
Let ’s take a look back at some of the great format wars of our time .
We should first clarify what we mean by losing .
Losing a war does n’t mean the technologies or formats are bad ( though sometimes they are ) .
This does n’t mean the technologies are n’t in use either .
It just means they ’re no longer the default solution for their area .
Every article on the death of ColdFusion was filled with angry developers pointing out new release of ColdFusion as an example of how alive the language was .
But ColdFusion developers are scarce , it ’s rarely chosen for new projects , and its no longer viewed as a mainstream web development language like PHP .
ColdFusion lost the technology war .
Deal with it .
Metric versus Imperial
The war to end all wars .
Until the 1960 ’s , imperial rocked the world , and students spent a great deal of time learning to convert fonoobularsers into schmeekulars .
Since then , however , everywhere but Myanmar , Libya and , er , the USA have switched to metric , with unfortunate consequences for polar landers everywhere .
Winner : Metric
Loser : Polar landers
Word and WordPerfect
PCs were DOS , GUIs were for children , and WordPerfect was the wordprocessor .
But then Windows came out , and due to a sweet combo deal for PC makers shipping MS - DOS , Windows 3 now came with most PCs .
Sure , you could run WordPerfect for DOS , but Microsoft had a pretty damn good version of Word for Windows that could read WordPerfect files .
Alas for WordPerfect , patenting file formats was n’t invented back then , so WordPerfect had to stand on its own two rather smelly feet .
By the time a decent GUI WordPerfect came out , nobody cared .
A few years later , Microsoft bundled WinWord with its other .
Winner : Word
Netscare versus Internet Explorer
In the mid 90 ’s years Netscape was the internet for a lot of people .
Microsoft were still touting their ( then proprietary , not internet based ) MSN as the sensible alternative to the internet .
But then something changed .
Bill Gates sent a memo to everyone in Microsoft about a coming Internet tidal wave .
So in the late 90s and early noughties , Microsoft did everything they possibly could to better Netscape .
Making their browser free , gluing the browser into the Windows file manager and desktop , and pleasing developers by pushing ahead with standards support that ate Netscape ’s for breakfast .
Meanwhile , Netscape did everything to annoy it users .
Netscape put a ’ shop ’ button next to ’ stop ’ , and while having Open Sourced its code to create the Mozilla project , Netscape seemed to have missed the whole ‘ release early , release often ’ tenant of that movement – the company did n’t release a major new version of Netscape for 5 years after Netscape 4 shipped .
In a forward war , Netscape apparently forgot to add ‘ compete ’ to its to - do list .
IE market share went from 20 % market share in 96 to 80 % in 2000 .
The winner : Internet Explorer .
RealPlayer and Windows Media Player
In the late 90s , a former Microsoft executive sees the internet coming , and starts creating a first - to - market streaming audio and video system that works on every platform , is free , included with the most popular web browser .
The model is simple : charges companies for the authoring tools to create files , and provide a better version of the player to paid customers .
Microsoft itself has no idea about the internet at the time and does not respond for years .
So why did RealPlayer lose ?
They did everything possible to annoy their customers .
In 1999 , the free player , hidden to this day in Real ’s website , was pimped out to spyware companies like Comet Cursor .
That same year the world realized the software sent a list of everything each user played back to RealNetworks .
Meantime , the free player kept harassing you with popup advertisements , while you were using other software .
Muting RealPlayer stopped all other sound applications from playing ( a problem that persists to this day ) .
During installation , RealPlayer asked if it could bone your sister , and if you unticked the box , it did it anyway .
OK we made that last one up .
We think .
Windows Media
Player took advantage of Microsoft ’s desktop monopoly to get onto everyone ’s desktop , and stayed there because it did n’t suck .
Winner : Windows Mobile
DVD -RW and DVD+RW
Sure , there were vast technical differences , but nobody cared .
In the early 2000s , most could burn either the DVD Forum backed DVD - RW ( supported by Apple and Pioneer ) or DVD +RW , supported by HP , Dell and Microsoft .
DVD -RW cracked first , converting to Hybrid DVD +/- RW drives a couple of years before everyone else did .
The winner : + RW .
But the victory did n’t last long .
Internet Explorer versus Firefox
By 2003 Netscape was dead .
Without any good competition ( apart from the great - but - still unpopular Opera ) Internet Explorer had n’t been updated in a couple of years , and Microsoft , having no need to attract developers , stopped caring about standards support .
Sure , there was Mozilla , but it was an ugly , slow , bloated mess .
In 2003 Firefox was announced to the world with a two page spread in the New York Times .
Firefox did n’t look like another web browser .
It had a more minimal design : one toolbar , with only the basic navigation controls placed beside the location bar , and , handily tabs underneath .
It was snappy and responsive , and the ability to block annoying flashing images and popup advertising were standard features .
It also had great standard support .
In late 2006 , five years after IE6 , Internet Explorer 7 came out .
Its has a more minimal design : one toolbar , with only the basic navigation controls placed beside the location bar , and , handily tabs underneath .
It ’s snappy and responsive , and the ability to block annoying flashing images and popup advertising are standard features .
It also has improved standard support .
That was n’t enough though : from 2004 to the present , Internet Explorer ’s market share has been in slow , steady decline .
While Firefox may only be around 20 % of computer users worldwide , it ’s clear which browser is setting the agenda for web browser development .
Winner : Firefox
Handheld Devices : Windows Mobile versus Palm
After Apple ’s Newton failed to take off , Palm was first to popularize the PDA .
Microsoft saw the opportunity , and came out with , er , Palm - Sized PCs , before getting their ass handed to them on a plate .
Later rebranding to Windows CE and then Windows Mobile , Microsoft differentiated from Palm ’s strictly - business devices by giving users color screens and multmedia support .
The Windows Mobile applications did n’t share much code with their desktop counterparts – editing a document in Word Mobile still removes most of the formatting , and Pocket IE ca n’t show most websites properly – but the brand recognition were strong enough to sway users to Windows Mobile .
Microsoft licensed their OS to all and sundry , and while HP came out with some great iPAQs , the cleverly namd High Tech Computer ( now just HTC ) , emerged from obscurity with a variety of innovate devices to become the most popular maker of PDAs .
Palm , meanwhile , did … not much at all .
Winner : Windows Mobile
Web Development : Microsoft Stack vs LAMP
Once upon a time , there was ASP .
It was web development for VB coders back when VB was the easy choice for web apps , and merely required a license for a server platform with a spotty security record that needed to be restarted for every security update .
But the market leading web server was generally deployed on Unix platforms , which already shipped PHP , and either MySQL or PostgreSQL , and had a better reputation for security and maintenance .
Sure , ASP still exists , but it ’s now a language for Microsoft - obsessed corporates , and virtually unheard of in the startup space .
See for yourself what the current crop of web 2.0 sites use , then visit the Y Combinator news forums and realize nothing ’s about to change .
Winner : LAMP
Open Source Desktops : GNOME and KDE
KDE was the older , more polished desktop .
GNOME was a weird acronym , whose main features were being brown , having this icon , and changing its internals every five seconds ( Enlightenment , Sawfish , Metacity , a plastic banana ) .
GNOME got some traction because Red Hat and Debian did n’t like KDE ’s reliance of QT , which would have required proprietary app developers to pay a licensing fee to Trolltech .
This eventually changed , but meanwhile GNOME had started to improve – and become the basis for Evolution , one of the first mail clients on any platform to include bayesian filtering and smart folders .
The major Open Source web browsers , Mozilla and then Firefox , also used the GTK theme to varying levels .
A few years later , Ubuntu was created from Debian .
Fedora was created from Red Hat .
Then SuSE brought GNOME boosters Ximian , and switched from GNOME to KDE as default .
Now : the most popular Linux desktops , Ubuntu , Fedora and OpenSuSE , use GNOME by default .
Meanwhile KDE spends its days convincing people that , er , 4.0 does n’t mean 4 .
Winner : GNOME
Open Source Operating Systems : BSD vs Linux
BSD took Unix , a popular proprietary operating system requiring proprietary hardware , and made it available for free on x86 under an Open Source license .
It existed before Linux did , and for the first few years Linux came along , and was technically superior in many ways , with securelevels , dependency based packaging , fantastic firewalling , and good documentation , before these features ( or their equivalents ) existed for Linux .
The only think it lacked was by design : BSD was licensed to allow anybodyo do pretty much anything they want with it , including take the source code and improve it without releasing the improvements back .
Folks loved the license , and took advantage of it – BSD ’s networking code and IP utilities ended up in Windows NT , other utilities ended up in NetApp Filers , and a bunch of other embedded firewalls are based on the entire OS .
Today , lots of people use BSD code .
They use it in proprietary applications , have no idea who created it , and have no idea that BSD exists as an Open Source general purpose operating system .
Meanwhile , the GPL license of Linux attracted more developers , creating better software , in turn attracting more developers .
Linux now does everything that was unique to BSD , a lot more it does n’t .
Winner : BSD .
Just kidding .
Windows Media Player and Flash Video
Windows Media Player trounced Real , and seemed unstoppable .
Meanwhile , Flash – which , as an essential plugin , also came with Windows , along with the growing - in - popularity Firefox and OSX ’s Safari , quietly added Sorenson Sparc video support .
Suddenly Flash was n’t just a plugin for animation and sound , but a video platform .
The timing was great .
The web video scene was starting to expand rapidly , now that users finally had the connections to handle it .
Flash was easier to update than Windows Media Player , and the quality was great – to the point Apple ( who make the less popular Quicktime ) sued Sorenson , the codec provider , claiming that Sorenson ’s technologies were licensed exclusively to them .
Subsequent updates added new and better codecs .
The plugin updated itself , and after a couple of years Flash video support was everywhere .
In 2005 Youtube and Revver ( and a plethora of wannabes ) came along , basing their business models on the new format .
In the last year , ever major video site has been based on Flash Video – and none on Windows Media .
Winner : Flash
Disagree ?
Think we ’ve missed a format war ?
Really , really , like Realplayer , and your sister can date who she wants ?
Comments below as usual .
New homes and schools should not be built within 60 metres of high voltage power lines until the link with childhood cancers is better understood by scientists , according to a committee of MPs .
They also recommend that home buyers should be provided with information on the level of electromagnetic fields within homes before they buy .
The committee says the science is still unclear and that any health effects are weak , but in the meantime it argues that the government should adopt a precautionary approach .
The Labour MP and GP Howard Stoate , who chaired the committee , said : " The overall body of evidence shows that there is undoubtedly a link between living near very high voltage power lines and childhood leukaemia .
We can't say that one causes the other but we can say that there is an association . "
He added : " I 've always got the view in science that if you do n't know something it is generally better to err on the side of caution , rather than to look back in 20 years time and say , if only we had done more 20 years ago . "
The most influential scientific study on the issue was published two years ago in the British Medical Journal .
It looked at the health records of nearly 30,000 children with cancer , including 9,700 with leukaemia and a similarly - sized group of healthy children .
The study found that those within 200 metres of power lines had a 70 % increase in their chance of developing leukaemia , compared with children living more than 600 metres from a power line .
Other epidemiological studies have failed to find a link and as yet no one has come up with a convincing biological mechanism that would explain how electromagnetic fields from power lines could cause cancer .
The committee of five MPs heard estimates of the number of excess cancer deaths attributable to power lines ranging from two to 60 a year .
The committee says the government should introduce a moratorium on home and school building within 60 metres of high voltage power lines and 30 metres of low voltage lines .
It also says that new power lines should not be built within 60 metres of homes and schools , and a larger building moratorium extending to 200 metres should be considered .
In evidence to the inquiry , Barratt Homes estimated that homes close to power lines already sell for 15 - 25 % less and that if a moratorium were introduced there would be an additional dip of 15 - 20 % in the price of such homes .
Edward Copisarow , chief executive of Children With Leukaemia , said : " This report really gives government the green light it needs to introduce precaution in the UK . "
Sydney 's famous skyline ( top image ) was shrouded in darkness
At 1930 ( 0930 GMT ) the city 's skyline dimmed and normally bright landmarks like the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge went dark .
The so - called Earth Hour is supported by the New South Wales government , environmental groups and businesses .
Sydney hopes the event will make a very big statement on climate change .
The city of four million people is aiming to become the first anywhere to achieve a blackout on this scale .
The BBC's Phil Mercer , in Sydney , says by and large Sydney had never been this dark .
He says lights were off in the majority of the central business district 's office blocks and large parts of the suburbs were also in darkness .
Co-operation
Greg Bourne of environmental group WWF , one of the driving forces behind Earth Hour , said the big switch off took months to plan .
" The logistics is really quite amazing in the sense every tower block is owned by one company , maybe leased by another company , have 10 tenants in and a manager and working through all of these people has been fantastic . "
Many restaurants signed up and planned to serve diners by candlelight .
The owner of the Newtown Hotel , which says it is Australia 's oldest gay bar , told the BBC before the blackout that they would have fun while trying to send a serious message .
" Sometimes drag queens [ female impersonators ] do look better in the dark anyway , " said Roger Zee .
" It 's up to the patrons .
They 'll actually have their own torches so they 'll be able to light up the drag queens on the stage themselves . "
Organisers want to encourage Australians to conserve energy and to think carefully about what they can do to cut pollution .
Every day millions of lights and computers are left on in deserted office blocks as well as in apartments and houses .
Campaigners have said that simply switching them off could reduce Sydney 's greenhouse gas emissions by 5 % over the next year .
Australia is one of the world 's largest per capita producers of carbon dioxide and other gases that many scientists believe are helping to warm the earth 's atmosphere .
A selection of your comments
We turned our household lights off for Earth Hour , although realistically it did n't make any difference to the amount of greenhouse gases generated .
I think most Sydneysiders saw Earth Hour as a way of expressing our growing awareness of the need to do something about the factors contributing to climate change rather than a ' fix ' for any part of the problem .
To that extent , it was a success .
Phil Keeffe , Sydney , Australia
Why does n't John Howard and his Premiers sign up to Kyoto instead of pulling off publicity stunts .
Perhaps this will get the residents of Australia to think and put pressure on their ' leaders ' to do so .
Andrew , Brisbane ( soon to be Edinburgh )
Have we already forgotten that Paris tried this too on the occasion of the International Panel on Climate Change conference just a month ago ?
The Eiffel tower lights went off , but most ordinary people did nothing .
At least for Paris we got numbers on the amount of power saved .
What for Sydney ?
Robert Cailliau , Prevessin , France
Well done Sydney !
Every city should follow .
I am not that old and I remember when public lights in cities were off from 11 pm to 6am !
gerome mortelecque , Toronto Canada
One hour ?
how much difference will that make to climate change .
adrian , ashby de la zouch
Kudos to Sydney !
Hong
Kong made a similar attempt last year but unlike its counterpart in New South Wales , the government refused to participate in the campaign , claiming that it would give " adverse publicity to Hong Kong as an international metropolis " .
Let 's hope that the precedent set by Sydney will help persuade other cities , and their governments , to follow suit .
C. Chan , Hong Kong
It 's true .
Sydney has never been so dark .
Fantastic !
Thank you to WWF for organising such an event .
Australian 's are cyring out for ways to get involved and make a difference .
Kath Eggleston , Sydney
I live in Sydney and I can assure you that the ' blackout ' did n't happen .
The lights on the bridge and opera house were turned off but the publicity stunt was completely ignored by the vast majority of ordinary people here .
The vast majority of people here did not turn off their lights .
Nick Mallory , Sydney
Amazing !
Very glad to hear of something like this happening .
Mr. Mallory , even if most people did n't turn of their lights , I 'm sure you would agree that the ' stunt ' at least got the world talking and citizens of other large cities wanting / working towards something similar .
Nicely done Sydney !
Raj Trivedi , Houston , Texas USA
Good on the Aussies !
Why is n't every country doing this ???
Lee , Bournemouth
I 'd like to commend Australia for taking such a bold initiative .
One can only imagine the scale of positive impact this can have if all the world 's major cities observed voluntary blackouts even for a few minutes if not hours .

" Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored . " ~ Aldous Huxley
The credit storm which began in July when two Bear Stearns hedge funds were forced to liquidate , has continued to intensify and roil the markets .
Last week the noose tightened around auction - rate securities , a little - known part of the market that requires short - term funding to set rates for long - term municipal bonds .
The $ 330 billion ARS market has dried up overnight pushing up rates as high as 20 % on some bonds  a new benchmark for short - term debt .
Auction - rate securities are now headed for extinction just like the other previously - vital parts of the structured finance paradigm .
The $ 2 trillion market for collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , the multi-trillion - dollar mortgage - backed securities market ( MBSs ) and the $ 1.3 asset - backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) market have all shut down , draining a small ocean of capital from the financial system and pushing many of the banks and hedge funds closer to default .
The price of insuring corporate bonds has skyrocketed in the last few weeks making it more difficult for businesses to get the funding they need to expand or continue present operations .
Much of this has to do with the growing uncertainty about the reliability of credit default swaps , a $ 45 trillion dollar market which remains virtually unregulated .
Credit - default swaps are a type of financial instrument that are used to speculate on a company ’s ability to repay debt .
They pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements .
When the price of CDSs increases , it means that there is greater doubt about the quality of the bond .
Prices are presently soaring because the entire structured finance market  and anything connected to it  is under withering attack from the meltdown in subprime mortgages .
As foreclosures continue to rise , the securities that were fashioned from subprime loans will continue to unwind , destroying trillions of dollars of virtual - capital in the secondary market .
It all sounds more complicated than it really is .
Imagine a 200 - ft. conveyor belt with two burly workers and a mountain - sized pile of money on one end , and a towering bonfire on the other .
Every time a home goes into foreclosure , the two workers stack the money that was lost on the transaction  plus all of the cash that was leveraged on the home via " securitization " and derivatives  onto the conveyor - belt where it is fed into the fire .
That is precisely what is happening right now and the amount of capital that is being consumed by the flames far exceeds the Fed ’s paltry increases to the money supply or Bush ’s projected $ 168 billion " surplus package . "
Capital is being sucked out of the system faster than it can be replaced , which is apparent by the sudden cramping in the financial system and a more generalized slowdown in consumer spending .
According to a recent Bloomberg article :
" A year ago $ 20 million would have gotten Luminent Mortgage Capital Inc. access to $ 640 million in loans to buy top-rated mortgage - backed securities .
Now that much cash gets the firm no more than $ 80 million .
… ( Only ) 6 lenders are offering 5 times leverage , while a year ago , 20 banks extended 33 times . "
The banks are not providing anywhere near as much money for leveraged investments as they did just last year .
And , when credit shrinks on a national scale  as it is  so does the economy .
It ’s a simple formula ; less money means less economic activity , less growth , fewer jobs , tighter budgets , more pain .
Bloomberg continues :
" Wall Street firms , reeling from $ 146 billion in losses on their debt holdings , are fueling a credit crisis by clamping down on lending to investors and hedge funds that use borrowed money to buy securities .
By pulling back , ( the banks ) are contributing to reduced demand and lower prices throughout the fixed - income world . "
The banks are in no position to be extravagant because they ’re already saddled with $ 400 billion in MBSs and CDOs  as well as another $ 170 billion in private equity deals  for which there is currently no market .
They ’ve had to dramatically cut back on their lending because they either do n’t have the resources or are facing bankruptcy in the near future .
An article which appeared on the front page of the Financial Times last week , illustrates how hard - pressed the banks really are :
" US banks have been quietly borrowing massive amounts of money from the Federal Reserve … $ 50 billion in one month . "
The Fed ’s new Term Auction Facility " allows the banks to borrow money against all sort of dodgy collateral , " says Christopher Wood , analyst at CLSA .
" The banks are increasingly giving the Fed the garbage collateral nobody else wants to take … [ this ] suggests a perilous condition for America ’s banking system . "
The move has sparked unease among some analysts about the stress developing in opaque corners of the US banking system and the banks ’ growing reliance on indirect forms of government support . "
( " US Banks borrow $ 50 billion via New Fed Facility , " Financial Times . )
( The story appeared nowhere in the US media . )
At the same time the banks are getting backdoor injections of liquidity from the Fed , banking giant Citigroup has been trying to off - load some of its branches so it can cover its structured investment losses .
It all looks rather desperate , but scouring the planet for capital to shore up flagging balance sheets is turning out to be a full - time job for many of America ’s largest investment banks .
It is the only way they can stay one step ahead of the hangman .
In the last few days , gold has spiked to $ 950 , a new high , while oil futures passed the $ 100 per barrel mark .
The battered greenback has already taken a beating , and yet , Fed chairman Bernanke is signaling that there are more rate cuts to come .
The prospect of a global run on the dollar has never been greater .
Still , Bernanke will do whatever he can to resuscitate the faltering banking system , even if he destroys the currency in the process .
Unfortunately , interest rates alone wo n’t cut it .
The banks need capital ; and fast .
Meanwhile , the waning dollar has sent food and energy prices soaring which is leaving consumers without the discretionary income they need for anything beyond the basic necessities .
As a result , retail sales are down and employers are forced to lay off workers to reduce their spending .
This is all part of the self - reinforcing negative - feedback loop that begins with falling home prices and then rumbles through the broader economy .
There is no chance that the economy will rebound until housing prices stabilize and the rate of foreclosures returns to normal .
But that could be a long way off .
With housing inventory at historic highs and mortgage applications at new lows , the economy could keep somersaulting down the stairwell for a full two years or more .
Only then , will we hit rock - bottom .
The country is now headed into a deep and protracted recession .
Low interest credit and financial innovation have paralyzed the credit markets while inflating a monstrous equity bubble that is wreaking havoc with the world ’s financial system .
The new market architecture , " structured finance " has collapsed from the stress of falling asset - values and rising defaults .
Many of the banks are technically insolvent already , hopelessly mired in their own red ink .
Public confidence in the nations ’ financial institutions has never been lower .
Monetary policy and deregulation have failed .
The system is self - destructing .
Now that the credit crunch has rendered the markets dysfunctional , spokesmen for the investor class are speaking out and confirming what many have suspected from the very beginning ; that the present troubles originated at the Federal Reserve and , ultimately , they are the ones who are responsible for the meltdown .
In an article in the Wall Street Journal this week , Harvard economics professor and former Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan , Martin Feldstein , made this revealing admission :
" There is plenty of blame to go around for the current situation .
The Federal Reserve bears much of the responsibility , because of its failure to provide the appropriate supervisory oversight for the major money center banks .
The Fed ’s banking examiners have complete access to all of the financial transactions of the banks that they supervise , and should have the technical expertise to evaluate the risks that those banks are taking .
Because these banks provide credit to the nonbank financial institutions , the Fed can also indirectly examine what those other institutions are doing .
The Fed ’s bank examinations are supposed to assess the adequacy of each bank ’s capital and the quality of its assets .
The Fed declared that the banks had adequate capital because it gave far too little weight to their massive off balance - sheet positions  the structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) , conduits and credit line obligations  that the banks have now been forced to bring onto their balance sheets .
Examiners also overstated the quality of the banks ’ assets , failing to allow for the potential bursting of the house price bubble .
The implication of this for Fed supervision policy is clear .
The way out of the current crisis is not . "
How odd ?
So , when all else fails , tell the truth ?
But Feldstein is right ; the Fed refused to perform its oversight duties because its friends in the banking industry were raking in obscene profits selling sketchy , subprime junk to gullible investors around the world .
They knew about the " massive off balance - sheet positions " which allowed the banks ’ to create mortgage - backed securities and CDOs without sufficient capital reserves .
They knew it all ; every last bit of it , which simply proves that the Federal Reserve is an organization which serves the exclusive interests of the banking establishment and their corporate brethren in the financial industry .
Surprised ?
The upcoming global recession / depression will give us plenty of time to mull over the ruinous effects of Fed policy and to devise a plan for abolishing the Federal Reserve once and for all .
That is , if they do n’t destroy us first .

Mr Karunanidhi refuses to budge from his stand
M Karunanidhi also said there was no proof that Lord Ram had constructed a bridge where a new shipping canal is planned between India and Sri Lanka .
Hard - line Hindu groups say the chief minister 's statement is blasphemous .
On Tuesday Hindu activists angered by the comments set fire to a Tamil Nadu bus , killing two people , police said .
Enraged Hindu hardliners in the city of Bangalore , in neighbouring Karnataka state , also attacked the home of Mr Karunanidhi's daughter , Selvi .
Apology sought
Hindu scripture says the area between India and Sri Lanka - now known as Adam 's Bridge - was built millions of years ago by Lord Ram , supported by an army of monkeys .
But scientists and archaeologists say Adam's Bridge , or Ram Setu , is a natural formation of sand and limestone .
Hard - line Hindu groups say a proposed canal project between India and Sri Lanka will destroy the bridge .
They say Mr Karunanidhi's statement is blasphemous and have demanded an apology from him .
Hindu devotees believe the " bridge " was built by Lord Ram
" You tell me whether Ram lived .
I had only stated that there was no person in the name of Lord Ram .
What is wrong in that ? "
Mr Karunanidhi is reported to have told a TV channel .
On Saturday , addressing a public rally , Mr Karunanidhi had asked : " Who is this Ram ?
From which engineering college did he graduate ? "
Angered by his statement , Hindu hard - line groups have demanded his dismissal and arrest .
Last Wednesday , the Archaeological Survey of India told the Supreme Court that religious texts were not evidence that Lord Ram ever existed .
Hard - line Hindu opponents of the government accused the administration of blasphemy and protesters held demonstrations in the area and in Delhi , Bhopal and on a number of key highways .
The next day the report was withdrawn .
In a damage control exercise , two directors of the Archaeological Survey of India were suspended and Culture Minister Ambika Soni offered to resign .
The government wants to build a canal to link the Palk Strait with the Gulf of Mannar by dredging a canal through the shallow sea .
The $ 560 m Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project is expected to provide a continuous navigable sea route around the Indian peninsula and is expected to boost the economic and industrial development of the region .

Analysis by Nicholas Olczak
March 24 , 2008
On April 9 , San Francisco will be the only North American city to host the Olympic torch on its relay journey between Greece and Beijing .
Local activists have called for the city to boycott this event , asserting that the torch is “ a symbol of [ the ] bloodshed and oppression ” that has been practiced by China .
Mayor Gavin Newsom , whilst indicating that he is sensitive to human rights issues in China , has defended San Francisco ’s reception of the torch by arguing that it carries different symbolism .
Need for reform
“ It ’s important to remember that the Olympic spirit is one of international harmony and goodwill , and it transcends politics , ” Newsom spokesperson Nathan Ballard said .
“ In this spirit , San Francisco is proud to be the only North American city to host the Olympic torch relay . ”
The words “ in this spirit ” here are important .
Deciding whether or not to boycott the torch , the public is essentially deciding whether they believe it symbolizes the Olympic spirit of equality , or the legitimacy of the Chinese regime .
The Olympic torch is first of all an Olympic symbol .
It is not intrinsically a political symbol , but acts as a vessel into which people pour their own meaning .
How much we can empty it of those meanings once given is debatable .
If one argues that the torch only represents the Olympic spirit now , you are liable to be labeled as a supporter of oppression and told you are turning a blind eye to China ’s crimes .
In reality , few on either side would dispute the controversial human rights record of the Chinese regime and the need for reform .
Domestically , much attention has been drawn recently to China ’s persistent use of capital punishment and the execution of an estimated 7,500 each year .
Many dissidents are executed , and other criminals punished , without a fair trial , often simply for speaking out against the state .
An excuse to squash dissent in Tibet
This week ’s uprising in Lhasa has brought China ’s controversial occupation and suppression of Tibet to the world ’s attention .
China maintains that Tibet is an integral part of its state and has been since the Yuan dynasty in the 13th Century .
Central to Tibetan independence arguments is the fact that this conquest was undertaken by Manchu and Mongol dynasties which some claim are not technically Chinese .
In 1912 , a conference of Britain , China and Tibet gave the region autonomy , but in 1950 the Communists established military rule in Tibet .
China ’s response to the uprising by monks this week marks the last in a long legacy of aggressive suppression .
What ’s different and also worrying this time , however , is the reported violence from Tibetan protesters which gives the Chinese Government their excuse to act .
A further , spreading stain on China ’s human rights record is its continued support of the Sudanese Government despite their involvement in assaults on civilians .
Aid organizations estimate that 200,000 people have died and more than 2 million have been displaced in Darfur .
China helps to fund the Sudanese regime by buying around 60 percent of its oil .
It has sold weapons to the Sudanese government , and has used its UN veto to block actions which might resolve the crisis .
China ’s “ strategic and supportive relationship with the Sudanese government ” recently led actress Mia Farrow to attack China and encourage Stephen Spielberg to boycott the Olympics and pull out as adviser for the opening ceremony .
As these high profile boycotts indicate , our local decision on how to respond to the torch is part of a greater choice nations are making about how to respond to the Olympics this summer .
Is boycotting the Olympics an effective way to push for reform in China ?
As with the torch , this decision is essentially a battle between a belief that the Olympics can promote human equality and a belief that it is promoting the Chinese regime .
It might also be asked whether one could boycott the torch but not the Olympic competition .
Some argue that taking a stance on the first necessitates following through on the second .
Others say you can boycott the torch relay , as an event simply promoting China , while continuing to assess the Olympic competition because this offers a much more ambiguous mix of promotion and potential for change .
South Korea transformed
The International Olympic Commission ( IOC ) , supported by the UN , gave the Olympics to Beijing believing that this could help to reform China ’s human rights situation .
They pointed to how the 1988 Seoul games helped transform South Korea from a military dictatorship to a democracy .
China made strong promises to improve its human rights record .
The IOC has stuck by their decision .
Some would argue that this is corroding the organization ’s reputation .
They argue for now boycotting the games based principally on China ’s failure to deliver these changes .
Chinese government oppression
Shortly after winning the games , Deputy Chinese Prime minister Li Lanqing declared that the victory encouraged the country to maintain its “ healthy life ” by combatting such problems as the Falun Gong spiritual movement .
Hu -Jintau , the then vice president , argued that the victory made it crucial to fight separatists forces , such as Tibetan and minority activists , throughout the country .
The police were instructed to launch a crack down on crime and since began forcibly evicting rural migrant workers , beggars , vagrants , and sex workers from Beijing .
Human Rights
Watch has extensively documented the Chinese government ’s “ tightening chokehold against political activism , ” arresting dissidents like Hu Jia , Chen Shuqing , Yang Xenshue , and Jiang Zhianghong .
The International Olympic Commission and many world leaders continue , however , to believe in the potential the Olympics has to be a positive force .
They argue that China has not yet had enough time to show changes .
“ One must never forget that China has a time - frame which is totally different from the rest of the world and progress can not always be measured by the same time standard , ” IOC ’s legal advisor Francois Carrard said .
“ China is different ” arguments are commonly used to justify treating China in a particular way .
When deciding whether to boycott , we must ask how different China is from other countries and whether this difference can account for its difficulty in changing .
South Korea ’s move to democracy suggests that dramatic change can be made in seven years , but it is much smaller than China .
Soviet Russia required a much longer time frame to break down its authoritarian mechanism .
Press scrutiny
Whilst the run up is important , it can be argued that the Olympics will not exert its full influence over China until the summer months .
Then millions of foreign citizens and press will descend on Beijing , parading their values and subjecting the Chinese regime to close scrutiny .
Many recognize the potential for change that still exists .
Carrard recently declared that he is “ convinced that when we look at this with the perspective of history , we will see that the Olympic Games will have been an opportunity for considerable progress . ”
Amnesty International spokesperson Mike Blakemore , who might have been expected to push for boycott , recently stated that we should continue to support the games because they offered a “ fantastic opportunity ” to discuss human rights issues .
The loss of this opportunity through a boycott arguably outweighs the loss which China would suffer , particularly if only some nations chose to boycott .
IOC vice president Thomas Bach said boycotting the games “ would be the wrong way because that will cut lines of communication . ”
On top of this is the fact that a boycott would deny many athletes the chance to compete in a competition they have been training for their whole lives .
With athletes ’ peak performance being so short , and the Olympics occurring every 4 years , for many athletes this might be their only opportunity to compete .
Lowest on the list of losses , but from a pragmatic point of view , is the lost business an Olympic boycott would inflict .
Some might argue that America cannot afford to boycott .
Would China even listen to a boycott ?
There is evidence to suggest that it would .
Dissident Wei Jingsheng , who was imprisoned for 18 years , has said that his treatment and conditions in prison were directly related to protests made outside of China .
The more fuss people made , the better his situation was .
He argues China often uses the West ’s lack of popular protest as an example of democracies failings .
The Guardian ’s Lawrence Donegan puts the counter argument succinctly as “ the barbarians in Beijing could n’t care less what anyone else thinks . ”
In his book The Political Olympics , Derek Hulme suggests that the former Soviet Union failed to get the envisioned message from America ’s 1980 boycott .
Instead they saw the lack of European backing for the boycott as a sign of western division .
This warns of the danger that a boycott could push the Chinese Government to become more authoritarian and give them a symbol of western aggression to justify this .
A further question is whether America ’s own human rights record allows it to pass judgments on China without showing moral hypocrisy .
US complicity in human rights violations
Although the US executes fewer people each year , America shares China ’s continual application of the death penalty .
CIA water boarding and wiretapping show that the American government has its equivalents of China ’s torture and censorship techniques .
The arrest and treatment of those at Guantanamo Bay is comparable to China ’s detention of criminals without trial .
While China has been criticized for its unlawful occupation of Tibet , America has occupied Iraq without the approval of the UN .
Involvement in Iraq might be seen as a warning about America exercising judgments on foreign nations .
Others might equally argue that this is like saying somebody who ’s done something wrong ca n’t then do anything right .
America could possibly improve its human rights record by acting on this issue .
The ‘ let he who is without sin ’ argument is an easy way to justify no country ever acting in the world sphere , because we have all been tainted by past crimes .
Some would say progress can only be made on such issues based on the assumption that America , and China , can change their natures .
One must also distinguish between the American government , which is directly implicated in human rights crimes , and the people who remain freer from such moral responsibility .
Some argue that if the world were to take a lenient stance on China , this could have a domino effect , removing the legitimacy foreign nations have for opposing human rights abuses in other countries .
This argument suggests we cannot take a stand against the totalitarian regime in Burma , whilst simultaneously endorsing oppression in China .
But acting on China could also set a contrasting precedent which would oblige the US to intervene in more countries .
Could the US protest against Chinese occupation of Tibet , whilst not speaking out about Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian territories ?
Those who are in favor of boycotting the Olympics also ask , would n’t supporting the Beijing Olympics be co-operating with actions of a totalitarian regime ?
This outcry comes from a confusion between engagement and acquiescence .
It is the same outcry which Sen. Barack Obama recently met with when he said that he would speak with Fidel Castro .
Terror talks
Last week , the Guardian UK ran an excellent article entitled “ Terror talks : would contacting al - Qaida be a step too far ? ”
It highlighted how the discussions about Northern Ireland have proved the reforming value of close contact with those involved in actions we might condemn .
It identifies how refusing such contact normally tends to push those involved to more extreme viewpoints .
Importantly however , the article distinguished between being in the same room as such figures and agreeing with them .
With such complex factors and predictions about how China might react , deciding whether or not to boycott the Games is not straightforward .
Foreign nations and their citizens should continue to engage with the Olympics , but on their own terms .
They should engage in events , but do so assessing whether their engagement is supporting an Olympic spirit that can improve human rights , or a Chinese oppressive regime .
They should be prepared to change their attitude to the games in response to the conclusions drawn on this .
For most people , that ’s all you need .
A website that ’s good enough .
Not that breaks new ground , establishes a new identity , discovers new ways for people to interact online .
Just a good enough website that did n’t kill you to launch .
To be clear , the following advice assumes that :
You ’re not trying to reinvent the idea of a web page –that the page is a means to an end
You work with other people
So , here ’s what you do .
First , realize that traditionally , the job
of designer has been linked with the job of programmer .
There were very
good reasons for this .
Designing a page that ca n’t work is silly , and
changing the design every time you change the way the page works can be
time consuming and expensive .
As a result , web design became a sacred art , one done only by the
blessed few , in caverns far away from where mortals tread .
In addition ,
it became expensive , because design changes ( which marketers love to
make ) got in the same queue as programming changes .
We need to start by divorcing the two practices .
There ’s no longer a
really good reason for the two to be so closely linked , especially
since disciplined use of CSS and testing pays such dividends .
Start with design .
Do n’t involve the programming team until you ’re
90 % done with the look and feel of your pages .
It ’s cheap to change
design if it ca n’t by supported by programming , and cheaper and faster
to have design done in Photoshop before you commit to cutting it up and
coding it .
I ’m going to go out on a limb and beg you not to create an original
design .
There are more than a billion pages on the web .
Surely there ’s
one that you can start with ?
If your organization can’t find a website that you all agree can serve as a model , you need to stop right now and find a new job .
Not a site to rip - off , but an inspiration .
Fonts and colors and layout .
The line spacing .
The interactions .
Why
not ?
Your car is n’t unique , and your house might not be either .
If
you ’ve got a site that sells 42 kinds of wrapping paper , why not start
by finding a successful site that sells …
I do n’t know , shoes or
yo - yo ’s … something that both appeals to your target audience and has
been tested and tweaked and works .
No , do n’t pick a competitor .
That
will get you busted .
Pick a reasonably small but successful site in a
totally different line of work .
Say to your designer : " That ’s our
starting point .
Do n’t change any important design element without
asking me first .
Now , pull in our products , our logo and our company
color scheme and let ’s take a look at it . "
At this point , some people are aghast !
Should n’t the web be a design contest on top of everything else ?
I do n’t think so .
Now , take your finished Photoshop pages and get every single person
who can possibly veto your project to say okay .
THEN give it to
engineering to make it work .
[ Boy , am I in trouble .
People hate posts like this one .
They read all sorts of things into it that I do n’t intend .
I ’m certainly not against bespoke design , or designers .
I certainly do n’t believe that all engineers are bad designers or even difficult to deal with .
The point of the post is most definitely not to encourage you to commit copyright violations or even ethical ones .
It merely works to recognize two things :
1 . If you are unable to agree on an existing site , you are sure going to spend a lot of time and money trying to agree on a custom one .
2 . The process of design and user interaction is best done separately from the process of server speed , database structure and uptime .
Forgive me !]
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ridiculed the federal government ’s rebate checks as being “ like giving a drink to an alcoholic ” on Thursday , and said that presidential candidates were looking for easy solutions to complex economic problems .
The mayor also said the nation “ has a balance sheet that ’s starting to look more and more like a third - world country . ”
President George W. Bush signed legislation on Wednesday that will result in cash rebates ranging from $ 300 to $ 1,200 for more than 130 million people .
The federal checks are the centerpiece of the government ’s emergency effort to stimulate the economy .
Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly said that he is not a candidate , and explained recently he is speaking out on national issues as part of an “ experiment ” to influence the dialogue in the race .
The complaint filed in the Emperors Club escort bust , which apparently nabbed Eliot Spitzer , casts a rare spotlight on the dealings between the wealthy and high - priced escort services .
( See the Journal 's article on Mr. Spitzer . )
For one , the complaint makes clear that the wealth boom -- and the explosion in the number of multi-millionaires -- has created entirely new pricing levels for escorts .
According to the complaint , the Emperors Club escorts charged between $ 1,000 and $ 5,000 an hour , depending on their " rankings . "

The polling has been bad this primary cycle .
Last year 's national polls were wrong - for both parties .
The late polls in New Hampshire were wrong .
Even in a state like Virginia , where McCain was supposed to win by a huge margin , he only won by a modest margin .
What is more , pollsters have disagreed in state after state .
One predicts California going to Romney .
Another predicts it going to McCain .
What is going on ?
There are surely many answers to the question .
I 'd like to suggest one I have not seen discussed in depth .
Let 's start by taking note of an observation that political scientists have made since the 1950s .
That is , average voters do not pay much attention to politics .
This is a hard pill for political junkies to swallow , but swallow it we must .
Indeed , I think most of the many inferential errors of inside - the - Beltway pundits can be chalked up to their false assumption that voters pay as much attention as they do .
They need to get over this .
It is just false .
We move from this starting point to a question : how do voters pick their candidate despite these low levels of information ?
Most researchers will tell you that they make use of cognitive heuristics - mental shortcuts that help them make decisions amidst uncertainty .
Uncertainty is the consequence of inattention .
Voters simply do not know that much about what is going on - but they nevertheless make a vote choice .
Their mental shortcuts are tried - and - true ways of making good decisions despite this uncertainty .
Think of it this way .
Political junkies might know the in 's - and - out 's of each candidate 's health care proposals .
They can thus make decisions about which they like best .
However , the average voter does not have this kind of information .
Yet , when he gets to the voting booth , he gets the same choice that the junkie does .
The shortcut is his way through the uncertainty .
This leads us to another question - what serves as the shortcut ?
The answer for virtually the entire country is partisan identification .
Upwards of 90 % of the nation has some kind of party affiliation .
This is despite the polls that identify the size of the independent vote as larger .
It is not .
There is , for sure , some portion of the country that tells the pollsters they are independent - but when we look carefully at them , we see that most of them lean to one party or the other .
Not only is party identification held by almost all of us - it is an incredibly precise predictor of vote choice .
Republicans will almost always go 90/10 for the Republican candidate .
Democrats will do the same for their candidate .
Most of us have a party identification , and most of us rely on it quite heavily .
What does that mean in a general election ?
If partisanship is a near universal feature that is incredibly powerful , the preferences of most voters are anchored throughout the campaign - even though they are paying very little attention .
They do not have to pay attention to know whom they will vote for .
Accordingly , we will see the polls vary only a little bit throughout the campaign .
Oftentimes , they will break in late October or even early November .
However , the magnitude of the break will be relatively modest .
This is not to say it will be inconsequential ; just a few point swings in either direction could make a difference in many states .
They might swing by +/- 10 points during the whole cycle - but this is paltry compared to some of the massive swings in this primary cycle .
A big reason for this stability is partisanship .
As I said , it serves as an anchor .
That is a good metaphor for it .
Partisanship anchors preferences , keeping them from swaying , drifting , or listing wildly during the campaign .
In a primary campaign , voters must choose among candidates who are all of the same party .
Partisanship therefore does not enter into their decisions .
It is a non-factor .
I think this might be inducing the wild swings in the polls .
The polls are varying because the voters are ; the voters are varying because their partisanship is not stabilizing their preferences .
Of course , primary voters tend to pay more attention to politics than general election voters .
This probably makes them more able to make decisions without the use of their partisanship .
Nevertheless , they still pay a price for not being able to use it .
To say that primary voters are better informed than general election voters is not to say that they are well informed , or that they behave how the media implicitly assumes they do ( i.e. carefully following every speech , parsing every sentence , keeping a constantly updated evaluation of the state of the race , etc ) .
They do not do this .
It thus should be unsurprising that candidate personalities are so influential in voters ' decision - making processes .
How else do you make determinations when party distinctions are non-existent ?
Candidates often try to create clear contrasts , but these usually amount to making mountains out of molehills .
The average voter is not really paying much attention , anyway .
Thus , they have to go by their personal evaluations of the candidates .
This is not to say that vote choices are random .
Clearly , there has been a regular pattern to the early contests .
Certain types of voters obviously prefer certain types of candidates .
The point is that without partisanship , personality is what makes the difference .
And voters do not start to take careful note of personalities until late in the cycle .
Consider that 48 % of New Hampshire Democrats claimed to make their choice in the last week of the campaign .
From a certain standpoint , that is incredible .
If you think about all of the attention political junkies have paid to this race since last January - it is almost unbelievable to think that voters would not have decided months ago .
But , if we put ourselves in the shoes of the average voters , and try to recreate their thought processes - it makes a lot of sense .
Their partisanship cannot serve as a quick , easy guide .
Thus , they have to take a good , long look at the candidates as people .
Given their typical inattention to politics , the time when this happens is the last week or so .
This might explain the wide variability of the primary polling .
Because they have not been anchored by partisanship - voter opinions have been unstable for most of the cycle , up until the very end when we are wont to see a massive break in one direction or another .
The " error " in the polls might simply be a reflection of public indecision .
For that matter , Clinton 's massive lead through most of last year might have its origins here as well - without their partisanship , poll respondents had little to go on except their vague sense of the media 's consensus view of the race .
Predictably , they claimed to support Clinton .
Finally , this might account for momentum .
Voters take a close look at winners at precisely the moment they are basking in the glow of positive media coverage .
Unsurprisingly , researchers have found that more informed voters are less susceptible to momentum effects .
These considerations have two implications .
The first is good news for pollsters : life will get better for you !
When we move into the general election - the polls will settle down and start agreeing with one another .
I would note the stability in those head - to - head match - ups .
They have barely budged an inch even as the race in both parties has been chaotic .
Given that voters have their party identification to ground their general election responses to the pollsters - it makes sense they would be steady .
The second is a warning to consumers of political news : continue to be wary of these primary polls .
Without partisanship anchoring vote choices , they are still prone to large dramatic shifts at the last minute .
That 's what happens when voters try to make decisions without their use of most trusted cue , their partisanship .

look at these amazing works crafted from packing tape by ukraine born , philadelphia - based artist mark khaisman .
these large archetypal images are made from layer upon layer of translucent packing tape , applied to plexiglass and then placed in front of a light box to give the image shadow and depth .
mark is inspired by people , places and things which have a classic style to them .
he believes that reinterpreting these classics , using his medium and method , transforms these iconic figures and objects into a remarkable personal experience for the viewer .
this conceptual idea with realistic stylings is a tad outre and quite an intriguing combination .
his medium may be pedestrian , but his technique is noteworthy and the universally appealing objects and scenes that he chooses to recreate serve to create a bridge between his art and the viewer .
mark has a solo show coming up at the woodmere art museum in philadelphia .
it will be held from january 27th to march 8th .
please tell me if any of you are able to go and view these incredible pieces in person !

Television footage from President Bush 's African trip show his efforts to fit in , to " go native " but like his failed abstinence only policies , he keeps missing the beat .
Television footage from President Bush 's African trip show his efforts to fit in , to " go native " and find his rhythm , or any rhythm at all , but like his failed abstinence only policies , he keeps missing the beat .
But the crowds cheer , at least on television , and who would n't ?
To cash strapped African leaders , a dollar is a dollar and if they have to teach abstinence to get it , they will , and keep on cheering .
That does n't mean the policies work .
As Congressman Tom Lantos pointed out before he died , they do n't , and it is time for facts not ideology to drive this debate .
Away from the cheering African crowds , reality continues to rear its ugly head .
Today 's LA Times editorial , Married to HIV , is in synch with reality , taking on President Bush , his failed abstinence only programs , and the extreme far - right social conservatives on the House Foreign Relations Committee who continue to preach ideology over reality .
From the LA Times :
The religious right has begun whipping up the hysteria , calling the Lantos bill the " Pro-Aborts Emergency Plan for Abstinence Reduction . "
In fact , the bill would do nothing to alter the long - standing ban on U.S. funding for abortion .
What it would do is increase the availability of contraception for poor African women — and that is desperately overdue .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

Religious groups are fixated on the need to stop HIV transmission through premarital and extramarital sex , but what 's killing African women by the millions is unprotected sex with their husbands .
Yet the United States spends more on promoting abstinence and fidelity programs ( $ 198 million in fiscal 2007 ) than on promoting condom use ( $ 147 million in 2007 ) .
Roughly 10 million African girls under the age of 18 are married each year , many to older men who seek HIV - free brides .
To those wedded to HIV - positive men [ sic ] , marriage often means a death sentence .
They have little power to control their husbands ' condom use or extramarital behavior ; they are more likely than young men to contract HIV ; and those who know they 're infected and do not want to bear children often have no access to contraception .
By providing life - saving drugs to HIV - positive pregnant women , the president 's program claims to have prevented 157,000 infants from becoming infected .
This is a huge accomplishment .
What the U.S. funding has n't done is reduce unwanted pregnancies .
In a clinic in Uganda where pregnant HIV - positive women were receiving anti-retroviral treatment , 93 % reported that their pregnancies were unintended .
It 's no surprise that many HIV - positive women do not wish to bear children whom they might infect with the virus or leave orphaned .
It 's cruel to deny contraception to such poor and sick women should they desire it .
And as a public health matter , it 's far cheaper to prevent unwanted pregnancies than to prevent mother - child HIV transmission .
Yet U.S. funding for family planning has flat - lined .
Of course , the far - right sees it differently .
Chuck Colson writes ,
The revised bill also undoes rules that prevent money from funding abortions .
So out of the 50 billion dollar pot for HIV / AIDS relief , much of it could be diverted from faith - based groups to abortion providers .
While that may inflame the anti-choice donor base and activate their phone lines to Congress , the reality is that since 1973 , US law ( the Helms Amendment ) has prohibited any US foreign assistance from being used to provide abortion services “ as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions . ”
At no time in 35 years has any organization been found to be in violation of this law .
Reproductive health advocates hoping to apply lessons learned from the first five years of PEPFAR argue that the Lantos Bill provides funding to ensure prevention of mother - to - child transmission of HIV .
Instead of forcing failed abstinence programs on African agencies that have told us they do n't work , the Lantos Bill provides voluntary contraceptive information , counseling and supplies to HIV positive women wishing to plan their families .
Such services are recognized by both the World Health Organization and Office of the Global AIDS coordinator as essential .
Voluntary contraceptive services reduce unintended pregnancies .
Despite these facts , the far right beat goes on , insisting that 33 cents of every US tax dollar sent to Africa to prevent HIV / AIDS be spent on ideological programs that do n't work .
The Institutes of Medicine says ,
The [ abstinence ] earmark has greatly limited the ability of Country Teams to develop and implement comprehensive prevention programs that are well integrated with each other and with counseling and testing , care , and treatment programs and that target those at greatest risk .
and that they were
unable to find evidence for the position that abstinence can stand alone or that 33 percent is the appropriate allocation for such activities even within integrated programs .
The Government Accounting Office says ,
… 17 of 20 PEPFAR teams … reported that the spending requirement presents challenges [ in responding ] to local epidemiology and cultural and social norms .
Despite these facts , at next week 's hearings , the push to compromise with the far - right Congressmen who want to ignore reality will be strong .
One would think , based on the strength of the far - right 's rhetoric , that people pushing the Lantos Bill were actually trying to eliminate abstinence programs altogether .
They are not .
They are simply eliminating the earmark that forces 33 percent of funds to be spent in this specific way .
In fact , the Lantos Bill promotes measurable outcomes for increases in abstinence , delay of sexual debut , and behavior change that everyone acknowledges are critical aspects of comprehensive programs .
Let 's hope Congress can follow the beat of reality in Africa better than President Bush , by standing firm and passing the Lantos Bill so our efforts to prevent the spread of HIV / AIDS in Africa are in synch with what we 've learned from public health experts in the first five years of PEPFAR .
RPI 's battery is paper - thin , can be cut into a variety of shapes ­Credit : Image courtesy Rensselaer / Victor Pushparaj
­ Batteries­ are pr­actically essential devices but present a whole ho­st of problems .
Over time they can have trouble retaining a charge .
Some stop working altogether .
Others overheat or leak or even explode .
They 're also rigid and sometimes bulky .
Then how about , instead of your standard AA or lithium - ion , a flexible , incredibly thin battery that could be powered by blood or sweat ?
Seems like an improvement , right ?
­­
­A group of scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute claims they 've created just such a battery , one that uses the electrolytes naturally found in bodily fluids .
The results of the research , detailed in the Aug. 13 , 2007 , issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , are generating some excitement as part of a new crop of " bio- batteries " that run off of bodily fluids or other organic compounds .
( The RPI team claims that theirs could even run on tears or urine . )

The battery is not only as thin as paper ; it essentially is paper .
At least 90 percent of the battery is made from cellulose , which makes up traditional paper and other paper products [ source : RPI ] .
Aligned carbon nanotubes make up the other 10 percent , give the paper its conductive abilities and also make it black .
The nanotubes are imprinted in the very fabric of the paper , creating what 's called a nanocomposite paper .
One of the paper 's authors said that the battery " looks , feels and weighs the same as paper " [ source : RPI ] .
Using nanotechnology , the battery 's small size , flexibility and replenishing electrolyte source -- that is , as long as you eat -- make it ideal for medical applications .
When using the battery away from the human body , scientists soaked the paper in an ionic fluid ( a salt in liquid form ) , which provides the electrolytes .
­ The battery 's paper - like construction grants it significant flexibility .
The RPI research team believes that the battery could , in the future , be printed in long sheets , which could then be cut into small , custom - shaped batteries .
The nanocomposite paper can have holes poked in it or be cut into unusual shapes and continue to function .
Several sheets could be lumped together to power medical implants , such as pacemakers , artificial hearts or advanced prosthetics .
The battery would easily fit under the skin without causing any discomfort .
Because the ionic liquid used does n't freeze or evaporate like water , the battery could be employed at a wide range of temperatures : from - 100 degrees Fahrenheit up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit .
Its temperature resistance and light weight mean that manufacturers of automobiles and airplanes -- both of which require light , durable materials -- may come calling .
The researchers behind the battery claim that their device is unique because it can act " as both a high - energy battery and a high - power supercapacitor " [ source : RPI ] .
­Supercapacitors allow for large , quick bursts of energy , potentially extending the technology 's already wide range of applications .
The battery , which is considered environmentally friendly because of its lack of chemicals and high cellulose content , was announced in the summer of 2007 , but it may be years before it 's ready to stream off production lines in long sheets .
The RPI research team says that , in the meantime , they 're trying to boost the battery 's efficiency and to figure out the best method for production .

“ Not if you were the last man on earth ! ” Plenty of guys have heard that line at some point in their lives , but it ’s unlikely that Will Smith is one .
His irresistible charm has been proved , above all , by his ability to attract audiences to bad movies like “ Hitch ” and “ Wild Wild West , ” as well as to better ones like “ Ali ” and “ The Pursuit of Happyness . ”
In spite of its third - act collapse into obviousness and sentimentality , “ I Am Legend ”  in which Mr. Smith plays somebody with every reason to believe that he really is the last man on earth  is among the better ones .
And this star , whose amiability makes him easy to underestimate as an actor , deserves his share of the credit .
There are not many performers who can make themselves interesting in isolation , without human supporting players .
Tom Hanks did it in “ Cast Away , ” with only a volleyball as his buddy , foil and straight man .
Mr. Smith has a few more companions , including an expressive German shepherd , some department store mannequins and a high - powered rifle .
( There are also some flesh - eating , virus - crazed zombies , about which more in a moment . )
But it is the charismatic force of his personality that makes his character ’s radical solitude scary and fascinating , as well as strangely appealing .
In this Mr. Smith is helped , and to some degree upstaged , by the island of Manhattan , which the movie ’s director , Francis Lawrence , has turned into a post - apocalyptic wilderness .
Three years after an epidemic has caused the evacuation and quarantine of New York City , Robert Neville ( Mr. Smith ) is its sole diurnal human resident , and he spends his days roaming its desolate neighborhoods , at once wary and carefree .
The streetscapes he wanders through will be familiar to any visitor or resident , but the way Mr. Lawrence and his team of digital - effects artists have distressed and depopulated New York is downright uncanny .
Weeds poke up through the streets , which are piled with abandoned cars , and a slow , visible process of decay has set in .
A nightmare , of course , but not without its enchantments .
In some ways Neville , dwelling in a highly developed urban space that is also a wilderness , experiences the best of both worlds .
From his home base in the elegant Washington Square town house he was lucky enough to own ( on a government employee ’s salary ) before the big die - off , he makes daylight forays that are like an adventure - tourist fantasy .
He does a little deer hunting on Park Avenue and some indoor fishing at the Temple of Dendur , picks fresh corn in Central Park and smacks golf balls across the Hudson from the deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid .

An estimated 300,000 cetaceans are killed by nets each year
Enlarge Image
The football - sized " acoustic cat 's eyes " reflect sonar signals .
They have been designed to mark underwater locations such as channels that have been cleared of explosives .
But the developers believe a smaller version could be fitted to fishing nets to reduce the estimated 300,000 creatures caught in nets every year .
" Most of the time they swim into the net because they can't see it on their own sonar , " explained Carl Tiltman of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ( DSTL ) which is behind the innovation .
Devices strung along the net will reflect cetaceans ' ( whales , dolphins and porpoises ) own sonar , alerting them to the presence of a net .
" It will know something is there and will not just swim straight into it , " said Mr Tiltman .
When we go into places like the North Arabian Gulf and we find a mined area we need to mark it
Carl Tiltman
There have so far been no trials of the device for preventing by - catch but DSTL plan to do so in the future .
" That 's where we will go , " said Mr Tiltman .
Conservationists believe that they could be of use but say that other means of reducing by - catch such as moving fisheries also need to be considered .
Mine marker
The spherical devices consist of a glass - reinforced plastic shell with a core of silicon gel .
When acoustic energy hits them it splits .
" Some of it goes through the shell and some of it goes through the central core , " Mr Tiltman told BBC News .
The acoustic waves - travelling at different speeds - propagate through the passive device and meet at the back - exactly 180 degrees from where they entered .
The football - sized devices could be used to mark pipelines
" The trick is to make sure that the speed of sound in the two materials is correct so it hits the point at the same time . "
At this point the waves undergo " constructive interference " - creating a more intense signal than the individual waves .
This is then reflected back from the device towards the ship or dolphin .
Around 80 % of the received energy is beamed back .
The beacons were designed to replace older devices that consisted of metal discs filled with chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and were aimed primarily at the military .
" When we go into places like the North Arabian Gulf and we find a mined area we need to mark it , " explained Mr Tiltman .
" If you can mark mines with a big response then ships that come through later can find them and deal with them efficiently . "
Porpoise purpose
DSTL has set up a company called CESALT to find new uses for the technology and is in discussions with oil firms about marking undersea pipelines with the devices .
This is currently done with battery - powered boxes that continually pulse a signal back .
The same kind of device - known as a " pinger " - has also been tested to discourage cetaceans from approaching fishing nets .
" There is evidence that pingers work , at least with harbour porpoises , " Dr Mark Simmonds of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) told BBC News .
" There have been trials but they have never been deployed so far because of difficulties in deploying them . "
Keeping the boxes intact and the batteries working had been particular problems , he said .
Nets impregnated with barium sulphide have also been used to try to make them more visible , but have had limited success .
" There 's nothing to say a device similar to [ this ] - based on strongly reflecting back the animals ' own sonar - would n't do something , " said Dr Simmonds .
However , he said , the device would not help prevent large whales becoming entangled in nets as the majority of species - with the exception of the sperm whale - do not use sonar .
It would also have to be very carefully tested and not seen as a quick fix , he added .
" Despite lots of hot air about doing something about it , we have n't had any huge action to prevent the thousands of dolphins killed off the UK every year , " he said .
" We have to be careful about technological fixes that seem to have promise but which further inhibit other action such as closing fisheries and moving fisheries . "

REUTERS / Jim Young
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Voters in two Vermont towns on Tuesday approved a measure that would instruct police to arrest President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for “ crimes against our Constitution , ” local media reported .
The nonbinding , symbolic measure , passed in Brattleboro and Marlboro in a state known for taking liberal positions on national issues , instructs town police to “ extradite them to other authorities that may reasonably contend to prosecute them . ”
Vermont , home to maple syrup and picture - postcard views , is known for its liberal politics .
State lawmakers have passed nonbinding resolutions to end the war in Iraq and impeach Bush and Cheney , and several towns have also passed resolutions of impeachment .
None of them have caught on in Washington .
Bush has never visited the state as president , though he has spent vacations at his family compound in nearby Maine .
Roughly 12,000 people live in Brattleboro , located on the Connecticut River in the state ’s southeastern corner .
Nearby Marlboro has a population of roughly 1,000 .
PERHAPS the greatest scandal of the mort gage crisis is that it is a direct result of an intentional loosening of underwriting standards – done in the name of ending discrimination , despite warnings that it could lead to wide - scale defaults .
At the crisis ’ core are loans that were made with virtually nonexistent underwriting standards – no verification of income or assets ; little consideration of the applicant ’s ability to make payments ; no down payment .
Most people instinctively understand that such loans are likely to be unsound .
But how did the heavily - regulated banking industry end up able to engage in such foolishness ?
From the current hand - wringing , you ’d think that the banks came up with the idea of looser underwriting standards on their own , with regulators just asleep on the job .
In fact , it was the regulators who relaxed these standards – at the behest of community groups and “ progressive ” political forces .
In the 1980s , groups such as the activists at ACORN began pushing charges of “ redlining ” – claims that banks discriminated against minorities in mortgage lending .
In 1989 , sympathetic members of Congress got the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act amended to force banks to collect racial data on mortgage applicants ; this allowed various studies to be ginned up that seemed to validate the original accusation .
In fact , minority mortgage applications were rejected more frequently than other applications – but the overwhelming reason was n’t racial discrimination , but simply that minorities tend to have weaker finances .
Yet a “ landmark ” 1992 study from the Boston Fed concluded that mortgage - lending discrimination was systemic .
That study was tremendously flawed – a colleague and I later showed that the data it had used contained thousands of egregious typos , such as loans with negative interest rates .
Our study found no evidence of discrimination .
Yet the political agenda triumphed – with the president of the Boston Fed saying no new studies were needed , and the US comptroller of the currency seconding the motion .
No sooner had the ink dried on its discrimination study than the Boston Fed , clearly speaking for the entire Fed , produced a manual for mortgage lenders stating that : “ discrimination may be observed when a lender ’s underwriting policies contain arbitrary or outdated criteria that effectively disqualify many urban or lower - income minority applicants . ”
Some of these “ outdated ” criteria included the size of the mortgage payment relative to income , credit history , savings history and income verification .
Instead , the Boston Fed ruled that participation in a credit - counseling program should be taken as evidence of an applicant ’s ability to manage debt .
Sound crazy ?
You bet .
Those “ outdated ” standards existed to limit defaults .
But bank regulators required the loosened underwriting standards , with approval by politicians and the chattering class .
A 1995 strengthening of the Community Reinvestment Act required banks to find ways to provide mortgages to their poorer communities .
It also let community activists intervene at yearly bank reviews , shaking the banks down for large pots of money .
Banks that got poor reviews were punished ; some saw their merger plans frustrated ; others faced direct legal challenges by the Justice Department .
Flexible lending programs expanded even though they had higher default rates than loans with traditional standards .
On the Web , you can still find CRA loans available via ACORN with “ 100 percent financing . . . no credit scores . . . undocumented income . . . even if you do n’t report it on your tax returns . ”
Credit counseling is required , of course .
Ironically , an enthusiastic Fannie Mae Foundation report singled out one paragon of nondiscriminatory lending , which worked with community activists and followed “ the most flexible underwriting criteria permitted . ”
That lender ’s $ 1 billion commitment to low - income loans in 1992 had grown to $ 80 billion by 1999 and $ 600 billion by early 2003 .
Who was that virtuous lender ?
Why – Countrywide , the nation ’s largest mortgage lender , recently in the headlines as it hurtled toward bankruptcy .
In an earlier newspaper story extolling the virtues of relaxed underwriting standards , Countrywide ’s chief executive bragged that , to approve minority applications that would otherwise be rejected “ lenders have had to stretch the rules a bit . ”
He ’s not bragging now .
For years , rising house prices hid the default problems since quick refinances were possible .
But now that house prices have stopped rising , we can clearly see the damage caused by relaxed lending standards .
This damage was quite predictable : “ After the warm and fuzzy glow of ‘ flexible underwriting standards ’ has worn off , we may discover that they are nothing more than standards that lead to bad loans . . . these policies will have done a disservice to their putative beneficiaries if . . . they are dispossessed from their homes . ”
I wrote that , with Ted Day , in a 1998 academic article .
Sadly , we were spitting into the wind .
These days , everyone claims to favor strong lending standards .
What about all those self - righteous newspapers , politicians and regulators who were intent on loosening lending standards ?
As you might expect , they are now self - righteously blaming those , such as Countrywide , who did what they were told .

What a week !
The outpouring of public support for internet radio over the past seven days has been nothing short of extraordinary .
Following our outreach to Pandora listeners , every congressional office was flooded with constituent phone calls , emails and faxes – literally hundreds of thousands in just 5 days !
The entire fax system on the Hill was brought to a standstill .
We had to hand deliver the faxes !
The response in DC has been dramatic and immediate .
A bill was introduced today to reverse this terrible ruling and bring rationality to bear on this issue .
The bill is called the Internet Radio Equality Act , HR 2060 and is being introduced by Representatives Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) and Donald Manzullo ( R - IL ) .

Sand dollar larvae clone themselves when they sense predators are near .
If there 's something strange in the neighborhood … clone yourself .
That 's the philosophy of sand dollar larvae , which copy themselves when they sense predators are near .
Scientists exposed 4 - day - old sand dollar larvae to fish mucus , a sign that danger is close .
They found that the larvae created clones of themselves within 24 hours .
" It ’s the first time we 've seen anything clone itself in response to cues that predators are near , " said researcher Dawn Vaughn , a biology doctoral student at the University of Washington 's Friday Harbor Laboratories .
Sand dollar larvae are tiny globs that float along with plankton in the sea , an easy target for hungry fish .
When they are 6 weeks old , they settle to the seafloor and eventually become adult sand dollars with their distinctive petal - patterned shells .
After being exposed to fish mucus , the larvae formed embryo - like buds that eventually detached and developed into new , genetically - identical larvae that were much smaller than the originals .
The parent larvae were left smaller , too , measuring about half their beginning size .
Larvae that were not exposed to the fish mucus did not clone themselves .
The scientists think cloning may provide a double benefit to larvae facing danger .
By doubling themselves , they have a second chance to ensure their genetic information survives even if one larva gets eaten .
Additionally , being smaller may be beneficial to larvae trying to hide from fish .
" Fish are visual predators and often choose their prey based on size , " Vaughn told LiveScience .
" You 're apt to see something bigger .
Based on past research , we 're hypothesizing that small size protects larvae , but we have to test that . "
Even if being tiny helps the larvae , they could suffer for it later as full - grown sand dollars that live on the sea floor .
For many species , being bigger helps scare off predators .
The researchers do n't know yet if this is true for sand dollars .
" We 're suggesting that that ’s the tradeoff , " Vaughn said .
" You may reduce your vulnerability as a larva , but when you reach the sea floor , potentially small size ends up hurting you .
But if you do n't make it to the sea floor in the first place , it might be worth the tradeoff . "
Cloning had previously been observed in sand dollar larvae in response to a greater availability of food or favorable temperatures , but never in response to danger .
Vaughn and her colleagues detail the findings in the March 14 issue of the journal Science .
Hillary Clinton Booed in Iowa
This has been a tough couple of weeks for Hillary , even with her single handedly ending the hostage crisis in her New Hampshire campaign headquarters .
This all started with her inept answer to handing out driver ’s licenses to illegals question at the debate , and she has continued to spiral downward among stories of her planting questions at her campaign stops , to her planting questions at the Republican debate .
Dwindling poll numbers in early primary states must have the whole campaign staff on edge .
Her latest debacle came in Iowa , at an event where she was unable to attend because of weather , she had to call in instead .
Then came a question about amnesty for illegals .
Oh-oh .
The senator was asked if she would “ make a decision to give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship ” during her first 100 days in office .
Clinton responded saying , “ I have been favoring a plan to citizenship for years .
I voted for it in the Senate , I have spoke out about it around Iowa and the country and in my campaign .
And as president comprehensive immigration reform will be a high priority for me . ”
This answer brought her some boos , but it got worse .
The man repeated his question about the first 100 days .
Clinton replied , “ Well you ’ve to get congress to pass the legislation and the president to do as much as possible , which I will do . ”
To which she received an even louder round of boos .
The American people do not want anything to do with amnesty for illegals , yet all the Democrat candidates , and John McCain , support this policy .
This issue is a major issue in my opinion , and it is a major issue with the American people .
Americans by and large do n’t want to reward criminals who come across our borders by making them citizens .
This is one big reason why we need to elect a Republican , other than John McCain or Mike Huckabee , for president next year .
If we hand the whitehouse over to a Democrat , with a Democrat majority in the house and senate , it ’s hello amnesty .
If Hillary , Obama , or Edwards is elected we will run the risk of losing our country to illegal immigrants .

Wine was found to have the biggest effect on heart disease
New moderate drinkers were 38 % less likely to develop heart disease than those who stayed tee - total , a four - year study involving 7,500 people found .
Those who drank only wine showed the most benefit , the researchers reported in the American Medical Journal .
But cardiac experts warned alcohol was not a panacea for good heart health .
The results came from a study of 7,500 people taking part in a trial to look at risk factors for atherosclerosis - hardening of the arteries .
For carefully selected individuals , a ' heart healthy diet ' may include limited alcohol consumption even among individuals who have not included alcohol previously
Dr Dana King
Study leader
None of them drank alcohol at the start of the study but 6 % began to drink moderate amounts - one drink per day or fewer for women and two drinks per day or fewer for men - during the course of the research .
The reduced cardiovascular risk remained when the researchers from the Medical University of South Carolina took into account physical activity , body mass index , demographic and cardiac risk factors .
There was no difference in deaths over the four - year follow up .
Cholesterol
Those who stuck to wine had the biggest reduction in cardiovascular events , such as heart attacks , compared with non-drinkers , heavy drinkers or those who drank other types of alcohol .
The study also found some improvement in HDL or " good " cholesterol in those who took up drinking .
Despite several studies showing an association with alcohol intake and reduced cardiovascular risk , guidance from the American Heart Association warns people not to start drinking if they do not already drink alcohol .
Study leader Dana King said he was surprised that the effect was so large and so quick .
" For carefully selected individuals , a ' heart healthy diet ' may include limited alcohol consumption even among individuals who have not included alcohol previously , " he said .
However , Dr King said the benefits had to be weighed with caution against known adverse effects of drinking alcohol and it would not be advised in some people such as those with liver problems or cancer .
" I know there 's concerns about binge drinking but that is not the type of drinking pattern we 're seeing here .
" When we say seven drinks a week , we mean one a day not seven drinks on a Saturday night . "
Judy O'Sullivan , cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , said the study added to the evidence that alcohol in moderation provides some protection for the heart .
But she added : " Alcohol is not a medicine and it should not be used as a panacea .
" There is a fine line between moderation and excess and alcohol can pose as many threats as it does benefits .
" Non -drinkers should not take up alcohol to protect their heart based on this study alone . "
Hillary Clinton says the Democratic Party is stuck in a very tough spot as party leaders debate whether — and how — to seat delegates from Florida and Michigan at the nominating convention this August .
And Clinton 's latest comments , in an interview with U.S. News yesterday , wo n't make resolving the fuss any easier .
Many Democrats want a revote in both states , since the Democratic National Committee disqualified all their delegates because the states ' primaries were held too early in violation of party rules .
Some party officials are suggesting caucuses as an option to get the delegates qualified — but that does n't pass muster with Clinton .
" I would not accept a caucus , " she told us .
" I think that would be a great disservice to the 2 million people who turned out and voted .
I think that they want their votes counted . "
Florida held its primary January 29 and Michigan January 15 .
Clinton won both , although Obama 's name was n't on the ballot in Michigan and both candidates agreed not to campaign in either state , in deference to party rules .
Caucuses , held in living rooms , schools , and other neighborhood locations , are a less costly way of nominating delegates than primaries , which require more supervisory personnel and equipment .
And the turnout is usually much lower in caucuses , since several hours are needed to participate rather than a few minutes at a voting booth .
But there is a political reason for Clinton 's opposition : Barack Obama has dominated the caucuses so far , with superior organization and more motivated supporters .
Further explaining her opposition to the caucus solution , Clinton said , " A lot of people would be disenfranchised because of the timing and whatever the particular rules were .
This is really going to be a serious challenge for the Democratic Party because the voters in Michigan and Florida are the ones being hurt , and certainly with respect to Florida the Democrats were dragged into doing what they did by a Republican governor and a Republican Legislature .
They did n't have any choice whatsoever .
And I do n't think that there should be any do - over or any kind of a second run in Florida .
I think Florida should be seated . "

Impacts have been a major feature of Solar System evolution
This idea is based on a 1994 study that looked at comets originating from outside our Solar System .
New research , presented at the European Planetary Science Congress , has looked at the effect of Jupiter on comets already within our Solar System .
It seems that , whilst Jupiter does deflect some comets away from us , it sends almost as many comets towards us .
The recent Open University study has focussed on a population of comets called Centaurs that orbit between Jupiter and Neptune .
The majority of objects that threaten the Earth , termed Near Earth Objects , come from these Centaurs or from the asteroid belt found between Mars and Jupiter .
Different sizes
Dr Jonathan Horner , with Professor Barrie Jones , has designed a computer model that tracked the paths of 100,000 Centaurs , over 10 million years , and recorded the number of objects that would impact the Earth .
Five scenarios were run , the first with our Solar System , then replacing Jupiter with a planet that was three - quarters , a half and a quarter of the mass of the gas giant ; and finally with no Jupiter at all .
The results showed that the numbers of Earth impact events were the same for the cases with the real Jupiter and with no planet at all .
Although the data shows that Jupiter does deflect some objects that would otherwise threaten the Earth , its large mass also redirects bodies towards the Earth .
" Rather than it being a clear cut case that Jupiter acts as a shield , it seems that Jupiter almost gives with one hand and takes away with the other , " said Dr Horner .
Mixed bag
One unexpected outcome of the work showed that if we had a planet the size of Saturn in Jupiter 's place , the number of Earth impacts would be significantly increased .
A smaller planet would still divert comets towards the Earth , but would not have the bulk to send dangerous objects out of the Solar System .
" There was some degree of surprise in the results , " said Dr Horner .
" We had a feeling it would n't be as clear cut as everybody believed , as not having a Jupiter should be quite a stable situation because you 've got nothing stirring things up .
" We did n't expect to see this big peak of impact rates if Jupiter were the size of Saturn . "
This preliminary data has been presented to the European Planetary Science Congress in Potsdam , Germany .
The team is currently running five additional simulations to learn more about the effects of a Saturn - sized planet .
The next phase of the project for the group is to assess the impact risk posed to the Earth by objects in the asteroid belt and the team will go on to study comets that venture into the Solar System from deeper out in space .
Live totals : Obama donations break $ 7 million

According to Sen. Barack Obama's ( D - IL ) campaign website , his current fundraising total since Feb. 5 is :
WIRED : EARLY THURSDAY : " Illinois senator Barack Obama raised more than $ 6 million since the polls closed on Super Tuesday , matching the one - day fund - raising record set by Texas Republican congressman Ron Paul in December .
That 's according to a widget on Obama 's blog , which as of 10.27 pm Wednesday night showed that the senator 's campaign had raised $ 6.23 million .
The widget is updated almost instantaneously as donations pour in .
Supporters responded to a late afternoon fund - raising e-mail sent out by Obama campaign manager David Plouffe that said that the campaign had raised $ 3 million post Super Tuesday , but that the it needed to match the $ 5 million that rival Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had loaned her own campaign in January .
That $ 5 million was made to supplement the $ 13 million that Clinton raised that month .
Obama raised more than double that amount with $ 32 million -- the majority of which came through the Internet .
