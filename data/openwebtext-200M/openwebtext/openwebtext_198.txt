Dear xxxxxxxx : I am writing to you regarding a new matter that has been brought to my attention by my clients .
In this particular matter our office represents Religious Technology Center ( " RTC " ) and Bridge Publications , Inc. ( " BPI " ) .
It is well known that Google is a service provider directory that links users to an online location .
Pursuant to its Terms of Service , Google also prohibits the use of its service to link to web sites which contain infringing material .
I refer you to 17 U.S.C. 512(d ) of the DMCA which provides that an internet service provider is protected from liability , < blockquote class=notice > " by reason of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity , by using information location tools , including a directory , index , reference , pointer , or hypertext link , if the service provider . . . ( 3 ) upon notification of claimed infringement . . . responds expeditiously to remove , or disable access to , the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity , except for purposes of this paragraph . . . the information [ for notification ] shall be identification of the reference or link , to material or activity claimed to be infringing , that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled , and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate that reference or link . "</ blockquote > 17 U.S.C. 512(d ) .

When I was 15 , my scout team organized a camping rehearsal at the school compound for 3 days 2 nights .
On the first night , we learned many scout techniques such as making camp fire , building a camp , etc .
Then on the second night which is the last day of our camping practice , at around 11.30 pm ( the end of the rehearsal session ) , we suppose to rest and sleep for the next day instructor ’s presentation .
However , one of my schoolmate suggested not to sleep that early as this is a very good opportunity for us to chat without parents ’ interference .
We chatted for about an hour and she suggested to play hide and seek as the school is the best place to play such game .
Then I requested to select only one floor instead of the whole school compound .
We selected Level 2 which have 15 classrooms .
There were 6 of us and one of our friend volunteered to be the seeker .
When the game get started , I was hiding at one of the classrom in between the cabinet and the wall .
It was dark with some very very dim lights coming from the street lights around the school compound .
After a few minutes past , I heard someone running outside the room ( balcony ) .
Thinking that it may be the seeker , I sneaked out from the position I was hiding and I got a SHOCK to see a person sitting at one of the chair 6th row from the front row .
Since it was so dark , I could n’t see the face clearly .
Thinking that it may be the seeker , I quickly went back to the place I am hiding .
After about a minute , I tried to look out again to see whether the person is still sitting there or not , TO MY HORROR , she ( yes , I can see her long hair ) is now sitting in the first row with her face pointing at me .
I still could n’t see the face clearly .
Thinking that it may be my friend and since she is looking at me , I surrendered myself and as her why you are sitting here .
She did n’t answer .
Suddently , my friend ( the real seeker ) ran in and say “ Gotcha ” , I looked at her and turned back to the seat , the person ( ghost ) is nowhere to be seen .
I was so scared and quickly tell my friedn that i saw a girl sitting right here just now .
She did n’t believe me and saying that I am trying to scare her and keep asking “ Where , Where is she , do n’t bluff ” .
Suddently there were hands touching on our shoulders and said “ ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ME ” , we turned back and sam a girl with her hair covering the face .
We quickly ran out of the room towards the staircase to the camping area and shouted “ GHOST , GHOST , GHOST ” .
When we reached there , the other 4 were also running back to the place .
Both of us told them the story and we could n’t sleep for the whole night .
Spoofs & Satire Apr 18 , 2007 The Adventure of the Missing Stocking
The writers of the television series
Lost take time out of their busy schedules to write this pastiche — the latest chapter in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes .
It was a chill and shrouded October morning in 1894 when I called upon the subject of my biographies , the incomparable Sherlock Holmes .
I rapped sharply on the door of his rooms at 221B Baker Street , but the only sounds in the house were of the indefatigable Mrs.
Hudson below boiling eggs ; receiving no reply , I allowed myself in to Holmes ’s cozy sitting room .
It was there that I found Holmes supine on the velvet - lined sofa , eyes sealed , violin clutched to his breast , breathing relaxed and profound .
Beside him on the floor lay a syringe and a vial containing a seven percent solution of cocaine , and a black rubber strop — the various accouterments of his only vice .
I turned on my heel and prepared to depart , not wishing to wake him , fearing , if I did , that I would be unable to stopper the schoolmarmish scolding I typically delivered in such situations .
But , alas , my dexterity is not what it once was , and it was with great fanfare that I collided with an end table in my attempt to egress .
“ Watson , ” Holmes murmured , rousing from his torpor .
He laboriously brought himself to a sitting position , and studied me from beneath leaden lids .
“ Wait , stay , my friend .
I desire a distraction ; if I do n’t have a new case soon , I may begin doubling the percentage here . ”
I settled into an armchair by the fire , and watched as Holmes oscillated between languor and lucidity , bringing his vast mental capacity to bear on the task of achieving sobriety .
Just as he had begun to master the miasma , a knock echoed throughout the home .
As Holmes remained attenuated , I opened the door to reveal Inspectors Lestrade and Hopkins .
“ Hello , Holmes , ” said Lestrade , sauntering into the living area and eyeing the case with disapproval .
“ Stanley and I have something of a tough nut to crack , and thought perhaps we could seek your assistance . ”
Holmes , to my relief , seemed to have regained his wits in my absence .
“ Sit , gentlemen .
Please , I am yours . ”
The constables occupied the armchairs , while I drew out my notebook , to better chronicle the event .
“ Right , ” began Lestrade .
“ Around quarter - past seven this very morning , the body of one Roderick Rowatt was found .
He was dressed as if he were going to work — except he was missing one stocking , the left , though he still wore both shoes . ”
“ Curious , ” said Holmes .
“ Quite , ” Hopkins confirmed .
“ Moreso than you imagine .
For the stocking was not the only accessory our dear Mr. Rowatt lacked .
His head had been completely severed from his torso , and was nowhere to be found . ”
“ And yet you discovered the body in an alley off Blackfriars Road , ” said Holmes after a moment ’s thought .
“ Is that correct ? ”
The Inspectors were struck dumb with such synchronicity that I had to bite back laughter .
“ How the devil did you know ? ” demanded Hopkins .
“ It is simplicity itself , ” said Holmes dismissively .
He pointed at Lestrade .
“ The soil on your shoes is a mixture of silt and sand , indicative of the southern bank of the Thames .
And you , ” he turned to Hopkins , “ have a tiny feather affixed to your jacket , which comes from the Mute Swan , a breed that congregates exclusively in the Blackfriars neighborhood .
“ Furthermore , you both have about you the faint , cloying scent of decay .
Rowatt must have lain unfound for some time .
As Blackfriars Road itself is a major thoroughfare , it stands to reason that the body must have been secreted away .
That it was an alley , and not a side street or unused doorway , was mere conjecture based on the averages in London ’s history of crime . ”
The two men exchanged mystified glances .
“ Then I expect you ’ll have this case wrapped up in no time , ” Lestrade chuckled .
“ As I said before , however , the poor bloke was beheaded .
And what was exceedingly weird was the manner in which this was done .
The wounds look as if they were made by teeth .
Human teeth . ”
“ Surely no man , even in the throes of some violent passion , could gnash his way through a spinal column , ” said Hopkins .
He phrased the statement as a declaration , but it sounded more like a question to my ears .
But Holmes only nodded sagely .
“ We will revisit the point , ” he said .
“ Pray , continue . ”
“ Based on the neck wounds , we surmised that he must have been killed by an animal of some sort , ” said Lestrade .
“ But then we found distinct lacerations on his chest , clearly made by a blade .
When we cleared the blood away , it became apparent that someone — or something — had carved a list of words into the corpse . ”
“ Not into the corpse , ” countered Holmes .
“ If the carvings bled , then the man must have been alive when the cuts were made . ”
Lestrade looked surprised , and quickly transcribed the observation into his notebook .
“ Each word consisted of three capital letters , save only the last , ” he said .
“ Show it to him , Hopkins . ”
The other man handed Holmes a single sheet of foolscap .
The detective gave the sheet the briefest of glances , before handing the list to me .
It read :
KWP
SSO
WEU
VAY
NYW
FEL
WPW
DEQK
“ I see .
Well , then everything fits , ” said Holmes .
Lestrade scowled .
“ Am I to understand that you already have some inkling as to the perpetrator of this monstrous deed ? ” he asked .
Holmes waved away the question .
“ Let us not get ahead of ourselves ; I ’m merely pointing out that there are a few things of interest here .
But I believe there is more to your account , is there not ? ”
“ Quite a bit more , ” Hopkins averred .
Lestrade flipped to a blank page in his notebook and drew a small sketch .
He extracted the page and extended it to Holmes .
“ When we moved the body , we found this symbol inscribed into the cobble beneath it . ”
Holmes gave the sheet the most cursory of glances , before jerking his head in my direction .
Lestrade turned in his chair and handed the note to me ; I , in turn , copied the symbol into my ledger :
“ The Greek symbol for Saturn , ” Holmes said to me casually .
“ Found almost exclusively on ancient natal charts . ”
“ As you deduced , the man had been dead for some time when we arrived , ” said Lestrade .
“ We sought a witness to the slaying — and found one , perhaps .
She lives on the second floor of a house overlooking the alley , and was awoken this morning just past three , by a sound she recognized from her youth .
Hortence Bridgemen is her name , and she spent many a summer in the wilds of Africa , in the company of her father , Patrick Henry Bridgemen , the renowned big - game hunter .
She swears that the sound that interrupted her slumber was that of a rutting hippopotamus . ”
“ We , of course , dismissed her claims as nothing more than parasomnia , ” Hopkins chimed in , “ until we found hippopotamus scat , three blocks away on Blakely Road . ”
“ Having been woken , Miss Bridgemen looked out the window , ” Lestrade continued , seeming to sweat .
“ What she saw in no way corresponds with the scene of the crime , as we found it .
According to her account , a withered old woman was fending off the advances of seven cloaked figures , threatening her menacingly with cricket bats .
Just as they surrounded the crone , one of the assailants turned and looked up at the window .
Miss Bridgemen recalls a blinding light , a deep voice saying ‘ barometer , ’ and then darkness .
She did not rouse from her unconsciousness until we knocked on her door , hours later .
“ When she awoke the second time , she found , grasped in the fist of her hand , an egg .
She cracked the egg in our presence ; inside , we found 17 pence and a living diamondback moth . ”
Holmes smiled at the mention of the moth .
“ Another piece fits into the puzzle , yes . ”
“ We interviewed the family of the deceased , ” Lestrade continued .
“ Apparently the dead man kept his regular routine this morning , leaving his home at eight o’clock — a full three - quarters of an hour after his body was discovered . ”
“ Exactly , ” said Holmes .
“ Also , at 1:15 this morning — around the time we estimate Mr. Rowatt was slain — Paddington Cemetery , northwest of London , was pelted by cane toads , which fell from the sky for 13 straight minutes .
We do not know if the two events are connected . ”
“ Connected ? ” scoffed Holmes .
“ Why , they are inextricably intertwined ! ”
“ And , when the carriage arrived at the mortuary , Mr. Rowatt ’s body was missing .
In its stead we found seven stone of apricot preserves . ”
It was at that moment that Inspector Hopkins lunged forward .
“ Barometer ! ” he cried , and collapsed onto the center of the living space .
“ Dear God , ” exclaimed Lestrade , leaping from his chair and kneeling by the body .
An astute summary corroborated the conclusion of my quick physical inspection : “ He ’s dead . ”
“ I ’m so sorry , ” I commiserated .
Lestrade ruminated for a moment .
“ Honestly , his death was so sudden and arbitrary , I ca n’t help but feel like we are just being manipulated , ” he observed .
“ As if this was little more than an attempt to ‘ keep us on our toes , ’ as it were . ”
“ It did n’t have a whole lot of emotional resonance , ” I concurred .
Lestrade stood , nonchalantly dusted off his slacks , and turned to the detective .
“ Well , anyway , that brings us up to date .
How say you , Holmes ?
What single , unifying hypothesis could possibly account for all these disparate facts and events ? ”
Holmes threw back his head and laughed .
“ Why inspector , it ’s elementary , really .
The solution is so obvious I ’m amazed you have n’t tumbled to it already . ”
Lestrade returned to the armchair , and looked upon Holmes expectantly .
I held my pen poised over my notebook , ready to record yet another feat of intellectual pyrotechnics .
“ You see , none of this is really happening .
I am still in my cocaine stupor , and this entire conversation is little more than a flight of fancy . ”
The clock on the mantle ticked off seconds , measuring the length of the awkward pause .
“ You ’re joking then , ” said Lestrade .
“ The old ‘ it was all a dream , ’ ending ? ” I asked .
“ Holmes , for real ? ”
“ It does n’t even work , ” Lestrade pointed out .
“ The entire story up until now is told in first - person from Watson ’s point of view .
How can it be your dream ? ”
“ Well that ’s what it is , ” said Holmes said defiantly .
“ You just made that up , ” I challenged .
“ No , that was the idea all along , ” Holmes said .
“ Seriously .
I had the whole thing figured out from the start . ”
“ Man , I was way into it , too , ” I said , rising and taking up my stick .
“ What a letdown .
Total copout . ”
“ Pretty weak , dude , ” said Lestrade .
Holmes shrugged and closed his eyes again , content to let us see our own way out the door .
“ It does n’t really matter , ” he said .
“ No one is going to read all the way to the end . ”
The New York Times will stop charging for access to parts of its Web site , effective at midnight tonight .
The move comes two years to the day after The Times began the subscription program , TimesSelect , which has charged $ 49.95 a year , or $ 7.95 a month , for online access to the work of its columnists and to the newspaper ’s archives .
TimesSelect has been free to print subscribers to The Times and to some students and educators .
In addition to opening the entire site to all readers , The Times will also make available its archives from 1987 to the present without charge , as well as those from 1851 to 1922 , which are in the public domain .
There will be charges for some material from the period 1923 to 1986 , and some will be free .
The Times said the project had met expectations , drawing 227,000 paying subscribers  out of 787,000 over all  and generating about $ 10 million a year in revenue .

So far irradiation seems to creep out consumers , and Big Food 's been trying for a while to get us all to adopt nice - sounding names like " cold pasteurization " so they do n't have to fear lost sales if they nuke our food .
Currently , irradiated food is labeled as such , with a " radura " symbol on it too .
The FDA has proposed dropping this requirement and allowing other terms ( including " pasteurization " ) on packaging when food has been irradiated .
For consumers , this is misleading .
Maybe irradiation is n't the end of the world - certainly attitudes will differ on a personal level - but do n't we at least deserve full information about our food so we can make our own decisions ?
Irradiation does n't leave the food radioactive at all .
My own gripe about the matter is that it seems to give up on solving any of the problems in food production ... instead of trying to keep shit out of the meat , let 's make sterile shit the latest and greatest burger condiment .
Yum !
Can I have extra pickles with that ?

When you go to comment , they have several questions .
If you do n't want to or do n't know how to answer them , scroll down to where you can just leave a " general comment . "
My comment was something like :
I oppose dropping the requirement for irradiated foods to include the radura symbol on their packaging and allowing them to use nondescript terms such as " pasteurized . "
Consumers have a right to full information about their food , including whether or not it was irradiated .
We 've got until TOMORROW , so help get the word out !
There are several HTML elements and attributes that have now been declared deprecated by the World Wide Web Consortium ( the organization that sets HTML standards ) .
‘ Deprecated ’ means that the elements no longer serve a purpose and have been replaced by other methods , mostly involving cascading stylesheets ( CSS ) .
Although it is recommended that web browsers continue to support them , eventually they will become obsolete .
This page lists all the deprecated elements and attributes of HTML 4 , and specifies the recommended replacements for them .
You will need a basic understanding of CSS to implement most of these .
Do note that many examples below shown use inline styles for simplicity .
These should not be used on live sites – styles should be applied to classes or tags inside stylesheets .
Contents
The FONT and BASEFONT tags
These two elements have been deprecated in favor of CSS .
< basefont > was used to specify the main font for a page , while < font > was used to specify inline changes to a font ( e.g. for a paragraph or a few words ) .
They both have the same possible attributes :
face :
The actual font to use , such as Times New Roman or Arial .
This has been superseded by the CSS property font - family .
You can also specify the type of font ( serif , sans - serif , etc ) .
: The actual font to use , such as Times New Roman or Arial .
This has been superseded by the CSS property .
You can also specify the type of font ( serif , sans - serif , etc ) .
size :
The size of the font , relative to the default on the page .
This has been replaced by the CSS property font - size .
You can use any length value ( px , em , in , mm ) , but it is best to use pixel ( px ) sizes .
: The size of the font , relative to the default on the page .
This has been replaced by the CSS property .
You can use any length value ( px , em , in , mm ) , but it is best to use pixel ( px ) sizes .
color :
The color of the font .
This has been replaced by the CSS property color .
Deprecated example :
< basefont face = " Arial " size = " + 1 " color = " green " >
Some text </ basefont >
To set the font for a page using CSS ( as per basefont ) , you should target the body element in your style sheet .
The equivalent of the above would be :
body { font - family : Arial , sans - serif ; font - size : 13 px ; color : green ; }
If you use tables in your pages , you will need to add the td to the list of tags in the declaration , because the font size always reverts to the default inside tables :
body , td { font - family : Arial , sans - serif ; font - size : 13 px ; color : green ; }
You can specify several font properties at once using the CSS font property :
body , td { font : 13 px Arial , sans - serif ; color : green ; }
To set font styles for inline text ( as per FONT ) , you can do one of two things :
Use the SPAN tag with the style attribute : < span style = " font - family : monospace ; " >< span style = " font - size : 10 px ; " > This is 10 px text .</span></span>
Set up a class in the style sheet : . small { font - size : 10 px ; } Then in the page : < span class = " small " >
Small text </ span >
The latter method is much more reliable , since you can apply the style to several portions of text , without having to specify the size each time .
And if you decide to change the size later , you only need to change it in one place : the stylesheet .
The CENTER tag and ALIGN attribute
These have also been replaced by CSS .
Deprecated examples :
< p align = " center " > Centered paragraph < / p> < p align = " right " >
Right - aligned paragraph </ p> < center >< img src=" pic.gif " ></ center >
To align content on a page , the CSS property is text - align .
It takes four possibilities : left , right , center or justify .
. center { text - align : center ; }
The HTML :
< p class= " center " > Centered text </ p>
This works for inline content such as text or images , but block elements like tables and your own DIV tags do not follow the rules above .
However , there is a simple yet relatively under - promoted trick to center block elements .
The correct solution is to set the margin to auto , as in the following code .
Change 500 px to the width you would like the table to be :
< table cellpadding = " 0 " cellspacing = " 0 " style = " margin : auto ; width : 500 px ; border : 1 px solid black ; " > < tr > < td> Test</td > </tr > </table >
However , Internet Explorer prior to version 7 does not currently display the margin : auto rule correctly .
To fix this , we can take advantage of another IE bug , which is that the browser aligns things to the center when it should n’t .
The final code is as follows .
Note that we add text - align : left to the table to stop the div alignment applying to nexted text .
< div style = " text - align : center ; " > < table cellpadding = " 0 " cellspacing = " 0 " style = " margin : auto ; width : 500 px ; border : 1 px solid black ; text - align : left ; " > < tr > < td> Test</td > </tr > </table > </div >
This should work in all browsers .
Note that the auto value only has an effect on the left and right margins ; it does not center elements vertically .
Images can also pose alignment problems .
In HTML , setting the align attribute to left or right causes text to wrap around the image but the text - align property in CSS does not achieve this effect .
To align images to the left or right with text wrapping , you should use the float property .
The same argument holds for tables and other block level elements .
<img src=" pic.gif " style = " float : left ; " >
This text will wrap around the right of the image .
The U , S and STRIKE elements
These text formatting elements have been replaced by the text - decoration CSS property .
Deprecated examples :
< u> Underlined text </u> <s > Strikethrough text </s> < strike > Strikethrough text </ strike >
CSS replacements and HTML code :
.u { text - decoration : underline ; } . strike { text - decoration : line - through ; } < span < strong > class= " u " </ strong >>
Underlined text </ span > < span < strong > class= " strike " </ strong >>
Strikethrough text </ span >
It should also be noted that the HTML spec discourages the use of the B , I , BIG , SMALL and TT tags , in favor of stylesheets , though their use is not officially deprecated .
For reference :
< b > can be replaced by font - weight : bold ;
can be replaced by < i > can be replaced by font - style : italic ;
can be replaced by < big > can be replaces by font - size : larger ; or a specific size
can be replaces by or a specific size < small > can be replaced by font - size : smaller ; or a specific size
can be replaced by or a specific size < tt > can be replaced by font - family : monospace ;
The BACKGROUND and BGCOLOR attribute
These were used to set a background image or color for the document or an element .
The bgcolor attribute applies to the < table > , < tr > , < td > , < th > and < body > elements .
Interestingly , the background attribute was only ever defined for the body element , but most browsers support it for the same elements as bgcolor .
Both of these can be easily replaced with CSS .
The following sets the image graytile.gif as the background to the whole page .
As per CSS rules , if the image cannot be found , the supplied color ( gray ) will be used instead .
body { background : lightgray url ( " graytile.gif " ) ; }
Similar styles can be applied to the table attributes :
table.style1 { background - color : lightyellow ; }
Or , for different heading and data cell colors :
table .style1 th { background - color : yellow ; } table .
style1 td { background - color : lightyellow ; }
With HTML :
< table class = " style1 " > < tr > < th> Col 1</th > < th > Col 2</th > </tr > < tr> < td> Data 1.1</td > < td> Data 1.2</td > </tr > < tr> < td> Data 2.1</td > < td> Data 2.2</td > </tr > </table >
The BORDER attribute
Applies a border to an image or object .
Example CSS replacement :
< img src=" image.gif " width = " 200 " height = " 150 " alt = " Image description " style = " border : 1 px solid black ; " >
These attributes were used on the BODY tag to set the text color for the document and links :
text sets the default text color
sets the default text color link sets the default link color ;
sets the default link color ; vlink is the color of a visited link ;
is the color of a visited link ; alink sets the ‘ active ’ link color ( shown as the link is clicked ) .
They have been usurped by CSS pseudo elements .
Deprecated example :
< body text =" darkblue " link = " green " vlink = " black " alink= " red " >
< p> Some text in the document ...< br > < a href= " something.com " > this is link 1</a>< br > < a href= " somethingelse.com " > this is link 2</a >< br > < a href= " google.com " > this is link 3</ a> </ p> </ body >
CSS replacement for the respective attributes :
body { color : darkblue ; } a: link { color : green ; } a:visited { color : black ; } a:active { color : red ; }
The most useful aspect of this replacement is that you can change a multitude of styles , not just the color .
For example , you could set a background color on all the active links , or different fonts or borders , etc .
Note that the active rule must be below the others ; otherwise , the other rules take precedence .
For example if the order was link / active / visited , the active color would only show when clicking on an unvisited link ( which may be your intention ) .
There is also a fourth rule , : hover , which can change the style when the mouse moves over a link ( but does not click ) .
Depending on your preference , this should go near or at the bottom .
Here ’s an example that shows the typical link underline on hover only :
body { color : darkblue ; } a: link { color : green ; text - decoration : none ; } a:visited { color : black ; } a:hover { color : lightblue ; text - decoration : underline ; } a:active { color : red ; }
The active rule stays below the hover rule in this case so that it still occurs when clicking on a link .
The HPSACE and VSPACE attributes
These were used on the IMG and OBJECT tags to set spacing around them .
As you have may have guessed , the same effect can be achieved with margins in CSS .
Reminder : the four values in the margin property are for the top , right , bottom and left margins respectively .
< img src=" image.gif " width = " 15 " height = " 20 " alt = " image " style = " margin : 0 2px 2px 5 px ; " >
The LANGUAGE attribute
This was used on the SCRIPT tag to name the type of script being used .
< script language = " JavaScript " > alert ( " Hello ! " ) ;</ script >
The W3C now states the type attribute should be used instead .
I do n’t know the values for every scripting language , but it is likely to be ‘ text ’ followed by a forward slash , then the name of the language .
JavaScript is really the only language used these days ( and the only one supported by every major browser ) .
< script type =" text / javascript " > alert ( " Hello ! " ) ;</ script >
The CLEAR attribute
This was used on the < br > tag to undo the wrapping caused by floating elements , such as aligned images .
< br clear = " all " >
Again , this can be replaced by CSS .
The clear property takes the values left , right , both or none .
.unfloat { clear : both ; } < img src=" image.gif " style = " float : left ; " >
This text wraps ... < br class= " unfloat " >
This text appears underneath the image ...
The WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes
width applies to the < th > , < td > , < hr > and < pre > tags ; height applies to < th > and < td > .
These can all be replaced by the simple width and height CSS rules .
Note that it is still recommended to use the HTML attributes for images .
td.leftColumn { width : 600 px ; } td.rightColumn { width : 250 px ; }
The TYPE attribute for lists
The type attribute , when applied to lists , defined how the bullet points in a list are displayed .
Unordered lists could be displayed with filled - in circles , outlined circles or outlines squares .
Ordered lists could use numbers or lowercase / uppercase letters / Roman numerals .
This has been replaced with the CSS list - style - type property .
The following tables show the possible values .
Glyphs ( symbols for unordered lists )

Numbering ( for ordered lists )
Value Description decimal numeric , i.e. { 1 , 2 , 3 , …} decimal - leading - zero numeric including leading zero , i.e. { 01 , 02 , 03 , … , 10 , …} lower - alpha lowercase ASCII letters , i.e. {a , b , c , …} upper - alpha uppercase ASCII letters , i.e. { A , B , C , …} lower - roman lowercase Roman numerals , i.e. {i , ii , iii , …} upper - roman uppercase Roman numerals , i.e. {I , II , III , …} lower - greek lowercase Greek letters , i.e. {α , β , γ , …} georgian traditional Georgian numbering armenian traditional Armenian numbering
Here is a short example for an ordered list with roman numerals .
Deprecated code :
< ol type= " i " > < li>first item ( i ) </ li > < li>second item ( ii ) </ li > < li> third item ( iii ) </li > </ol >
Replacement code :
< ol style = " list - style - type : lower - roman ; " > < li>first item ( i ) </ li > < li>second item ( ii ) </ li > < li> third item ( iii ) </li > </ol >
The START and VALUE attributes for lists
The value attribute , applicable to list items only , sets a value for the current list item ( only useful for ordered lists ) .
This means we can reset the counter if required .
For example , the following code displays items numbered { 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2} :
< ol > < li> list item </ li > < li> list item </ li > < li> list item </ li > < li value= " 1 " > list item </li > < li>list item</li > </ol >
The start attribute specifies the starting number for a list , and as such only applies to the OL tag .
For example , to start an ordered list from zero , the deprecated HTML would be :
< ol start= " 0 " > < li>zeroth item </ li > < li > first item </li > < li >...</li> </ol >
Both can been replaced with generated content in CSS .
This is quite complex so I wo n’t go into too much detail here , but here ’s a basic example .
We start with the following CSS :
ol { counter - reset : item ; } li { display : block ; } li:before { content : counter ( item ) " . " ; counter - increment : item ; } li.reset { counter - reset : item 0 ; }
This uses the : before pseudo element to set a number before each list item .
It uses the counter function alongside the counter - increment property to put an increasing number before the content of the list item .
Then , the following HTML code provides a list ordered { 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3} .
Note that the counter - reset value always makes the counter start from the next number – i.e. when we put 0 , it starts from 1 .
< ol > < li> list item </ li > < li> list item </ li > < li> list item </ li > < li class = " reset " > list item reset </ li > < li>list item </li > < li>list item</li > </ol >
The reset class mimics the value attribute .
To replicate the start attribute , replace item with item 0 as the counter - reset value for the ol rule .
As above , use one less than the actual value you require ; so to start the list at zero use item - 1 , or to start at 10 use item 9 .
The problem with this code is that the standard nice indentation on lists – where the left edges of each list item align vertically and the numbers are right - aligned – is not preserved .
This can be fixed with some positioning trickery – I wrote an answer on Stack Overflow detailing this .
The COMPACT attribute for lists
As the name implies , this was intended to produce a compact version of a list ( the < dir > , < dl > , < menu > , < ol > or < ul > tags ) , however the W3C does not define ‘ compact ’ – it could be a smaller font size , small line height or something else .
Furthermore , none of the major browsers support this attribute ( it has no effect ) .
As such it is not possible to advise a specific replacement , but if you want a compact list then you should change the font size or spacing with CSS .
The APPLET element
This element has been deprecated in favor of the < object > element , which is more general .
Here is how the attributes crossover :
code or object was the location of the main class file in the APPLET element – use data or classid instead .
or was the location of the main class file in the APPLET element – use or instead .
type or codetype should be used to specify the type of content given in data or classid respectively .
or should be used to specify the type of content given in or respectively .
codebase , the root location of the objects / code , remains .
, the root location of the objects / code , remains .
archive , a comma-separated list of objects to preload , remains .
, a comma-separated list of objects to preload , remains .
alt is not a possible attribute for OBJECT ; you could use standby , which shows a message while loading .
is not a possible attribute for OBJECT ; you could use , which shows a message while loading .
‘ visual presentation ’ attributes such as width , height and align can be controlled with CSS ( see the relevant sections of this page ) .
Also note that many browsers disable loading of Java by default for security reasons .
Mobile devices have no support at all .
In almost all cases you are better served by JavaScript .
The DIR and MENU elements
< dir > < li> list element ...</ li > </ dir > < menu > < li> list element ...</ li > </ menu >
These were used for special types of lists , though they should display in the same way as a standard bulleted list .
For this reason , they are deprecated in favor of using a list
< ul > < li>list element 1</li > </ul >
The ISINDEX element
This tag inserts a search field into the page .
You should use standard form elements instead .
NOSHADE and SIZE for horizontal rules
All attributes for the horizontal line tag are deprecated ( except global attributes like class ) . size is easily replaced by the height property in CSS .
Unfortunately , web browsers tend to differ in how they shade CSS representations of horizontal lines .
Setting background color works in Opera and Firefox ; setting the color ( which is intended for text ) works in Internet Explorer .
Thankfully , using both together does n’t have any adverse effects .
Here are two deprecated examples : a thick horizontal line and a line without shading :
< hr size = " 10 " > < hr size = " 3 " noshade >
Replacement CSS : < hr style = " height : 10 px ; " > < hr style = " height : 3 px ; border - style : none ; background - color : gray ; color : gray ; " >
The NOWRAP attribute
Applies to the < td > and < th > elements .
This attribute turns off text wrapping , so text in the cell stays on one line and stretches the table if necessary .
The equivalent CSS property white - space with the value nowrap recreates this for any tag .
< td style = " white - space : nowrap " > This is a very long piece of text that could stretch the table cell by quite a bit .
</td >
The VERSION attribute
This was used on the HTML tag , providing the version number of HTML being used .
The W3C have declared this unnecessary , since in HTML 4 the document type declaration provides version information .
The best method is to use the modern doctype which works in all browsers :
<! DOCTYPE html >
Conclusions …
Well that was a long list !
Some of these replacements may seem unwieldy – for example using < span style = " text - decoration : underline ; " ></ span > instead of < u > < /u > is quite cumbersome – but the main point to take away from this tutorial is that in general , these styles should not be used directly .
If you are underlining something there is a reason for it .
You may be creating a title , for example .
In this case , you should use a heading tag or a CSS class named title and set the styles on that .
Instead of this :
<b><u>Section 2.3</u></b>
You could use a level 3 heading with appropriate styling :
h3 { font - size : 14 px ; font - weight : bold ; text - decoration : underline ; }
Ultimately , if you ’re only creating a few pages then using deprecated tags wo n’t matter .
Browsers will support them for many years to come .
But as soon as your site starts to grow , you must start thinking about using CSS for cleanliness and consistency .
But I would like to see the conversation change for this election .
The real issue - the issue that undermines all the other issues - is the issue of executive power .
We currently have an executive in office who feels no obligation to submit to oversight , who values loyalty over competence , ideology over science , and secrecy above all else .
The current batch of presidential candidates needs to take a stand on these issues ; the next president cannot continue these ridiculous policies .
Signing statements : During the Roberts hearings , you could n't get enough description of the make - up of the Supreme Court as " three strict constructionists , three moderates , and three activist judges who continually try to legislate from the bench . "
Legislate from the bench ?
For the past six years , Bush has ( through the use of signing statements ) been legislating from the Oval Office !
The constitutional check on the legislature is the president 's veto .
I want to hear the current batch of candidates pledge to either enforce the law as passed in Congress , or veto it .
Executive privilege : Every use of executive privilege in the past fifty years has been to cover up something shady .
I want the candidates to demonstrate they know it 's a privilege and not a policy .
So to the candidates : Please give us the opportunity to trust you .
Privacy is fast becoming the trendy concept in online marketing .
An increasing number of companies are flaunting the steps they 've taken to protect the privacy of their customers .
But studies suggest consumers wo n't pay even 25 cents to protect their data .
In one week in July , Ask.com unveiled AskEraser , a tool that will allow users to obliterate their search histories ; Microsoft announced enhanced privacy controls for its Windows Live service ; and Google and Yahoo shrank the amount of time they retained IP addresses and search logs , reducing the ability of government agencies to subpoena such data .
Startups are aiming to carve out a piece of the privacy market .
ReputationDefender , which allows individuals to manage what people say about them online , launched the beta version of a new subscription service on Sep.
1 . Its service , called MyPrivacy , lets users control how their personal data is brokered across the web ( the service was announced last fall but is only now publicly available ) .
Suddenly it seems that " privacy is the new black , " as Duncan Riley wrote at TechCrunch .
For $ 5 a month , MyPrivacy subscribers can locate their records in people - search directories , such as Yahoo People Search , 411.com , WhitePages.com , Yellowbook.com and Netscape White Pages , and click a button to remove their listing .
As long as you keep paying , the service will keep you unlisted when these information brokers refresh their directories .
MyPrivacy will feature at least 10 major consumer databases at launch and expects to have 75 such information brokers signed on by year end .
But are U.S. consumers willing to pay for privacy ?
And if so , how much ?
A 2007 study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon and the University of California at Berkeley found that most subjects were unwilling to spend even a quarter to keep someone from selling sensitive information about them – such as their weight or number of sex partners .
" People prefer money over data , always , " says Alessandro Acquisti , assistant professor of information technology and public policy at CMU .
Historically , the results are equally discouraging to would - be privacy entrepreneurs .
In 1999 Zero -Knowledge Systems launched its Freedom suite , which allowed netizens to surf the web and manage e-mail anonymously .
The company discontinued the product in October 2001 because of lackluster sales ( the dot - com implosion did n't help ) .
In 2005 , Zero Knowledge , having given up on the consumer privacy market , morphed into Radialpoint , which provides technology services to ISPs .
Another privacy service , Anonymizer , whose Safe Surfing Suite lets individuals cruise the net with anonymity , is " significantly profitable and growing rapidly , " according to President and chief scientist Lance Cottrell .
But he admits that commercial customers account for about 80 percent of his company 's revenue .
The reason ?
Most consumers are unaware of how their privacy is slowly siphoned off , Cottrell says .
" The threats ( enterprises ) face are tangible and monetary , " Cottrell says .
" The thing about consumer privacy is it 's really a death from a thousand cuts .
With any given click or any given web page the loss of information is usually very subtle .
The fact that you may get more spam or pay more for flowers because you live in a wealthy ZIP code are just single drops in a tsunami of privacy violations . "
Reputation Defender CEO
Michael Fertik admits his MyPrivacy service is something consumers could do themselves .
" They can also change the oil in their cars , if they wanted to take the time and effort , " he notes .
" We offer the economies of scale , technology and expertise to do it for them . "
But the amount of privacy MyPrivacy can realistically hope to provide is fairly limited .
The major data brokers have an incentive to work with them , says Owen Tripp , MyPrivacy 's executive vice president of products .
" The cost of having to deal with squeaky - wheel customers is much higher than the value of having them on the list , " he says .
" It 's just cheaper to remove them . "
Getting the smaller brokers to cooperate will prove a bigger challenge , Tripp admits .
And because brokers cull much of their information from public records that can't be suppressed , that information will still be available for such brokers to resell .
" I think it would be difficult for any company to claim they can really opt you out when they can't go back to the source and take you out of the public record , " says Jennifer Barrett , global privacy leader for Acxiom , a $ 1.4 billion data broker .
" When consumers pay for a service like this , most expect universal opt-out .
When the number of ( marketers ) who contact them ( with junk mail ) does n't change very much , they 'll say ' this did n't do much good . ' "
Fertik argues his aim is n't to reduce spam or junk mail but to lower your web profile – making it harder , though not impossible , for stalkers or identity thieves to find you .
As with his firm 's reputation management services , Fertik offers no guarantees .
But in an era where personal privacy is under siege by both industry and government , he believes people will pay to erect a small wall around their data .
" One hundred and thirty million people put their names on the Federal Trade Commission 's ' Do Not Call ' list , " Fertik says .
" You 're saying 10 percent of those people would n't pay $ 5 a month for privacy ?
That 's nuts .
I think it 's a market with absolutely zero risk . "
Others are n't convinced .
Austin Hill , one of the founders of Zero - Knowledge Systems and now CEO of Akoha.org , says most people remain unaware of what happens to their information online – and unwilling to make sacrifices to protect it .
" Ask people if they care about the environment they 'll say yes , but they 're not willing to give up their SUVs , " says Hill .
" Ask if they care about privacy , they 'll say yes , absolutely , but I will not take down my MySpace page with my 400 friends on it because that 's how I socialize .
They 're very unaware that these pages get indexed , archived , and become part of their public record .
" I hate to say this , because I am a big fan of privacy , " Hill adds .
" But I think as a society we are redefining our understanding of what ' privacy ' means , and unfortunately not for the better . "
Robots have been roaming the streets of Iraq , since shortly after the war began .
Now , for the first time – the first time in any warzone – the machines are carrying guns .
After years of development , three " special weapons observation remote reconnaissance direct action system " ( SWORDS ) robots have deployed to Iraq , armed with M249 machine guns .
The ' bots " have n't fired their weapons yet , " Michael Zecca , the SWORDS program manager , tells DANGER ROOM .
" But that 'll be happening soon . "
The SWORDS – modified versions of bomb - disposal robots used throughout Iraq – were first declared ready for duty back in 2004 .
But concerns about safety kept the robots from being sent over the the battlefield .
The machines had a tendency to spin out of control from time to time .
That was an annoyance during ordnance - handling missions ; no one wanted to contemplate the consequences during a firefight .
So the radio - controlled robots were retooled , for greater safety .
In the past , weak signals would keep the robots from getting orders for as much as eight seconds – a significant lag during combat .
Now , the SWORDS wo n't act on a command , unless it 's received right away .
A three - part arming process – with both physical and electronic safeties – is required before firing .
Most importantly , the machines now come with kill switches , in case there 's any odd behavior .
" So now we can kill the unit if it goes crazy , " Zecca says .
As initially reported in National Defense magazine , only three of the robots are currently in Iraq .
Zecca says he 's ready to send more , " but we do n't have the money .
It 's not a priority for the Army , yet . "
He believes that 'll change , once the robots begin getting into firefights .
UPDATE : If you 're looking for a little robo war porn , here 's Future Weapons ' segment on the ' bot ...

Not long ago , the satirical newspaper The Onion ran a fake news story that began like this :
“ At a well - attended rally in front of his new ground zero headquarters Monday , former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani officially announced his plan to run for president of 9/11 .
‘ My fellow citizens of 9/11 , today I will make you a promise , ’ said Giuliani during his 18 - minute announcement speech in front of a charred and torn American flag .
‘ As president of 9/11 , I will usher in a bold new 9/11 for all . ’
If elected , Giuliani would inherit the duties of current 9/11 President George W. Bush , including making grim facial expressions , seeing the world ’s conflicts in terms of good and evil , and carrying a bullhorn at all state functions . ”
Like all good satire , the story made me both laugh and cry , because it reflected something so true — how much , since 9/11 , we ’ve become “ The United States of Fighting Terrorism . ”
Times columnists are not allowed to endorse candidates , but there ’s no rule against saying who will not get my vote : I will not vote for any candidate running on 9/11 .
We do n’t need another president of 9/11 .
We need a president for 9/12 .
I will only vote for the 9/12 candidate .
What does that mean ?
This : 9/11 has made us stupid .
I honor , and weep for , all those murdered on that day .
But our reaction to 9/11 — mine included — has knocked America completely out of balance , and it is time to get things right again .
It is not that I thought we had new enemies that day and now I do n’t .
Yes , in the wake of 9/11 , we need new precautions , new barriers .
But we also need our old habits and sense of openness .
For me , the candidate of 9/12 is the one who will not only understand who our enemies are , but who we are .
The George W. Bush administration ’s campaign to seize and detain Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) officials in Iraq , presented by Bush himself last January as a move to break up an alleged Iranian arms smuggling operation in Iraq , appears to have run its course without having been able to link a single Iranian to any such operation .
Despite administration rhetoric suggesting that the U.S. military had solid intelligence on which to base a campaign to break up Iranian - sponsored networks supplying armour - piercing weapons , what is now known about the kidnapping operations indicates that the actual purpose was to obtain some evidence from interrogations that would support the administration ’s line that the IRGC ’s elite Quds Force is involved in assisting Shi’ite forces militarily .
None of the six Iranians now held by the U.S. military , however , has provided any evidence for the administration ’s case despite many months of very tough interrogation usually employed on " high value " detainees .
Wayne White , former deputy director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research Office of Analysis for the Near East and South Asia , told IPS he believes the administration badly wanted to get information from the Iranian detainees that they could use to make their case , but has been unable to do so .
" I ’m convinced that they have n’t gotten anything out of them , " he said in an interview .
" They have n’t come up with anything they can shop around . "
The program has also been a political embarrassment in relations with U.S. allies in Iraq .
U.S. military seizures of Iranians who the U.S. military claimed were IRGC Quds Force officers have been condemned not only by the Shi’ite government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki but by Kurdish leaders as well .
The U.S. military apologised in August for " a regrettable incident " in which eight Iranians were arrested in Baghdad , and then freed after Iraqi protests .
The U.S. quietly released nine Iranian detainees last week , two of whom were seized in the Kurdish city of Erbil in January , saying they were " of no continuing intelligence value . "
The others do not appear to have been part of the deliberate targeting of Iranian officials .
What was later learned about the U.S. raids on Iranian officials in Kurdistan last January and again in September and in Baghdad last December shows that the U.S. military was targeting Iranians merely on the basis of their affiliation with the IRGC , while claiming publicly to have intelligence of their involvement in weapons trafficking .
The Jan. 10 raid was on an Iranian liaison office that had been operating in the Kurdistan capital of Erbil for 10 years with official Iraqi government approval .
The U.S. military issued only a vaguely - worded rationale for kidnapping the five Iranians , saying they were " suspected of being closely tied to activities targeting Iraqi and coalition forces … "
That was a thinly - veiled allusion to their suspected membership in the Revolutionary Guard Corps .
Iraq ’s Kurdish foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari , who demanded the release of the five Iranians , explained that they were not part of a " clandestine network " but were working on visas and other paperwork for travel by Iraqis to Iran .
Zebari pointed out that the men were working for the Revolutionary Guard Corps because that institution has the responsibility for controlling Iran ’s borders .
It is also common for IRGC officers to be given positions in a wide range of non-military Iranian government agencies .
That was the case with Mahmoud Farhadi , the Iranian official kidnapped by U.S. military from a hotel in Soleimanieh , Kurdistan Sep. 20 .
U.S. military spokesman Rear Adm .
Mark
Fox told reporters that Farhadi was a member of the " Ramadan Corps " of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard command responsible for all Iranian operations inside Iraq and the " linchpin " behind the smuggling of " sophisticated weapons " into Iraq by the Quds Force .
But officials of the Kurdistan regional government and the Kurdish president of Iraq , Jalal Talabani , publicly confirmed the Iranian government ’s assertion that Farhadi was a civilian official of the Kermanshah province governor - general ’s office on a " commercial mission with the knowledge of the federal government in Baghdad and the government of Kurdistan . "
Again , Kurdish authorities did not contest the fact that Farhadi had been in the IRGC .
The governor of Suleymaniye , Dana Majeed , acknowledged his IRGC membership to National Public Radio a week after the U.S. kidnapping , but insisted that his job was to expedite trade and transit across the border .
The U.S. military was apparently operating on the basis of information from the Iranian armed opposition group Mujahideen E Khalq ( MEK ) that was badly out of date .
The political arm of the MEK , the National Council or Resistance of Iran , which had been providing information to U.S. intelligence on the Iranian nuclear programme and on Iranian officials operating in Iraq , published a detailed article on Farhadi Sep. 25 which claimed that he was the commander of the Quds Force Zafar Base and said nothing about his having working for the province on cross - border trade .
But an article in a local Kurdish language daily in Soleminiye on Sep. 24 reported that an " informed source " belonging to unnamed " Iranian opposition group  obviously the MEK  had used the past tense in regard to Farhadi ’s role as Quds Force commander and acknowledged that Farhadi was now working in a commercial delegation .
In December 2006 , two accredited Iranian diplomats were kidnapped from the Embassy car on the way from praying at a mosque and later had to be released .
But four other Iranian officials were kidnapped in the compound of Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , the head of the Shi’ite political party called SCIRI , who had visited Bush three weeks earlier .
They were in the home of the chairman of the Parliamentary security committee and head of the Badr organisation .
The official explanation was that they were being detained on " suspicion of carrying out or planning attacks against Iraqi security forces . "
But the Iraqi interlocutors are part of the Iraqi government which supports the occupation and opposes the Madhi army .
If the Iranian officials detained were actually plotting with their hosts to attack Iraqi security forces , it would have meant that the SCIRI and the Badr Group were planning to attack their own government .
U.S. military officials claimed to the Washington Post that they had captured maps of Baghdad delineating Sunni Shi’ite and mixed neighbourhoods that would be useful for militias , lists of weapons systems and " information about importing modern , specially shaped explosive charges into Iran . "
But Laura Rozen of the National Journal quoted a U.S. official as saying that the evidence was far less conclusive than was claimed .
" They are trying to walk this back , " said the official .
" There are no smoking guns about Iran in Iraq . "
None of the allegedly damning evidence was mentioned in the Feb. 11 military briefing to the U.S. media on the alleged Quds Force EFP smuggling , indicating that these claims were vastly exaggerated .

Few phrases are quite so boring , misleading , or overused as the phrase ‘ size - zero debate ’ .
I mean , what exactly is it that people are supposed to be debating ?
Everyone , it seems , is agreed on the essentials : ‘ size zero ’ , for most women , is far too thin ( not to mention the fact that what we really mean is ‘ size four ’ ) ; it ’s better to be healthy than unhealthy ; it ’s better to be happy than unhappy ; it ’s rarely in anyone ’s best interests to look like a water - retentive buffalo , but then again , why starve yourself to look like a prepubescent boy ?
It ’s tedious stuff .
Every cliché in the book of clichés has been used again and again , to the point where journalists have little left to do but moan on about how monotonous it ’s getting – baiting the debate has become as much a banality as the ‘ debate ’ itself .
After all , thinking up different ways to describe collarbones is a game you can only play for so long , before your brain stem starts to rot and you switch on The Simple Life instead .
And yet our collective fixation refuses , like baby - weight , to budge .
When Heat magazine ran twelve consecutive ‘ skinny celebrity ’ covers , its sales figures sky - rocketed .
When someone realised this was money - making wizardry , other magazines followed suit .
There is even a website ( www.theskinnywebsite.com), which , describing itself as ‘ celebrity gossip and trends pertaining to weight , diet and exercise ’ is bombarded with 50,000 page hits every day .
Interspersed with Google ads for ‘ pro-mia bracelets ’ and ’ emotional eating ’ treatments , this website is to gossip mags what hardcore pornography is to Carry on Camping .
Photographs of celebrities are posted , and hordes of gleeful commenters rush in to bitch about the find .
To take a random selection of comments : ‘ OmG sHe Is SoOoOoOo FaT !!!!!’ , ‘ Her legs are terrible !
The girl has cankles !’ , and ‘ Look at her lower tummy .
It ’s poochy … like an old lady ’s ’ .
If I tell you that the target of this particular onslaught is the tremendously slender Mischa Barton , a girl whose tummy is no closer to being ‘ poochy ’ than mine is to being a nuclear warship , then you get a sense of the sort of derangement we ’re contending with .
Worse yet is the cattiness reserved for Mel ‘ Sporty Spice ’ C : in response to her admission that she has a history of eating disorders and may have done permanent damage to her bones , one comment makes the snide remark : “ She ’s making up excuses so people wo n’t criticise her for being fat now . ”
It ’s easy to dismiss such sniping as playground idiocy – the extra-curricular stupidity of a small number of ill - educated and objectionable teenage girls .
But people read this stuff .
People who really should know better .
Realistically speaking , none of us cares one iota what Britney ’s cellulite is doing these days .
Why should we ?
Until she actually amputates a chunk of it and sends it to us anonymously in a brown paper envelope , it is n’t impinging on us .
Equally , no - one gives a flying flip whether so - and - so celebrity is pregnant , or full up , or merely breathing out .
But , however we justify it to ourselves – whether post - modern irony or pop-culture curiosity or simply boredom – we read this trash all the same .
We read it gluttonously and compulsively , and when we ’re sated we feel soiled and slightly grubby , and resolve not to waste our time on it again .
At least until next Tuesday , that is , when the next spate of weeklies fills our stands .
Calling it ‘ the size zero debate ’ obfuscates what ’s really going on .
This is not about what size women ought or ought not to be – this is about the fact that women feel they ‘ ought ’ to be anything at all
I must admit , I ’m a serial offender when it comes to ‘ skinny porn ’ .
Often , I ’ll go to the newsagent ’s under the pretext of buying chewing gum and will stand for hours ( well , the five minutes that it takes to read Heat , Now , Closer , First , Grazia , Reveal , Star , Look and New in any case – they ’re not that wordy ) suckered in by the headlines .
‘ Celebrity body shocks ! ’ they ’ll scream – and you ’ll open the magazine to find that some poor girl in the region of a size ten has been papped sticking her belly out :
“ Fat celebrities ! ”
“ Skinny celebrities ! ”
“ Celebrities who used to be fat and now are skinny ! ”
“ Celebrities who used to be skinny and now are fat ! ”
“ Celebrities ’ real weights ! ”
“ Celebrities ’ dress sizes / waist measurements / BMIs ! ”
“ Celebrities who love their curves ! ”
“ Celebrities who hate their chunky thighs ! ”
“ The worrying new quadruple zero trend ! ”
“ Celebrities who are powerless to defend themselves against the massive oncoming tide of obesity to which you too will succumb if you do n’t follow our exclusive new diet plan ! ”
“ Big fat extravaganza of bitchiness , self - loathing , insecurity and wrenching confusion dressed up as concern ! ”
( OK , so those last few are reading between the lines , but I ’m sure you get the picture ) …
Here , you ’ll find more mixed messages than at a postal sorting office for the blind .
Whether a celebrity is deemed to be thin or fat will depend on which magazine you ’re reading , and whether said thin / fat figure is deemed to be good or bad will depend on what ’s being promoted .
‘ Curvy ’ – which can be euphemistic for ‘ needs a gastric bypass ’ , or shorthand for ‘ size 4 with silicon breasts ’ – has no meaning whatsoever : all we can garner from these magazines is that men are supposed to like it and women are supposed to be it .
( Every magazine purports to be anti-size - zero after all , and , if you look very closely , believes itself to be bucking a trend . )
You ’ll find adverts for diet products next to ‘ body - positive ’ interviews with invariably ‘ curvy ’ celebs ; you ’ll find page - spreads of pin-thin models , close to self - righteous chastisements of celebrities the same size ; you ’ll find that celebrities ’ supposed weights , and even heights , will oscillate insanely from one magazine to the next ( is Lily Allen 5 ft2 or 5ft6 ? is Keira Knightley a 00 or a 12 ? ) ; and you ’ll find that these magazines tell you nothing but that the female body is an object to be judged .
Judging each others ’ bodies is our prerogative , we think , given that we ’re so brutal about our own
Calling it ‘ the size zero debate ’ obfuscates what ’s really going on .
This is not about what size women ought or ought not to be – this is about the fact that women feel they ‘ ought ’ to be anything at all .
This is about the fact that most women , to a greater or lesser extent , are dissatisfied with their bodies ( Grazia magazine , which knows its target market , once reported the figure as 97 % ) ; this is about the fact that unhealthy attitudes to food have become so common in our society as to be virtually normalised ; this is about the fact that the owner of theskinnywebsite , in response to the question ‘ do you have an eating disorder ? ’ , can truthfully reply ‘ I know very few women who do n’t have some kind of eating disorder or weird relationship with food ’ this is about the fact that a woman can be famous , successful , admired , scorned , pilloried or lauded as an icon to us all , simply for being a certain size ; this is about the fact that Nicole Richie gained exposure with every pound that she lost , and that critically - acclaimed actresses can be better known for the circumference of their hips than for their Academy Awards ; this is about the fact – the crucial fact – that it ’s different for men .
There simply is n’t a market in objectifying men in this way .
Sure , every so often these magazines will include a token bloke with a paunch ( theskinnywebsite has ‘ male celebrities ’ sandwiched in between Lindsay Lohan and Mandy Moore ) , and it looks like men are starting to face similar pressures to women , given that male eating disorders are on the rise .
But nobody – neither men nor women – is interested in mauling men in the same way that women tear at each other .
Judging each others ’ bodies is our prerogative , we think , given that we ’re so brutal about our own .
What is needed is awareness , resilience , a more - than - occasional reality check , and , in the case of the girls who called Mischa Barton ‘ fat ’ , a trip to the opthamologist
The ‘ size - zero debate ’ , and the thousand magazine spreads it has spawned , is a genius stroke of marketing .
In the same crude way that sex sells , skinny - porn sells , for in an industry bloated with sensationalism , flushed with garish colours and festooned with headlines of the “ my brother gave birth to a frozen chicken and I ’m the father ” variety , the more voyeuristic a picture or caption the more profitable .
The reason they keep on churning this stuff out is because we keep on buying it .
And the reason we keep on buying it is because our self - esteem has already been eroded by umpteen other articles which showed us exactly the same things .
Ways out of the tangle ?
I suspect that websites like this one are a good way to begin .
What is needed is awareness , resilience , a more - than - occasional reality check , and , in the case of the girls who called Mischa Barton ‘ fat ’ , a trip to the opthamologist .
The bloggers at Jezebel have the right idea .
In a recent take - off of ‘ celebs and their cellulite ’ style magazine covers , they compiled a mock - up cover containing pictures of their own cellulite .
Imperfect , normal , proud – and not a bit of schenfreude , or refracted insecurity , in sight .
They serve as a shining and delightfully dimpled example to us all .
As it stands , however , I ’m going to the newsagents .
For chewing gum .
I promise …

Almost 90 % of teenagers aged 12 - 18 claim to have been victims of some level of sexual violence , according to a study conducted jointly by the University of Haifa and Ben Gurion University ( Israel ) .
The research surveyed 1,036 high school students .
Additionally , 82 % of the boys and 76 % of the girls reported said that they had been subjects of violent physical assault .
Prof. Rachel Lev-Wiesel from the University of Haifa 's School of Social Work , one of the authors of the study , noted that the results showed a distressing increase in the incidence of violence – both sexual and physical - over the past few years .
The number of criminal files opened by the police for assault against children rose from 6,370 in 1998 to 8,805 in 2005 .
According to the National Council for the Child , the number of children treated for suspected violent attacks or abuse in 2005 stood at more than 37,000 , a rise of 120 % over the past decade .
Of the 37,000 , 30.5 % were reported physical violence , 9.9 % sexual , 13 % psychological and 36.8 % varying degrees of neglect .
Prof. Lev-Wiesel stressed that the aim of the research was to examine the personal and social factors that help adolescents cope with the trauma of a violent assault .
A questionnaire was completed anonymously by over 1,000 high school students .
The questionnaire measured six variables : demography , physical and sexual assaults , PTSD , potency and social support from family and friends .
According to the researchers , there is a distinct correlation between a child 's feeling of potency and the level of traumatic symptoms exhibited following a violent attack .
The study found a distinctive difference in the personal resources and the level of psychological distress of the children who suffered violent attacks as opposed to those who did not – whether the violence was limited to one incident or continuing and whether the attack was considered minor or severe .
Boys in the study reported a higher incidence of sexual and physical violence than girls .
" The results of the research show that a feeling of potency and support of family and friends are important resources which have the potential to reduce the resulting trauma following assault .
In addition to the importance of developing programs to decrease the incidence of violence , these is a need for programs for empowerment and strengthening personal resources that will protect those who have already fallen victim to violence , " summarized Prof. Lev-Wiesel .
The results of the study were presented at a conference , held on October 10 , 2007 , in cooperation with the University of Haifa , announcing the establishment of a non-profit organization founded by academics , professionals in the fields of social services and healthcare , lawmakers and the media to fight the rising incidence of violence and propose concrete solutions for aiding victims .

Update 2007 - 10 - 01 : Patch 5 for the video element support can run this SVG demo .
Binaries and SVG source available here .
Vladimir Vukicevic ported a Silverlight demo to SVG .
The photos.svg file runs in Firefox and you can move , resize and rotate the photo 's using a nice interface .
It demonstrates that the types of things that Silverlight is being used for can also be done using open standard technologies like SVG .
I took Vladimir 's work and modified it to work with the HTML video element support I 'm adding to Firefox .
With this version you can resize , rotate and move video files while they are playing .
The topmost video in the z -order has the audio track played .
Performance is pretty reasonable considering I have n't done any optimisation of it .
The magic of including the HTML video element inside SVG is done using < foreignObject > .
Something like
< foreignObject > < div xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < video src=" myvideo.ogg " /> </div> </foreignObject >
A screen cast of this running is available ( in various file formats ) :
The videos being played are :
Open Road Trip interview
A Scanner Darkly movie trailer
Video of Pitcairn Islanders making Molasses
To get this working I had to make a few changes to the video element code , some of which are in the git repository already .
The rest will be pushed soon , along with the source to the SVG demo which I 'll add to the list of test / demo files I use .
If you have a browser with support for < video > you should see the option to play it below .

Sorry , this browser does not support the video element .
Hotel heiress Paris Hilton does n't need to worry about family patriarch and precious grandad Barron Hilton cutting her out of his will .
A story published in the UK said the ex-con party princess was in jeopardy of losing her mega- inheritance because sullying the family reputation , saying that grandpa was cutting her out of the will .
TMZ has confirmed that 's baloney .
After the socialite was sprung from the klink , she spent a few days at grandpa Hilton 's family compound in Beverly Hills .

Posted in OLPC Posted in Hardware
Last week I had the pleasure to play with one of the first models of the 100 dollars laptop , aka OLPC ( One Laptop Per Child ) .
And I am quite impressed by it .
Before listing the good stuff let me say one thing that I did n’t like : that is the special interface for Linux Fedora .
Maybe the kids will appreciate it but I found it to be rather confusing .
Now ….
the good stuff :
The screen
For this inexpensive piece of hardware the LCD is simply amazing .
You can adjust its luminosity very easy .
And on the minimum level the screen looks a lot like paper , and you will need some light to read the screen ( I imagine the kids in Africa will appreciate it ) .
You can also turn the display just like a tablet PC .
It is not a touchscreen yet but you have some buttons to scroll the screen or do various tasks .
The camera
First thing I thought when I saw the OLPC ’s camera I felt ripped off .
Last year I ’ve bought a webcam that costed around 50 $ and compared with the camera of the 100 $ laptop it is a piece of crap .
The camera built in the OLPC has almost the same quality as those on the Mac’s .
I can not see a damn thing on my camera unless I turn all the lights on .
Battery life
20 hours .
Do I need to say more ?
The Keyboard
Though it is very small and made from rubber it is perfect for the kids that will gonna use it .
Did you ever spill coffee on your laptop ?
I did n’t but I ’ve seen some crazy movies on You Tube .
But when the kids will spill some milk ( and they will ) on their keyboards nothing will happen .
They can easily clean it with dry towel and laptop it ’s as good as new .
Wireless access
Yep ….
the laptop has some funny antennas that you can connect wireless to the Internet .
What can you ask for more ?
Conclusion
I ’ve always considered the OLPC to be no more than an advanced toy but once I ’ve seen the technology inside it I think it is quite a superb machine .
Shannon Rea 's job as a part - time bartender in Brooklyn gives her a close - up look at the risky behavior of people in their 20s .
Some end a night of drinking with hookups .
Some take rides from the slightly inebriated .
Others try to drive when they should n't .
( She sobers them up , takes their keys and finds them rides . )
" I think the early 20s are the new teenage years , " says Rea , 26 , a college student studying to be a history teacher .
" There are no parents telling them , ' You ca n't do this . '
It 's pretty much a free - for - all . "
The 20s always have been prime time for risky behavior , from binge drinking and unprotected sex to dabbling in drugs and driving too fast .
But new brain research suggests young adults may have less control over these impulses : Neurological areas that regulate impulse and emotions are not fully developed until about the mid-20s , findings show .
And recent demographic trends do n't help :
Young people today are delaying settling down into careers and marriage , both of which tend to reduce risky behaviors , sociologists , psychologists and historians say .
" We are so obsessed about the dangers of adolescence , we have all sorts of mechanisms to protect kids from disaster , but we do n't have that for young people in their 20s , " says Steven Mintz of the University of Houston , who is writing a book on the history of adulthood .
American society has taken great pains to prevent adolescents from the perils of foolhardy behavior , from zero - tolerance alcohol and drug programs to graduated drivers ' licenses to city curfews for youths , Mintz says .
If teens make mistakes , they often get a second chance .
But in their 20s , society is less forgiving .
" It 's the 20s that are risky , " he says .
Statistics tell the story
Recent statistics back this up : 56 % of births among women ages 20 - 24 were to unwed mothers , according to preliminary 2005 data from the National Center for Health Statistics ; for ages 25 - 29 , it was 29 % .
Violent crimes — from homicide to rape , robbery and assault — are highest among young adults , according to data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the FBI .
The 20s also is the time of heaviest drinking .
One measure , the University of Michigan 's 2005 Monitoring the Future study , shows that the highest percentages of those having five or more drinks in a row at least once in a two - week period were those in their 20s .
Bingeing was reported by 40.4 % of ages 21 and 22 , 39.2 % of ages 23 and 24 , and 37.7 % of ages 25 and 26 .
When young celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan abuse drugs or alcohol or drive under the influence and get caught , the big question seems to be : Why ?
Scott Stanley , a research professor in psychology at the University of Denver , says many major life decisions that used to be fairly settled are now " up for grabs through their 20s " — from education and career to sexual relationships and partner choices .
This " extended adolescence " increasingly is being acknowledged by those who have focused on teens .
For example , in May , the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy announced an expansion of its mission to include those in their 20s and 30s .
At least 35 states have taken some steps to extend foster care services to those ages 19 - 23 ; 18 has been the point for " aging out " of the foster care system .
Most states consider 18 the time when young people are legally held responsible for their actions .
But Jeffrey Arnett , a research professor in psychology at Clark University in Worcester , Mass. , says many young people just do n't believe they 're going to suffer the consequences .
He calls it an " optimistic bias . "
Arnett says young celebrities in particular so often have been overindulged as children and teens that they do n't have the self - discipline to play by the rules .
Britney Spears ' risky behavior has n't just affected her .
Last year , the singer , now 25 , was photographed driving with her infant son sitting on her lap behind the wheel rather than in a car seat .
But real social and economic factors today do add to the pressures facing young adults :
• A study of long - term wealth trends released last week by the University of Michigan 's Institute for Social Research found the median household net worth of people in their 20s fell by nearly 30 % from 2003 to 2005 .
The data support the notion that it is more difficult for younger people today to establish themselves financially , says study director Frank Stafford .
• Finishing college often takes longer than four years ; some also stay in school longer because in an increasingly competitive job market , they seek to get a leg up with advanced degrees .
• Some experts , including Mintz , say the military draft ( created in 1940 and eliminated in 1973 ) forced young men to mature and at the same time helped keep them away from troublesome behavior .
The military used to be a pretty standard part of growing up for men in decades past , but it 's a route for fewer young people today — " it 's a risky proposition these days , " he says .
Adds bartender Rea : " When you 're 15 or 16 , you 're expected to go out and experiment and break curfew and do something ridiculous .
You 're immature at that point .
Then at 18 or 19 , something is supposed to snap on in your head , and you 're supposed to grow up . "
The biology of the brain
Over the past several years , brain studies by researchers around the country , including at the National Institutes of Health , University of Pittsburgh , Harvard Medical School and Temple University , have found that the area that controls impulses takes longer to mature than previously thought .
Greater demands have made the 20s a difficult period , says Frank Furstenberg Jr. , a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia whose work has focused on the transition to adulthood .
" It is not well known that this age group does have these elevated problems , " he says .
" Adolescence has captured so much of the attention of American policymakers . "
He says it 's even more of a challenge for an estimated 15 % to 25 % who by early adulthood are " seriously off track . "
They include those who are n't in school , do n't have jobs or may have little prospect of finding a job due to lack of skills .
Others have serious drug or alcohol problems .
Some are in jail or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system .
" It can be a risky stage for rich kids because they have the money to get in trouble and for poor kids because trouble finds them in the neighborhood , " says Michael Rosenfeld , a social demographer at Stanford University .
" There are plenty of ways in which kids from families with the financial means avoid the long - term repercussions of youthful indiscretion . "
Partners , careers stabilize
John Laub , a University of Maryland criminology professor , and Robert Sampson , a Harvard sociologist , have studied the life course of crime for about 20 years .
Sampson says the peak age for many crimes has shifted older , and although juveniles are committing offenses at younger ages , the duration of criminal activity lasts longer .
By analyzing interviews with 500 men , all of them former juvenile delinquents , and follow - up interviews with 52 men , the pair also found , on average , a 35 % less chance of a crime being committed during a period of marriage .
" We find that marriage ' civilizes ' men — reducing crime and antisocial behavior on average by a large amount , " Sampson says .
The average age at first marriage , according to the latest Census data , is 25 for women and 27 for men .
Experts say singles overall are more likely than married people to take risks because they have the freedom to do what they want without having to answer to anyone .
A few years do seem to make a difference .
All sorts of research suggests that by the late 20s , risky behavior drops among young adults , largely because that 's when they pair up and begin to settle down with a career and a partner .
Furstenberg says social relationships tend to constrain behavior .
" People stop doing things they did when they were younger . "
Beth Kerber , 26 , of St. Louis , believes she has definitely matured , although she says she " can't imagine " marriage right now .
" I 've seen a huge amount of growth in myself from age 22 to 25 , " says Kerber , who just finished graduate school and is working as a hospital speech pathologist .
" When I go out now , it 's completely different than when I was 21 or 22 .
You are much more experienced with drinking and realize it's not that great to black out or not remember the night .
When you 're young , it 's ' Let 's have fun . ' "
Differences in sexual appetite may be driven by evolution
Researchers from Germany found that four years into a relationship , less than half of 30 - year - old women wanted regular sex .
Conversely , the team found a man 's libido remained the same regardless of how long he had been in a relationship .
Writing in the journal Human Nature , the scientists said the differences resulted from how humans had evolved .
For men , a good reason their sexual motivation to remain constant would be to guard against being cuckolded by another male
Dr Dietrich Klusmann
The researchers from Hamburg - Eppendorf University Hospital interviewed 530 men and women about their relationships .
They found 60 % of 30 - year - old women wanted sex " often " at the beginning of a relationship , but within four years of the relationship this figure fell to under 50 % , and after 20 years it dropped to about 20 % .
In contrast , they found the proportion of men wanting regular sex remained at between 60 - 80 % , regardless of how long they had been in a relationship .
Tenderness
The study also revealed tenderness was important for women in a relationship .
About 90 % of women wanted tenderness , regardless of how long they had been in a relationship , but only 25 % of men who had been in a relationship for 10 years said they were still seeking tenderness from their partner .
Dr Dietrich Klusmann , lead author of the study and a psychologist from Hamburg - Eppendorf University Hospital , believed the differences were down to human evolution .
He said : " For men , a good reason their sexual motivation to remain constant would be to guard against being cuckolded by another male . "
But women , he said , have evolved to have a high sex drive when they are initially in a relationship in order to form a " pair bond " with their partner .
But , once this bond is sealed a woman 's sexual appetite declines , he added .
He said animal behaviour studies suggest this could be because females may be diverting their sexual interest towards other men , in order to secure the best combinations of genetic material for their offspring .
Or , he said , this could be because limiting sex may boost their partner 's interest in it .
Professor George Fieldman , an evolutionary psychologist from Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College , said : " These findings seem to fit in with anecdotal studies and his explanations seem plausible .
" The rational for why a woman 's sex drive declines may be down to supply and demand .
If something is in infinite supply , the perceived value would drop . "
This is the story of a piece of paper no bigger than a credit card , thrown away in a dustbin on the Heathrow Express to Paddington station .
It was nestling among chewing gum wrappers and baggage tags , cast off by some weary traveller , when I first laid eyes on it just over a month ago .
The traveller 's name was Mark Broer .
I know this because the paper - actually a flimsy piece of card - was a discarded British Airways boarding - pass stub , the small section of the pass displaying your name and seat number .
The stub you probably throw away as soon as you leave your flight .
It said Broer had flown from Brussels to London on March 15 at 7.10 am on BA flight 389 in seat 03C .
It also told me he was a " Gold " standard passenger and gave me his frequent - flyer number .
I picked up the stub , mindful of a conversation I had had with a computer security expert two months earlier , and put it in my pocket .
If the expert was right , this stub would enable me to access Broer 's personal information , including his passport number , date of birth and nationality .
It would provide the building blocks for stealing his identity , ruining his future travel plans - and even allow me to fake his passport .
It would also serve as the perfect tool for demonstrating the chaotic collection , storage and security of personal information gathered as a result of America 's near - fanatical desire to collect data on travellers flying to the US - and raise serious questions about the sort of problems we can expect when ID cards are introduced in 2008 .
To understand why the piece of paper I found on the Heathrow Express is important , it is necessary to go back not , as you might expect , to 9/11 , but to 1996 and the crash of TWA Flight 800 over Long Island Sound , 12 minutes out of New York , with the loss of 230 lives .
Initially , crash investigators suspected a terrorist bomb might have brought down the aircraft .
This was later ruled out , but already the Clinton administration had decided it was time to devise a security system that would weed out potential terrorists before they boarded a flight .
This was called Capps , the Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-screening System .
It was a prosaic , relatively unambitious idea at first .
For example , in highly simplistic terms , if someone bought a one - way ticket , paid in cash and checked in no baggage , they would be flagged up as an individual who had no intention of arriving or of going home .
A bomber , perhaps .
After 9/11 , the ambitions for such screening grew exponentially and the newly founded Department of Homeland Security began inviting computer companies to develop intelligent systems that could " mine " data on individuals , whizzing round state , private and public databases to establish what kind of person was buying the ticket .
In 2003 , one of the pioneers of the system , speaking anonymously , told me that the project , by now called Capps II , was being designed to designate travellers as green , amber or red risks .
Green would be an individual with no criminal record - a US citizen , perhaps , who had a steady job and a settled home , was a frequent flyer and so on .
Amber would be someone who had not provided enough information to confirm all of this and who might be stopped at US Immigration and asked to provide clearer proof of ID .
Red would be someone who might be linked to an ever - growing list of suspected terrorists - or someone whose name matched such a suspect .
" If you are an American who has volunteered lots of details proving that you are who you say you are , that you have a stable home , live in a community , are n't a criminal , [ Capps II ] will flag you up as green and you will be automatically allowed on to your flight , " the pioneer told me .
" The problem is that if the system does n't have a lot of information on you , or you have ordered a halal meal , or have a name similar to a known terrorist , or even if you are a foreigner , you 'll most likely be flagged amber and held back to be asked for further details .
If you are European and the US government is short of information on you - or , as is likely , has incorrect information on you - you can reckon on delay after delay unless you agree to let them delve into your private details .
" That is inconvenient enough but , as we tested the system , it became clear that information was going to be used to build a complete picture of you from lots of private databases - your credit record , your travel history , your criminal record , whether you had the remotest dubious links with anyone at your college who became a terrorist .
I began to feel more and more uncomfortable about it . "
Eventually , he quit the programme .
All of this was on my mind as I sat down with my computer expert , Adam Laurie , one of the founders of a company called the Bunker Secure Hosting , to examine Broer 's boarding - pass stub .
Laurie is known in cyber - circles as something of a white knight , a computer wizard who not only advises companies on how to make their systems secure , but also cares about civil rights and privacy .
He and his brother Ben are renowned among web designers as the men who developed Apache SSL - the software that makes most of the world 's web pages secure - and then gave it away for free .
We logged on to the BA website , bought a ticket in Broer 's name and then , using the frequent flyer number on his boarding pass stub , without typing in a password , were given full access to all his personal details - including his passport number , the date it expired , his nationality ( he is Dutch , living in the UK ) and his date of birth .
The system even allowed us to change the information .
Using this information and surfing publicly available databases , we were able - within 15 minutes - to find out where Broer lived , who lived there with him , where he worked , which universities he had attended and even how much his house was worth when he bought it two years ago .
( This was particularly easy given his unusual name , but it would have been possible even if his name had been John Smith .
We now had his date of birth and passport number , so we would have known exactly which John Smith . )
Laurie was anything but smug .
" This is terrible , " he said .
" It just shows what happens when governments begin demanding more and more of our personal information and then entrust it to companies simply not geared up for collecting or securing it as it gets shared around more and more people .
It does n't enhance our security ; it undermines it . "
Just over $ 100 m had been spent on Capps II before it was scrapped in July 2004 .
Campaigners in the US had objected to it on grounds of privacy , and airlines such as JetBlue and American faced boycotts when it emerged that they were involved in trials - handing over passenger information - with the Department of Homeland Security 's Transportation Security Administration .
Even worse , JetBlue admitted it had given the private records of 5 million passengers to a commercial company for analysis - and some of this was posted on the internet .
But the problems did not end with the demise of Capps II .
Earlier that month , after 18 months of acrimonious negotiation , the EU caved in to American demands that European airlines , too , should hand over passenger information to the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection , BCBP , before their aircraft would be allowed to land on US soil .
The BCBP wanted up to 60 pieces of information routinely gathered by booking agencies and stored as a Passenger Name Record , PNR .
This included not only your flight details , name , address and so on , but also your travel itinerary , where you were staying , with whom you travelled , whether you booked a hire car in the US , whether you booked a smoking room in your hotel , even if you ordered a halal or kosher meal .
And the US authorities wanted to keep it all for 50 years .
At first , the European Commission argued that surrendering such information would be in breach of European data protection law .
Eventually , however , in the face of huge fines for airlines and cancelled landing slots , it agreed that 34 items from PNRs could be handed over and kept by the US for three and a half years .
Capps II was superseded by a new system called Secure Flight in August 2004 .
Later , in October last year , the BCBP demanded that airlines travelling to , or through , the US should forward " advance passenger information " , including passport number and date of birth , before passengers would be allowed to travel .
It called this the advance passenger information system , or APIS .
This is the information that Laurie and I had accessed through the BA website .
" The problem here is that a commercial organisation is being given the task of collecting data on behalf of a foreign government , for which it gets no financial reward , and which offers no business benefit in return , " says Laurie .
" Naturally , in such a case , they will seek to minimise their costs , which they do by handing the problem off to the passengers themselves .
This has the neat side - effect of also handing off liability for data errors .
" You can imagine the case where a businessman 's trip gets delayed because his passport details were incorrectly entered and he was mistaken for a terrorist .
Since BA did n't enter the data - frequent flyers are asked to do it themselves - they can't be held responsible and can't be sued for his lost business . "
By the time I found the ticket stub and went to Laurie , he had already reported his suspicions about a potential security lapse to BA ( on January 20 ) by email .
He received no response , so followed up with a telephone call asking for the airline 's security officer .
He was told there was n't one , so he explained the lapse to an employee .
Nothing was done and he still has not been contacted .
Three months ago , after further objections in the US , but before our investigation , Secure Flight was suspended after costing the US taxpayer $ 144 m .
At the time , Kip Hawley , transportation security administrator , said : " While the Secure Flight regulation is being developed , this is the time to ensure that the Secure Flight security , operational and privacy foundation is solid . "
The TSA said it would continue its passenger pre-screening programme in yet another guise after it had been audited and added that it had plans to introduce more security , privacy and redress for errors - confirming critics ' suspicions that no such systems were yet in place .
To the consternation of privacy activists in Europe , the TSA also spelled out plans for its desire for various US government departments to share information , including yours and mine .
Dr Gus Hosein , a visiting fellow specialising in privacy and terrorism at the London School of Economics , is concerned about where the whole project will go next .
" They want to extend the advance passenger information system [ APIS ] to include data on where passengers are going and where they are staying because of concerns over plagues , " he says .
" For example , if bird flu breaks out , they want to know where all the foreign travellers are .
The airlines hate this .
It is a security nightmare .
Soon the US will demand biometric information [ fingerprints , retina scans etc ] and they will share that around .
" But what the BA lapse shows is that companies cannot be trusted to gather this information without it getting out to criminals who would abuse it .
The potential for identity theft is huge , but the number of agencies among which it will be shared is just growing and growing . "
And that is where concern comes in over the UK 's proposed ID cards , which may one day be needed to travel to the US .
According to the Home Office , the identity cards bill currently going through Parliament allows for up to 40 pieces of personal information to be held on the proposed ID card , with digital biometric details of all of your fingerprints , both your irises and your face , all of which can be transmitted to electronic readers .
The cards will contain a microchip the size of a grain of sand linked to a tiny embedded antenna that transmits all the information when contacted by an electronic reader .
This readable system , known as Radio Frequency Identification , or RFID , has recently been installed in new British passports .
The Home Office says the information can be transmitted across a distance of only a couple of centimetres because the chips have no power of their own - they simply bounce back a response to a weak signal sent from passport readers at immigration points .
However , the suspicion is that the distance over which the signal can be read relates only to the weakness of the signal sent out by the readers .
What if the readers sent out much stronger signals ?
Potentially , then , criminals with powerful readers could suck out your information as you passed by .
The Government denies that this scenario is viable , but , in January , Dutch security specialists Riscure successfully read and de-encrypted information from its country 's new biometric passports from a distance of about 30ft in just two hours .
" The Home Office says British passport information is encrypted , but it 's a pretty basic form of encryption , " says Hosein .
" Everyone expects the ID cards to be equally insecure .
If the government insists they wo n't be cracked , read or copied , they 're kidding themselves and us . "
BA has now closed its security loophole after being contacted by the Guardian in March , but that particular lapse is beside the point .
Because of the pressure being applied to airlines by the US , breaches will happen again elsewhere as our personal data whizzes around the globe , often without our knowledge or consent .
Meanwhile , accountability remains lamentable .
Several calls to the US Transportation Security Administration were not returned .
Perhaps the last word should go to Mark Broer , the man whose boarding pass stub started off this virtual paper chase .
He is aged 41 and is a successful executive with a pharmaceutical recruitment company .
When I told him what we had done with his boarding pass stub , he was appalled .
" I travel regularly and , because I go to the US , I submitted my personal information and passport number - it is required if you are a frequent flyer and want to check yourself in , " he says .
" Experienced travellers today know that they have to give up information for ease of travel and to fight terrorism .
It is an exchange of information in return for convenience .
But as far as I 'm concerned , having that information leaked out to people who could steal my identity was n't part of the deal . "
Claim : Between 1988 and 2006 , a man lived at a Paris airport .
Status : True .
Origins :
What follows is one representative newspaper account of the strange story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri , a man without country , trapped by his lack of papers in Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris , France , since 26 August 1988 :
He could be any passenger waiting for a flight , sitting patiently on a red plastic bench in Charles de Gaulle Airport ’s Terminal One , luggage piled neatly by his side .
He could be any passenger waiting for a flight , sitting patiently on a red plastic bench in CharlesAirport ’sluggage piled neatly by his side .
He sips a cup of hot chocolate and scans the crowd , occasionally cocking his head to listen to the airport announcements .
He peruses a book , Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s “ It Takes a Village . ” But Mehran Karimi Nasseri is going nowhere .
He has been waiting for a flight out of France , he says , for 10 years .
Nasseri was expelled from Iran a decade ago for his political views .
Through a series of fateful missteps , he landed here without any documents .
Since then , Europe ’s increasingly stiff stance toward refugees and his fragile mental state have kept him at the airport here in legal limbo .
His is a story of broken hopes and bureaucracy , of a trip across Europe in search of a homeland that became a journey into mental chaos and despair .
And it is a story of a man who has searched for his family , only to find an adopted one here , at Charles de Gaulle .
“ He ’s like a part of the airport .
Everyone knows him , ” says Muhamed Mourrid , the manager of the Bye Bye Bar , pointing to the spot where Nasseri , 47 , has lived for a decade .
“ That ’s his table , his chair , his place . ”
Adds Marise Petry , a Lufthansa clerk , “ He ’s one of us .
We even get letters for him . ”
Among the annals of horrific refugee tales , Nasseri ’s story is remarkable for its pathos and complexity .
It begins in Iran in 1977 , when Nasseri , fresh from studying in England , was expelled for protesting against the shah .
His expulsion left him without a passport .
Nasseri came to Europe .
He bounced from capital to capital , applying for refugee status and being refused , again and again , for nearly four years .
In 1981 , his request for political asylum from Iran was finally granted by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Belgium .
That decision gave him refugee credentials , which in turn allowed him to seek citizenship in a European country .
The son of an Iranian and a Briton , Nasseri decided in 1986 on England with the hope of finding relatives there .
He got as far as Paris , where in 1988 his briefcase containing his refugee documents was stolen in a train station .
Nasseri boarded a plane for London anyway .
But when officials at Heathrow Airport found he had no passport , they sent him back to Charles de Gaulle .
At first , the French police arrested him for illegal entry .
But as Nasseri had no documents , there was no country of origin to which he could be deported .
So he took up residence in Terminal One .
From its circular confines , he and his attorney , the Paris - based human rights lawyer Christian Bourget , battled to define his status and send him to London .
In 1992 , a French court finally ruled that Nasseri had entered the airport legally as a refugee and could not be expelled from it .
But the court could not force the French government to allow him out of the airport onto French soil .
In fact , Bourget said , French authorities refused to give Nasseri either a refugee or transit visa .
“ It was pure bureaucracy , ” said the lawyer .
French immigration authorities have no comment on the case .
Bourget and Nasseri then focused on Belgium , where they hoped to reclaim Nasseri ’s original refugee documents .
But Belgian refugee officials refused to mail them to him in France .
They argued that Nasseri had to present himself in person so that they could be sure he was the same man to whom they had granted political asylum years before .
But , inexplicably , the Belgian government refused at that point to allow Nasseri to return there .
And under Belgian law , a refugee who voluntarily leaves a country that has accepted him cannot return .
In 1995 , the Belgian government finally told Nasseri that he could retrieve his refugee documents if he agreed to live in Belgium under the supervision of a social worker .
Nasseri refused .
He said he would move only to Great Britain .
And so here he has remained , year after year .
At first glance , the dignified man does not appear to be a refugee who sleeps on an airport bench because he has nowhere else to go .
His clothes are clean , his moustache well - trimmed .
He keeps his one blazer covered with plastic wrap , hanging from an airport cart .
His belongings are carefully packed in a frayed suitcase and a stack of Lufthansa boxes .
Nasseri nods hello to a clerk , who calls him “ Alfred , ” his nickname here .
He follows the news closely , thanks to the most recent Time magazine , which the postman has just dropped off .
And he loves to discuss the new selections from the Book - of - the - Month Club .
“ I just keep on reading , every day , ” said the soft - spoken Nasseri , a courtly gentleman who rises and offers his seat to a visitor .
“ I just keep waiting here . ”
His pallid complexion is testament to his inability to cross the airport threshold to the outside world .
He walks to the doors of Terminal One and absorbs fresh air as they swing open .
But he never steps outside .
His hollow cheeks and thin frame show the limits of the generosity of airport staff and strangers to help with his meals .
Nasseri ’s confused account of his plight speaks to the psychological price he has paid in his fight to become a man who belongs somewhere .
“ Nobody could suffer all he did and stay normal , ” noted Bourget .
The sad truth is this :
After fighting for years to leave the airport and apply for citizenship elsewhere , Nasseri was afraid to do so when the opportunity arose .
Belgium offered Nasseri the chance to settle there , but he refused .
“ Now , I think he will stay in the airport until he dies , ” Bourget concluded softly .
His bizarre tale has brought him a degree of fame .
He has been the subject of news reports from Finland to Britain .
His life story became a 1994 French film , starring Jean Rochefort .
Nasseri gets fewer visitors now to punctuate the long days down on Terminal One ’s boutique level , ringed with stores and small cafes .
But he still has a following who help clothe and feed him and lift his spirits .
“ He does no harm to anyone , ” said Papa Starr , manager of the Les Palmes restaurant .
“ Everyone cares for him here . ”
Several times a week , the airport priest stops by to visit him , as does Dr. Phillipe Bargain , the airport doctor .
Many staff regularly visit him at his table for a cup of coffee and a chat .
“ I get lots of cards at Christmas , ” he said .
“ I call it my American Christmas . ”
His life follows the quotidian airport cycle .
He wakes at 5:30 in order to shave in the men ’s room before passengers arrive .
He reads all day long .
At night , he waits until the airport stores are locked before he brushes his teeth with the toothbrush and toothpaste from a complimentary airline travel kit .
Weekly , he rinses out his clothes overnight in the bathroom .
Nasseri is renowned throughout the airport for his refusal to ask for help .
“ We have a colleague who gave him clothes , but he returned them , saying ‘ I ’m not a beggar , ' ” said Crystelle L’Hospitalier , a Lufthansa clerk .
But he has to eat , and accepts occasional meal vouchers and francs from stewardesses and airport staff .
As the years have slipped by , it has become increasingly clear that Nasseri will never leave Charles de Gaulle .
His airport years have made him “ crazier by the day , ” on the topic of his future , said airport doctor Bargain .
When he talks about flying to London , the staff here greet him with understanding smiles .
“ An airport is kind of a place between heaven and earth , ” said Danielle Yzerman , spokeswoman for Charles de Gaulle .
“ He has found a home here . ” 1
Nasseri , who has since adopted the name “ Sir , Alfred Mehran ” ( that ’s not a typo — Nasseri took both the title and its misplaced comma from a mistake in a letter from British immigration ) , has changed the story he tells about his background several times over the years :
Over the years , he has claimed many things about his origins .
At one time his mother was Swedish , another time English .
Nasseri ’s effectively reinvented himself in the Charles de Gaulle airport and denies these days that he ’s Iranian , deflecting any conversation about his childhood in Tehran .
( “ He pretends he does n’t speak Persian , ” his longtime lawyer , Christian Bourguet , says .
“ He was interviewed by Iranian journalists and made believe he did n’t understand . ” )
When we first met two years ago , he insisted that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was attempting to locate his parents in order to establish his identity .
But a spokeswoman for the agency dismissed the assertion as “ pure folly . ”

But a spokeswoman for the agency dismissed the assertion as “ pure folly . ”
Early on in his saga , Nasseri maintained that he was expelled from his homeland for antigovernment activity in 1977 .
According to a number of reports , Nasseri protested against the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi while a student in England , and when he returned to Iran , found himself imprisoned , and shortly thereafter exiled .
He bounced around Europe for a few years with temporary refugee papers , alighting finally in Belgium , where he was awarded official refugee status in 1981 .
He traveled to Britain and France without difficulty until 1988 , when he landed at Charles de Gaulle airport after being denied entry into Britain , because , he contends , his passport and refugee certificate were stolen in a mugging on a Paris subway .
Nasseri could not prove who he was , nor offer proof of his refugee status .
So he moved into the Zone d’attente , a holding area for travelers without papers .
He stayed for days , then weeks — then months , then years .
As his bizarre odyssey stretched on , Bourguet , the noted French human rights lawyer , took on the case , and the news media piled on .
Articles appeared around the world , and Nasseri became the subject of three documentary films .
( Oddly , apparently none of his friends or relatives have attempted to contact him . )

Nasseri
is known for his honesty ( when he is n’t talking about himself ) and his refusal of charity .
On two occasions he turned in billfolds full of money that had been mislaid by passengers .
Airline and airport personnel push meal vouchers on him so he can eat .
“ French fries are my favorite , ” he confides .
“ It ’s not a very healthy diet , but I get enough . ”
On 17 September 1999 , an international travel card and a French residency permit were put into Nasseri ’s hands .
With them , he ’s now free to leave the airport , either to take up residency in France or to fly to another country that will allow him entry .
He refuses to sign them , however , because they list his nationality as Iranian , and he wants it listed as British .
He remains at Charles de Gaulle airport , using the excuse that he ’s determined to stick to this point rather than face life outside the terminal :
[ In 1999 ] he finally got permission to leave the airport — in fact , he can now go wherever he likes in Europe .
The problem is , he no longer wants to .
[ In 1999 ] he finally got permission to leave the airport — in fact , he can now go wherever he likes in Europe .
The problem is , he no longer wants to .
“ He is scared to leave this bubble world he has been living in , ” said Dr. Philippe Bargain , the airport ’s medical director .
“ Finally getting the papers has been a huge shock to him , as if he was just thrown from his horse .
When you wait 11 years for something and suddenly in a few minutes you sign some papers and it ’s done — imagine what a shock that is . ”
“ He will have to be weaned from the airport , like an addict really . ” Dr. Bargain said .
“ Still , it does make you wonder what kind of a society we live in that this can happen to a man . ”

In July 2006 , Nasseri was hospitalized .
In January 2007 he left the hospital and was looked after by the airport ’s branch of the French Red Cross ; he was lodged for a few weeks in a hotel close to the airport .
On 6 March 2007 , he transferred to a homeless shelter in Paris .

In their first television interview since Michelle Malkin , Rush Limbaugh and others on the right decided to crucify their 12 year old son and swiftboat their family , the parents of Graeme Frost sat down and talked with Keith Olbermann tonight on Countdown .
Download Download
Bonnie and Halsey Frost , with much the same grace and dignity shown by Shawn Hornbeck 's parents after their son was victimized by Bill O'Reilly , tell Keith about dealing with the attacks , including death threats , and debunk all the lies that were spread about their family by the rabid right .
To bring this whole disgusting episode into perspective , Keith showed heartbreaking pictures of Graeme and his sister Gemma in the hospital shortly after their horrific accident -- bringing full circle the REAL ISSUE -- which is the SCHIP program that made it possible for the Frost children to get the care and ongoing therapy they need , and is so desperately needed by millions more American children .
How can you look on these poor , broken bodies after the car crash and be heartless enough to say they do n't deserve the benefits they received ?
How can you look at those children hooked up to a hundred devices and tell their parents that they should lose their home , or their children deserve their fate ?
Never allow the Republicans to call themselves the pro-life party if they have no problem begrudging these children their right to life .
UPDATE : ( Nicole )
True to her heartlessness , Michelle Malkin ( I 'm not linking her because she deserves your contempt , not your hits ) has this to say :
The Frost parents finally made a wise choice and decided not to put their son on Olbermann .
Instead , they appeared to field Olbermann 's softball questions about the " lunatic fringe . "
Olbermann prodded the family to supply pictures of their children in the hospital recovering from their terrible accident .
The photos were displayed as Olbermann and the couple complained about the Right 's " distraction " techniques .
It really does n't get much lower or much cheaper or much sadder than this .
Oh yeah , Michelle , you traitor to motherhood , you 've just proven how much sadder it can be .
How dare you ?
Speaking as a mother , I pray with every bone of my liberal body that you never , ever spend one day as the Frosts have , hoping against the odds for the recovery of their children .
I can't look at those pictures and not have tears for the pain they must have felt -- that 's what becoming a mother has done for me -- I want to take care of children .
You , on the other hand , ca n't get your horrible partisan brain out of your horrible partisan tush to see any pain , just your own pathetic attempt to raise your own profile among those who could not care less about anyone other than themselves .
Fired attorney : Rove , Gonzales resignations ' absolutely linked ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday August 27 , 2007
Print This Email This Like President Bush 's top political adviser , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigned to avoid encroaching Congressional investigations , a fired federal prosecutor said Monday .
During an appearance on CNN , former US Attorney David Iglesias said Gonzales 's resignation is " absolutely linked with Karl Rove leaving two weeks ago , " and speculated the two resigned " for the same reason " : Congressional investigators closing in on their suspected roles in the attorney - firing scandal .
" This is what happens when there is not check and balance " under a Republican - controlled Congress and White House " and all of a sudden you have a new sheriff in town - so to speak - that wants answers to hard questions . "
Due to obstruction by Gonzales and other Bush officials , Iglesias added , the extent of the White House 's attempt to have politically inconvenient prosecutors fired remains unknown .
" We still do n't know who put our names on that list , " he said .
The former US Attorney for New Mexico contends that he was fired after two Congressional Republicans - Sen. Pete Dominici and Rep. Heather Wilson - urged him to speed indictments of a Democratic state senator before the election .
" What triggered this [ resignation ] was Attorney General Alberto Gonzales going in front of the US Senate and not being fully candid , telling half truths ( and ) having very convenient memory lapses , " Iglesias said Monday .
" Had he shot straight with the American people and shot straight with the Senate , perhaps a lot of this would 've been mitigated . "
The Justice Department 's credibility has sunk to Nixon - era levels under Gonzales 's soon - to - end tenure , Iglesias charged .
" I 'm not aware of the Justice Department losing so many top people , probably since ... the early 70s during the Watergate scandal , " he said .
Iglesias would n't comment on any specific names that have been mentioned as possible replacements for Gonzales , but he called for an end to partisan influence within the Justice Department .
" I just hope that the next Attorney General is a person who understands the core mission in the Justice Department is not to play politics , it is to enforce the law , " Iglesias said .
" And it 's to give the president hard advice that he sometimes does n't want to hear like , ' Mr. President , you can't do that , it 's not constitutional . ' "
The following video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on August 27 .

Sorry for the short diary but I have to watch my steelers !
As someone who tries to read a lot about my field , I feel I have my “ ear to the ground ” , so to speak .
And right now , I ’m picking up a lot of hype - rumblings about the Erlang programming language .
I have a little bit of experience with it , having used it briefly about 3 years , and having made a few minor contributions .
Why are people interested in it ?
Picking up new programming languages is fun for some people , but in general , unless it ’s something backed by millions of dollars of marketing and development ( Java , C# / .
Net ) there needs to be a ‘ killer feature ’ to drive adoption .
Tk and Tcl , ease of developing simple dynamic web content with PHP , Rails and Ruby , and so on .
Erlang , in many people ’s eyes :
gets concurrency right , or at least is a big improvement over existing models ( threads ) .
Makes distributed computing easier and does it naturally .
Is a solid base on which to construct reliable applications .
That appears to be enough to have nudged Erlang into a position where it has a chance at the big time .
While I would highly encourage people to learn a bit of Erlang , and to seriously consider its use for the type of systems for which it was created , I have some doubts about it becoming that widespread .
Please read the following as the thoughts of a critical mind , and keep in mind that it ’s far easier to zero in on defects than it is to create something from scratch , so do not misconstrue my writing as being “ against ” Erlang ( I do use it , enjoy it , and recommend learning it ! ) , but as an honest appraisal colored by my own view of the world , which might not be like yours .
To begin with the superficial , its syntax is a bit odd .
For a professional programmer , that should n’t present much of an obstacle , and indeed is n’t after a few days of using it , but there are a few things that I do find a bit annoying despite being used to the syntax , first and foremost being the use of .
and , to separate lines of code , rather than a newline , or ; ( which is used elsewhere ) .
They ’re like little mouse droppings – hard to spot , and they get in your way when you swap out bits of code here and there .
The last line of a function must end with a . , but other lines are separated with commas , so when you ’re cutting and pasting lines from here to there , you end up having to recheck the line endings each time .
Erlang is a functional programming language .
Once again , someone with a wide exposure to many programming styles will not find this difficult after a week or so of practice , to wrap your mind around a different way of thinking .
However , I have some doubts as to whether a functional language will be able to bring on board the numbers necessary to be widely adopted ( see Scaling Down ) .
One of the benefits of wider adoption is , indeed , having a wider set of libraries – it ’s a “ positive network externality ” in terms of economics .
Other people have written about the relative lack of Erlang libraries to do various things , but it ’s actually not one of the things I ’m worried about – it ’s something that will take care of itself if the language grows in popularity .
After being spoiled by Ruby ’s gems , what I really miss , though , is a nice , simple , easy distribution mechanism .
Related to making it easier for J Q Programmer to adopt , the error messages are at times not the most helpful I ’ve seen in the computing industry :
Error in process < 0.29.0 > with exit value : {undef , [{shell_default , sfdsf , []} , {erl_eval , do_apply,5} , {shell , exprs,6} , {shell , eval_loop,3} ] }
In English , that means that I tried to execute the function sfdsf ( ) , which does n’t exist .
It seems that there ought to be a way to keep the nice , computer parseable error messages , and add in something that humans would find just a bit easier .
Other people have already covered the problems with Erlang ’s strings , so I wo n’t belabor the point .
Suffice it to say that , in my opinion , is_list ( [ foo , bar , baz ] ) and is_list ( " hello " ) should probably not both be true .
Which brings us to another issue .
Erlang is a language used in big , reliable systems like telephony switches .
That ’s not the sort of environment where you want to break things , so I doubt that Erlang will ever see big changes that introduce incompatibilities , like Python has recently done .
This one is a tradeoff – stable , reliable and backwards compatible is simply not compatible with rapid development of the language – it ’s a zero - sum game , you want more of one , you get less of the other .
Related , is the “ open sourceness ” of the language .
It is open source , which for me is very nearly a prerequisite for dedicating my time to a language , but Ericsson appears to maintain firm control over it .
This is another thing that ’s both good and bad .
Having the backing of a large corporation means that developers are paid to work on and enhance Erlang , which is beneficial to everyone .
On the other hand , as some people say , open source is just the start , open development is important too .
Random thought : I bet Erlang would make a nice Apache project , but I ’m sure the bureaucracy involved would be a nightmare .
In terms of the language itself , beyond the syntax , it feels a little bit too verbose .
Perhaps not as much as Java ( that would be difficult , would n’t it ) … maybe I ’m just used to Ruby , which is about as concise as I ’m comfortable with while still being readable .
Sometimes , though , there is a little bit more ‘ repeat yourself ’ than I would like to see .
For instance , in this implementation of string_join ( something else that ought to be in the standard library , but still is n’t ) , it ’s necessary to create the same function , with different arity , simply to work around the fact that it ’s not possible to say the default separator should be ” “ :
string_join ( Items ) -> string_join ( Items , " " ) . string_join ( Items , Sep ) -> lists : flatten( lists:reverse(string_join1 ( Items , Sep , [ ] ) ) ) .
Which is a lot more typing than string_join ( Items , Sep= " " ) .
This is pure opinion , and very subjective , but Erlang to me feels like it falls more in the “ systems programming language ” category than “ scripting language ” .
It ’s a bit more verbose , it needs to be compiled to run it , modules need to have an entry point … it ’s not as suitable to quick throwaways as Ruby , Tcl or Python .
Of course , it is certainly higher level than C , and leaner than Java , but still falls an the other side of an admittedly fuzzy line in my head .
Its command line options reinforce that .
Whereas “ scripting ” languages do the obvious thing first :
ruby foo / bar.rb
Erlang is a little bit more complex :
erl - noshell - pa foo / - run bar
A minor detail , once you get used to it , but still , I prefer the “ do the obvious thing first , and let the user have some say in the matter if they want to do something else ” approach to systems design .
One of the wonderful things about Ruby on Rails , is that it uses Ruby throughout , templates included .
Without getting into the merits of using templates vs other systems , my own opinion is that Rails gets them right , and demonstrates the flexibility of Ruby by using it as the language for the templates , rather than inventing some other solution .
I do n’t see the same flexibility in Erlang , which is unfortunate , as it blows Ruby out of the water in terms of being a very solid solution to deploy on a server ( no fiddling with proxies and load balancers and single threaded mini- servers + hot code replacement = nice ) .
Of course , there are lots of good things about Erlang , as mentioned at the beginning of this article – concurrency and distribution , but also language features like pattern matching that are a lot of fun to use , a pleasant syntax for dealing with binary data , list comprehensions , first class functions , tail recursion , and lots of other goodies .
However , if I had to try and predict the future , I could easily imagine another language grabbing some of Erlang ’s good ideas and running with them , perhaps being more “ conventional ” in other respects – this is n’t uncommon in the languages field , as we ’ve seen with things like Lisp and Smalltalk .
On the other hand , one of the reasons I am quite happy with Erlang is that it is most certainly not a proof of concept – it is a very practical language that excels at solving certain classes of problem , and does so in many commercial settings .
If you ’re the kind of person who enjoys new things , check it out !
Apparently officially recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records , here in San Alfonso del Mar in Chile you can hardly miss the world ’s largest swimming pool !
This absolutely immense pool is 1 kilometre long and covers eight hectares – that ’s 80,000 square metres !
Furthermore , it contains an incredible 250,000 cubic metres of water .
And yes , it ’s right beside the beach , and no more than a stone ’s throw … from the sea .

Thanks to the Eid al - Fitr holiday , news was scant for a second day in a row .
Many newspapers in Iraq have temporarily ceased publication during the holiday .
Overall , at least 58 Iraqis were killed , mostly gunmen , and 22 more were wounded in the latest round of violence .
Also , four American soldiers were killed in separate events .
An American soldier died yesterday in Kirkuk during an IED explosion .
Two 15th Sustainment Brigade Soldiers were killed and five others were wounded during shelling just outside Baghdad on Wednesday ; this incident is unrelated to the Camp Victory rocket attack .
The DOD also reported the death of a soldier in Baghdad on Thursday ; he was killed during an IED attack .
In Baghdad , three dumped bodies were found .
Shelling in the Doura neighborhood left one dead and eight wounded , including children .
A roadside bomb in Kirkuk killed one policeman and wounded three others during an assassination attempt on the deputy police chief ’s life ; he was unharmed in the incident .
A former police commando , now civilian , was injured during an armed attack .
Also , the final figures in yesterday ’s attempt on the the police chief ’s life reached eight dead and 62 wounded ; that is ten more injury victims than previously reported .
Four bodies belonging to suspected al - Qaeda members were found near Duluiya .
A large cache of explosives was discovered in Tal Afar .
A medical doctor was abducted in Basra .
U.S. forces killed one suspect and detained three others in Baghdad .
Iraqi army troops backed by the al - Fadel Awakening council reported killing 48 suspects over the last four days in the al - Fadel neighborhood in Baghdad .
In Diyala province , 65 families were forced to leave their homes after receiving death threats .
The Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) denied their intention to cross over into Turkey .
They also claimed to not launch attacks on Turkey from inside Iraq as they have members already based in Turkey .
Meanwhile , the presence of Turkish troops on the Iraqi border has increased .
Villagers in Kani Zawa also claimed that Turkish troops terrorized them during an overnight small arms attack , while those in Nezdoor said they received shelling from Turkish forces .
No casualties were reported in either incident .

It 's not attractive and you do n't know what I 've been through ) * Tall !!
( I love em tall ) * NOT deathly skinny or skinny in general ( Meaning , if you 're 6 " 1 ' and you weight the same as a sack of potatoes .. you 're too skinny ..
I like my men with meat ) * Intelligent ( If you all of your stories start with ' I was so drunk ' .. its not going to work .. must be able to carry conversation )
*Have had some interaction with women besides sliding out of your mom 's vajay .* You and your teeth are white and straight .
* Well - groomed ( I do n't mean that you wear armani crap , but have clean - cut nails and if you keep facial hair , that it 's maintained so you do n't look like a domesticated animal ) * Please be a gentleman ( Do n't ask me about my favorite position the first time we talk .
Everytime I use a word that could be used in a sexual reference does n't mean that I am referring to having sex with you .

( Please do n't flatter yourself thinking that a pic of your abs will work like panty - dynamite .
It does n't and instead responses like that send out the signal that you are looking for only one thing , or that you are too stupid to formulate intelligable human conversation in the English language . )
* Dont be adversely opposed to something normal .
( for example : myspace , showers , tv , cellphones , radio , music , oral hygiene , living in one place , eating spicy foods , exploring , sunshine .

The case has evoked memories of the battle over Elian Gonzales
The girl was taken into custody when her mother attempted suicide after moving to the US .
Her father , Rafael Izquierdo , wants her to return to Cuba .
Florida officials argue she should stay with her wealthy foster parents , former baseball agent Joe Cubas and his wife .
The case has evoked memories of the highly publicised custody saga of Cuban castaway Elian Gonzalez .
Elian was five years old in November 1999 when he was rescued at sea after a boating accident that killed his mother and other Cubans trying to immigrate illegally to the United States .
Rafael Izquierdo insists his daughter needs to be with him
Elian 's great - uncle in the US fought unsuccessfully to keep the child in Miami despite court rulings .
He was eventually seized in a pre-dawn raid by US agents and returned to his father in Cuba .
Florida officials on Monday argued that Joe Cubas and his wife should be allowed to start adoption proceedings for the girl , who has not been named .
They said Mr Izquierdo , a farmer from the central Cuban village of Cabaiguan , had abandoned his child by allowing her to come to the US and was negligent in failing to send financial support .
A lawyer for Mr Izquierdo said he had let his former girlfriend take the girl to the US when she was granted a visa in 2004 because he wanted a better life for his daughter .
The girl 's mother says the child should go back to Cuba
He could not have predicted that the girl 's mother would attempt suicide , his lawyer argued .
Mr Izquierdo's low earnings relative to US wages and the difficulties of sending money out of Cuba had made it impossible for him to send child support , he added .
The case was set to continue on Tuesday .
Mr Cubas - who controversially allegedly helped several top baseball players leave Cuba in the 1990s - and his wife are also fostering the girl 's half - brother and want to adopt him too .
This story is so incredible , I had to do additional research to confirm that it was indeed true .
It centers on Kansas City auto mechanic and inventor Johnathan Goodwin .
Two years ago , Goodwin got a rare chance to show off his tricks to some of the car industry 's most prominent engineers .
He tells me the story :
He was driving a converted H2 to the SEMA show , the nation 's biggest annual specialty automotive confab , and stopped en route at a Denver hotel .
When he woke up in the morning , there were 20 people standing around his Hummer .
Did I run over somebody ?
he wondered .
As it turned out , they were engineers for GM , the Hummer 's manufacturer .
They noticed that Goodwin's H2 looked modified .
" Does it have a diesel engine in it ? " " Yeah , " he said .
" No way , " they replied .
He opened the hood , " and they 're just all in and out and around the valves and checking it out , " he says .
They asked to hear it run , sending a stab of fear through Goodwin .
He 'd filled it up with grease from a Chinese restaurant the day before and was worried that the cold morning might have solidified the fuel .
But it started up on the first try and ran so quietly that at first they did n't believe it was really on .
" When you start a diesel engine up on vegetable oil , " Goodwin says , " you turn the key , and you hear nothing .
Because of the lubricating power of the oil , it 's just so smooth .
Whisper quiet .
And they 're like , ' Is it running ?
Yeah , you can hear the fan going . ' "
One engineer turned and said , " GM said this would n't work . "
" Well , " Goodwin replied , " here it is . "
And what 's the bottom line for Goodwin 's modified vehicles ?
Stuff like this :
Goodwin's feats of engineering have become gradually more visible over the past year .
Last summer , Imperium Renewables contacted MTV's show Pimp My Ride about creating an Earth Day special in which Goodwin would convert a muscle car to run on biodiesel .
The show chose a ' 65 Chevy Impala , and when the conversion was done , he 'd doubled its mileage to 25 mpg and increased its pull from 250 to 800 horsepower .
As a stunt , MTV drag - raced the Impala against a Lamborghini on California 's Pomona Raceway .
" The Impala blew the Lamborghini away , " says Kevin Kluemper , the lead calibration engineer for GM's Allison transmission unit , who 'd flown down to help with the conversion .
Remember --
Detroit tells us it 's impossible to increase gas mileage without taking a hit on horsepower .
Yet here 's Goodwin -- with an eight - grade education -- able to design motors that blow the doors off the conventional ( and obviously bullshit ) wisdom .
His latest project ?
Goodwin leads me over to a red 2005 H3 Hummer that 's up on jacks , its mechanicals removed .
He aims to use the turbine to turn the Hummer into a tricked - out electric hybrid .
Like most hybrids , it 'll have two engines , including an electric motor .
But in this case , the second will be the [ jet ] turbine , Goodwin 's secret ingredient .
Whenever the truck 's juice runs low , the turbine will roar into action for a few seconds , powering a generator with such gusto that it 'll recharge a set of " supercapacitor " batteries in seconds .
This means the H3's electric motor will be able to perform awesome feats of acceleration and power over and over again , like a Prius on steroids .
What 's more , the turbine will burn biodiesel , a renewable fuel with much lower emissions than normal diesel ; a hydrogen - injection system will then cut those low emissions in half .
And when it 's time to fill the tank , he 'll be able to just pull up to the back of a diner and dump in its excess french - fry grease -- as he does with his many other Hummers .
Oh , yeah , he adds , the horsepower will double -- from 300 to 600 .
" Conservatively , " Goodwin muses , scratching his chin , " it 'll get 60 miles to the gallon .
With 2,000 foot - pounds of torque .
You 'll be able to smoke the tires .
And it 's going to be superefficient . "
He laughs .
" Think about it : a 5,000 - pound vehicle that gets 60 miles to the gallon and does zero to 60 in five seconds ! "
And here 's the punchline :
Goodwin's work proves that a counterattack is possible , and maybe easier than many of us imagined .
If the dream is a big , badass ride that 's also clean , well , he 's there already .
As he points out , his conversions consist almost entirely of taking stock GM parts and snapping them together in clever new ways .
" They could do all this stuff if they wanted to , " he tells me , slapping on a visor and hunching over an arc welder .
" The technology has been there forever .
They make 90 % of the components I use . "
The problem with Detroit is n't the laws of physics , it 's the fact that a guy who never even went to high school can do things -- with stock parts -- that Detroit 's auto executives and their armies of engineers claim is impossible .
Good ol ' American know - how and ingenuity is alive and well , just not where we need it .
Update : From the comments , video of that Impala smoking the Lamborghini on MTV :
Man blames bar exam failure on gay marriage , launches website to solicit donations RAW STORY
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email
This " My dream is to become a Lawyer , but I cannot defile my Christian faith simply to pass an examination , " writes Stephen Dunne on the front page of his website , christianlawsuit.com .
On June 25 , 2007 , Dunne filed a federal complaint after failing his Massachusetts bar exam with a score of 268.866 out of 400 ; 270.0 was required to pass .
He believes that this is due to his refusal to answer a question that he says requires the test taker to " affirmatively accept , support and promote homosexual marriage and homosexual parenting , " and that the question violates his freedom of religion .
Enthusiastically citing scripture , Dunne expresses his belief that the court ruling that affirmed same - sex marriage rights in Massachusetts , Goodridge v. Department of Public Health , is " profoundly undemocratic and un-American , " and that the case is about " the protection and defense of Christianity . "
Dunne 's solicitation of funds , he says , will go further than just challenging his test results :
He plans on suing to outlaw same - sex marriage in the only US state where it is currently recognized and given equal status to the extent of state law ; marriages between individuals of the same sex are void at the federal level in the United States .
" There is no price tag on my faith , " says Dunne .
" It is not for sale . "
Shares in Dunne 's religion - based political agenda , however , start at $ 1.00 .

Boksalget går opp , mens lesingen holder seg stabil .
TV - tittingen går som en jojo .

Debattserie : Opphavsrett og framtida Aktivistene bak dagens fildelingssystemer , mener det er umoralsk å kontrollere kopier av musikk , film og andre kulturuttrykk .
De fleste som laster opp og ned beskyttet materiale ønsker likevel at kunstnere fortsatt må kunne finansiere kunstproduksjonen sin , og eventuelt bli belønnet for det de skaper .
Spørsmålet er hvordan det skal kunne finansieres i et internettmarked hvor kopien ikke bare er immateriell , men i realiteten er blitt verdiløs .
Dagbladet .
no ønsker å diskutere hvordan kulturproduksjon skal finansieres i framtiden .
Derfor har vi stilt forfatter Eirik Newth spørsmålet :  Hvordan ser opphavsretten ut om ti år ?
 I morgen skriver professor Olav Torvund om Pirater uten moral
Eirik Magnus
Newth er utdannet astrofysiker , men arbeider som forfatter , blogger og programleder på radio .
Hans populærvitenskapelige Superstreng på Kanal 24 , var det første nasjonale radioprogram i Norge med podcasting .

Noen holdepunkter har vi dog
 Det vil finnes rikelig med penger og betalingsvilje .
Platesalget har sunket med en firedel på et tiår , men konsertbesøk har økt enda mer , og vi har aldri kjøpt flere musikkspillere .
Digital kjøpetekst på nettet er en flopp , men nettbokhandlene går så det suser .
Problemet er ikke pengemangel , men at pengestrømmen går i andre retninger enn mange produsenter skulle ønske seg .
For å løse det problemet ( i den grad det er et problem ) før 2017 , trengs ikke stokken , men gulrota .
 Kulturlivet vil fortsatt være kjøpers marked .
Da som nå vil tilbudet av kulturprodukter langt overstige etterspørselen , og resultatet vil være det samme som i dag : gjennomsnittskunsteren vil ikke være i nærheten av å tjene en normal årsinntekt .
Maksimen " don \'t quit your day job " vil om mulig være enda sannere i 2017 .
 Konvensjonell opphavsrett vil suppleres av frie lisenser .
I fremtiden vil produsenter fremdeles trenge lovens beskyttelse mot å bli overkjørt av kommersielle aktører .
Men åpne lisenser som Creative Commons og GPL , som allerede er en del av hverdagen vår gjennom prosjekter som Wikipedia , Firefox og Linux , er på rask frammarsj .
Det er vanskelig å konkurrere med åpent og gratis , og denne innsikten ( som til og med Microsoft er i ferd med å ta innover seg ) vil føre til at langt flere produsenter vil gi brukerne rett til å forandre og spre verk videre , der det er hensiktsmessig .
 Brukerne vil være med på laget .
Brukerskapt innhold er et produkt av sosiologiske utviklingstrekk ( utdanningsrevolusjonen , velstandsøkningen ) i kombinasjon med teknologi .
Dette er alts å ingen motebølge , og i 2017 vil brukerskapt innhold spille en mye større rolle enn i dag - ikke minst fordi man da har fått et par tiår med tradisjon å bygge på .
Machinima - fenomenet viser at dette ikke bare handler om uklare snutter på YouTube : absolutt alle genre vil bli utfordret .
 Brukerne vil ikke gi slipp på sine hevdvunne rettigheter .
Blant disse er muligheten til å kunne dele et kjøpt åndsverk med venner og familie , og retten til å slippe å betale for samme verk flere ganger hvis programvare eller maskinvare forandrer seg .
Dagens systemer for kopibeskyttelse ( DRM ) bryter fundamentalt med en eller flere av disse rettighetene , om de ikke er til generelt bryderi , utsetter brukerens maskinvare for fare eller truer personvernet .
Kortversjonen : DRM kommer ikke til å fungere , og framtidens økonomiske modeller må basere seg på noe annet .
 Hva skal man gjøre med fildelingen ?
Fildelingens popularitet handler ikke bare om pris og evne til å forstå hvordan ungdom tenker , men også om brukervennlighet .
Fra et enkelt grensesnitt kan man få tak i det aller meste , med et minimum av bryderi , og i åpne formater .
Mediebransjens beste sjanse til å marginalisere fildelingen ligger i å gjøre de kommersielle tilbudene bedre på alle områder ( utvalg , filkvalitet , brukervennlighet , tilgjengelighet ) enn det ene man ikke kan gjøre noe med : betalingen .
Også her er det lov til å tenke innovativt .
Modell 1 : Direkte salg av innhold
i Tunes er det foreløpig beste eksempelet på at det går an å videreføre eksemplarsalg på nettet .
Apples integrering av maskinvare , programvare og innhold gir et hint om framtidens mediemaskiner : i 2017 vet mobilen det meste om deg og alt om din mediebruk , inklusive hvor du trykket på pause - knappen på filmen du så i går , hva du lytter til i bilen og hvilke filer du arbeider med på jobben eller skolen .
Men verken produsenter eller brukere har interesse av at Apple ( eller Microsoft ) alene realiserer en slik visjon .
Radioheads
In Rainbows viser at det går an å lage nettbutikker basert på helt andre prinsipper .
Enda mer interessant , ikke minst for artister som er for ukjente eller teknisk uinteresserte til å lage en nettbutikk selv , er Amiestreet .
Dette er en sosial markedsplass for indiemusikk som baserer seg på prinsippet om at jo mer populær musikken blir , desto mer må du betale .
Buffetmodellen a la Napster burde likevel ha de lyseste utsiktene på lang sikt , simpelthen fordi den er enklere å forholde seg til .
Flat betaling kan lett inkluderes i andre abonnementer , slik Telenor - kunder i dag får tilbud på Store norske leksikon .
Jeg betaler en månedlig avgift for å motta godt over hundre TV - , radio - og - musikkanaler via min kabelleverandør , og har problemer med å begripe hvorfor ikke jeg får tilgang til en musikkhandel mot en økning i månedssatsen .
Modell 2 : Annonser og sponsing
Annonsemarkedet er ikke er stort nok til at det kan finansiere alt innhold på nettet , men det er mulig å se for seg at en intelligent etterkommer etter f.eks .
Adsense vil skape et lønnsomt annonsemarked for enkelte små aktører .
Mer sannsynlig er det at direkte sponsing blir en viktig inntektskilde for spesialiserte nettsteder , jamfør prosjektet Pro Publica , som støtter uavhengig journalistikk på nettet .
I Norge ga stiftelsen Fritt Ord ti millioner for å holde papirutgaven av Store norske leksikon i live .
Om Fritt Ord virkelig ville gjøre inntrykk på det norske nettet , burde det neste skrittet være å betale for å fjerne passordbeskyttelsen på Store Norske .
Modell 3 : Inntekt av bivirkninger
Flere av dotcomboomens kjernetanker lever i beste velgående ( ikke minst i BBC ) : markeder er konversasjoner , og generøsitet gir oppmerksomhet som kan konverteres til penger .
I dag legger musikere ut sanger på MySpace i håp om å få interesse fra konsertgjengere og plateselskap , mens forfattere og journalister blogger for å få lesere i tale eller skaffe seg forelesnings - og konsulentoppdrag .
At denne modellen virker , kan jeg stå inne for : inntekten fra oppdragsgivere som direkte tar utgangspunkt til saker jeg har blogget , øker stadig , mens den relative verdien av boksalget mitt avtar .
Det er intet nytt ved dette : man kan se på det som kulturlivets variant av forvandlingen fra produksjons - til serviceøkonomi .
Modell 4 : Offentlige og kollektive ordninger
I 2014 skal én prosent av statsbudsjettet gå til kulturformål .
Vi kan regne med at støtteordningene fremdeles vil favorisere gamle kulturuttrykk , men selv en liten prosentandel av kulturbudsjettet i 2014 kan komme til å bety mye for norske nettprodusenter .
Den rene statsstøtten vil også suppleres med vederlag for nettbruk , som kan komme til å øke kraftig om Nasjonalbibliotekets digitalisering av norske bøker , aviser , tidsskrifter blir noe av .
Spørsmålet er om offentlig støtte noensinne blir så viktig som den har vært for analoge medier .
Når grensen mellom produsent og bruker viskes ut , er det vanskelig å se for seg hvordan dagens stipender og vederlagsutbetalinger skal videreføres .
Det nye kulturlivet er på en og samme tid mer kollektivistisk og mer privatisert : vi er i langt større grad ansvarlige for egen synlighet .
Konklusjon
For produsenter som er vant til å overlate det meste av produksjonskjeden til en statsstøttet kulturindustri , vil alt dette virke skremmende .
Men for nettgenerasjonen vil det virke frigjørende .
Den vil se det som en mulighet til å forvalte livsverket etter eget hode .
Istedenfor å se gamle verker falle ut av bruk og bli glemt , slik musikere og skribenter opplever i dag , vil man i framtiden kombinere direktesalg av nytt materiale med halesalg eller frislipp av eldre materiale .
Forlag og plateselskap vil fremdeles finnes , men mest som mellomstasjoner på et langt karrièreløp .
Først og fremst vil det handle om å dyrke forholdet til brukerne .
Som også vil opptre som produsenter , når det passer seg sånn .
Ingen har sagt at framtiden ikke blir forvirrende .

" If you choose not to decide , you still have made a choice … “
Lyrics are from the band called Rush ; the song is Free Will from 1980 ; always hated the song ( seemingly every station played it too often , killing it ) .
The too - often - played song from the Bush administration ’s endless stream is that some other force is responsible for how to decide the dirty problems , even as Bush occasionally squawks that he is the decider .
I was reading about the recent black hole mergers simulations performed by the people at Goddard , more thoroughly described here and in this forthcoming article .
These are , undoubtedly , beautiful results , and a testament to the complexity of Einstein ’s equations when it comes to obtain realistic results : according to the reports above , thousands of lines of code ( plus an impressive array of supercomputers ) were needed to obtain them .
An impressive achievement , but still there ’s something in it that makes me uneasy : if i’ve read it right , those thousands of lines of code are actually lines of Fortran ( or , in the best case , C ) code ( more concretely , they ’re using a library called Paramesh , written in Fortran 90 ) .
Now , if you ask anyone with a solid background in computer science , she will probably tell you that nobody ( except physicists , that is ) programs these days in Fortran .
We know better languages , and have developed far better ways of writing computer programs in the 50 years since Fortran was invented .
That is , we physicists are using obsolete technologies .
Those newer languages ( Scheme , Haskell , OCaml , and so on and so forth ) are better in many ways , but specially in one that i am sure is close to any physicist ’s heart : they provide far , far better means of abstraction .
That is , you can write much shorter programs in a language that is conceptually closer to the problem at hand .
And shorter may well mean something like a ten fold reduction in the number of lines of code ; not to mention the benefits on clarity , maintanability and extensibility that greater abstraction entails .
To use a metaphor , it ’s like we were using Levi-Civita ’s books and notation as our standard way of calculating in General Relativity , instead of modern differential geometry .
Of course , there ’re perfectly understandable reasons for our using antics like Fortran , legacy code being probably the most prominent one ; and physicists not having the needed expertise might well an important one too ( but let me rush to say that efficiency of the code is not a good excuse these days ) .
But i’m convinced that numerical physics would be vastly improved if we imported some expertise from the professional computing world .
I ’m told by friends in the field that some of the most ‘ advanced ’ guys are trying things like C++ and Java ( instead of Fortran ) these days : i’m sorry , but these languages were current some 20 years ago , and we ’ve learnt since then how to avoid many of the pitfalls and unnecessary complexities they carry on .
Much more interesting is to use interactive languages like Python ( to be on the conservative side ) or , if you ask me , functional languages like Scheme or Haskell .
To give you a glimpse of what i’m talking about , here is how you ’d write quicksort in Fortran 95 ; in Haskell , it ’s a two - liner :
qsort [ ] = [ ] qsort ( x:xs ) = qsort ( filter (< x ) xs ) ++ [ x ] ++ qsort ( filter ( >= x ) xs )
Fortunately , not every one sticks to Fortran these days : Michele Vallisneri ’s Synthetic LISA is a beautiful example of a step in the right direction , and i’m glad to see that numerical libraries like PETSC do in fact provide Python bindings .
But , as i said , i think ( after nine years or so of earning a living writing computer programs ) that there are even better ways .
As a matter of fact , i’m seriously considering the possibility of writing some LISA simulation code using Scheme .
What deters me , besides lack of time , is the enormous weight of tradition : almost everybody out there in the physics community is using those C and Fortran libraries , and that means millions of lines of well - tested code and wondrous results like those black hole mergers .
The easiest thing to do is to go with the flow , but still …
( By the way , these comments are by no means intended as a critique of Baker et al. work , which is impressive as it stands .
Besides , for what i know , they may well be using far more sophisticated techniques than plain Fortran or C .
My rants are more geared towards many other cases i’ve seen of physics programmers which were anything but sophisticated . )

All you need to know about rugby
By Tom Geoghegan
BBC News Magazine
Rugby union fever is sweeping England ahead of the World Cup final in Paris on Saturday .
But many who have been caught up in the fervour remain clueless about the game itself and the culture surrounding it .
Traditionally dismissed by footballers as egg - chasers , it 's the rugby players who will have all eyes on them this weekend .
An estimated 15 million on this side of the Channel are expected to watch England play South Africa in the World Cup final in Paris .
Every so often a sport reaches out far beyond its normal fan base .
But for many , rugby union is perplexing - arcane and , to some , elitist .
The truth is it 's not .
So , from line - outs to player etiquette ; fans ' fashion to cauliflower ears , here the Magazine offers a crash course .
BEHAVIOUR OF PLAYERS ETIQUETTE OF SUPPORTERS SONGS & JOKES CAULIFLOWER EARS KEY RULES
The story goes that rugby was born in 1823 at Rugby School when William Webb Ellis disregarded the rules of football , took the ball in his arms and ran with it .
It has evolved a long way since , into a very technical sport , but you only need to know the basics to enjoy a match .
The BBC's Sarah Campbell , a delicately - built rugby innocent , ventured on to the battlefield at a school in west London to find out .
There she bravely interrogated the hulking Craig Dowd , a former New Zealand All Black , 6ft 3ins ( 1.91 m ) tall and 18 stones ( 114kg ) , for answers , as revealed in the videos on the right .
BEHAVIOUR OF PLAYERS
Despite the physical , even brutal , exchanges on the pitch , the aggression is largely within the laws of the game .
Violence over , let 's have a drink
There is the odd scuffle and rugby had its own " Eric Cantona " moment when former Ireland international Trevor Brennan assaulted a fan and received a five - year ban .
But veteran footballer Jimmy Greaves says he is so impressed by rugby 's spirit it has replaced football as his main sporting passion .
Others have detected a cultural shift from football to rugby but some believe that has been overplayed .
Key aspects to look out for in rugby include : Low - key celebrations - no robotic dancing or going to the crowd
Any back - chat to the referee is punished by moving the penalty forward 10 yards
Players rarely fake injury
Gracious in defeat - handshakes , as in football , and " tunnels " of applause at pitch - side followed by socialising in the bar Jeff Probyn , who played in the 1991 final loss to Australia , says rugby " teeters on the edge of violence and the self - control is part of that " .
" Because it 's such a physical game if you carried it on , you would end up fighting all the time and not playing , so within the individual players there 's a self - control button . "
There are probably more thugs in rugby than in soccer , the only difference is they 're on the pitch
Jeff Probyn
Former England player
Rugby v football : 606 debate Shaking hands at the end draws a line under the game , he says .
" Whatever goes on on the pitch stays there .
Your opposite number may have spent the match kicking you but you shake his hand . "
Probyn says it would be simplistic to think football is played by oiks and rugby by gentlemen .
" It 's a bit unfair on soccer , which is n't generally a violent game .
There 's a lot of pressure on players and the authorities have allowed players to question referees .
" There are probably more thugs in rugby than in soccer , the only difference is they 're on the pitch and that 's a controlled area . "
Return to top ETIQUETTE AMONG SUPPORTERS
For those people new to following the oval - shaped balls , there 's a number of key questions that need to be answered , such as what do I wear , what do I drink and how should I behave ?
TYPICAL RUGBY FAN OUTFIT 1 : Rugby shirt is a must ( up - turned collar optional ) 2 : Lager , preferably bitter but never white wine 3 : Stonewashed jeans , not shellsuit bottoms 4 : Comfortable shoes such as deck shoes - no trainers Talking rugby - quick guide
Send in your pictures
What do fans wear ?
What do fans drink ?
The outfit of the typical fan ( pictured right ) has long been rugby shirt , jeans and comfortable shoes .
Unlike at Twickenham , where Barbour jackets and green wellies are also evident , England supporters in France have followed football 's lead and dressed in anything from St George outfits to funny wigs .
While purists have always favoured bitter or Guinness as their bevvie of choice , the continental spirit that has imbued the current World Cup means newcomers will not be frowned on for drinking lager .
However , white wine spritzers might be a cultural shift too far .
When in the stadium , there 's no segregation - rival supporters sit side - by - side .
Fans are expected to respect the anthems and allow players to prepare to kick penalties without being whistled .
And club allegiances are left at home .
Whether fans support Wasps , Leicester or Sale simply does n't matter following England .
Return to top RUGBY SONGS & JOKES
Unlike in football , the repertoire of songs for England supporters is quite small , with Swing Low , Sweet Chariot the main anthem : SWING LOW ...

Swing low , sweet chariot

Swing low , sweet chariot

And if you really want to rub it in , here 's the Afrikaans translation :
Hang laag liewe strydwa
Want jy moet my huis toe vat
Hang laag liewe strydwa
Want jy moet my huis toe vat
DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT ?
Why do n't rugby players have mid-life crises ?
They stay stuck in adolescence
Why do rugby players like smart women ?
Opposites attract
How to greet a fan
The spiritual slave - song was written 150 years ago and adopted by the Twickenham faithful in 1988 when England beat Ireland .
According to rugby legend , it was first sung that day by a section of supporters from the Douai School in Woolhampton , who were inspired by three tries scored by the Nigerian - born Chris Oti in front of where they sat , in the lower east stand .
But Swing Low is not to the taste of all England supporters and some prefer Jerusalem .
Return to top CAULIFLOWER EARS Rugby 's defining scar of battle , hematoma auris , or cauliflower ears , can afflict any sportsman that risks a head injury .
After a sharp blow , a large blood clot develops under the skin and blocks the flow of blood to the cartilage , that gives the ear its shape .
If the cartilage dies , the ear shrivels and becomes lumpy .
Graham Rowntree played without a scrum hat Some players , like former England lock forward Alex Codling , managed to keep their ears fully - formed throughout their careers .
" I 've worn a scrum hat for many , many years and that 's the easiest way to avoid it , " he says .
" Before becoming professional , at school , I wore tape .
Some players are uncomfortable wearing it but I did n't mind . "
He says one common remedy for team mates was the use of leeches to suck out the fluid .
More conventional treatment involves draining the blood and reconnecting the skin to the cartilage , but going back on a rugby pitch to do battle once more disrupts this recovery .
Jeff Probyn has one cauliflower ear , his right , from a blow he received from the boot of a Wasps team mate in 1986 .
" I drained it three or four times and my wife stuck a pin in it but I got fed up with it and never bothered .
If a player is that bothered he can get it operated on , unless he wants to wear it as a badge of honour . "

I know lots of " rugby fans " but very few have been to watch a league match - revealing themselves as international part - time , armchair fans .
Rugby may be " on the up " this week but the proof of the pudding will be in the crowds at domestic games .
Andrew , Newbury
My wife is an avid football fan and goes to all the Reading home games .
Two years ago I took her to see London Irish play Harlequins .
She was amazed to see no segregation of fans , most people enjoying a pint ( Guinness of course ) on the terraces and the friendly banter between the " rival " fans .
I have not yet converted her bet carry on trying .
Peter Mills , Bracknell Just look at the passion with which the players sing anthems .
England - Russia - pathetic .
England - France - Dallaglio had veins popping out of his head he was singing with such passion .
Enough said ... come on England !
Marion , Cambridge Dear Rich from Newcastle , you should hang your head in shame .
Footballers are , generally , overpaid under performers .
They appear to take little pride in their ' work ' and are disrespectful of anyone who questions them , especially the officials .
It stinks of a genuine lack of morals and pride .
Unlike the rugby lads who give their all and more in the name of the game .
Come on England ....
Jason , Fleet , Hants Andrew .
I fully agree .
Many of the 15 million people will go straight back to round ball .
Anyway , back on subject ... being a recent convert from football ( well 12 years to be precise ) I can honestly say that it was the best choice I have ever made .
I love the game .
My highlight was going to Croke Park and sitting next to a die hard Ireland fan .
He had huge shamrock tattoos on his arms , the works !
He was the most gentle soul I have ever met .
I was expecting him to cause trouble for me and my friends but he was buying us drinks , chatting freely to us and even applauded the one good move by England .
You never see that in football .
Rugby is all about respect and togetherness .
The same can't be said to football .
Come on England !
Scott Holland , Northwich
I grew up within sight and sound of the hallowed turf of Kingsholm rugby ground in Gloucester and with that experienced the mingling , singing and indeed drinking of rival fans .
Never did I experience the edgy , lagered up , something is going to kick off feeling I now get if I 'm in the area of a number of London football clubs on match day .
I think rugby is less tribal , more social much like cricket , an excuse to enjoy a bevy and talk balls ...
Richard , London Swing Low was probably adopted as England 's " anthem " because it is a song that all rugby players know .
It has been sung in rugby clubs throughout the land for many years - long before 1988 .
Len Jones , Westcliff on Sea , UK I 'm sick of all this rugby is great football is rubbish .
I love football and always will no matter how often the players argue with the ref and how over the top goal celebrations are .
Rugby is ok and I 'll be watching it on Saturday hoping that we win but I do n't see why just because the rugby team and doing well we have to always slate the footballers by saying football is all wrong .
How often do you see a footballer stamp his studs on an opponents chest or throw a punch without being sent off and slaughtered in the press , it happens in rugby most games .
Rich , Newcastle
Bit of a sweeping statement on the stone washed jeans front .
Chinos , shorts , kilts and cords are also common place .
Here 's hoping the football fraternity have learned something from this world cup , how to behave in front of the referee , respect your opponent and entertain the fans .
Unlikely right enough .
Good luck England .
Scottie , Scotland ' Sweet Chariot ' is only the main English anthem ; supporters of other rugby - playing nations - including Wales , Ireland and Scotland - have other songs .
Besides , the repertoire of songs sung in the bar after the match by all supporters can be much larger ( though not necessarily suitable for this website ! ) .
Huw B , London I 've never been a rugby fan until the last world cup .
What is amazing is how the England team surprise us again and again while the football team disappoint us again and again .
It is so encouraging to see how the rugby boys fight back and no wonder the game is on the up .
Christina Spybey , London , United Kingdom " Swing lo ... " goes back a few years more than 1988 .
In 1959 when playing for The Royal Leicestershire Regiment in Germany , it was a prerequisite at the after - game booze - up - complete with hand gestures !
David , London
The difference between football and rugby can be summed up in one word , " Respect ' .
How many times have you seen football fans clap an opponent 's goal ?
You often see opponents tries and skill clapped in rugby .
Which ever way the game goes on Saturday I will be proud of England if they do their best and should S Africa win , good luck to them .

Tom the Dancing Bug by Ruben Bolling Man : Let 's see ...
" We hold these truths to be self - evident ... "
Man # 2 : Too long have we lived under the authoritarian tyranny of KING GEORGE !
Man :
His list of abuses is long -- he has IMPRISONED persons WITHOUT A TRIAL !
Man # 2 : Under our NEW government , we will establish a right of HABEAS CORPUS !
Man : Yes !
Man :
We must grant the executive only LIMITED powers -- we know from the example of KING GEORGE that unchecked power leads to TYRANNY !
Man # 2 : Indeed .
A nation of LAWS , not MEN !
Man # 2 : For example , if the congress enacted a law against spying on citizens , the chief executive would have to comply .
Man :
And the congress could limit his ability to wage wars by ...
BAM BAM Man # 2 : Oh , no !
It 's Man # 2 : KING GEORGE !
George W. Bush :
That 's right , and by divine power I declare you ENEMY COMBATANTS !
I think maybe this starts at a Who concert in 1976 :
I went to the concert with two musician friends of mine and some women who , for reasons obvious to me at least , shall remain nameless .
Toots and the Maytals , one of the great reggae bands , opened the show .
In retrospect , they played a nice opening set – what there was of it .
We booed them off the stage early .
I always rationalize to myself that it was because they covered John Denver ’s execrable “ Country Roads ” – I mean , who in hell can tolerate “ Almost Heaven / West Jamaica ” as a lyric ?
But that was n’t the real reason we booed them off , pissed off Pete Townshend , and had to wait an extra half - hour for The Who to come out and play an amazing show .
What we wanted was the spectacle .
We wanted The Who – rock stars who ’d give us a show worthy of our grubbily lofty expectations .
It was 1976 , after all .
No one would want to see authentic musicians like The Maytals playing their music – we wanted the Big Bang .
And The Who delivered – a laser lit , ear ringing spectacle that I have long told anyone who ’d listen was the best concert I ever saw … .
In Art Into Pop , British scholar and critic Simon Frith speaks of the “ recuperation ” of Pete Townshend into a “ pop star ” ( the Brits use the term pop almost interchangeably with rock and certainly have a much less pejorative connotation about it than Americans do , so relax ) as explanation of how Townshend “ lost control of [ him ] self ” as an artist .
By that , Frith means that the rock star lives in a “ dual ” culture that both rewards artistic risk and commodifies the artist / person taking that risk .
Think of the sensation of Hendrix when his talent exploded onto the American consciousness at Monterrey – and of the pathetic circumstances surrounding his death and the fight over his estate .
I do n’t think it ’s by chance that in The Rolling Stone History of Rock the image for the chapter on The Beatles IS NOT a picture of The Fabs – it ’s a picture of a British Bobby holding the limp body of a teeny bopper who has fainted from the sheer ecstasy of being near ( physically and temporally ) her heroes .
More than any other media outlet Rolling Stone promotes the ideal of the rock star culture : a culture that Simon Frith describes this way : “ the rock experience ‘ the magic that can set you free ’ is never described but endlessly referred back to as some mythical adolescent moment against which all subsequent rock moments can be judged . ”
He goes on to point out this about Rolling Stone : “ What they value in music is its ability to infuse hedonism with a sense of community … . ”
As David Sanjek notes , “ It is an essentially conservative , even mystical approach to music … . ”
And it ’s Rolling Stone who decided who were rock stars – “ Wenner identified rock ’s authenticity with a limited set of figures who formed the publication ’s icons of the rock canon : these include Dylan , the Stones , and the Beatles ” ( Sanjek , Pleasure and Principles ) .
Of course , Rolling Stone also gave proper obeisance to the great progenitors and contemporaries of the “ anointed ones ” – folks like Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly , Hank Williams and Howlin ’ Wolf , Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry , and James Brown and George Jones were lauded for “ authenticity . ”
( Remember that cliche from the 60’s “ keeping it real ” ? )
But those rock stars – The Beatles / Stones / Dylan triumvirate – dominated and defined rock stardom – and its attendant cultural myth - making .
Now David Shumway offers us an overview of his forthcoming book from NYU Press , on rock stars as cultural icons .
In a recent essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education called , interestingly enough , “ Where Have All the Rock Stars Gone ? ” he explores what a recent WBUR ( Boston NPR ) On Point program called the “ The Death of the Rock Star . ”
Shumway argues what I ’ve heard argued before – that the reasons for the fading of the rock star from relevancy are the following : the splintering of the mass audience that post WWII icons from Elvis to Kurt Cobain could draw to them ; the evolution of technology which changed listening habits from mass media communalized ( everyone tuned to rock radio ) to idiosyncratically individualized ( each one to his / her iPod ) ; the mutability of the powerful cultural forces ( the rise of Baby Boomers to adolescence and young adulthood ; the Civil Rights movement ; the Vietnam War ) over time from central , uniting issues to “ the dustbin of history . ”
Shumway ’s right , I believe ( and I suspect those of you educated in postmodernist , cultural studies analysis would agree ) but there ’s something in his Jameson / Baudrillard / Hall “ academized ” approach that leaves me with a sense of being unfulfilled .
And I think I ’ve figured out what it is .
Let ’s use an analogy – a metaphor , if you prefer – and the more persnickety of you may insist that this comparison is metaphorical – so… .
What I may have been experiencing at that concert in 1976 was , in rock experience terms , my “ peak oil ” moment .
I ’d been listening to rock since I was 6 or 7 ( I had an aunt less than a decade older than I who let me play her old 45 ’s – that ’s how I discovered Elvis , Little Richard , Chuck Berry , Fats Domino , and other primeval greats ) .
I was on the cusp of adolescence when Beatlemania hit – I got my first guitar the following Christmas , setting me on a path that led to professional work as a rock musician for a number of years .
By the time of that Who concert in 1976 , I ’d seen almost everybody who mattered ( to me , anyway ) except Elvis and The Beatles ( and I ’d see The King some 5 months later , only a few months before his sad demise that came apparently while he was on the throne – life is full of irony ) .
Having worked in the business ( and I would work in it part - time off and on for another 18 years ) , I knew a lot about what was behind the music .
The filth and the fury , one might say … .
But there were still bands I had held in awe – that I needed to see for my life to be complete .
The Who , of course , was one of those bands .
And , as I noted , they delivered shock and awe suitable to my lofty opinion of them .
But a year later much would be different – I ’d be listening religiously to Elvis Costello , The Ramones , and The Sex Pistols .
And my feeling for those musicians would be considerably different than the reverence in which I held the groups who formed for me rock ’s holy trinity , The Beatles , The Rolling Stones , The Who .
And while I admired the intensity and serieuxment of The Clash and the talent and artistry of Graham Parker , Joe Jackson and the plethora of New Wave artists who came in the wake of the sea change that occurred in rock with the dying of the “ dancing days ” of rock ’s arena gods , something was over , I knew .
And then that goddam madman shot John and the dream was really over .
Rock became , despite my sincere efforts ( and those of dear friends who push good new music at me constantly ) less than everybody ’s everything ….
There have been golden moments since – seeing a group in a local club that turned out to be a big deal ( Dave Matthews Band ) ; the sloppy , raucous joy of The Black Crowes and Georgia Satellites ; hearing Nirvana for the first time and knowing that a transcendent band could still simply appear .
But those golden moments have been tempered by the loss of spirit guides and bright lights – Kurt ’s suicide , George ’s cancer … .
And more and more the business trumps the music .
The rule used to be that one could determine a band ’s greatness by its third album .
Many bands had an initial good album .
And one usually forgave the sophomore slump .
But if a band ( or artist ) was worth a damn long term , the third album demonstrated it .
A few examples to prove my point : Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers , Damn the Torpedoes ; Bruce Springsteen , Born to Run ; U2 , War ; REM , Fables of the Reconstruction ; Nirvana – oh , that ’s right ( sigh ) …..
Think .
How many bands can you name since Nirvana ’s passing that have had careers that even mattered for three albums ?
Now we are infected and afflicted with manufactured music by manufactured artists .
Tell me – do you consider Justin Timberlake a “ rock star ” ?
Timbaland ?
Fergie ?
Do n’t rock stars play instruments ?
When did dancing around like a stripper to pre-recorded soundtracks begin to qualify as rock performance ?
Ashley Simpson , anyone ?
Anyone ?
Maybe you ’ll dismiss these as old geezer complaints .
If so , you ’re missing the point – or maybe I have n’t made it .
Let me try again ….
Once there were these people who played instruments and wrote songs that made us want to change the world .
We hailed them as heroes .
After all , where does one hear this kind of stuff now ?
Then take me disappearin ’ through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time , far past the frozen leaves
The haunted , frightened trees , out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes , to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea , circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow .
Hey !
Mr Tambourine Man , play a song for me
I ’m not sleepy and there is no place I ’m going to
Hey !
Mr Tambourine Man , play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I ’ll come followin’ you .
They were called rock stars .
They belong to the ages now .
We may never see their like again … .
A reader writes :
So I finally had to get the book and read it .
It was relatively cheap in paperback and had been updated .
It was a lot more complex and nuanced than I expected .
Murray and Herrnstein were careful in their conclusions .
It was hard to argue with a lot of their data and examples .
What was n’t hard to understand was the reaction to the discussion .
You were not allowed to appear discuss this .
It was off the table and a reinforcement of the  Political Correctness ’ movement gathering steam .
I read The New Republic Bell Curve edition that you edited and had not read the book or been familiar with the authors .
TNR pretty much ripped the book down and kept it out of the discussion for a long time .
I have not seen in the 13 years since then , another book with such an intense reception or discussion .
Normally a story like this would be covered by all the MSM and the columnist would have material for weeks .
But there is a caution here that traces itself back to the Bell Curve .
The latest flap with James Watson appears to be playing bigger in England than the US , and I think you are picking up on that .
I was really surprised that Wikipedia had the scoop locally .
I took the New Republic ’s criticism as a little deeper analysis of social policy in general .
In science the Uncertainty Principle places limits on what we can know and what we can do at the Sub - Atomic Level .
The Bell Curve was suggesting the Social Policy had limits , and that is really what the rage was about .
For the last 100 years America had seen explosive growth in the standard of living and the distribution of wealth .
We ’ve spent generously to help the middle class succeed .
Not just welfare , but GI Bill , Education , Immunizations and Social Work .
Especially with the Civil Rights movement as these benefits were expanded to the last Americans .
My theory was partially reinforced when Welfare Reform was initiated .
If anything in the book was to be taken up as something worth changing in social policy it was the encouragement of young poor mothers to have more children via Aid to Dependant Children .
Clinton , at Gingrich ’s urging , practically implemented the changes in social policy advocated in the Bell Curve .
Add the University of Michigan Admissions Policy challenge to the Supreme Court and America was certainly implementing a lot of Bell Curve corrections to our social policies .
And Charles Murray was gaining in stature .
On C - Span you could not get through the phone lines to comment on his latest work .
I did not see any substantial criticism of his work .
Other studies on Meritocracy seemed to reinforce the ideas in the book .
As more genetics was understood , the book held up .
Murray was correct that not all well intentioned ideas are going to succeed .
They need to be reviewed and examined in details .
As Dr. Watson said last week :
" Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so . "
Yes there are dangers in starting the dialog about race and intelligence .
Patricia
Berne is correct that new ideas like this get twisted to conform to political views .
But there is a greater danger .
The Conservative Movement in America has read the Bell Curve and watched social policy and is implementing a lot of it ’s policies .
The Left is ignoring them and pretending they will go away .
Murray and Hernstien may be correct , and Watson ’s work may confirm it .
The Left should be looking to see how they can adapt to this reality , before they get left behind .
As always , your intuition on the subject is correct .
Something has to give .
For many using the net is a very stressful experience
The project will employ psychologists to closely study a small group of people to reveal what stops them joining the net - using majority .
Early research done for the project suggests that , for some , using the net is as stressful as a bungee jump .
Official statistics on UK net use suggest that 39 % of households do not have web access .
Net losses
Dr David Lewis , the lead psychologist employed on the project , said that for many people the biggest barrier to getting online was mental as many of those avoiding the net lived in homes with a dedicated connection .
He said : " More often the barriers are internal , stemming from a fear of the technology . "
" It will be interesting to see whether the trial will be enough to build the participants ' online confidence , or whether more needs to be done in terms of support and guidance to help them to become tech savvy , " he said .
By contrast to novices , many seasoned net users find the experience of going online very relaxing , said Dr Lewis .
The psychologists on the project will take readings of physiological changes reluctant net users undergo when they go online .
BT has chosen four subjects who will be studied closely as they are coached to use the net to find out why they fear using it .
To acquaint them with online life , the four subjects have been given a broadband link , a laptop , webcam and a digital camera .
A two - month training plan has also been developed that will introduce them to what they can do on the net .
The participants will also be encouraged to record their experiences on video or in still images and comment on what they discover .
Their videos and images will be shown on the " Journey to Inclusion " website documenting the project .
Gavin Patterson , a spokesman for BT said : " The gap between the competent internet user and those who have never been online has never been greater . "
The government should consider making alcohol more expensive and reassess its 24 - hour drinking laws to curb serious health problems related to excessive drinking , according to a group of experts .
In a review of public health policy , the Nuffield Council on Bioethics concluded that , left to themselves , people do not choose to live healthy lives , and the state must intervene to control behaviour .
Lord Krebs , principal of Jesus College , Oxford , who chaired the council 's review , said the government had a duty to help people make healthy choices .
" We think it 's too simplistic to say that it 's all down to individual choice , because individuals often suffer ill health or adopt unhealthy behaviours for reasons beyond their control . "
The council gathered doctors , philosophers , economists , lawyers and scientists to look at how far the state should intervene .
" We know from medical evidence that many of the big killers in society - cancer , heart disease and stroke - are at least partially preventable by altering people 's behaviours , " said Krebs .
" Our report asks whose job it is to ensure we all lead a healthy life . "
The group considered obesity , infectious diseases , and smoking - but singled out alcohol as of most concern .
Roger Brownsword , a law professor and member of the group , said : " Alcohol is , on any harm index , a very harmful product .
It 's estimated that £ 20 bn a year is the cost of alcohol to the country , of which a third is accounted for by crime and public disorder . "
Deaths due to alcohol consumption rose from 4,000 in 1991 to 8,000 in 2005 .
The government 's approach to reducing harm has included clearer labelling of drinks and information campaigns .
But Brownsword said this strategy was not proven to work and went against advice by the World Health Organisation in 2000 .
" In the WHO report , it was suggested the kind of measures required were to increase tax on alcohol , closer control over opening hours , and attend to the density of outlets .
The council recommends the government needs to think hard about these more stringent interventions .
The policy adopted a couple of years ago on extended opening needs to be revisited . "
Krebs said most public health policies over the past 150 years meant government intervening in peoples ' lives , with some interventions very much resisted at the time , though he acknowledged the current questions were more difficult " because they 're seen as lifestyle issues " .

Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute have developed a new method to bond materials that do n’t normally stick together .
The team ’s adhesive , which is based on self - assembling nanoscale chains , could impact everything from next - generation computer chip manufacturing to energy production .
Less than a nanometer – or one billionth of a meter – thick , the nanoglue is inexpensive to make and can withstand temperatures far higher than what was previously envisioned .
In fact , the adhesive ’s molecular bonds strengthen when exposed to heat .
The glue material is already commercially available , but the research team ’s method of treating the glue to dramatically enhance its “ stickiness ” and heat resistance is completely new .
The project , led by Rensselaer materials science and engineering professor Ganapathiraman Ramanath , is featured in the May 17 issue of the journal Nature .
Like many key scientific discoveries , Ramanath and his team happened upon the novel , heat - hardened nanoglue by accident .
For years Ramanath has investigated ways of assembling layers of molecular chains between two different materials to enhance the structural integrity , efficiency , and reliability of semiconductor devices in computer chips .
His team has shown that molecular chains with a carbon backbone – ending with appropriate elements such as silicon , oxygen , or sulfur – can improve adhesion and prevent heat - triggered mixing of atoms of the adjoining substances .
Recently , Ramanath ’s group and other researchers have found these nanolayers to be useful for creating adhesives , lubricants , and protective surface coatings .
The nanolayers , however , are extremely susceptible to heat and begin to degrade or simply detach from a surface when exposed to temperatures above 400 degrees Celsius .
This severe limitation has precluded more widespread use of the nanolayers .
Ramanath ’s team decided to sandwich a nanolayer between a thin film of copper and silica , thinking the extra support would help strengthen the nanolayer ’s bonds and boost its adhesive properties .
It proved to be an insightful venture , and the research team found more than it bargained for .
When exposed to heat , the middle layer of the “ nanosandwich ” did not break down or fall off – as it had nowhere to go .
But that was not the only good news .
The nanolayer ’s bonds grew stronger and more adhesive when exposed to temperatures above 400 degrees Celsius .
Constrained between the copper and silica , the nanolayer ’s molecules hooked onto an adjoining surface with unexpectedly strong chemical bonds .
“ The higher you heat it , the stronger the bonds are , ” Ramanath said .
“ When we first started out , I had not imagined the molecules behaving this way . ”
To make sure it was n’t a fluke , his team recreated the test more than 50 times over the past two years .
The results have been consistent , and show heating up the sandwiched nanolayer increases its interface toughness – or “ stickiness ” – by five to seven times .
Similar toughness has been demonstrated using micrometer - thick layers , but never before with a nanometer - thick layer .
A nanometer is 1,000 times smaller than a micrometer .
Because of their small size , these enhanced nanolayers will likely be useful as adhesives in a wide assortment of micro- and nanoelectronic devices where thicker adhesive layers just wo n’t fit .
Another unprecedented aspect of Ramanath ’s discovery is that the sandwiched nanolayers continue to strengthen up to temperatures as high as 700 degrees Celsius .
The ability of these adhesive nanolayers to withstand and grow stronger with heat could have novel industrial uses , such as holding paint on hot surfaces like the inside of a jet engine or a huge power plant turbine .
Along with nanoscale and high heat situations , Ramanath is confident the new nanoglue will have other unforeseen uses .
“ This could be a versatile and inexpensive solution to connect any two materials that do n’t bond well with each other , ” Ramanath said .
“ Although the concept is not intuitive at first , it is simple , and could be implemented for a wide variety of potential commercial applications .
“ The molecular glue is inexpensive – 100 grams cost about $ 35 – and already commercially available , which makes our method well - suited to today ’s marketplace .
Our method can definitely be scaled up to meet the low - cost demands of a large manufacturer , ” he said .
Ramanath and his team have filed a disclosure on their findings and are moving forward toward a patent , which will complement the robust portfolio of other intellectual property they hold in this field .
The team is also exploring what happens when certain variables of the nanoglue are tweaked , such as making taller nanolayers or sandwiching the layers between substances other than copper and silica .
Along with Ramanath , Rensselaer materials science and engineering graduate students Darshan Gandhi and Amit Singh contributed to the paper .
Other co-authors include Rensselaer physics professor Saroj Nayak and graduate student Yu Zhou , IBM researcher Michael Lane at the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , N.Y. , and Ulrike Tisch and Moshe Eizenberg of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology .
Ramanath ’s ongoing research is supported by the National Science Foundation , the U.S. - Israel Binational Science Foundation , the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation , and New York state through the Interconnect Focus Center .
LaVerne Hess , the NSF program official most familiar with Ramanath ’s work , applauded the interdisciplinary nature and strong technical relevance of the nanoglue project .
“ It ’s a good example of basic materials science research motivated by an understanding of engineering needs in the electronics field , and involving fundamental chemistry concepts to create new materials capabilities to enable progress in a field important to U.S. competitiveness , ” Hess said .

Vecto - Simple Vector Drawing with Common Lisp
Abstract Vecto is a simplified interface to the powerful CL - VECTORS vector rasterization library .
It presents a function - oriented interface similar to CL - PDF , but the results can be saved to a PNG instead of a PDF file .
Since Vecto and all supporting libraries are written completely in Common Lisp , without depending on external non-Lisp libraries , it should work in any Common Lisp environment .
Vecto is available under a BSD - like license .
The latest version is 1.5 , released on December 23rd , 2017 .
Vecto is used by Easystreet and Movie Charts .
The canonical location for Vecto is http://www.xach.com/lisp/vecto/.
Download shortcut : http://www.xach.com/lisp/vecto.tgz
Contents
Overview and Limitations
Vecto is a library that provides a simple interface to the the CL - VECTORS vector drawing library .
It supports drawing on a canvas and saving the results to a PNG file .
Vecto depends on the following libraries :
The easiest way to install Vecto and all its dependencies is with Quicklisp .
Vecto's function interface is similar to the PDF vector description and painting interface : you create images by describing vector paths , then using stroke or fill operations to paint to the canvas .
Vecto's color system uses red , green , blue , and alpha color components for drawing .
The results can be be saved to a PNG with an alpha channel .
Vecto's coordinate system starts at the lower - left corner of the image , and increases rightwards along the X axis and upwards along the Y axis .
All measurements are in pixels .
PDF is a feature - rich system .
Vecto supports a small subset of PDF - style operations .
In particular , it does not support :
sampled images
pattern or functional fill
complex layout of text
PostScript fonts
non-RGB color spaces
Other limitations :
No output formats other than 8 - bit , truecolor - alpha PNGs
No access to underlying pixel data

It is not applied immediately , but is created after after the painting is done in the next call to one of FILL - PATH , EVEN - ODD - FILL , FILL - AND - STROKE , EVEN - ODD-FILL-AND-STROKE , or END - PATH -NO -OP .
The clipping path initially covers the entire canvas ; no clipping is done .
Subsequent calls to CLIP - PATH set the clipping path to the intersection of the established clipping path and the new clipping path , and all drawing will be done within the outline of the clipping path .
The outline of the clipping path is defined with the nonzero winding rule , as with FILL - PATH .
There is no way to enlarge the clipping path .
However , the clipping path is part of the graphics state , so changes may be localized by using WITH - GRAPHICS - STATE .
A filled red rectangle , not clipped
The same rectangle drawn with a circle clipping path in effect Clipped to a rounded rectangle clipping path Clipped to the intersection of the circle and rounded rectangle clipping paths
[ Function ]
even - odd - clip - path => |
Like CLIP - PATH , but uses the even / odd fill rule to determine the outline of the clipping path .
Paths
Paths are used to create lines for stroking or outlines for filling .
Paths consist of straight lines and curves .
Paths consist of one or more subpaths .
[ Function ]
move - to x y => |
Starts a new subpath at ( x , y ) . move - to must be the first step of constructing a subpath .
[ Function ]
line - to x y => |
Appends a straight line ending at ( x , y ) to the current subpath .
[ Function ]
curve - to cx1 cy1 cx2 cy2 x y => |
Appends a cubic Bézier curve ending at ( x , y ) and with control points ( cx1, cy1 ) and ( cx2 , cy2 ) to the current subpath .

The center of the arc is at ( x , y ) .
The arc begins at point at a distance radius from the center and with an angle angle1 radians from the positive x axis , and ends at the point with angle2 radians .
If angle2 is less than angle1 , it is increased by increasing multiples of 2 π until it is greater than or equal to angle1.
radius , angle1 , angle2
If there is a current point , a straight line is added from the current point to the start point of the arc .
Otherwise , a new path is started .
( defun pie-wedge ( file ) ( with - canvas ( : width 80 : height 60 ) ( let ( (x 0 ) ( y 0 ) ( radius 70 ) ( angle1 (* ( / pi 180 ) 15 ) ) ( angle2 (* ( / pi 180 ) 45 ) ) ) ( translate 5 5 ) ( set- rgb - fill 1 1 1 ) ( move - to 0 0 ) ( arc x y radius angle1 angle2 ) ( fill - and - stroke ) ( save - png file ) ) ) )
[ Function ]
arcn x y radius angle1 angle2 => |
Like ARC , but draws the arc clockwise instead of counterclockwise .
If angle2 is greater than angle1 , it is decreased by increasing multiples of 2 π until it is less than or equal to angle1 .
( defun wiper ( file ) ( with - canvas ( : width 70 : height 70 ) ( let ( (x 0 ) ( y 0 ) ( r1 40 ) ( r2 60 ) ( angle1 0 ) ( angle2 (* ( / pi 180 ) 90 ) ) ) ( translate 5 5 ) ( set-rgba - fill 1 1 1 0.75 ) ( arc x y r1 angle1 angle2 ) ( arcn x y r2 angle2 angle1 ) ( fill - and - stroke ) ( save - png file ) ) ) )
[ Function ]
ellipse - arc cx cy radius -x radius -y rotation - angle angle1 angle2 => |
Like ARC , but draws an arc from an ellipse .
The arc is drawn counterclockwise .
[ Function ]
ellipse - arcn cx cy radius -x radius -y rotation - angle angle1 angle2 => |
Like ELLIPSE -ARCN , but draws the arc clockwise .
[ Function ]
close - subpath => |
Closes the current subpath .
If the current point is not the same as the starting point for the subpath , appends a straight line from the current point to the starting point of the current subpath .
Subpaths with start and end points that coincidentally overlap are not the same as closed subpaths .
The distinction is important when stroking : Open subpath Closed subpath
If the subpath is not closed , the start and points of the subpath will be drawn with the current line cap style .
If the path is closed , the start and endpoints will be treated as joined and drawn with the line join style .
[ Function ]
stroke - to - paths => |
Sets the current active paths to the paths that would result from outlining a STROKE operation .
[ Function ]
rectangle x y width height => |
Creates a rectangular subpath with the given width and height that has its lower - left corner at ( x , y ) .
It is effectively the same as : ( move - to x y ) ( line - to (+ x width ) y ) ( line - to (+ x width ) (+ y height ) ) ( line - to x (+ y height ) ) ( close - subpath )
[ Function ]
rounded - rectangle x y width height rx ry => |
Like RECTANGLE , but rounds the corners of the rectangle paths by the x radius rx and the y radius ry .
[ Function ]
centered - ellipse - path x y rx ry
Adds a closed subpath that outlines an ellipse centered at ( x , y ) with an X radius of rx and a Y radius of ry .
[ Function ]
centered - circle - path x y radius => |
Adds a closed subpath that outlines a circle centered at ( x , y ) with a radius of radius .
It is effectively the same as : ( centered - ellipse - path x y radius radius )
Painting
After a path is defined , filling , stroking , or both will use the path to apply color to the canvas .
After a path has been filled or stroked , it is no longer active ; it effectively disappears .
[ Function ]
fill - path => |
Fills the current path with the fill color or gradient .
If the path has not been explicitly closed with CLOSE - SUBPATH , it is implicitly closed before filling .
The non -zero winding rule is used to determine what areas are considered inside the path .
[ Function ]
even - odd - fill => |
The same as FILL - PATH , but uses the even / odd rule to determine what areas are considered inside the path .
[ Function ]
stroke => |
Strokes the current path .
The line width , stroke color , line join style , line cap style , and dash pattern and phase determine how the stroked path will appear on the canvas .
[ Function ]
fill - and - stroke => |
Fills the current path , then strokes it .
[ Function ]
even - odd - fill - and - stroke => |
Fills the current path using the even / odd rule , then strokes it .
[ Function ]
end - path - no - op => |
Ends the current path without painting anything .
If a clipping path has been specified with CLIP - PATH or EVEN - ODD - CLIP - PATH , it will be created by end - path - no - op .
Text
Vecto can draw text to a canvas .
It loads glyph shapes from TrueType font files with ZPB - TTF .
[ Function ]
get - font font - file => font - loader
Creates and returns a ZPB - TTF font loader object from font - file .
Any font loader created this way will automatically be closed at the end of its enclosing WITH - CANVAS form .
[ Function ]
set - font font - loader size => |
Sets the active font to the font associated with font - loader , scaled to size units per line .
The first argument can be any ZPB - TTF font loader ; it need not be created via GET - FONT .
However , only font loaders created via GET - FONT will be automatically closed at the end of WITH - CANVAS .
[ Function ]
set - character - spacing spacing => |
Sets the scale of the spacing used between characters when drawing text with DRAW - STRING and related functions .
Normally , the character spacing for drawing text is taken directly from a font 's advance - width and kerning metrics .
SET - CHARACTER -SPACING
can be used to adjust this spacing ; for example , a character spacing of 2.0d0 would double the normal space between characters , and 0.5d0 would halve it .
[ Special variable ]
* default - character - spacing *
The default scale for character spacing when drawing text with DRAW - STRING and related functions .
Initial value is 1.0d0 .
Changes to this variable affect the next WITH - CANVAS form .
To affect the spacing within the current WITH - CANVAS form , use SET - CHARACTER -SPACING .
[ Function ]
draw - string x y string => |
Draws string on the canvas with the active font .
The glyph origin of the first character in the string is positioned at x and the baseline of the string is positioned at y .
The text is filled with the current fill color .
The string may be a specialized vector of characters ( a true CL string ) or a vector containing characters , Unicode code - points , or both .
For example , #(#\L #\a #\m #\b #\d # \a #\= # x3BB ) is a valid argument for DRAW - STRING .
The horizontal space between characters is determined by the advance - width and kerning metrics of the font , then multiplied by the current character spacing .
At the default character spacing of 1.0d0 , the spacing is not adjusted at all .
SET - CHARACTER -SPACING
can be used to increase or decrease the character spacing .
[ Function ]
string - paths x y string => |
Like DRAW -STRING , but instead of drawing the text , adds the subpaths that make up the string glyphs to the graphics state .
This can be used to stroke , fill , or clip based on the outlines of a string .
[ Function ]
draw - centered - string x y string => |
Draws string on the canvas with the active font .
The horizontal center of the string is positioned at x and the baseline of the string is positioned at y .
[ Function ]
centered - string - paths x y string => |
Like DRAW -CENTERED -STRING
, but adds subpaths instead of painting .
See also STRING - PATHS .
[ Function ]
string - bounding - box string size loader => # ( xmin ymin xmax ymax )
Calculates the bounding box of string for font - loader at size .
Miscellaneous
[ Constant ]
+ kappa + => 0.5522847498307936d0 .
This constant is useful to draw portions of a circle .

Study helps to answer question of odd primate behaviour .
Monkey pee : rubbing urine on the hands could be a way of seeking attention .
Katalin Laszlo
It may seem strange , but many monkeys wash their hands and feet with urine .
Researchers now think they know why .
Since this odd behaviour was first observed , explanatory theories have varied wildly from suggesting that it helps monkeys improve their grip when climbing to saying it is a method of cleaning .
One widely supported theory argues that monkeys use urine washing to cool themselves down when temperatures get too high .
But new research hints that it 's all about social communication .
The notion of animals using chemical scents to communicate with each other is hardly new .
Dogs classically use urine to mark their territory , for example , as do many other creatures .
But when it comes to peeing on oneself , researchers had thought physiological reasons might be as important as social ones .
It seems they were wrong .
Hot times
Primatologist Kimran Miller and her research colleagues at the National Institutes of Health Animal Center in Poolesville , Maryland , monitored capuchin monkeys for ten months in a captive environment .
The researchers would record daily the enclosure temperature and humidity and then note rates of urine washing .
Their report , to be published in the American Journal of Primatology , shows that urine washing behaviours did not change with either temperature or humidity .
Instead , Miller and her team noticed a link between urine washing and attention - seeking .
Alpha males , for example , doubled their urine washing rates when being solicited by females .
The researchers think this might be how males encourage females to continue paying attention once they 've started .
And in 87 % of fights or aggressive incidents , the loser of the battle washed in urine .
The team suspects that this is also an attention - seeking behaviour — in this case seeking sympathy .
But more research is needed to be sure .
ADVERTISEMENT
" This really challenges the dominant theory that urine washing in capuchins is related to thermoregulation , " comments primatologist James Anderson at the University of Stirling in Scotland .
" We see antelope that pee on their throats , vultures that poop on their feet , and monkeys that wash their hands in urine , " says behavioural endocrinologist Fred Bercovitch at the centre for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species in San Diego .
" It 's obvious that urination is about more than elimination and it is great to see research like this that is figuring out why . "

If you ’ve developed software for long enough , you ’ve most certainly heard of a “ business logic layer . ”
It ’s supposed to be the layer ( or “ tier ” ) containing an application ’s business logic and is sandwiched between a “ persistence layer ” and a “ presentation layer . ”
Some call that the “ standard three tiers of an application . ”
But what it really is , however , is a bad design that leads to bad software .
Or at the very least , dangerously poor semantics .
In lieu of your standard WTF article , allow me to explain why .
First and foremost , we need to define the term “ business logic . ”
Unlike so many other entries in the IT lexicon , “ business logic ” has no standard meaning .
We ’re left with what you think it is , what your colleague wants it to be , and what some article you read says it is .
So , for the purpose of this article ( and hopefully beyond ) , here is my definitive definition .
business logic ( n. ) — any program code ( “ logic ” ) that pertains to the purpose ( “ business ” ) of a software application
It ’s a fairly broad definition for a fairly broad term .
If you think about it , virtually every line of code in a software application is business logic :
The Customers database table , with its Customer_Number ( CHAR - 13 ) , Approved_Date ( DATETIME ) , and SalesRep_Name ( VARCHAR - 35 ) columns : business logic .
If it was n’t , it ’d just be Table032 with Column01 , Column02 , and Column03 .
The subroutine that extends a ten - percent discount to first time customers : definitely business logic .
And hopefully , not soft - coded .
And the code that highlights past - due invoices in red : that ’s business logic , too .
Internet Explorer certainly does n’t look for the strings “ unpaid ” and “ 30 + days ” and go , hey , that sure would look good with a # 990000 background !
So how then is possible to encapsulate all of this business logic in a single layer of code ?
With terrible architecture and bad code of course !
No One Likes Business
When it comes down to it , us software developers do n’t like writing business software .
It ’s terribly , mind numbingly boring .
Just look at the dreadful specs we ’re given to work with :
When a Sale is Cleared , only Managers with Void Approval and Executives may issue a Cancellation Request .
If the Propagation Status for the Transferable Receivable is not Pending and the Expense Allocation Type is Reversible , the Cancellation Request is issued for Processing ; otherwise , it is issued for Approval .
I ’m sure those of you who managed to make it through that spec did not have visions of IF - ELSE code blocks swirling through your head .
I ’ll bet some of you , without even seeing the rest of specs , excitedly envisioned a CancelationWorkflowProvider that inherited from the abstract RequestWorkflowProvider and implemented the IPermissionRequired , IPropogationStatusRequired , and IExpenseAllocationTypeRequired interfaces , and was powered by the all - encompassing WorkflowManager .
Why ?
Because that ’s so much more challenging than writing a simple IF - ELSE code block .
Michael A. Jackson ( no , not that Michael Jackson ) observed this exact phenomenon in his 1975 book , Principles of Program Design .
Programmers … often take refuge in an understandable , but disastrous , inclination towards complexity and ingenuity in their work .
Forbidden to design anything larger than a program , they respond by making that program intricate enough to challenge their professional skill .
So what does this have to do with the “ business layer ” being a poor design ?
Everything .
By implying that a system ’s architecture should include a layer dedicated to business logic , many developers employ all sorts of horribly clever techniques to achieve that goal .
And it always ends up in a disaster .
The Enterprise Rules Engine , Revisited .
Again
Yes , I realize that the Enterprise Rules Engine — the ultimate example of a soft - coded business layer — has become my go - to example for bad software .
But it ’s for good reason .
The ERE truly represents the absolute worst kind of software .
It was as if its architects were given a perfectly good hammer and gleefully replied , neat !
With this hammer , we can build a tool that can pound in nails .
One “ problem ” that was immediately apparent to the designers of the ERE was user - input validation .
Certain forms had certain fields that were required in certain circumstances , and end users needed those fields identified with an asterisk .
While coding the validation rules in the HTML form ’s onsubmit ( ) method would most certainly do the trick , the ERE team found that to be completely unacceptable .
After all , business logic had no place in the presentation layer .
So the ERE designers built around it .
Each “ business entity ” class had a method that returned a complex tree structure representing which fields were required in which circumstances .
Another class in the presentation layer utilized this method to generate JavaScript validation code for each field .
Of course , this meant that they ’d have to solve another “ problem : ” how would the JavaScript generator know which fields corresponded to which HTML controls ?
The answer to that was surprisingly simple .
They built a two - way data - binding utility that would save to and load from fields on the business entity with controls on the page .
It got pretty tricky when it came to dropdown lists , file uploads , and the like , but they coded around that as well .
As the ERE developers continued on their quest of freeing the presentation layer from business logic , they came across another “ problem . ”
In order to display and constrain certain fields in the user interface , they had to implement business logic .
Thing like , the “ years old ” field should only be two characters big .
So they coded around that , too .
In addition to a validation rules , the business entity classes returned field lengths so that the presentation layer knew how to size the controls .
As more business logic “ problems ” arose , the ERE team pushed the business logic a layer down .
Eventually , they found the perfect balance .
Using XML “ display templates , ” they could simply serialize their business entities into XML , mash the two together with an XSLT , and send the resulting XML “ display instructions ” to the presentation layer to convert into a usable UI .
I ’ll let you imagine how well that worked out in the end .
The Persistence Plague
Unfortunately , the obsession to create a single layer encapsulating the all business logic has crept its way to the back - end .
Not content with “ mucking up ” the database with business logic , some developers have gone the route of “ persistence . ”
The idea behind persistence ( at least , as far as most in the industry have defined it ) is that business layer objects ( e.g. instances of a Customer class ) are persisted in some storage mechanism .
Note that this is a drastically different approach than simply coding classes to retrieve and save the appropriate data from a database .
With persistence , very little ( if any ) business logic needs to exist in the storage mechanism .
One of the most flagrant examples of this persistence paradigm is a framework called Prevayler .
Its premise is simple .
The framework serves as a container for all business objects and stores them in memory .
Changes to these objects are accomplished through a Transaction interface , where the framework makes the change ( e.g. set the Status property on a Customer object to “ Accepted ” ) and logs it .
While it may seem like a novel concept ( it certainly is clever ) , it ’s a terrible solution for most problems .
Any framework —
Prevayler certainly is n’t the only one — that attempts to remove business logic from the database will consequently remove useful information as well .
Tom Kyte elaborated on this point exactly in The Ultimate Extensibility :
One table ( no need to pester those mean DBAs asking them to create tables or indexes or anything ) .
It can hold any object on the planet : I have a table with a blob field , and type among other details .
Say , CREATE TABLE trx ( trxId NUMBER ( 18 ) , trxType VARCHAR2 ( 20 ) , objValue BLOB , ... )
Blob Fields contains a java serialised object , different objects based on types , though all of them implements same interface .
We access this object always thru ' j2ee container , so it works fine so far .
Unfortunately , the " architects " of this system discovered that :
Now users want to use reports using sqlplus , crystal reports etc .
So they want a solution to this blob issue .
The core problem with all persistence approaches , as Tom pointed out , is change .
A relational database — something actually designed for indefinite storage of a changing data model — can easily be modified with a few ALTER TABLE queries and accessed by virtually any other application .
The data stored for a persisted object , however , is meaningful only to the object ’s class and can’t readily be accessed or manipulated with anything else .
It ’s actually a rather familiar problem .
MUMPS has “ business logic free ” persistence .
Other ancient languages do , too .
Relational databases are a solution to that problem , not another problem to be overcome .
All About Semantics
The Enterprise Rules Engine and the Persistence Plague are fueled by two factors : bored and clever developers , and dangerously poor semantics .
Thinking of an application as existing over three separable layers — persistence , business , and presentation — encourages development towards that goal .
As demonstrated , it ’s completely infeasible to encapsulate an application ’s business logic into a single layer .
It ’s also logically impossible .
By the time a developer creates the perfect persistence layer — something that takes in any type of data , tucks it away somewhere , and provides an easy mechanism to retrieve it — he has created a separate infrastructure application .
Recreated , actually .
The operating system ’s file system already does exactly that .
By the time a developer creates the perfect presentation layer — something that takes in any type of data and displays it in a flexible manner — he too has recreated an infrastructure application .
ASP / PHP /etc with HTML already does a fantastic job of implementing that goal .
There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a multi-layered application .
In many cases , anything but that would be a bad design .
It ’s absolutely critical , however , to not think of these layers as persistence , business , and presentation .
Database , processing , and user interface are much more appropriate terms .
The Ideal Approach
Separating application code into different layers is important : it ’s a core principal ( “ loose coupling ” ) of structured programming .
But it ’s just as important — if not more so — to keep in mind that almost all of an application ’s code will be business logic .
There are already enough tools out there ; your application does not need a generic layer .
A good system ( as in , one that ’s maintainable by other people ) has no choice but to duplicate , triplicate , or even - more - licate business logic .
If Account_Number is a seven - digit required field , it should be declared as CHAR ( 7 ) NOT NULL in the database and have some client - side code to validate it was entered as seven digits .
If the system allows data entry in other places by other means , that means more duplication of the Account_Number logic is required .
It almost goes without saying that business logic changes frequently and in unpredictable ways .
The solution to this problem is not a cleverly coded business layer .
Unfortunately , it ’s much more boring than that .
Accommodating change can only be accomplished through careful analysis and thorough testing .
With simple , consistent code , change analysis is a breeze .
A simple trace through the layers of code with a text - search tool will generally reveal exactly what needs to be changed , and where .
A solid test plan will identify what changes broke the system and how , and allow developers to respond appropriately .
No , it ’s not fun and not challenging .
It ’s just good software .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. oil hit a record over $ 95 a barrel on Wednesday , posting the biggest gain in 10 months after a steep drop in U.S. inventories fueled winter supply concerns and the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates .

U.S. oil rose $ 4.90 , more than 5 percent , to $ 95.28 a barrel in late electronic trading after settling at $ 94.53 earlier .
London Brent settled up $ 3.19 at $ 90.63 a barrel .
U.S. crude oil stocks fell 3.9 million barrels in the week to October 26 , government data showed , countering expectations for a build ahead of the Northern Hemisphere winter .
The draw was led by a huge tumble in stockpiles at the Cushing , Oklahoma , delivery point for the NYMEX oil contract as companies drained storage tanks .
“ Given the economics of what it takes to store oil , it makes no sense to hold on to inventory right now , ” said Stephen Schork , president of The Schork Report .
“ Storage owners are taking the economically prudent step and dumping inventories . ”
Retail heating oil prices in top oil consumer the United States shot to a record $ 2.95 a gallon last week on the winter supply worries .
Further price support came as the dollar plummeted to a record low against the euro .
The weak greenback has boosted many dollar - denominated commodities in recent weeks .
FED CUT
Oil roared higher ahead of the Fed ’s decision to lower benchmark costs by a quarter of a percent on Wednesday to bolster the world ’s biggest economy against the threat of the growing credit crisis .
“ The energy markets had assumed a quarter percentage point interest rate cut by the Fed , but there were still some that expected the cut to be half a percentage point , ” said Tom Knight of Truman Arnold .
“ While there may be some selling , I expect crude prices to firm here , after a $ 4 rise . ”
Despite the battered housing sector , the U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly brisk clip in the third quarter boosted by strong consumer spending and brisk exports , the government said on Wednesday .
In addition , the U.S. economy was holding up against high oil prices , the White House said on Wednesday .
“ The American economy is resilient and it ’s able to shrug off higher oil prices primarily through gains in productivity growth and through expansions into other sectors , ” White House economic adviser Edward Lazear said .
Rate cuts by the Fed have added liquidity to financial markets by making it cheaper to borrow .
Analysts say some of the extra cash has been drawn to energy markets and contributed to oil ’s record rally .
The price increase has spurred U.S. government officials to call on OPEC to increase output , but cartel officials maintain speculator buying has driven up prices , not a supply shortage .
“ OPEC is not very happy with the existing situation that shows a lack of stability in world oil markets , ” Javad Yarjani , head of OPEC affairs at Iran ’s Oil Ministry , was quoted as saying .
He warned that geopolitical concerns had created a “ bubble ” in oil prices which would burst one day .
March 31 , 2002 --
The Academy Awards are all over except for the incessant movie ads that will trumpet the results for months .
But it 's how the academy voted that has surprising connections to other topical issues .
The voting system used by the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences often has a pronounced effect on its selections .
This may appear to be a rather myopic commentary on the Oscars that only a mathematician would make , but how one keeps score helps determine who wins not only in Hollywood , but in Palm Beach , in Salt Lake , and almost everywhere there are competitions .
No one has forgotten the many types of dimpled chad and the infamous butterfly ballots that clouded the presidential election of 2000 .
The Electoral College always generates controversy , and strategic positioning for the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries is already being discussed by potential candidates .
Everyone is aware , too , of the vagaries of Olympic figure skating scoring , where the judging was sometimes quite subjective , to say the least .
Even in those racing events such as skiing and sledding , where the scoring was objective , the times were measured in imperceptible thousandths of a second , differences that were much less than those caused by the changing weather and course conditions that the athletes confronted .
In short , much often depends on such fine discriminations and arcane measurements .
Hollywood No Different
Hollywood is no different .
The winners there were chosen by a plurality system whereby the nominated movies and artists receiving the most first - place votes received the Oscars .
This sounds unobjectionable until one realizes that with five nominees for each award , the winner is unlikely to be a favorite of a majority of the voting member of the academy .
The nominees , however , were chosen by a more complicated system designed to ensure variety and , some argue , quality .
Roughly it goes as follows :
Each of the members of the academy ranks up to five of his or her preferences , and those nominees who receive enough first - place votes are selected .
Those with the fewest first - place votes are eliminated .
The votes are then redistributed among the remaining candidates .
Once again those with enough first - place votes are selected and the process continues until the nominees are selected .
An unappreciated mathematical point is that who the winners are depends as much on the system used as the votes cast .
There 's certainly nothing wrong with this .
In fact , it could n't be otherwise .
Different Methods , Different Winners
For illustration , consider the following imaginary scenario .
Let 's reduce the numbers involved and say there were only three candidates for Best Actor and only 100 voting members .
Assume that 37 members rated Denzel Washington ( the real winner ) their favorite , Russell Crowe their second choice , and Sean Penn their third .
Further assume that 18 members rated Crowe first , Washington second , and Penn third , and that the remaining 45 rated Penn first , Crowe second , and Washington third .
After the presenters exchange banter , the envelope is opened and …
If the academy uses the plurality system , then Penn , who has 45 first - place votes , wins handily .
If it first eliminates the nominee with the fewest first - place votes ( Crowe ) and has a runoff between the two remaining nominess , then the winner is Washington , whom 55 of the 100 voters prefer to Penn .
If it stipulates that each first - place vote an actor receives is worth 3 points , each second - place vote 2 points , and each third - place vote one point , then who wins ?
( Answer below )
There are many alternative systems , including the increasingly popular approval voting system in which voters vote for or approve of as many nominees as they care to .
A famous theorem by economist Kenneth Arrow states , however , that all systems satisfying some very simple conditions have their flaws .
It 's appropriate that this year 's best picture award went to A Beautiful Mind .
The movie 's protagonist , mathematician John Nash , made seminal contributions to game theory , a discipline not unrelated to voting systems and the ways voters and candidates respond to them .
The movie was my favorite , despite the fact that there was less math in it than there is in this short column .
Answer : Given the rankings ( 37 - W , C , P ; 18 - C , W , P ; 45 - P , C , W ) , Crowe wins because his total number of points is ( 37 x 2 ) + ( 18 x 3 ) + ( 45 x 2 ) , which equals 218 .
Penn 's point total is ( 37 x 1 ) + ( 18 x 1 ) + ( 45 x 3 ) , which equals 190 , while Washington 's is ( 37 x 3 ) + ( 18 x 2 ) + ( 45 x 1 ) , which equals 192 .

According to a report by the Associated Press , George W. Bush is going to announce today ( on Constitution Day , coincidentally ) that he has selected Michael B. Mukasey , a retired federal judge from New York , to replace Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General .
So I decided to do a little digging into Mukasey 's background .
First I learned that Senator Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) had recommended Mukasey as a possible nominee for the Supreme Court , as well as for the AG gig .
So maybe he 's not so bad .
I also learned that Mukasey had heard the trial of Jose Padilla .
He ruled that Padilla could be held as an enemy combatant ( not so good ) , but that Padilla was entitled to see his lawyers ( good ) .
Then I read an op -ed that Mukasey had written in the Wall Street Journal about the Padilla case .
While dressed in all kinds of legalese , the piece made me uncomfortable .
It seems that Mukasey was advocating for secret evidence and other restrictions on a defendant 's Constitutional rights and civil liberties .
Will he be another enabler of the Bush administration 's policy in which national " security " trumps the rule of law ?
Read the op-ed and decide for yourself : Jose Padilla Makes Bad Law
And remember the words of Benjamin Franklin : " They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety . "

The market appeared to react positively to remarks by Mr. Bush that the administration would not favor changing the way partners in private equity firms are taxed .
In recent months , several prominent lawmakers have proposed subjecting the investment gains of fund managers  known as “ carried interest ”  to the ordinary income tax rate of up to 35 percent , rather than the capital gains rate of 15 percent .

Halloween is a time for children to dress up as witches , ghouls and goblins , but historically witchcraft was serious business , according to a Duke University professor .
Though people today might view witchcraft as mere superstition , it ’s evident from anthropological literature that , for some people , the practice has served a basic human need , said Anne- Maria Makhulu , an assistant professor of cultural anthropology who studies the ongoing practice of witchcraft in Africa .
" We live in a bewildering world where we do n’t have a lot of control .
And we can imagine doing things through magic that we ca n’t do as ordinary human beings , " said Makhulu , who is teaching a course this semester on magic and capitalism .
During the early Christian period , Halloween , despite its pagan origins , came to be associated with the veneration of saints and for a time was marked alongside the celebration of those who had been granted sainthood .
Today , by contrast , Halloween is largely associated with ghosts and monsters and other popular figures of horror , such as " Jason " from " Friday the 13th . "
People believe in magic for all sorts of reasons , Makhulu said , including the desire to accrue wealth or advance in life , but the belief also says something about a deep - seated human desire for equality .
" When people say they believe in magical forces , they believe in magic that can make the world equal and just in circumstances where it ’s not , " Makhulu said .
For some , " witchcraft is about recuperating what is ethical , just and moral . "
" We need enchantment in our lives because our world has become disenchanted , " Makhulu said .
" We need faith that promises something bigger and better than what we have . "
Makhulu ’s research mainly focuses on South Africa and urbanization .
This semester , she is teaching " Magical Modernities , " a course about the " magical properties of capitalism " in which she examines the connections between economic and ritual trends in postcolonial Africa .

Following up on an item from yesterday , Bush was unusually reckless in his choice of words during his press conference , in response to a question about Iran .
The president said , " I ’ve told people that if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . "
Naturally , hearing the president of the United States reference “ World War III ” while discussing foreign policy , particularly in regards to a county at whom Bush has rattled his saber , raised a few eyebrows .
So , the White House has tried to walk the comments back a bit .
President Bush was simply “ making a point ” when he stated at his press conference this week that anyone who wants to avert World War III wants to keep nuclear weapons out of Iran ’s hands , the White House said today .
“ The president was not making any war plans , ” White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said today .
“ He was not making any declaration .
He was making a point . ”
Oh , the president was making a point .
In that case , Bush ’s remarks made perfect sense .
The problem , of course , is that it ’s not at all clear what this “ point ” might have been .
It certainly sounded as if the president said World War III would happen if Iran acquired “ the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
What , pray tell , was the “ point ” Bush hoped to get across ?
The White House can try and argue today that the president ’s comments were no big deal , but in this climate , random references to World War III are taken a little more seriously than that .
Cranberry sauce is not the star of the traditional Thanksgiving Day meal , but when it comes to health benefits , the lowly condiment takes center stage .
In fact , researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) have found that compounds in cranberries are able to alter E. coli bacteria , which are responsible for a host of human illnesses ( from kidney infections to gastroenteritis to tooth decay ) , in ways that render them unable to initiate an infection .
The findings are the result of research by Terri Camesano , associate professor of chemical engineering at WPI , and a team that includes graduate students Yatao Liu and Paola Pinzon - Arango .
Funded , in part , by the National Science Foundation and the Cranberry Institute and Wisconsin Cranberry Board , the work has been reported in a number of publications and presentations , including FAV Health 2007 ( The 2nd Annual Symposium on Human Health Effects of Fruits and Vegetables ) , the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in September 2006 , and the January / February 2007 issue of the Italian publication AgroFOOD industry hi-tech .
For the first time , the research has begun to reveal the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that appear to underlie a number of beneficial health effects that have long been ascribed to cranberries and cranberry juice — in particular , the ability of cranberry juice to prevent urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) .
The mechanism by which cranberry juice prevents such infections has not been clear , though scientists have suspected that compounds in the juice somehow prevent bacteria from adhering to the lining of the urinary tract .
Camesano and her students have used the atomic force microscope and other sophisticated tools to study how a group of tannins ( called proanthocyanidins or PACs ) found primarily in cranberries interact with bacteria at the molecular level .
They have found that the compounds prevent E. coli from adhering to cells in the body ( a necessary first step in infections ) in several ways :
--
The chemical changes caused by cranberry juice create an energy barrier that keeps the bacteria from getting close to the urinary tract lining .
-- Direct measurements show that the adhesive forces between E. coli and cells of the urinary tract are greatly reduced when at least a 5 percent solution of cranberry juice cocktail is present .
-- Cranberry juice causes tiny tendrils ( known as fimbriae ) on the surface of the type of E. coli bacteria responsible for the most serious types of UTIs to become compressed , reducing the bacteria ’s ability to latch onto the lining of the urinary tract .
-- E. coli grown in cranberry juice or the isolated PACs are unable to form biofilms .
Biofilms , clusters containing high concentrations of bacteria , are required for infections to develop .
Biofilms are the source of infections associated with indwelling catheters and other biomedical devices .
-- When E. coli are cultured over extended periods in solutions containing various concentrations of either cranberry juice or PACs , their cell membranes undergo changes that hinder the bacteria ’s ability to attach to cells of the urinary tract .
Camesano and her team have also noticed that cranberry juice inhibits the ability of E. coli to produce IAA , a molecule involved in a phenomenon known as quorum sensing .
Bacteria produce IAA to let other bacteria know they are there .
Quorum sensing enables bacteria to sense that their population is large enough to initiate an infection , or to form a biofilm .
Keeping bacteria from producing IAA may be another way that cranberry compounds can hinder their ability to cause serious infections .
Some of Camesano ’s current work is aimed at assessing the minimum effective dose of cranberry juice ( or tannins ) and the optimum frequency to ward off infections .
In addition , she is working to test whether the urine of patients who have consumed cranberry juice still contains anti-adhesive properties .
The clinical portion of the work is being done in collaboration with Amy Howell , associate research scientist at the Philip E. Marucci Center for Blueberry and Cranberry Research at Rutgers University .
Camesano says her work to date indicates that the benefits increase the more juice or cranberry products one consumes .
So when it comes to this year ’s Thanksgiving feast , do n’t spare the cranberry sauce .

The Chairman of the House ’s Oversight and Government Reform Committee today demanded that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice respond to 11 outstanding requests for information sent by his office since 2003 .
The letters primarily concerned claims , later proved erroneous , on the threat posed to the United States by Saddam Hussein ’s government in the run up to the Iraq War .
( More )
It has been two long months since Gen. David Petraeus , the top commander in Iraq , cowed Congressional Democrats into silence , championing President Bush ’s misguided course on the war .
We ’re pleased to see that the effects of his briefing are finally wearing off .
The bad news , as ever , is that Mr. Bush and his Republican allies continue to resist reason .
House Democrats distinguished themselves this week when they stood up to the White House ’s latest military funding steamroller : approving only $ 50 billion of the additional $ 196 billion the president requested for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
They also set conditions on the funding , including demands that troops start coming home from Iraq within 30 days and that the withdrawal be completed by mid-December 2008 .
Senate Democrats quickly brought the House plan to the floor .
But , ever the spoilers , Republicans blocked it , as they have other attempts to rein in Mr. Bush ’s war - without - end in Iraq .
Predictably , the White House — which always prefers fear - mongering to serious debate — accused Democrats of undermining the troops .
Even Defense Secretary Robert Gates got into the act , threatening to direct the Army and Marine Corps to begin developing plans to lay off employees and terminate contracts next year unless Congress approves new funding within days .
If the American dream means doing better than your parents did , then Mike Brockman 's not living it .
Single , with a 10 - year - old daughter , he 's a server at a Black Angus restaurant in Mesa , Ariz .
His father at his age had a good , steady job as a machinist at TRW .
Today " there are n't the kind of jobs available you used to get with a high school education , and work yourself up , " says Mr. Brockman .
" Now you have to have training or experience to start – then you can work your way up from there . "
Norman Payne , on the other hand , thinks the American dream is alive and well .
An immigrant from Panama , he 's lived in the US for 16 years – and on June 28 in Boston he was sworn in as a US citizen .
Mr. Payne works in customer service at Kodak and has high hopes for his young son and daughter .
" I do n't think the American dream has changed , " he says .
" I am trying to do everything I can do so that they can do better than I did . "
Two hundred and thirty - one years after the 13 colonies declared their independence from Great Britain , is the United States still the land of opportunity , the light of hope for the poor of the world ?
The economic dream that has united a diverse population for generations , that children would be more prosperous than their parents , is in question as perhaps never before .
Yet the nation 's overall standard of living remains high .
Immigrants both legal and illegal arrive every year by the tens of thousands , testament to the US economy 's continuing dynamism .
Less mobility in US
Overall , there is actually less economic mobility in the US than in Canada and many European countries , notes John Morton , Managing Director , Program Planning and Economic Policy , for the Pew Charitable Trusts .
But for immigrants " the economic assimilation machine is in fact still very strong , " says Mr. Morton , who is helping lead a long - term Pew project on the American dream 's health .
The phrase " American dream " is relatively recent .
It was popularized in the 1930s by historian James Truslow Adams , who in his day was a widely read author on the major themes and figures of the nation , similar to , say , David McCullough today .
Yet the idea expressed by the phrase , that the US was a land of opportunity where generation after generation would keep doing better and better , has always been the " gyroscope of American life , " writes Southern Methodist University political scientist Cal Jillson in his book " Pursuing the American Dream . "
In some periods the American dream has seemed more attainable than in others , says Mr. Jillson .
Most recently , it was alive and well in the era from the end of World War II through the early 1970s .
But since 1973 , median family income has been essentially flat , says Jillson .
" This is one of those periods in American history when to many ... the American dream seems illusory , " Jillson says .
Some polls back up this contention .
In a recent CBS News survey of 17 - to 29 - year - olds , only 25 percent of respondents said their generation would be better off than their parents .
Forty - eight percent said they would be worse off .
The American dream is " obsolete , " says Adam Gandelman , a Boston bike messenger .
" It 's a scam . "
Single - earner families see fall in pay
Income figures show that the days are gone when a single , stable income , typically earned by the father , was enough to launch the next generation to greater prosperity , according to a Pew report on economic mobility released this spring .
Today , men in their 30s earn about $ 5,000 less in real terms than did their fathers ' generation , according to Pew .
That fits with Brockman 's experience .
Neither he , nor his father , graduated from college .
Nor did his grandmother , but she worked her way up from a secretarial position to the executive ranks at GE .
" I could n't get the job my dad had at [ age ] 30 without a degree , or waiting in line for years , " he says .
However , overall family income is a different story .
Families with men in their 30s today have about $ 4,000 more in annual income than did their parents ' generation .
" The main reason that family incomes have risen is that more women have gone to work , buttressing the incomes of men by adding a second earner , " notes the Pew economic mobility report .
Katy Curtis , a real estate agent in north Scottsdale , Ariz. , did not work when she was in the family - rearing stage of life .
" And we survived quite well , " she says .
But her two daughters , now in that thirty - something cohort , are finding life economically more difficult , she says .
They see new cars and plasma TVs and other accoutrements everywhere , and they want them , too .
" I think there are more demands made upon them materialistically , and it 's harder , " says Ms. Curtis .
" Things have gone up in price , and I do n't think salaries are commensurate with that . "
Some experts point out that income measures today are an inexact gauge of family well - being .
Cash , for example , is just one part of compensation .
" Total compensation includes such increasingly important components of workers ‚ pay as health benefits , contributions to retirement plans , and paid vacations , " writes Heritage Foundation labor expert James Sherk in a recent analysis of economic mobility .
And the use of the Consumer Price Index to calculate inflation - adjusted pay is a mistake , according to Mr. Sherk .
Economists should use the more accurate implicit price deflator instead .
" The result of this mistake is that wage growth will almost always appear to lag far behind productivity growth , even when workers are making gains , " writes Sherk .
Nor does everyone judge the American dream to be purely based on monetary gain .
Mike Heitmann is a Kansas City resident visiting his wife 's family in Boston , his four daughters in tow .
" The American dream is having a strong family and living in a place where we have freedoms like we do in the US , " says Mr. Heitmann .
" Family is the most important thing . "
More to American dream than money
Wallace Sheppard will return to Iraq for his third tour there in October .
The Army serviceman , based in Ft. Campbell , Kentucky , is also in Boston as a tourist .
" I define [ the American dream ] as being happy , " he says .
" Money does n't really mater if you make enough to sustain your family . "
And for the masses in many other parts of the world , whether they are huddled or not , the Statue of Liberty still stands as their dream destination .
Joseph Nemorin today is a line cook at Nick 's Italian Restaurant on Ocean Drive in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
He 's been there 17 years .
He arrived in the US from Haiti when he himself was 17 .
Today he is a legal permanent resident who says he has done better than his parents .
He expects his children will do better than he has , because they were born in America .
The American dream is available for those who come to the US for the right reason , he says .
" If you come to work , you do n't get in trouble ... you should be doing fine , just like me . "

When biologists speak of cooperation , they speak more broadly than the rest of us .
Cooperation is what happens when someone or something gets a benefit because someone or something else pays a cost .
The benefit can take many forms , like money or reproductive success .
A friend takes off work to pick you up from the hospital .
A sterile worker bee tends to eggs in a hive .
Even the cells in the human body cooperate .
Rather than reproducing as fast as it can , each cell respects the needs of the body , helping to form the heart , the lungs or other vital organs .
Even the genes in a genome cooperate , to bring an organism to life .
In recent papers , Dr. Nowak has argued that cooperation is one of the three basic principles of evolution .
The other two are mutation and selection .
On their own , mutation and selection can transform a species , giving rise to new traits like limbs and eyes .
But cooperation is essential for life to evolve to a new level of organization .
Single - celled protozoa had to cooperate to give rise to the first multicellular animals .
Humans had to cooperate for complex societies to emerge .
“ We see this principle everywhere in evolution where interesting things are happening , ” Dr. Nowak said .
While cooperation may be central to evolution , however , it poses questions that are not easy to answer .
How can competing individuals start to cooperate for the greater good ?
And how do they continue to cooperate in the face of exploitation ?
To answer these questions , Dr. Nowak plays games .
His games are the intellectual descendants of a puzzle known as the Prisoner ’s Dilemma .
Imagine two prisoners are separately offered the same deal : if one of them testifies and the other does n’t talk , the talker will go free and the holdout will go to jail for 10 years .
If both refuse to talk , the prosecutor will only be able to put them in jail for six months .
If each prisoner rats out the other , they will both get five - year sentences .
Not knowing what the other prisoner will do , how should each one act ?

Bush Meets With and Honors Man Three Days After He Attacked Gold Star Father
By Hannah Johns
( Chris Hill , ‘ National Director of Ops ’ for the Gathering of Eagles in DC on 9/18/07 , while assaulting Mr. Arredondo and with Bush ( left to right ) .
On September 18 , 2007 , three days after members of the pro-war Gathering of Eagles were involved in the verbal , then physical , attacks on Gold Star Father and war opponent Carlos Arredondo ( and to a much lesser extent myself ) at the march in DC , the pResident , Laura , Condi , Karen Hughes , and Darth Cheney hosted groups they deem supporting the troops at a breakfast on the south lawn of the Whitehouse .
Here are three pictures which show that the administration is not too choosy in the terrorists it invites for eggs and bacon .
There is a photo of Chris Hill , ‘ National Director of Ops ’ for the Gathering of Eagles , with the pRez himself , one of Chris Hill over Carlos during the altercation , and one just after as he distances himself from the police questioning .
These people continue to encourage physical confrontation with those they disagree with , which now polls show is a strong majority .
This was a wakeup for me .
I did n’t think that in public they would try to strongarm a middle - aged woman like myself .
The verbal abuse they hurled at those who passed them by would have been reprehensible enough , but to follow up with ripping off ( fallen US soldier ) Alex Arredondo ’s photo , and the ensuing kicking of his father , was shocking .
To me , anyway .
I guess not to Bushco .
Profiling bit - twiddling in Python
After my previous post regarding the the is_power_of_2 and next_power_of_2 functions , Richard Jones pointed out that Pyglet has an implementation that used the bit - twiddling method .
Since I had something to do a direct comparison with , I wrote a script to test the run time of the two methods .
#!/usr/bin/env python setup_1 = " " " from math import log , ceil def is_power_of _2 ( n ) : return log(n , 2 ) % 1.0 == 0.0 def next_power_of_2 ( n ) : return ( 2 ** ceil ( log ( n , 2 ) ) ) " " " setup_2 = " " " def next_power_of_2( v ) : v -= 1 v |= v >> 1 v |= v >> 2 v |= v >> 4 v |= v >> 8 v |= v >> 16 return v + 1 def is_power_of_2( v ) : return ( v & ( v - 1 ) ) == 0 " " " from timeit import Timer t1 = Timer ( " is_power_of_2 ( 128 ) " , setup_1 ) t2 = Timer ( " is_power_of_2 ( 128 ) " , setup_2 ) t3 = Timer ( " next_power_of_2 ( 125 ) " , setup_1 ) t4 = Timer ( " next_power_of_2 ( 125 ) " , setup_2 ) print " float math is_power_of_2 : " , t1 . timeit ( ) print " bit- tiwddling is_power_of_2 : " , t2 . timeit ( ) print print " float math next power of 2 : " , t3 . timeit ( ) print " bit - twiddling next power of 2 : " , t4 . timeit ()
This produced the following results on my humble PC .
float math is_power_of_2 : 3.79312203087 bit - tiwddling is_power_of_2 : 1.11348704933 float math next power of 2 : 4.90055467944 bit - twiddling next power of 2 : 2.99615733285
The results are conclusive - bit - twiddling is still a big win in Python .
I figured that the bit - twiddling is_power_of_2 function would be faster than the float math version , but I was surprised by the next_power_of _2 result .
It pays to profile !
I also tested it with Psyco , and got the following results .
float math is_power_of_2 : 4.33070460072 bit - tiwddling is_power_of_2 : 0.037652550813 float math next power of 2 : 5.66786840227 bit - twiddling next power of 2 : 0.0600607060395
Wow !
The bit - twidding times improved astronomically with Psyco - almost 50 times faster , by my calculations .
What is surprising is that the float versions are actually a little slower with Psyco .
Conclusion ?
If you need to calculate the nearest power of 2 for billions of numbers in a hurry , use Psyco .
The government of Bangladesh is desperately trying to evacuate millions of people to avoid repeating the disaster of 1970 .
Tropical Cyclone Sidr , at the top of category 4 is much stronger than the 1970 storm that killed at least half a million people , however .
The front edge of its furious winds is just beginning to reach land now .
Instead of weakening as earlier forecasts , Sidr has strengthened to the top of category 4 according to satellite estimates of its strength .
No actual measurements of wind speeds have been done .
For an excellent explanation of the meteorological aspects of Sidr , please read Alefnot 's outstanding diary .
The Ganges delta is one of the most densely populated places on the planet .
It is also one of the poorest .
It is also flat and barely above sea level .
For these reasons , it is subject to devastating floods and enormous death tolls .
One of the worst natural disasters in history occurred in the Ganges delta .
In November 1970 , the deadliest tropical cyclone of the twentieth century hit the Ganges Delta region .
The 1970 Bhola cyclone killed 500,000 people ( official death toll ) , with another 100,000 missing .
The Guinness Book of World Records estimated the total loss of human life from the Bhola cyclone at 1,000,000 - [ 1 ]
Another cyclone hit the delta in 1991 , killing about 138,000 people — see 1991 Bangladesh Cyclone .
Better preparation and better evacuation will save lives but cyclone Sidr has been at major hurricane strength for over 3 days .
It has developed 40 foot high waves according to US Navy measurements .
I suspect that the the largest waves are even higher , based on similar storms in the Gulf of Mexico .
Sidr 's foreward speed is increasing as it approaches land further builing the storm surge .
Even the best preparation may not be enough to save lives .
Millions of people will be fighting for their lives over the next day as the storm moves inland .
May our thoughts and prayers be with them .
One of our machines at work gets hammered by ssh password guessers , and this is about a neat and cheap ( IMHO ) way of dealing with this .
Possible solutions : block ssh for all unknown clients , use a log - scraping blacklister like this one to detect mischief , change over to key - only authentication , port - knocking or connection rate limiting .
Blocking unknown clients does n't work as not all legitimate users have fixed addresses , the blacklister is inelegant but works , key - only is an ssh - specific fix and does n't keep the suckers from using up cpu on our box , and for port - knocking I 'd need central admin to open up more network ports .
All not overly clean nor close to perfection .
Connection rate limiting using iptables is great : let 's allow everybody one new connection in a window of , say , 5 minutes .
The problem is that if you legitimately need more connections , you 're screwed : with ipt_recent , all animals are equal .
I 'd like some animals to be more equal than others , but not based on advance knowledge of their client addresses : let them prove their worth .
This is where my add - on comes into play .
The pam_recent module provides a PAM session management function , and session management is only run after authentication has succeeded .
The module adds or removes the client IP address to / from an ipt_recent list ( via the cool / proc - interface to ipt_recent ) .
In the most trivial deployment , you 'd allow everybody a very few new connections within a longish window .
If the client manages to login , his history is cleared and subsequent new connections are not blocked .
Password guessers , however , would not manage to prove their legitimacy and be blocked on a second / third / whatever connection .
That 's it : no need to know your clients , they 're all treated as scum unless they can prove to be Good People .
This idea is obviously similar to pam_abl , the auto - blacklist module , but in contrast my pam_recent does n't need to manage its own databases and is a lot more lightweight and simpler .
Also , pam_recent can add to or remove from any ipt_recent list , meaning that you could open up different / all services or ports upon successful authentication to a particular service .
Plus pam_recent is super - trivial and simple : a mere 150 lines of C ( survives - Wall - pedantic , TYVM ) , most being error handling .
Docs are included at the top of the file , licence is GPL V1 or V2 .
The downside is that it 's iptables - specific and works only together with the recent match extension .

Stargazers have yet to lay eyes on any of the nearly 240 planets detected outside our solar system .
These so - called exoplanets are too faint for current telescopes to distinguish from the stars they orbit* ; instead astronomers rely on indirect methods to infer their existence .
Yet popular news accounts , supplied by space agency press services , overflow with bold , almost photo - realistic images of distant worlds .
Naturally , people can get confused .
When San Francisco artist Lynette Cook painted a particularly striking image of a newly discovered planet passing in front of the star HD 209458 for a 1999 NASA press release , she received e-mail asking what kind of amazing image processing software she had used .
" A lot of people did n't understand that it was a rendering , " she says .
When astronomers make a sexy new discovery that does n't lend itself easily to visual inspection , they turn to artists like Cook to bring it to life .
A compelling image has the power to transform even the most complex data into an easy - to - grasp mental snapshot , but it runs the risk of fooling people into believing an iffy scientific case is closed .
Well aware of the double - edged sword they wield , artists and astronomers who dream up images of astronomical exotica often spend considerable time deciding how best to illustrate new discoveries .
In the case of exoplanets , they are guided by a few key pieces of information and a healthy dose of educated guesswork .
Researchers frequently discover exoplanets by searching for regular variations in the color of a star 's light .
A planet circling in orbit will tug its star back and forth like a wispy figure skater spinning around a heavier one .
If the system is aligned so that the star wobbles toward and away from us , the light will appear to oscillate between bluer and redder as the wavelength expands or contracts along the line of sight to Earth .
This oscillation , which would not be especially eye - catching plotted as a graph , contains several crucial bits of information .
Encoded in the timing of the oscillating light are the shape and distance of the planet 's orbit around its star , which in turn determine how warm it is likely to be and , therefore , whether it could have liquid or frozen water , in the case of a rocky , Earth - like planet .
The degree of the color shift indicates the planet 's mass and makeup .
Astronomers believe that a planet as hefty as the solar gas giants Saturn ( 95 Earth masses ) or Jupiter ( 318 ) would almost certainly be gaseous .
Smaller planets of up to a few dozen Earth masses might range from those made mostly of rock and ice to larger ones with a solid core enshrouded by a mixture of thick gas .
Orbital distance would also influence a planet 's color , says astronomer Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California , Berkeley , whose team has discovered 145 of the known exoplanets .
Jupiter and Saturn have brownish - orangey tints because their atmospheres swirl with carbon - based molecules that reflect light of those colors , Marcy says ; a hotter atmosphere would evaporate water clouds and break down those molecules into carbon dioxide and methane , which scatter blue light .
The effect might result in " deep blue billiard balls , " he says .
Less familiar colors may also be out there .
In May astronomers reported that planet HD 149026 b seems to absorb so much light that it should appear nearly black .
Today 's instruments have too little resolution to detect details found in some images , including moons , rings and volcanic activity .
Cook takes her cue from astronomers when deciding how or whether to depict such enhancements .
" Most of them are really pretty open to show what might be there , " she says .
Robert Hurt , a self - described visualization scientist for the Spitzer Space Telescope , says he ups the realism of his depictions of distant gaseous planets by matching the size and shape of their roiling clouds with those of known solar gas giants .
Marcy says the artists he works with ( including Cook ) typically develop two drafts of an image before creating the final masterpiece [ click here for examples ] .
Of course , he does n't always have final say on the illustration that accompanies press releases .
When his team discovered the first Saturn - like exoplanet , for instance , NASA commissioned an image of a reddish gas giant covered in white spiral clouds .
" This makes me cringe , " he says .
" It looked like the planet was wearing paisley pajamas . "
But it was out of his hands .
" There 's not much you can do when NASA says they want a [ certain ] depiction .
You ca n't stop them . "
Some observers say that an emphasis on realism might be a touch deceptive .
" My problem with so much of the beautiful stuff that artists do is that we are not privy to the decision - making process , " says Felice Frankel , a senior research fellow and science photographer at Harvard University .
" The more , quote , ' real ' something looks , the more you accept it as fact . "
For Frankel , labeling something an artist 's rendering is not enough , because an image leaves a lasting impression .
She advocates literally showing viewers where the interpretation lies by providing multiple possible views — something Marcy and Cook have tried — or making images sketchier and more interactive .
" My fantasy is , for example , that you see a picture online and , with your cursor , you kind of travel around the artist 's concept and you see a rollover of information , " she says .
" Why not say right at that spot , ' this is supposed to represent this but we 're not sure about that and this and that ' ? "
Nobody disagrees that colorful , detailed images may carry a risk of misconception .
But for the image makers — tasked by funding agencies to convey new findings to the public — the benefits outweigh the risk .
" It 's alright to have pictures as long as they generate intelligent discussion , " Marcy says .
" Pictures allow people to imagine , where otherwise their imaginations might be somewhat limited . "
Capturing a true image of an exoplanet , Marcy says , may have to wait until NASA scrapes together the money to launch the proposed Terrestrial Planet Finder , which would include a telescope equipped with a tool for blotting out distant stars , thereby creating an artificial eclipse to reveal orbiting planets .
Until then , the problem of realism versus abstract renderings has no easy solution , Hurt says , noting that the goal generally dictates the answer .
" If a casual observer notices an artist 's concept of a planet in an article in USA Today , [ and ] thinks ' wow , we 're observing planets , ' and [ then ] turns to the sports page , was that a success ? " he asks .
Probably so , in his view .
" If the image was dull or diagrammatic , " Hurt says , " he might not have even noticed the article at all . "
* Note : Exo-sticklers may recall that telescopes did image a planet - size red object around the brown dwarf 2M1207 , but researchers do not believe it formed like the planets in our solar system did .
You must see it !!! :) ) ) LOL !!!!!!! :)
Being an information security enthusiast / professional I am often asked how one can go about hiding their IP address while on the Internet .
Here ’s the analogy I give them :
Ordering Pizza
What would happen if you were to give a fake address when making a pizza delivery order ?
Simple — you would n’t get a pizza .
While you could pretty easily fool the pizza place , you ultimately would n’t accomplish much .
The very thing that you wanted ( the pizza ) would get sent to some other guy ’s house , and you ’d go hungry .
It ’s the same with the Internet .
You need a valid IP address in order to receive web pages and email — just like you need a valid house address in order to receive a pizza delivery or a package from the post office .
If you did n’t have an address people simply would n’t know how to bring you the things you wanted .
Proxies
One popular way of obscuring your IP address is by using a proxy .
But proxies do n’t break the rules ; they just add a bit of complexity .
Using our pizza delivery analogy , a proxy is like calling your buddy at his house and having him order your pizza .
Then , when the pizza gets there , he brings it to YOU .
But guess what ?
You still need an address .
If your buddy did n’t know where you lived he could n’t bring you your pizza .
So you hid from the pizza place , but not from everyone .
The key here is that the pizza shop did n’t hear your voice ( what browser you ’re using ) , your accent ( your operating system ) , or get your mailing address ( your IP ) .
They got your friend ’s information instead , and that ’s what people like about proxies .
Conclusion
Just remember that proxies are n’t magical ; they simply add extra hops in the middle .
Each person still has an address ( you , your buddy , and the pizza place ) .
So do n’t think of it as “ hiding ” or “ becoming invisible ” ; this is n’t how the Internet works .
The Internet needs to know your IP addressees or else you ca n’t use it .
If you were truly hidden , nobody would be able to bring you the stuff you asked for — whether that something was a pizza or an email from a friend . :

Mobile phones do not pose health problems to adults in the short term but there is a " slight hint " of a cancer risk for long - term users , according to the results of a study which could not rule out risks of brain or ear cancer for those who have used mobiles for more than 10 years .
" We found no association between incidence and exposure for people who have used their phones for less than 10 years , " said Lawrie Challis , chair of the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research programme .
" But we can not rule out the possibility [ of ] an association for exposures for more than 10 years .
The numbers appeared to show some slight hint ... it 's a faint suggestion that needs to be followed up . "
The researchers involved in the six - year study said they would further investigate in the next phase of their work , which would also examine the effects of mobile phones on children 's health .
The £ 8.8 m MTHR programme is a joint project funded by government and the mobile phone industry in response to Sir William Stewart 's independent inquiry in 2000 into the safety of mobiles .
He has concluded that mobile phones seem to pose no problems but has recommended further research .
The group 's report , published yesterday , collates the work of 28 studies it has backed , as well as other research from around the world that has looked at the effects of mobile phones on health factors such as blood pressure , brain function and cancer .
It concludes that there is no evidence of short - term effects from either GSM or 3G handsets or base stations .
There is also no evidence , the researchers say , of the phones causing the symptoms described as electrical hypersensitivity , a phenomenon affecting up to 4 % of people in the UK who describe a sense of tingling or dizziness in the presence of electrical signals .
For the long term , however , there is less certainty .
Paul Elliott , an epidemiologist at Imperial College London , said : " In some of the studies there was an excess of malignant brain tumours and acoustic neuromas [ ear cancers ] .
But the excess is quite small and is at the borderline of statistical significance . "
Regarding the question over the effects of mobiles on children , Professor Challis said : " At this stage we have no evidence at all that mobile phones or masts hurt children .
But we do know that [ regarding ] a number of other environmental agents - lead , tobacco smoke , ultraviolet radiation , ionising radiation - children react differently to them and often more severely , than do adults . "
The professor said that his group 's findings did not contradict the advice from Sir William , who , in 2005 , urged parents to limit their children 's use of mobile phones as a precaution , and advised that under - eights should not use them at all .
Starting next year the MTHR researchers will begin a £ 6 m health study on more than 200,000 mobile phone users from across Europe .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A 19 - year - old German woman has escaped from prison by hiding in a friend ’s suitcase .
The fugitive hid inside the large case when her 17 - year - old fellow inmate was released from the youth prison in northwest Germany on Friday , Lower Saxony ministry spokesman Dennis Weilmann said on Monday .
The girl simply walked out of the building with her friend concealed in her luggage , Weilmann said .
“ Our staff are going to make sure they inspect big suitcases more carefully in the future , ” Weilmann said .
Neither of the teenagers has since been caught .
Both had been jailed for theft .
The escaped prisoner had less than two weeks left to serve .

Wafer - thin paper beats bucky tubes Agençe France - Presse
Scientists led by Professor Rodney Ruoff of
The paper is made from graphene oxide , which is derived from the cheap and plentiful form of carbon , graphite .
First , scientists oxidised graphite to form graphite oxide , a layered material , which sheds layers of graphene oxide in water .
They then filtered the sheets and formed them into neatly - structured layers , each a micrometre , or a millionth of a metre , thick .
The researchers have made small sheets of the dark - brown paper 1-100 micrometres thick and tested it successfully for stress and tensile resilience against other papers .
This includes so - called bucky paper , which is made of carbon nanotubes .
Graphene oxide paper owes its physical qualities to a unique interlocking - tile lattice at the atomic scale .
It also has intriguing electrical qualities , as the oxidisation process turns the material from a conductor into an insulator .
" In the future , it will be possible to tune the material as a conductor , semiconductor or insulator , " Ruoff says .
" One will be able to control the electrical properties without sacrificing exceptional mechanical properties . "
The foil - like paper has many potential outlets , the scientists say .
It could be used alone or as a composite with plastics , ceramics or metals where flexible reinforcement is needed , such as in aircraft , cars and buildings .
Each of these layers is a micrometre thick ( Image : Dmitriy Dikin )
It could also be used in batteries and supercapacitors , while its unique lattice structure could be electrically charged to make membranes with controllable permeability .
So far , only experimental sheets of the paper have been made , each of them around 12 centimetres in diameter .
But Ruoff believes that it would be quite easy to scale up to large sheets , helped by the fact that graphite is cheap and plentiful .
Ruoff 's team is a pioneer in a new class of material called graphene , a sheet of carbon only one atom thick .
" The mechanical , thermal , optical and electrical properties of graphene are exceptional , " says Ruoff .
" For example , the stiffness and strength of these grapheme - like sheets should be superior to all other materials , with the possible exception of diamond . "
Wafer - thin carbon paper said to be stronger , lighter and more flexible than the equivalent made from nanotubes has been developed in the US .
Scientists led by Professor Rodney Ruoff of Northwestern University in Chicago describe the super - thin paper today in the journal Nature
The paper is made from graphene oxide , which is derived from the cheap and plentiful form of carbon , graphite .
First , scientists oxidised graphite to form graphite oxide , a layered material , which sheds layers of graphene oxide in water .
They then filtered the sheets and formed them into neatly - structured layers , each a micrometre , or a millionth of a metre , thick .
The researchers have made small sheets of the dark - brown paper 1-100 micrometres thick and tested it successfully for stress and tensile resilience against other papers .
This includes so - called bucky paper , which is made of carbon nanotubes .
Graphene oxide paper owes its physical qualities to a unique interlocking - tile lattice at the atomic scale .
It also has intriguing electrical qualities , as the oxidisation process turns the material from a conductor into an insulator .
"
In the future , it will be possible to tune the material as a conductor , semiconductor or insulator , " Ruoff says .
" One will be able to control the electrical properties without sacrificing exceptional mechanical properties .
" The foil - like paper has many potential outlets , the scientists say .
It could be used alone or as a composite with plastics , ceramics or metals where flexible reinforcement is needed , such as in aircraft , cars and buildings .
It could also be used in batteries and supercapacitors , while its unique lattice structure could be electrically charged to make membranes with controllable permeability .
So far , only experimental sheets of the paper have been made , each of them around 12 centimetres in diameter .
But Ruoff believes that it would be quite easy to scale up to large sheets , helped by the fact that graphite is cheap and plentiful .

Today I ended my hypocrisy .
Today I sold my stock in multinational corporations .
Today I made a step towards moral and existential sanity .
Today I stopped supporting a malevolent , inhuman and amoral force .
Let me back up a moment .
Two years ago , freshly graduated from an East Coast status enclave , I took a job in Japan , where I lived in a mountain community that is rapidly fading into a coal mine ghost town .
Well paid , and with no student loans thanks to my industrious grandfather , I needed something to do with the portion of my salary that did n’t go towards food and beer .
The local bank paid interest rates of about .001 percent .
Where to put my money ?
How to turn it into more ?
Why did I want more money so badly ?
These were three easy questions .
I wanted more money so that I could travel the world and indulge my dream of becoming a great writer
I wanted more money so that I could travel the world and indulge my dream of becoming a great writer , living like Hemingway in Paris , Spain and Cuba , fishing and chasing pretty girls .
Not a bad goal , really .
I ’m not all that smart , but my education has given me a small sniff of how the world economy functions .
I know how to make money .
Buy stocks .
The technique of buying stocks came naturally to me as well .
It was just like playing Fantasy Baseball .
With a little research and the click of a mouse , I bought the stock of big mining companies that are headquartered in the United States , Australia , China and Canada , but have operations in countries like Peru , Cambodia and Sudan .
Why did I buy these particular stocks ?
Simple !
Because buying stock in international energy and mining corporations is one of the quickest , most reliable ways for rich people like me to get even more rich – this was true two years ago , and it ’s still mostly true today .
The elite of Shanghai , Sydney , Manhattan and Moscow all know this .
I managed my stock portfolio the same way I managed my fantasy baseball team , and I made plenty of travel money .
I made enough to fulfill my fantasy and take an extended holiday .
I chose my destination the same way I chose my stocks .
What place would give me the best value ?
Another easy answer – go to the Southeast Asian countries of Thailand , Cambodia and Laos .
In Southeast Asia a young person like me can live like royalty for less than it costs to rent a studio apartment in Tokyo or Manhattan .
And I had a great time .
For months , I sipped fresh mango juice on tropical beaches and managed my stock portfolio from Internet cafes .
It was great .
Except for one thing .
Show Me The Money
In Cambodia , there were people with no legs who dragged themselves across the sand .
There were little metal bombs in the forest waiting to lash out and kill you .
There were girls younger than anyone in my Facebook network selling their bodies in brothels .
There were businessmen , generals and politicians driving through the desiccated countryside in black Lexus SUVs with military license plates .
There were luxury hotels with teak bars crowded with tourists like me , everyone sipping a taste of exotica .
Every day in Cambodia I saw injustice so obvious , so callous and so inhumane it filled me with a sense of guilt and rage .
So I did what my generation does best : I looked for entertainment elsewhere .
I left the beach , and took a bus way off into the boondocks , to a province called Mondulkiri that borders Vietnam .
There , I nearly killed myself drinking Mekong Whiskey and rode elephants through upland forests that stretched far and green and pure for as far as the eye could see .
I had adventures .
I felt like the hero in a Graham Greene novel .
One clear day I was driving through the forest with a 24 year old Englishman named Jack Highwood , one of only a few foreigners who lives in Mondulkiri .
Jack runs two projects : a bar called the Middle of Somewhere and an NGO that promotes healthy coexistence between people and elephants .
“ It ’s a shame all this is done for , ” said Jack mournfully , reaching for his cigarette lighter .
“ What do you mean ? ” I asked .
“ BHP Billiton bought the rights to this whole forest , ” he said .
“ It ’ll be stripped clean . ”
BHP Billiton is one of the stocks I bought in Japan .
BHP Billiton has given me over $ 12,000 .
Seeing the letters Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœBHP ’ gives me a soft , warm , proud feeling .
I tried to look on the bright side .
“ Maybe you could work out some sort of partnership with them , ” I suggested .
“ Get some money for your NGO . ”
Jack braked for a pothole and looked at me sideways .
“ Maybe if there was a scrap of good in what they stand for , ” he said .
“ But there ’s not . ”
Reality Bites
Deep down , I knew that what Jack said was true .
But instead of selling my BHP stock , I bought more and went to Laos .
Laos…beautiful Laos .
Laos was surely paradise .
In Laos I ate tropical fruit and played in pristine waterfalls .
I ambled through golden temples and drank cold beer by the Mekong River .
But I also felt a certain tension .
I sensed fear and desperate paranoia .
I smelled smoke .
The smoke was easy to explain .
Laos was on fire .
It was the dry season , and the mountain forests were burning night and day .
The hazy air made for spectacular sunsets .
But the tension … that was harder to account for , because the people of Laos could not have been more hospitable and kind .
I met monks and farmers and earnest young students .
I felt no animosity – only that vague and unsettling paranoia .
One day I learned that when my father was my age , an army captain in Vietnam , the United States haphazardly dropped millions of tons of bombs and deadly chemical weapons from airplanes onto Laos .
They dropped 500 pounds of high explosives for every man , woman , child and baby in the country .
They tried to bomb Laos back to the Stone Age , and they almost did .
Many survivors lived in caves .
I wondered why .
The answer , I discovered , was that the Americans were nervous .
They dropped all those millions of tons of bombs on monks and mothers and rice farmers living in bamboo huts because they were worried they might not be able to control them .
For years , they kept the bombing secret from the American people .
Now , I know which people made the decision to bomb Laos and Cambodia .
I ’ve met some of them .
I ’ve sat down at a table and broken bread with former Defense Secretary and World Bank President Robert McNamara , who made decisions that are directly responsible for the deaths of millions of innocents , vast ecological destruction and the hopeless , cringing poverty of entire nations .
And the thing I could n’t get , the thing I could n’t understand , was this :
Robert McNamara is a good man .
He loves to go hiking in Colorado .
He is deeply intelligent and sincere .
When , on the day I joined him for lunch , a student asked Mr. McNamara how it feels to be one of the biggest murderers of the twentieth century , I thought the question was inappropriate and cruel .
For the record , Mr. McNamara replied by saying , “ I do n’t think I am . ”
How could upstanding citizens like Robert McNamara be responsible for the utterly inhuman apocalypse of mortal thunder unleashed on Laos ?
How could good people be responsible for such evil ?
I did n’t have the answer to this question , so I bought stock in a company called Goldcorp and went to Thailand .
The Ignorance of Evil
By the time I got to Thailand , I had put so much money into stocks , I did n’t have much left in my travel fund .
Instead of redeeming my precious stock , I went to a farm where I could live for close to free .
Life on this farm was strangely simple .
Food came from the garden and was delicious .
Sun came from the sky and was warm .
Water came from the river and was laced with invisible poison – carcinogenic pesticides produced by multinational corporations and shipped by the ton to countries like Thailand .
The weirdest thing was that even though I spent almost no money while living at the farm , buying little more than bottled water , I have never been happier .
I worked with my hands in the earth .
I slept well and deep .
My food tasted great and made my body healthy .
I started each day with a sunrise .
At dusk I listened to music while stars flickered in the purple sky .
But I still did n’t sell my stock .
I did n’t decide to sell my stock until today , when I was driving through the golden autumn hills of Vermont listening to an old man ’s voice – loud and brave and clear : “ Sing a sadder song of freedom , ” he sang .
“ Slowly sinking like the sun . ”
Next to me in the passenger seat was a beautiful young woman named Becky who I ’m starting to like ( although I have n’t told her so yet ) .
And I got to thinking – what if , someday , I marry someone wonderful like Becky ?
What if we have children ?
What world – what truth – do I want my children to know ?
Knowledge and Morality
When a wealthy American like me buys a stock , or invests in a mutual fund , that action has a very real impact somewhere in the world .
All too often , that impact is invisible , totally divorced from moral consequence .
The gap between action and consequence is the central problem of the global market based economy .
There is no room for moral judgment in a system that only rewards profit .
The key is active , empowered awareness .
When you travel , think about where your money is going , and what exactly you are supporting .
Just as Robert McNamara and the men who incinerated Laos would never , could never , have torched bamboo huts and Buddhist temples by hand , so too would American stockholders recoil from the real damage inherent – but invisible – in their carefully managed stock portfolios .
When tons of bombs and rates of return become abstract numbers , we lose the qualities that make us moral beings .
We become inhuman .
The refreshing news is that we have the potential to recapture our morality .
Just as our money can do evil , poisoning water systems , displacing indigenous people and destroying the forests that are this planet ’s lungs , money invested with care and attention can be a force for good .
The key is active , empowered awareness .
When you travel , think about where your money is going , and what exactly you are supporting .
Likewise , when you invest in a stock , or a fund , or even just go shopping for a new pair of shoes , make the effort to consider the moral implications of your action .
These are exciting times in which to live .
The possibilities are endless .
We have more freedom than any generation before us , but that freedom is dangerous and destructive without moral awareness .
We must not succumb to ignorance , fear and greed .
Our character is defined by the choices we make .
Ultimately , the fate of the planet may depend on our ability to extend our empathy across oceans , to act with knowledge , and most importantly , to act with love .

How to apply human morality to global issues ?
Here are a couple of articles that give us an idea : “ The Journey Begins With A Single Step ” and “ Why The GDP Says Little About Authentic Happiness ”
And please leave comments below !
Urban camping means different things to different people , from living without a vehicle or electricity and plumbing to squatting in unused properties and more .
However , the most popular definition of urban camping provided by the urban dictionary is : “ camping in an urban setting by sleeping on rooftops , under bushes , and in public parks . ”
Amid and Zach are two brave New Yorkers who picked the busiest and most high profile place they could think of to pitch their urban camp : Times Square , New York City .
According to Zach ,
“ We chose the traffic median at 44th Street because it is a wide island right in the middle of Times Sqaure with plenty of room for our tents to sprawl .
It was noisy and bright , but the LEDs replaced the stars nicely , and the skyscrapers could n’t have imitated sequoias any better .
We met dozens of strangers who , whether they were just curious , drunk or lonely , were eager to strike conversation to try figuring us out . ”
They were also questioned by multiple police officers , to whom they provided non-commital responses about photographing the North Face store or waiting overnight to buy tickets .
Baltimore , Maryland seems as good a location as any to pitch a tent on the sidewalk .
These industrious campers managed to travel virtually for free , selling mugs and living on the street .
“ With promise of a free dinner from RISD , a new city to inhabit , and galleries extraordinaire , the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts ( NCECA ) Conference in Baltimore was a must .
While figuring out the budget side of this journey camping was suggested as a housing option in a joking manner , and strangely the idea began building with intrigue . ”
Ultimately they were shooed away by the police , but not before sipping on hot chocolate and taking a few pictures .
The Car Tent is a rather ingenious approach to urban camping .
Instead of hiding in a park or making up excuses in a public location , car tent users can camouflage themselves right in plain view .
“ The car tent is a tent designed to look like a car cover , so you can go camping in the city without being disturbed .
And really , who does n’t go camping in the city ?
When you get hungry you just shoot a business man and cook him over an open flame . ”

Australian DNA database
August 4 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
I was waiting for this .
I was wondering how soon before Australia would fall in line behind the UK and subject Australians to increased surveillance and invasion of privacy .
( Skip this post if you ’re unconcerned about your DNA potentially ending up on a national database ) .
In a previous post , I told you about the review of the Police and Criminal Evidence ( PACE )
Act in the UK and the controversial plan to enter DNA details of convicted citizens into a national database .
The fear is that people convicted of minor offences such as littering would be included .
The deadline for the review was May 31 , 2007 .
But seems the NSW Police Commissioner , Ken Moroney , is not going to wait around to read the consultation document .
He is calling for tougher identification checks when people buy mobile phone SIM cards ( knee - jerk reaction to Haneef case surely ) and he confirmed that police might soon enjoy expanded powers to collect our DNA , regardless of whether you ’re innocent , according to The Sydney Morning Herald .
And Moroney was n’t shy in owning up to the fact that a proposed DNA database could contain the data of innocent people when he said : “ Well , that ’s the purpose of a database … to keep within it issues that go to the identification of people . ”
The NSW Cabinet has just approved an expansion of police powers .
Police can now demand DNA from a hair sample or mouth swab from suspects arrested for any offence .
And speaking of DNA sampling , Moroney said “ … the possibilities are endless .
It ’s an important tool ” – meaning the possibilities on how your DNA might be collected are only limited by the Government ’s imagination .
Moroney did not rule out a national Australian DNA database when he quipped that the policing of the future could not simply be police numbers and the visibility of police .
Thankfully , Moroney is retiring soon , so let ’s hope the next NSW Police Commissioner considers the impact and consequences of such far - reaching powers .

It 's always tricky to combine learning with fun , but especially difficult when it comes to learning about the bible .
While Jack Thompson rants against video games for being " immoral " and " unacceptable " and " killing his family , " a few companies are trying to put the hand of God back on the controller .
Not surprisingly , we found that devout fundamentalists often make incredibly bad game designers .
A little less expected is their muddling of the message of the Bible .
We take a look through six of the most preposterous religious video games , evaluating them on sheer ridiculousness , as well as biblical coherence to answer the ultimate question :
What would Jesus play ?

6 Super 3D Noah 's Ark : Suppose you own a Super Nintendo , but the 16 - bit graphics have too many rounded corners and smooth surfaces for your eyes .
Also , imagine that your idea of a fun game involves taking an existing PC game about shooting nazis , and reskinning it so that you are throwing fruit at animals that puts them to sleep .
Having a difficult time imagining that ?
Well , then you 'll have a hard time imagining why anyone in their right mind would buy Super 3D Noah 's Ark.

Hell , we had a tough time even imagining why ID software would let a company like Wisdom Tree take over Wolfenstein3D , the grandpappy of all first - person shooter games and transform it into ... well , just a random grandpappy running around tossing melons at sheep .
Nor , can we readily fathom what Wisdom Tree was thinking here .
Not only do you have to fictionalize the whole Noah throwing fruit at sheep trope -- one apparently omitted as being too boring for the bible -- but you also have to pass over about a million Bible stories that lend themselves to being Wolfensteined instead .
Would Jesus Approve :
Not only did the folks at Wisdom Tree make a bad game , it also appears that they have never read the Bible .
For instance , it has Noah shooting fruit at an ark full of 100 sheep .
Is n't the ark supposed to have two of each animal ?
Hell , you could have just seen Evan Almighty and known that .

If I were a big - shot L.A. music mogul , Jammie Thomas would not be my ideal poster child as the face of illegal file sharing .
Thomas , you 'll recall , was found liable last week in a Duluth , Minnesota , court for violating copyright law by making a couple of dozen songs available to the multitudes .
For this she was ordered to pay the recording industry $ 222,000 in damages , and she could lose even more to court costs and appeals .
All because she was among the 26,000 people sued by those Brioni suits known collectively as the Recording Industry Association of America , and hers was the first case to actually reach trial .
The RIAA , faced with plummeting CD sales and increasingly restive artists , wanted to " send a message " to all the lowlifes out there who download music for free and undercut their profit margins .
The message , apparently , is this : " We 're idiots . "
The RIAA , after all , is the guardian of an industry so antiquated and oppressive that having sympathy for these guys is a little like feeling sorry for a Georgia slaveholder after watching Sherman 's troops fire his mansion and scatter his livestock .
So when their first victim , Thomas , turns out to be a single American Indian mother of two making a measly $ 36,000 a year – latte money for the RIAA boys – you have a hard time picturing these guys nailed to a cross .
But that 's the image the RIAA has tried hard to foster since some pimply - faced intern first explained to them what file sharing was .
All of a sudden it was , oh , boo - hoo .
Poor us .
Cry me a river .
Here 's an industry so bloated with executives and middlemen , all of them greedily slurping up profit like bluepoint oysters , that the people who actually write the songs and play the music – the " talent " – are getting royally screwed in the royalty department .
It 's been like that for years .
The Dylans and the Stones of the world might be able to rise above it and name their price , but for the rank and file it 's " Dance to our tune , or go back and rot in that crummy little club . "
The usurious nature of the business is the main reason that the average CD , which at most costs a couple of bucks to produce , routinely sells for upwards of $ 20 .
Sometimes the songwriter makes out all right ( forget about the singer or the musicians ) , but licensing and contracts have been sufficiently rigged by the boys in legal to ensure that the lion 's share of the carcass goes to people who have absolutely nothing to do with the actual music .
If there 's an industry where the Marxist exhortation for the workers to control the means of production makes sense , this is it .
Some artists are beginning to wise up to this .
Thanks to technology ( and when have you ever heard the Luddite say that ? ) bands are discovering that they can , in effect , become their own publishers , cut out the middleman and go directly to their audiences .
Radiohead is the latest band to offer an album 's worth of music online , for free .
Fans are being asked to pay what they feel is fair , and my guess is that most people will kick in something .
Given the chance to be reasonable , we usually will .
The record companies are greedy , not reasonable , which is why it 's hard to get worked up at the thought of people sharing " their " music for free .
Thieves stealing from thieves ?
So what ?
It 's this new artist - to - audience business model , though , that poses the real threat to the long - term survival of the traditional music companies .
If you 're among those who consider corporations and conglomerates to be evil incarnate , you 'll be rooting hard for this new model to take hold .
Not just for the sake of the little guy in the music world , but for the sake of little guys everywhere .
Meanwhile , I think Jammie Thomas is going to turn out to be a public - relations nightmare for the RIAA .
Crucifying someone who falls into about five demographically challenged categories to " send a message " hardly represents sound battle tactics for an entity already perceived as arrogant and overweening .
Talk about a Pyrrhic victory .

We have long been concerned about the potential threat to free speech and a free press as communications migrate from old - fashioned telephone lines , TV broadcasts and printing presses to digital networks controlled by unregulated private companies .
The threat stopped being theoretical recently when Verizon Wireless censored political speech on one of its mobile services .
Verizon did the right thing after the problem was disclosed : it promptly dropped a misbegotten policy and said its new policy is to open its network to any legal communication .
But alarm bells should be ringing on Capitol Hill , where industry lobbying , legislative goldbricking and Republican aversion to regulations have bottled up much - needed laws on digital communications .
Late last month , Verizon Wireless denied an application from Naral Pro-Choice America , a reproductive rights group , for a “ short code , ” a few numbers that a mobile phone user can use to subscribe to a particular source of text messages .
Verizon said its policy was to refuse “ issue oriented ” text - messaging programs from any group that “ seeks to promote an agenda or distribute content that , in its discretion , may be seen as controversial or unsavory to any of our users . ”
The policy also said political candidates may be granted short codes if the content is , “ in VZW ’s sole discretion , not issue - oriented or controversial in nature . ”
Leave aside for the moment the sorry spectacle of a major American company aiming to make campaigns even more substance - free than they already are .
The Verizon policy was textbook censorship .
Any government that tried it would be rightly labeled authoritarian .
The First Amendment prohibits the United States government from anything approaching that sort of restriction .
Summary : America pluses are quality and speed , minuses are cost and connection to work .
Here is a comparison by Americans living in Canada who are presumably famliar with both American and Canadian health care systems , one of which is slightly more socialistic than the other , both of which are heavily shaped by government intrusion .
There are obvious problems with this kind of comparison ; this is only one of the most meaningful comparisons that I have seen , which is saying little .
Americans living in Canada prefer the U.S. health - care
system for speed , quality and diagnostic technology , says a new study .
But they also applaud the equity and cost - effectiveness of Canada's
system .
And in the final analysis , 40 per cent prefer the Canadian
system . [...]
Overall , the Americans said they preferred the U.S. system for emergency ,
specialist , hospital and diagnostic services , and said they preferred
the timeliness and quality of the American system . [...]
In all , 260 [ out of 310 total ] of the Americans identified wait times as the most significant negative feature of the Canadian system , while 192 identified quality
of care as the most positive feature of the U.S. system .
In all , 196 of the Americans said cost efficiency was the best thing about the
Canadian system , while 223 said cost inefficiency was the worst thing
about the U.S. system . [...]
Meanwhile , 32 per cent also noted that while they lived in the U.S. , health
insurance concerns affected their decisions about where to look for a
job , and 29 per cent said it influenced decisions about whether to
remain at a workplace .

With only days left before the Internet tax ban was set to expire , the Senate reached a compromise between lawmakers who proposed a shorter extension and those who insisted it should be made permanent .
“ By keeping the Internet tax - free and affordable , Congress can encourage Internet use for distance learning , telemedicine , commerce and other important services , ” Sen .
Ted Stevens , of Alaska , said in a statement on Thursday night .
The vote came about two weeks after the House of Representatives approved a four - year extension of the Internet tax ban .
The two chambers must work out their differences on the bill before a final version can be approved and signed by President George W. Bush .
On Friday , Bush listed the Internet tax ban extension among a list of tasks that Congress had failed to accomplish .
“ I urge Congress to keep the Internet tax - free -- and to get a bill to my desk that I can sign , ” Bush said .
The state tax ban has been in place since 1998 .
It was last renewed by Congress in 2004 for three years .
It is scheduled to expire on November 1 .
Internet service providers say the price of Internet access could rise by as much as 17 percent if the moratorium on state taxes were allowed to expire .
Some senators , including many Republicans , had argued that a permanent ban on Internet taxes is needed to spur more investment by broadband service providers .
They complained that Senate Democratic leaders had blocked a vote on a permanent moratorium .
Stealing someone 's heart can cost you : Just ask German Blinov .
A Cook County jury ordered Blinov to shell out $ 4,802 last week after he was sued by a husband from a Chicago suburb for stealing the affections of the man 's wife .
Arthur Friedman used a little - known state law to mount the legal attack against Blinov .
The alienation of affection law , one of eight across the country , lets spouses seek damages for the loss of love .
But Natalie Friedman , the woman at the center of it all , claims her husband asked her to have sex with other men and women - including Blinov - to spice up their relationship .
She supposedly began having feelings for Blinov , prompting her husband to file the lawsuit .
" This guy ruined my life - he backstabbed me , " Arthur Friedman told the Chicago Sun -Times .
" What he did was wrong .
And I did what I had to do to get my point across . "
Blinov does n't deny having a relationship with Natalie Friedman while she was married , but he was surprised to learn he could be sued for it .
His attorney also said Natalie Friedman was unhappy with her marriage before the relationship started .
" German was not a pirate of her affections , " attorney Enrico Mirabelli said .
" Her affections were already adrift . "

Middle East US behind Afghan warlord 's rise , fall At Guantanamo , unruly chieftains join combatants
Gardez , the provincial capital that was home to Abdullah Mujahid , has grown since his departure .
Shoppers at a market bustled about recently but residents say the insurgency rages in the background .
( Jean Chung for The Boston Globe ) GARDEZ , Afghanistan --
When US special forces wanted to defeat the Taliban , they befriended Abdullah Mujahid , the police chief of this mountainous province .
They visited his home with a gift of chocolates , and gave money and equipment to his fighters .
Mujahid met frequently with US troops , and even arrested and handed over a suspect the US military sent to the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
But as the threat of the Taliban receded , US forces sought to replace Mujahid -- an illiterate leader who had been accused of corruption -- with a professionally trained police chief .
Soon , Mujahid was accused of being responsible for an attack on US forces .
He was sent to Guantanamo Bay , where he languishes not far from the man he arrested .
The fall of Mujahid offers a rare glimpse into the trials of postwar Afghanistan , where US special forces struggled to rein in the warlords they once wooed .
But it also reveals the extent to which the military is using the Guantanamo Bay detention center for a starkly different purpose than the one outlined by President Bush : to keep the worst terrorism suspects behind bars .
A Globe investigation found that the military has used Guantanamo Bay not just for terrorists " picked up on the battlefield " -- as Bush has repeatedly asserted -- but also for uncooperative or unruly tribal chieftains , many of whom had been key supporters of the US - led invasion .
The use of Guantanamo Bay for purposes other than fighting international terrorism could have legal significance , because Bush has tried to justify creating a place where detainees can be held without normal legal protections on the grounds that the prisoners are enemy combatants who might launch a terrorist attack if they are released .
Despite Bush 's assertions , at least 52 detainees who had been held at Guantanamo Bay were not accused of ties to the Taliban or Al Qaeda , according to publicly released military records detailing the accusations against nearly 500 prisoners .
At least a dozen were once officials in the post - Taliban government , arrested in their homes or offices during a broader US campaign to rein in warlords .
Mujahid was one .
The former head of the United Nations office in Gardez , Thomas Ruttig , said he urged the Afghan government to remove Mujahid from his post because he was seen as an uneducated , disruptive , and corrupt figure .
But Ruttig said he expected Mujahid to be fired or tried for corruption in Afghanistan , not held indefinitely in Cuba without a trial .
" I never dreamed he would be sent to Guantanamo , " Ruttig said in a recent interview in Kabul .
John Sifton , a Human Rights
Watch researcher , helped write a 2003 report that accused Mujahid and his inner circle of allowing their fighters to set up illegal checkpoints to take money from truck drivers .
But he , too , said Mujahid should not have been sent to Guantanamo Bay .
" Guantanamo is not even vaguely the appropriate place for him , " he said , adding that the administration should n't use its power to hold accused terrorists at Guantanamo to solve political or criminal problems in Afghanistan .
The distinction between Guantanamo and a regular military or civilian prison is significant because Guantanamo detainees are stripped of most of their rights , and can be held on unspecified charges without being given a chance to mount a normal legal defense .
For a year after Mujahid 's arrest in July 2003 , the military refused to release any information about why he was arrested .
But in 2004 , after a Supreme Court ruling forced the government to reveal why people were being held , the military accused Mujahid of " being responsible for " an attack in which a US soldier was killed , though UN and Afghan officials say Mujahid was not in Gardez at the time .
Then , in 2005 , the military accused him of being a senior leader of a militant group operating in India - held Kashmir .
But Pakistani news accounts suggest that another man by the same name who died last fall was a senior leader of that group .
Now , even the military has stopped saying that Mujahid belongs in Guantanamo Bay .
In February , Pentagon officials informed his lawyers that he was among a group of at least 12 detainees who had been cleared to return to Afghanistan , either for release or further detention .
Pentagon spokesman Jeffrey Gordon declined to discuss the accusations against Mujahid , but said the decision to clear him for transfer does not " change the fact that he still poses a threat to the United States . "
" We take into account many factors in the decision to transfer a detainee , " Gordon said .
" Those factors include the risk the detainee would pose if released , the prospects of the detainee reintegrating into society , and the capacity of the receiving government to hold the detainee if they deem detention is necessary to mitigate the threat . "
Gordon declined to comment on why Mujahid had not yet been sent back to Afghanistan , where his wife and three children await him .
Gordon said only that the US and Afghan governments are working on a transfer agreement .
Recently , Mujahid was moved from a communal living arrangement to a solitary cell , with only limited contact with other inmates .
" No one has told us why , " said his lawyer , Carolyn Welshhans , who has taken his case pro bono , even though she has only limited access to him .
A call for volunteers Enlisting the help of strongmen like Mujahid was once a key to the US strategy in Afghanistan .
When the Taliban were defeated , only a few hundred US soldiers were on the ground -- most of them special forces Green Berets working alongside the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance , a coalition of warlords who sometimes clashed in turf battles with one another .
Enlisting the help of strongmen like Mujahid was once a key to the US strategy in Afghanistan .
When the Taliban were defeated , only a few hundred US soldiers were on the ground -- most of them special forces Green Berets working alongside the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance , a coalition of warlords who sometimes clashed in turf battles with one another .
In Gardez , Mujahid and his childhood friend Ziauddin -- who , like many Afghans , uses only one name -- filled the vacuum left by the fleeing Taliban .
As members of the tiny ethnic Tajik minority , they suddenly had powerful patrons in the Tajik - led Northern Alliance and the new Afghan government .
Mujahid became police chief and Ziauddin became the local army commander .
The government of US - backed President Hamid Karzai was so new that it had not yet begun to pay salaries or send equipment .
So Mujahid and Ziauddin used untrained volunteers to patrol with their personal weapons .
Complaints quickly arose .
Citizens in Gardez accused them of letting their fighters rob drivers at checkpoints , according to interviews with UN , US , and Afghan officials and a Human Rights Watch report .
The fact that they came from a minority tribe also sparked opposition .
But many in town backed the two men , who were embroiled in a tribal war against Pacha Khan Zadran , a warlord in the south .
Throughout 2002 , the US military described Mujahid and Ziauddin 's forces as pro-government in media reports , and called Zadran a renegade .
In spring 2002 , US fighters recruited Mujahid and Ziauddin , among others , to help in the fight against remnants of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in a mountainous area known as Shaikot .
The key point of contact between local strongmen and US special forces was a sunburned man known only as " Commander Mike , " according to current and former Afghan and UN officials .
Special forces operate only under first names or aliases .
Commander Mike was known in the lawless mountainous provinces for brokering deals with local warlords , according to humanitarian workers and Afghan soldiers in the area at the time .
They said he was known to use scare tactics before a negotiation , sometimes exploding harmless bombs in the air above the heads of Afghan commanders to get their cooperation .
Commander Mike gave Ziauddin money and a satellite telephone to fight in Shaikot , as well as shoes , uniforms , and camping gear for about 320 fighters , Ziauddin said in an interview .
Later , when Mujahid 's father returned from a religious visit to Saudi Arabia , Commander Mike brought chocolates to the family home and was given perfume in return , according to Mujahid 's brother .
A year later , in spring 2003 , a second man also called Commander Mike appeared at the special forces base in Gardez .
This man wore a beard and was a " real fighter , " according to Faiz Zaland , an Afghan aide to the provincial governor at the time who also served as a translator for the US military there .
The new Commander Mike came at a time when the US military was trying to replace troublesome strongmen with educated , modern leaders .
The US government was also trying to set up the first " Provincial Reconstruction Team " in Gardez to work with the Afghan government , hoping to win the confidence of citizens by kicking out corrupt leaders and turning Gardez into a model of good government , according to interviews with US officials who worked in Gardez .
The new Commander Mike kept up relations with Mujahid and Ziauddin for a time .
In February 2003 , Mujahid arrested a suspect he handed over to special forces .
The suspect was later sent to Guantanamo Bay .
But at the same time , Commander Mike was quietly working to banish Mujahid and Ziauddin from Gardez , according to former and current Afghan and UN officials who met with him frequently in security coordination meetings .
Zaland said Commander Mike was responsible for the arrests of Ziauddin , Mujahid , and Hafizullah Shabaz Khail , a district officer of neighboring Zurmat .
Khail , who was also sent to Guantanamo Bay , met an American named Mike at the Spindak Hotel for several days of talks shortly before his arrest , according to military transcripts of Khail 's testimony .
" Mike was the guy who followed all the cases , " said Zaland , the former military translator , adding that the Americans had lost patience with their former allies .
" During the Shaikot operation , Ziauddin and Mujahid helped the coalition forces a lot .
But they were just negative - minded .
They were illiterate , from the smallest tribe .
They did n't have any background in the military or police . "
The relationship sours A key turning point came early in 2003 , when General Dan K. McNeill -- now head of NATO 's force in Afghanistan -- traveled to Gardez and met with Mujahid and Ziauddin to ask them to remove their fighters from two strategic hilltops that overlooked the town , according to Ziauddin and Zaland , the translator .
Ziauddin said he and Mujahid resisted and complained to their friends in the Afghan Ministry of Defense about the orders , saying that their enemies -- Pacha Khan Zadran and Al Qaeda -- would come in over the hills .
US forces eventually bombed Ziauddin 's arms caches on the hills , but did not arrest him until many months later .
Over time , US forces came to suspect Ziauddin and Mujahid of launching rockets at the new US Provincial Reconstruction Team base , according to interviews with US soldiers and Afghan officials who served in Gardez at the time .
Relations between Mujahid and the special forces deteriorated further in March 2003 .
US soldiers in Gardez had severely beaten a group of Afghan prisoners during an interrogation , and one of them had died , according to several former Afghan police and a report by the Afghan attorney general 's office , which investigated the case .
The second Commander Mike ordered that the seven living prisoners be transferred to Mujahid 's jail , according to the attorney general 's report and Raz Mohammad Dalili , the Afghan governor at the time who helped make the arrangements for the transfers .
At a joint security meeting , Commander Mike threatened to kill Mujahid if he released the prisoners , according to the Crimes of War Project , a Washington human rights group that investigated the alleged abuse .
The Americans who dropped off the prisoners spoke briefly to Mujahid in his office behind a closed door and then drove away , said Mehboob Ahmad , Mujahid 's personal driver .
Some of the prisoners were unconscious , and their bodies had turned black and blue , Ahmad said .
Mujahid ordered that they be given medical treatment and mattresses , Ahmad said .
" Mujahid was upset .
We all were , " he said .
" I think anyone who would have seen them in that condition would be upset . "
Mujahid described the prisoners ' injuries to Afghan military prosecutors , who later wrote a report recommending that the American soldiers be punished .
In January of this year , two special forces soldiers received administrative punishments in connection with the prisoners ' treatment .
Major James
Gregory , a spokesman , said at the time that the special forces command " takes all allegations of abuse seriously . "
Weeks after the prisoners were dropped off at Mujahid 's jail , the Afghan government decided to remove Mujahid from his post .
Dalili , the governor , said in a recent interview in Kabul that the second Commander Mike helped persuade him -- and Afghanistan 's central government -- to replace Mujahid with a professionally trained police chief .
Initially , Mujahid refused to allow the new chief into the town .
But after negotiations -- and after Mujahid was offered a job as " highway commander " in Kabul -- he stepped down in an elaborate ceremony .
Around this time , Commander Mike called Mujahid to his office and advised him to leave Gardez , warning that he was at risk of being sent to Guantanamo Bay if he remained , said Ahmad , who drove Mujahid to that meeting .
Ruttig also recalled that Mujahid was told that he would be arrested if he stayed in Gardez .
Mujahid left Gardez for Kabul .
He stayed a month , waiting for a letter of appointment for the new job , but it never came .
While he was away , US forces were ambushed near an abandoned police checkpoint near Gardez , killing one soldier and injuring two others .
Mujahid was held responsible for the attack because US forces believed that it had been carried out by one of his supporters as revenge for his removal from his post , Zaland said .
In July 2003 , Mujahid returned to Gardez to attend a wedding .
Days later , American forces arrived at his home and asked him to come to a meeting .
He went willingly , but never returned .
Months later , employees from the Red Cross in Kabul handed Mujahid 's family a letter he had sent to them from Guantanamo Bay .
Mujahid 's deputy at the police station , Fazel Ahmad Wasiq -- who today runs the US - assisted police training center in Gardez -- said it was a good thing for the town to get a new police chief .
But he insists that Mujahid did not deserve to be sent to Guantanamo Bay .
After Mujahid 's arrest , Wasiq said he visited Commander Mike and asked for an explanation .
" I said , ' You were so friendly with him .
He was a good guy .
Why did you arrest him ? ' " recalled Wasiq .
The only explanation Mike gave , he said , was : " ' We were ordered to do it by higher - ups . ' " From chief to combatant Six days after Mujahid 's arrest , the Americans arrested Ahmad , his driver .
Ahmad said they stripped him naked and at one point held him upside down for more than 10 hours during questioning .
They asked him whether Mujahid had secretly hoarded weapons while he was police chief , he said .
Six days after Mujahid 's arrest , the Americans arrested Ahmad , his driver .
Ahmad said they stripped him naked and at one point held him upside down for more than 10 hours during questioning .
They asked him whether Mujahid had secretly hoarded weapons while he was police chief , he said .
" I replied that he has handed over all the weapons and kept not even a bullet , " said Ahmad .
US soldiers also arrested Syed Nabi Siddiqui , a police colonel who had served under Mujahid and had stayed on to work with the new chief .
Siddiqui said soldiers beat him , photographed him naked , and kept him in a cage while they questioned him .
" The American forces asked : ' Who is Mujahid ?
Is he a criminal ?
Did he kill somebody ? ' " Siddiqui said .
" I replied that Mujahid is preventing the thieves from coming in the town . "
Siddiqui said he also told them that -- decades ago -- Mujahid had been a member of Harakat - e- Mulavi , an Afghan group that fought the Russian invasion in the 1980s that is now believed to have ties to extremists .
That allegation surfaced in Mujahid 's file at Guantanamo Bay .
Both Ahmad and Siddiqui were released from US custody with a slip of paper that said they had been determined not to be a threat .
They have both joined a lawsuit against former defense secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld protesting their treatment .
The Army 's Criminal Investigation Command investigated their cases and found no evidence that they were abused , said Chris Grey , a spokesman .
For months , Ziauddin avoided arrest by staying in Kabul , where his allies gave him a job at the Ministry of Defense .
But he returned to Gardez in fall 2003 , sparking swift complaints from Afghan officials who accused him of extortion and threats .
Within days of his return , US forces arrested him and detained him at Bagram Air Force Base for about a year .
He is currently unemployed , but free .
Four years after his arrest , Mujahid still sits in Guantanamo Bay .
In 2004 , he was told he could call witnesses from Afghanistan to try to prove that he is not an " enemy combatant . "
But officers later told him none of his witnesses could be found -- even Afghanistan 's interior minister .
The accusations against Mujahid were not drawn up by the special forces soldiers who knew him in Gardez .
The Pentagon hired emergency workers with two weeks ' training to search through intelligence reports to create the files against the detainees , according to an affidavit by Rear Admiral James M. McGarrah , a top Pentagon official .
The first file , drawn up in 2004 , accused Mujahid of membership in Harakat - e- Mulavi , the extremist group that fought the Russians .
But a year later , all mention of Harakat disappeared , replaced by a new allegation : that he was a senior leader of Lashkar - e - Taiba , a militant group based in Lahore , Pakistan , that conducts terrorist operations in India - held Kashmir .
Mujahid was stunned .
" It seems you have confused me for someone else , " he said in 2005 , at the one review hearing before US military officers that he receives each year .
Mujahid 's lawyers investigated the allegation .
A Google search turned up a clue : A man named Abdullah Mujahid was indeed believed to be a senior leader of Lashkar - e - Taiba .
But that man had been killed in November 2006 .
Mujahid 's lawyers planned to highlight the apparent mistake .
But this past February , they received an e-mail from Pentagon officials , telling them Mujahid had been cleared to return to Afghanistan .
Yet , six months have gone by and he languishes in his solitary cell .
Gordon , the Pentagon spokesman , said the US government is working closely with Afghan officials to transfer detainees such as Mujahid home .
Five Afghan detainees were sent home last week , but Mujahid was not one of them .
His friends in Afghanistan , along with his lawyers and human rights workers , maintain that his presence at Guantanamo Bay is a misuse of the powers claimed by the president to hold terrorism suspects -- defined by Rumsfeld as " the worst of the worst . "
" Here we have a man who , by many accounts , was helping the United States , and fought against the Taliban , and we have evidence to demonstrate that , " said Welshhans , his lawyer .
To indefinitely imprison anyone without a trial , let alone someone like that , is unconscionable . "
When -- or if -- Mujahid makes it home , he will find that much has changed .
His father has died .
His children , ages 7 , 6 , and 5 , have grown up without him .
The town has grown , too .
Wasiq , his former deputy and friend , now runs a new police training facility .
His successor -- the professionally trained police chief -- was fired after allegations of corruption .
His sworn enemy , Pacha Khan Zadran , is now a member of Parliament .
But a few things have not changed , according to the people of Gardez : Americans who use only their first names still broker deals , make arrests , and detain people across the restive countrywide .
The insurgency they are fighting rages on .

On the eve of World War II , soldiers in Polish uniform stormed a radio station at Gleiwitz , just inside the German border with Poland .
Shocked listeners heard shots echo over the airwaves , then Polish voices proclaiming the hour had come to invade Germany .
It was August 31 , 1939 .
Here was the immediate pretext for " retaliation " , Hitler 's invasion of Poland , which began a few hours later .
The Nazis had started their assault in the spirit of absolute ruthlessness which was to characterise everything which they did thereafter to the Polish people .
The " Polish " soldiers responsible for the Gleiwitz attack were actually SS troops commanded by Sturmbannfuhrer Alfred Naujocks .
Scroll down for more ...
The radio station charade was devised by Himmler 's - lieutenant Reinhard Heydrich , who even supplied a " Polish " corpse ( in reality a concentration camp prisoner ) shown to neutral correspondents .
In the six years that followed , more than six million Poles died , 15 times Britain 's wartime losses , from a nation of only 35 million .
Poland suffered a tragedy rendered all the more terrible because the Russians joined the Germans in the great killing , and continued it long after Hitler was dead .
Today , it is hard to say which country commands a deeper historic hate among Poles - Germany or Russia .
The wounds which caused Thursday 's astonishing eruption at the EU Summit by Polish prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski are still at the heart of Poland almost 70 years later .
Kaczynski caused uproar by accusing Germany of " incomprehensible crimes " against his nation .
He spoke of events which still dominate the folk memory of every Pole .
The German troops which poured through Poland in September 1939 swept aside the gallant but hopelessly outgunned defenders , with their ancient aircraft and horsed cavalry .
Hitler 's intention from the outset was to incorporate a large part of Poland , which contained a German - speaking minority , into the Third Reich .
In the wake of the Panzer spearheads , German troops started readying these Poles , some 9.5 million of them , for their place in Greater Germany .
In the first weeks , 531 towns and villages were systematically burned .
Some 16,376 people were executed , most of them prominent citizens or intellectuals .
All traces of Polish culture were obliterated .
Universities and schools were closed , libraries levelled , national monuments destroyed .
The playing of music by Polish composers was banned .
A million people deemed unfit to become citizens of the new part of Germany were stripped of their homes and possessions and herded eastwards , to survive however they might - thousands died as starving refugees .
Meanwhile , Nazi bombers and tanks completed the capture of most of the country .
Jadwiga Soskowska , a nurse at Warsaw 's main hospital , described the city 's confrontation with blitzkrieg : " The procession of wounded from the city was an unending march of death .
As the operating theatres and dressing stations were destroyed , the work was done in lecture rooms on ordinary deal tables , and owing to lack of water , the instruments had to be cleaned with alcohol .
" I shall remember for ever the dreadful night of September 25 when , with one hand , I helped to give anaesthetics , holding a candle in the other , while the surgeon amputated arms and legs .
Warsaw was burning .
We lost all sense of time .
" I saw a river of blood flowing down the corridor , washing the bodies of the dead , dying and still living martyrs .
Here lay a little girl beside an aged , whitehaired woman ; there a soldier beside an old workman .
Old and young , children and adults , men and women , all mercilessly murdered . "
The Poles ' ordeal at German hands was rendered vastly worse by the simultaneous invasion which began in the east .
By the terms of Stalin 's secret bargain with Hitler , Soviet troops stormed over the frontier to seize 77,000 square miles of territory allotted to Moscow .
In the wake of this occupation , every Polish officer and prominent citizen identified by the Russians was taken to the forest at Katyn .
There , some 7,000 were murdered by one of Stalin 's most experienced executioners , who shot each one himself with a bullet in the neck .
The first 4,000 bodies were found only in 1943 , by the Germans .
Further corpses are still being disinterred to this day .
In Nazi-occupied Poland , the Jewish population was herded into ghettoes in the major cities where they were held until their systematic annihilation began in 1942 .
The greatest extermination camps in Himmler 's empire were established on Polish soil at Auschwitz - Birkenau and Maidenek .
A host of ordinary Poles were conscripted for forced labour in the factories of Germany .
The remainder were reduced to a life of oppression and near - starvation , which continued through the years that followed .
A cavalry officer captured by the Germans , Colonel K. S. Rudnicki , asked his German escort where he and his companions were being taken .
" Have you heard about the Volga - Don canal ? " the soldier answered contemptuously .
" You 'll be sent there to dig .
After two years , if you 're still alive , your wife will join you and you 'll settle down and live there .
If you die , a band will play at your funeral . "
The response of Rudnicki , like many Polish soldiers , was to throw everything into passionate efforts to escape west and rejoin the armed struggle against the Germans , a quest in which he was eventually successful .
The first Poles to distinguish themselves in the struggle after the fall of their country were fighter pilots who reached Britain and began to fly with the RAF .
Some 154 Polish airmen took part in the Battle of Britain , of whom 30 were killed between the end of August and October 1940 .
Their record was extraordinary .
Men such as Czech - born Josef Frantisek ( who had joined the Polish Air Force ) , the most famous ace , were the despair of their British commanders and controllers .
They ignored all orders and simply hurled themselves at the Luftwaffe formations .
In the end , the British decided they had no alternative but to allow the Poles to fight their own way , which they did in two squadrons - 302 and 303 .
The memorial to 303 still stands at Northolt outside London , where its Hurricanes were based in 1940 .
Polish pilots claimed 203 German aircraft shot down during the Battle of Britain , an extraordinary record .
Around 20,000 Polish troops reached Britain , of whom the most senior was the hugely admired General Wladyslaw Sikorski , who later died in an air crash off Gibraltar .
These Poles formed a corps which fought with distinction in the British Army in North - west Europe .
A second corps was later created from Poles grudgingly released by the Russians through Iran .
Those men fought in Italy , most famously at Monte Cassino .
Their passion , of course , was to take part in the liberation of their own country .
At every turn , the Western Allies soothed and assured them that they would be able to do this .
Yet it proved their tragedy that while they played a noble part in the struggle against the Germans in Western Europe , great power politics would deny them the chance ever to return home .
Many of those rash enough to go back to Poland eventually perished at Russian hands , when Stalin gained control of their country .
Throughout the war , the Nazi lawyer Hans Frank , who served as governor of Poland , sustained a policy of repression and mass murder more ferocious than any which operated in France , Belgium and Holland .
The Polish people had been designated as sub-humans , of slave status .
They were thus deemed not to require education or leadership .
Racial testing centres were established to determine the suitability of children for Germanisation .
Several thousand Catholic priests were deported to the concentration camp at Dachau .
Some 100,000 people were removed from the port of Gdynia , which was renamed Gotenhafen .
German settlers from the Baltic states were imported to occupy Polish lands .
Food was rationed by racial categories , the Jews inevitably receiving least .
Resistance spread through Poland far more rapidly than in France .
Their leaders established radio contact with the Polish government - in - exile in London and laboured to sabotage the German railway network to the Russian front .
Partisan groups began to operate from the marshes and forests of the east , but they could not readily be armed , because the country lay so far from British air bases .
By 1943 , there were already acute tensions between the mass of Poles who gave their allegiance to London , aspiring to become a free post - war democratic nation , and those who became Communist stooges of Moscow .
One of Stalin 's earliest demands from the Western Allies was that Eastern Poland should be recognised as part of the Soviet Union , while the Poles would be compensated with land from Eastern Germany .
Nobody liked the deal , but Russian participation in the war against Hitler was thought essential .
London and Washington acceded to Stalin 's demand .
It was one of the great political betrayals of the war .
In August 1944 , with the Soviet armies storming westwards and the Germans in full retreat , the Polish " Home Army " of resisters under General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski launched its bravest and most reckless stroke - the Warsaw Rising .
Though feebly armed , and beyond reach of Allied supply , the Poles concluded that their only chance of escaping domination by the approaching Soviets was to liberate themselves .
Through more than two months which followed , they fought a heroic , doomed battle in the capital against Hitler 's SS .
On the first day , 98 men of the Resistance " Stag " battalion stormed one German position armed only with revolvers .
They succeeded in taking it , but only seven survived .
Large parts of the city were destroyed .
Governor of Poland Hans Frank reported to Hitler : " For the most part , Warsaw is in flames .
Burning down the houses is the most reliable means of liquidating the insurgents . "
A quarter of a million Poles died , almost all civilians .
The Russians , a few miles away across the Vistula , declined to hasten their advance to help them .
" The Soviet government do not wish to associate themselves directly or indirectly with the adventure in Warsaw , " a senior Soviet commissar coldly informed the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow .
The 1944 agony of Warsaw became the Western world 's most vivid memory of wartime Poland .
The combination of Polish suicidally courageous emotionalism , German savagery and Soviet ruthlessness set the seal on six years of slaughter and misery .
Polish behaviour was characterised by a heroic spirit of self - immolation which has displayed itself throughout the nation 's history .
The Soviets told General Bor-Komorowski that if the Red Army was to help , the Home Army must recognise Moscow 's Polish puppet government , along with Russia 's claim to eastern Poland , and declare publicly that the Katyn massacre was the work of Germans , not Russians .
The Polish proudly refused .
Their general signalled to London on August 26 : " Poland has not been fighting the Germans for five years , bearing the greatest losses , just to capitulate to Russia .
Our fight against the Germans has shown that we love freedom more than life " .
Here , indeed , reality matched rhetoric in the most terrible fashion .
When the surviving resisters capitulated on October 2 , 1944 , a Polish officer said bitterly to General Erich von dem Bach - Zelewski , the Nazi high priest at Poland 's sacrifice : " You , the nation which gave your Goethe and Schiller to the world , have tried through terror to take the rights of freedom and existence from us . "
The German shrugged : " This is war . "
Hitler knew that his armies could no longer hold Warsaw against the Russians .
Yet he ordered his engineers to conduct a last act of vengeance against the Poles whom he hated and despised .
Every major public building in Warsaw was systematically destroyed before the Germans evacuated the city .
A few weeks later , the Red Army occupied the rubble .
The Russians continued shooting " London Poles " - those who refused to give their allegiance to the new Communist regime which Moscow established - long after the end of World War II and the defeat of Hitler .
K. S. Rudnicki , the cavalry officer who by 1945 was a general commanding a Polish division in North - west Europe , told Montgomery that his men felt utterly betrayed .
The general died an exile in Britain , along with many other wartime Poles , the colours of whose regiments still hang in that tragic rendezvous of lost souls , the Polish Hearth Club in London .
He wrote in his old age : " We are still on the path of destiny , and I am deeply convinced that this path will lead us expatriate Poles back to a free Poland . "
His hopes have been triumphantly fulfilled long after his death , by the collapse of the Soviet Union , the coming of democracy and freedom to his country .
But the descendants of the wartime generation , who suffered so terribly at the hands of both Germans and Russians , never forget .
The Germans may today have become their partners in the European Union , but in the eyes of men such as Poland 's prime minister , they are still the architects of the nation 's 20th - century tragedy .
For all the courtesies of modern commerce and diplomacy , for years to come there will still be moments such as that which took place on Thursday , when old Polish passions break loose and history is hurled back in the face of the German people .
A Brisbane police officer will be tested for disease after a woman he was questioning allegedly wounded him in the groin with a used syringe .
The detective was questioning the woman at the criminal investigation branch at Fortitude Valley , in inner Brisbane , when she pulled the syringe from her pocket and threw it about 7.30 pm ( AEST ) yesterday , police said .
The officer suffered a puncture wound to his groin .

A recent radio commercial for Lexus says , “ What do people think when they see you driving a Lexus ?
For one thing , they see you as successful . ”
But do they really ?
Almost everybody leases their cars today .
So you do n’t need a lot of money to drive Lexus , BMW , or Mercedes .
One selling point of luxury brands has always been the notion that other people will think more of you when they see you buying and using the brand .
But does this still hold today ?
Anybody who has read The Millionaire Next Door Knows that most millionaires do n’t drive status cars .
FW , a wealthy client who made his fortune in equipment leasing , drove a nice - looking Oldsmobile , which he loved — even though he could have driven a BMW .
Do you think you are really fooling anyone by driving around in your leased luxury car ?
We drive a Nissan Maximia and Toyota Sienna mini-van — both bought new and paid for with cash .
To me , zero debt is a lot more impressive than big monthly lease , mortgage , and loan payments .
Should Lexus rewrite its copy to reflect today ’s market perception ?
Or are they still right on target with their assumptions about status ?

What Anita Roddick Taught Me About Marketing
Summer begins , officially , around June 21 .
Here at Wolfram Research it actually begins when the interns start to arrive .
As we released Version 6 of our flagship Mathematica software less than two months ago , we ’re still collectively exhaling , yet at the same time breathing in hard to keep up with these youthful , faster folk .
No easy feat , unless you happen to be a trumpet player .
A summer here at our headquarters in Champaign , Illinois , can find anywhere from 5 to 25 or so interns .
They range in level from late high school to graduate school , as young as 15 and as old as 40 - something .
And we ’re always on the hunt for new ones ( apply on our website if interested ) .
Where do they come from ?
I believe our interns have hailed from all six naturally inhabited continents , as well as several major island groups .
Most are now residing in North America for their studies , though some have traveled from farther away .
What do we do with these interns ?
Well , by law , we can not eat them ( even if we could manage to catch one ) .
Instead we find it useful to put them to work on a variety of tasks , based on individual educational background and experience .
For example : this summer we have some interns writing interactive Demonstrations for our new Wolfram Demonstrations Project ( a powerful and popular way to illustrate , with dynamic controls , concepts from physics , math , engineering and elsewhere ) .
Another intern works on graphics and computational geometry .
Still another is coding possible improvements to Mathematica ’s built - in capabilities for indefinite integration .
We have some working on projects related to A New Kind of Science , some in business development , some assisting in the library and other parts of the Communications group .
One works in Quality Assurance — helping find our mistakes before they escape the lab .
Past years have seen interns ’ work go out the door , so to speak , in important aspects of Mathematica functionality such as optimization , statistics and computational geometry .
Other projects have improved our in - house systems from editing and formatting The Mathematica Journal articles to design work to administration of the hardware we all rely upon for our collective professional existence .
What becomes of these fine , mostly young , energetic people ?
Well , one went on to become Sergey Brin , Co-Founder & President of Technology at Google .
Okay , that ’s a fib ; actually , he already was Sergey Brin .
But back in 1990 nobody ( except maybe he himself ) had an inkling of his meteoric rise to come .
Others we cannot seem to let go so easily : three permanent members of our Kernel Development group began their careers here as summer interns .
So that ’s the run-down on summer interns at Wolfram Research .
The pace is brisk , but they seem to handle it without whining audibly .
That , or my ears are going soft .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A six - week probe into the mistaken flight of nuclear warheads across the country uncovered a " lackadaisical " attention to detail in day - to - day operations at the air bases involved in the incident , an Air Force official said Friday .
Air Force Col .
Bruce Emig was stripped of his responsibilities , sources say .
The investigation found that " a limited number of airmen " at both locations failed to follow procedures , said Maj .
Gen. Dick Newton , assistant deputy chief of staff for operations .
Four officers -- including three colonels -- have been relieved of duty in connection with the August 29 incident in which a B - 52 bomber flew from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana .
The plane unknowingly carried a payload of nuclear - tipped cruise missiles .
" Nothing like this has ever occurred , " Newton said .
" Our extensive , six - week investigation found that this was an isolated incident and that the weapons never left the custody of airmen -- were never unsecured -- but clearly this incident is unacceptable to the people of the United States and to the United States Air Force . "
The probe also found there was " an erosion of adherence to weapons - handling standards at Minot Air Force Base and at Barksdale Air Force Base , " Newton said .
" We have acted quickly and decisively to rectify this , " he added .
Do n't Miss Air Force investigates mistaken transport of nuclear warheads
Relieved of duty were the Minot wing commander and maintenance crew commander , and the Barksdale operational group commander .
Minot 's munitions squadron commander was relieved of duty shortly after the incident .
Newton did n't name any of the officers , but Col. Bruce Emig had been the commander of the 5th Bomb Wing at Minot .
A number of other personnel -- " under 100 , " Newton said , including the entire 5th Bomb Wing at Minot -- have lost their certification to handle sensitive weaponry .
The matter will be referred to an Air Force convening authority to find out whether there 's enough evidence to bring charges or any other disciplinary action against any personnel , Newton said .
Air Force Secretary Michael
Wynne called the incident " an unacceptable mistake and a clear deviation for our exacting standards . "
Watch Wynne talk about the breakdown in procedures »
" We are making all appropriate changes to ensure that this has a minimal chance of happening again , but we would really like to ensure that it never happens again , " he said .
Wynne has convened a blue - ribbon panel to review all of the Air Force 's security procedures and adherence to them .
That panel is to report back on January 15 .
The probe into the incident , which ended this week , lists five errors -- all of them procedural failures to check , verify and inspect , Newton said .
The investigation found that nuclear warheads were improperly handled and procedures were not followed as the missiles were moved from their storage facility , transferred to the bomber and loaded onto it , Newton said .
The bomber carried six nuclear warheads on air - launched cruise missiles , but the warheads should have been removed from the missiles before they were attached to the B - 52 .
A munitions crew at Barksdale followed proper procedure when the plane landed , discovering the error and reporting it up the chain of command , Newton said .
The weapons were secured in the hands of airmen at all times and had been stored properly at Minot , Newton said .
He called it a " lack of attention to detail , a lack of effective leadership and supervision . "
" Airmen did not do their jobs ... that would have prevented this incident from occurring , " he said .

While those above were victims of the tactics of the Drug War , there are many others who lost their lives as a result of this war .
WASHINGTON , May 16 — Scientists working with the Defense Department have found evidence that a low - level exposure to sarin nerve gas — the kind experienced by more than 100,000 American troops in the Persian Gulf war of 1991 — could have caused lasting brain deficits in former service members .
Though the results are preliminary , the study is notable for being financed by the federal government and for being the first to make use of a detailed analysis of sarin exposure performed by the Pentagon , based on wind patterns and plume size .
The report , to be published in the June issue of the journal NeuroToxicology , found apparent changes in the brain ’s connective tissue — its so - called white matter — in soldiers exposed to the gas .
The extent of the brain changes — less white matter and slightly larger brain cavities — corresponded to the extent of exposure , the study found .
Previous studies had suggested that exposure affected the brain in some neural regions , but the evidence was not convincing to many scientists .
The new report is likely to revive the long - debated question of why so many troops returned from that war with unexplained physical problems .
Many in the scientific community have questioned whether the so - called gulf war illnesses have a physiological basis , and far more research will have to be done before it is known whether those illnesses can be traced to exposure to sarin .
The long - term effects of sarin on the brain are still not well understood .
Switching From OS X to Ubuntu : 10 Things I Miss
About 2 years ago , I stopped using Windows on my main computers at work and home .
I switched to a Mac Mini , then to a Macbook , for all of my daily work , web design , programming , photo organizing , etc .
We also have a large install base of Ubuntu Linux machines and a few Windows 2000 boxes at work , so I did n’t use OS X exclusively , just whenever possible .
Then , about two months ago , I switched to using a new Dell with Ubuntu Linux at work .
For the most part , I could n’t be happier , but there are a few things I really miss about my Mac .
Here ’s a list of the 10 things I miss the most .
If you know of replacements for any of these under Ubuntu , please leave a comment and share your solution .
1. Dashboard
2. Quicksilver
I ’ve only scratched the surface of what Quicksilver can do , but I can’t find anything on Ubuntu that does these tasks quite as well .
I ’ve tried Deskbar but find it slow and annoying .
Is there something out there that compares with Quicksilver on Ubuntu ?
3. Adium
When Using GAIM on Ubuntu 7.04 , I feel like I ’ve stepped back 5 years .
GAIM under Ubuntu is clunky and rather ugly .
It ’s also much more difficult to see when new messages arrive because there is no notification system similar to Aduim ’s Growl based notices .
The version of Pidgin shipping with the Ubuntu 7.10 looks more promising , hopefully it is more polished and fun to use .
4. Professional Graphics Software
5. TextMate
The Free Man's TextMate : Gvim + Nautilus The Free Man's TextMate : Gvim +
Nautilus
On Ubuntu , I ’m using a combination of Gvim and Nautilus to replace TextMate .
Gvim is fine , but I ’m not yet a Vim expert and the lack of a good integrated file browser really bothers me .
I think I ’ll get over this one pretty soon .
6. Dictionary
On Ubuntu , there is a dictionary application , but it can only look up words in free dictionaries ( results and quality vary ) .
This means that you must be online to look up a word , which is kind of a bummer .
There are some cool features like multi-language dictionaries , but the quality often leaves much to be desired .
Is there a really great dictionary app for Linux ?
7. Quicktime
Playing your favorite media files on Ubuntu is not a great experience .
Sure , if you hunt around the web enough , you find instructions on how to make just about any media file play in Linux , but the results are usually buggy .
I often find it possible to play a file but not possible to fast forward or rewind without the player crashing .
I miss Quicktime and its simplicity .
8. Bluetooth Support and Syncing
While I was able to get rudimentary file transfers working with the Bluetooth module in my Dell N1420 , it was not easy .
Syncing contacts and calendars also seems to be impossible .
Much work could be done to improve the Bluetooth experience in Ubuntu .
9 . System - wide spell checking
Of course there is spell checking in almost every Ubuntu application , but each one has its own system .
You need to train the dictionaries for each app and get used to each system ’s little quirks .
Hopefully , someone out there is working on a system - wide spell checking framework for Linux .
10 . Smart Trackpad
After using a Macbook for over a year , the trackpad included with my Dell Ubuntu system seems horrible .
First of all , the scrolling feature of the trackpad does n’t work at all .
What ’s even worse is the lack of a setting ( that I can find ) to make the trackpad ignore accidental taps .
I ’m constantly having the cursor jump to another spot on the screen because I accidentally tapped the trackpad with my palm while typing .
I ’m really hoping that Ubuntu 7.10 addresses some of these issues .
Overall , I have to say that I ’m very happy with using Ubuntu .
These are just a few little things that really bug me about my Dell Ubuntu notebook .
With a little patients , I ’m sure most of these issues will be solved .
There are also a lot of things I love about Ubuntu that I miss when I use OS X , maybe I ’ll share those in my next post .
The evolution of Cookie Monster .
Image As seen in / Year Notes
IBM training film " Coffee Break Machine " and
The Ed Sullivan Show
( 1967 ) The monster retains his teeth and his fur is dark green with a few brown - black patches .
Munchos commercials
( 1969 ) Arnold , a smaller , younger - looking version of the Wheel Stealer puppet , is created for commercials for Munchos .
The puppet has lost its teeth and has light purple fur , appearing closer to the Cookie Monster that will debut on Sesame Street .
Sesame Street
Season 1 - early Season 2
( 1969 - 1971 ) Back to his normal size and gaining his trademark blue fur , the monster puppet becomes Cookie Monster during the first season of Sesame Street .
This puppet is loose and floppy , giving him much more expressiveness , and has scruffier fur .
Years later , the puppet would be repurposed as Apple Monster .
Sesame Street
Season 14
( 1982 -1984 ) Cookie is rebuilt with a similar design as the former puppet and with brighter blue shag fur .
Sesame Street
( 1984-2016 )
Two subtly different Cookie Monster puppets have been used interchangeably since the 1980s : One puppet ( pictured at top ) first appeared in season 16 and has a larger , wider mouth ; the other ( bottom ) , which appeared in Follow That Bird and thereafter , has a smaller , more curved mouth .
Overall , Cookie 's googly pupils have shrunk , and his fur is fluffier and lighter in color .
An example of the use of both Cookie Monsters is Monsterpiece Theater : Twin Beaks , with one puppet for the Alistair Cookie scenes and the other for the storyline 's " Agent Cookie . "
The Furchester Hotel
( 2014 - present ) A new Cookie puppet with a more circular mouth and longer , frizzier fur first appears in episodes of The Furchester Hotel .
The puppet is used more regularly starting with season 46 of Sesame Street .

Fourteen Congress Members for Impeachment
By David Swanson
The official count of cosponsors , including Kucinich , is at 10 .
But Rep. Jim McDermott spoke on the floor of the House last week and committed to signing on .
That makes 11 .
Congressmen Bob Filner ( D - CA ) and Jim Moran ( D - VA ) now also say that they are signing on .
That ’s 13 .
And Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. has spoken out in support of impeachment .
He is clearly either signing on or introducing his own articles of impeachment or both .
That makes probably 14 .

NEW YORK – I 'm sitting in a tiny post - production studio in lower Manhattan , watching a scene from the upcoming film , Winter of Frozen Dreams .
A menacing bass line throbs away beneath the soundtrack –- this is a murder story , after all – but something 's wrong :
The bass is so boomy that my head feels as if it 's going to explode .
Then , composer Mark Garcia crawls underneath the console and plugs in something that looks like a small loudspeaker .
The bass line instantly recedes into the background where it belongs .
Garcia has just powered up an E - Trap , the world 's first electronic bass trap .
Once turned on , it invisibly massages the studio's funky acoustics , eliminating the low - frequency pressure wave that threatened to blow my head off .
" It gives you the ability to sit anywhere in the room and hear exactly what you 'd hear at the center , at the sweet spot , " Garcia said .
Tiny little studios like this one are popping up all over the world , thanks to new technology and ever - increasing rents in cultural capitals like New York , London and Tokyo .
As digital equipment becomes more compact , studios can fit into ever - smaller locations .
Located in the heart of Manhattan 's independent - movie industry on West 14th Street , the miniscule Ovasen Music & Tandem Sound studio is crammed into just 800 square feet – which costs $ 15,000 a month to rent .
The studio was built by the Walters - Storyk Design Group , which builds approximately 40 studios a year from Bogota to the Bronx .
While most of these studios would once have been several times the size of Tandem Sound , up to 80 percent are now " small , compact and in strange places , " says co-founder John Storyk , the architect who built Jimi Hendrix 's Electric Lady Studios in 1970 .
That facility in a former nightclub in Greenwich Village occupied 6,000 feet – nearly eight times the size of the newest studio a few blocks away .
To compete with bigger studios , Garcia and his partner , Eric Offin , had to shoehorn two mixing rooms , a voice - over / foley room and a machine closet packed with digital - processing equipment into the conference - room - sized apartment .
They even found space for a marble - tiled bathroom and a kitchen - cum - screening room equipped with both a Sub - Zero fridge and a giant flat - panel monitor .
" I figured we 're competing against places that are palaces , so we had to cram perks into every square inch of this place , " Garcia said .
Compression comes at a cost , however .
As sound waves bounce back and forth between the walls of a room , certain frequencies are naturally reinforced at particular locations .
In a small space , these resonance modes can result in massive bass buildup and radically different listening experiences around the room .
Traditionally , studio designers have fixed such problems with " bass traps , " absorptive panels or resonating chambers that dampen the troublesome frequencies .
But adding ordinary bass traps to Garcia and Offin 's mixing rooms would have meant further reducing spaces that were already excruciatingly tight .
" The thinnest one you can get is 5 or 6 inches thick .
We did n't have it , " Storyk said .
Enter the $ 1,600 E - Trap to muffle bouncing sound waves .
The device is built around a 10 - inch loudspeaker , two built - in microphones , tuning circuitry and frequency - measurement software .
By flooding a space with pink noise and analyzing the frequency response , you can " tune " the E - Trap to cancel two different offending frequencies in the 20 - to 65 - Hz range .
Storyk used two in each studio for even - better coverage .
The result is pristine sound no matter where you happen to be seated .
But do n't assume you 'll be able to install one of these in your living room any time soon .
It took an experienced technician most of a day to tune the E - Traps at Tandem Sound properly , and Storyk admits that he himself would n't have been able to do it at all .
" They would be great in home theaters , but they 're not for self - installation , " Storyk said .
" You would n't even know where to start . "
Atheist Revolution recently picked up on a stunning poll result described in The Nation :
… a more recent and more nuanced Financial Times / Harris poll of Europeans and Americans that allowed respondents to declare agnosticism as well as atheism : 18 percent of the more than 2,000 American respondents chose one or the other , while 73 percent affirmed belief in God or a supreme being .
A more general issue affects American surveys on religious beliefs , namely , the “ social desirability effect , ” in which respondents are reluctant to give an unpopular answer in a society in which being religious is the norm .
What happens when questions are framed to overcome this distortion ?
The FT / H poll tried to counteract it by allowing space not only for the customary “ Not sure ” but also for “ Would prefer not to say ” — and 6 percent of Americans chose this as their answer to the question of whether they believed in God or a supreme being .
Add to this those who declared themselves as atheists or agnostics and , lo and behold , the possible sum of unbelievers is nearly one in four Americans .
One in four Americans !
If this poll result is accurate , atheists and agnostics would be the largest single group by religious affiliation in America , equalled only by Roman Catholics .
Although nonbelievers do not all have the same political aims or operate as a monolithic group , if we could harness even some of these numbers in the cause of church - state activism and freethought evangelism , we would be a force to be reckoned with .
An enormous amount of good could be done if the freethought constituency could take a strong , public stand for nonbelief and rally behind principled politicians who would defend secularism in government .
With such numbers , we could face down obnoxious religious leaders and compete with them directly on their own terms .
Granted , this result is probably something of an outlier .
Most polls , including a Pew study from 2004 , find that the percentage of Americans who are atheist , agnostic or otherwise secular or non-religious Americans is around 15 % .
This result has been reproduced by numerous studies , including the major 2001 ARIS study and a more recent survey from March of this year , so we can trust that it is mostly accurate .
However , if this poll is an outlier , it is one on the leading edge .
Surveys have also shown that the number of secular and nonreligious Americans is increasing with each generation .
And given that the Harris poll tried to compensate for the social desirability effect by explicitly listing “ Would prefer not to say ” as an answer , it may well show that other surveys have underestimated the number of secular Americans .
This fact further underscores why atheists need to speak out .
Given the strong prejudice against atheism that still exists in many places , it is extremely probable that a significant number of nonbelievers are still in the closet , reluctant to declare themselves even to pollsters .
By doing this , they give the impression that the religious are more numerous and influential than they actually are .
But we who are already “ out ” can counteract this by speaking out strongly in favor of atheism , which will widen the realm of discourse and stake out a space in which others will feel more comfortable announcing their own convictions .
This result also highlights the irrelevancy of those who say that atheists should keep quiet and not criticize religion , lest we antagonize the believing majority .
This claim is born of fear and contradicted by reality .
If we act as if we ’re afraid to offend the holders of irrational beliefs , we will only further embolden the virulent fundamentalists and send closeted atheists the message that they should stay hidden and keep their heads down .
Conversely , by taking a strong stand for atheism , we will send the message that we cannot be intimidated , which will encourage yet more hidden nonbelievers to step forward .
In addition , it will expose people who are religious only by default to a different view , and may well sway them if the case we present is passionate and well reasoned .
So therefore , let us voice our convictions , the more strongly the better .
It is better to have too much criticism of religion than too little , and if we refuse to be silenced , that 25 % figure may be a herald of things to come .
This bill is coming up for another vote .
This bill is ridiculous !!
All crimes are " hate " crimes !
This is just another way to steal your freedoms as a thief in the night .
To label something a " hate crime " is giving government another way to become thought police .
Hate is an emotion : Def. : hate- the emotion of hate ; a feeling of dislike so strong that it demands action .
Emotion !
So now we are so willing to let them dictate our emotions ?
Do n't be fooled by their rhetoric .
We have enough laws regarding the crimes committed by bigots and the like acting on ignorance !!
Pretty soon , if the bill passes , it will be a so called " hate crime " to speak out against the tyranny of government !
So just because you hate what an administration is doing your committing a crime ?
Well that 's exactly what they will do with this thought / emotion crime bill !
They will use it against you in ways you did n't intend because of the loopholes in the system which allows them to attach something like this bill to anything they perceive a threat .
They keep trying to put this bill through every time the Stalinesque media puts another of these heinous racial crimes on the box .
They happen every day .
It 's evil and wrong , yes , but we have enough laws to govern these crimes .
They only inundate you with them on T.V. so they desensitize you to the fact that this kind of power over emotion is not needed .
In your outrage they want you to think this is a needed bill , when in fact it is just the doorway to control your thoughts and emotions !!!
WAKE UP EWE !!
THOUGHT POLICE ARE ON THE WAY !!!!
Check out my new article on this published Sept.27
Hate crimes bill " piggy - backed " on defense authorization bill : Welcome Thought Police !!
Okay folks , this oneâ€™s simple : Among Shia in Iraq , the U.S. backs the same folks as the Iranians do : The Daâ€™wa Party and the Supreme Islamic Council .
The Shiâ€™ites who are fighting our guys are nationalists , and so are somewhat down with the Sunni Arab nationalists and opposed to Iran .
Enter Michael R. Gordon of the New York Times , who keeps pushing ( without providing evidence ) the Vice - Presidentâ€™s propaganda that the new , improved EFP bombs must be coming from Iran .
For those who listen to Antiwar Radio , you know I refute this lie every single day , citing CSM and Reutersâ€™ reports that an EFP factory was found in Iraq in April by troops during â€ œOperation Black Eagle , â€ according to Army Spokesman Lt. Col Scott Bleichwehl .
Journalist Gareth Porter , whom I often interview , has written extensively on this matter .
Andrew Cockburn took an axe to the lies in this Los Angeles Times article back in February .
NBC News and Wired have also run articles casting doubt on the alleged Iranian origin of the bombs .
Allisa J. Rubin in the New York Times discusses the discovery of an EFP factory in Iraq ( Shhhh ! Donâ€™t tell Michael R. Gordonâ€™s editor ! ) and even the Wall Street Journal has spoken truth to the propaganda .
And so why is this such a big deal ?
Well , because Dick Cheney is trying to start a war with Iran and since the president has admitted that Iran does not have a nuclear weapons program , the War Party has had to switch gears .
Now the excuse for bombing Iran is that they are bombing our guys in Iraq .
The proof ?
Itâ€™s right there , even in the New York Times .
Update : Philip Giraldi debunked Cheney - Gordon ’s claims too .

How Dogs Work - Seizure Alert Dogs
Guide dogs are one of the most often thought of types of assistance dogs , but recently dogs have been trained to lend a helping hand in all different types of situations .
Some dogs have an uncanny ability to predict seizures , resulting in a type of assistance dog that is a constant companion to people with epilepsy and other brain disorders , or even those who have suffered head or brain trauma .
Seizure alert dogs are a unique kind of assistance dog in that how they do what they do is n't necessary trained ; there is no preferred breed , no way to encourage dogs to develop their abilities .
There are also a wide range of behaviors that these dogs demonstrate while doing their job .
Some seizure dogs will alert their companions to an impending seizure by licking their face or hands , by laying down at their feet , or even by staring or whining .
Dogs usually show potential as puppies without necessarily being trained , but by instead being exposed to individuals who suffer from seizures .
In many cases , people who suffer from seizures find their dogs alerting them to the upcoming episode without even being trained for it or being shown what to do .
So how do they know ?
The jury is still out on this one , but there are several theories .
Dogs are incredibly sensitive to the most minute changes in human behavior .
Much of what a dog infers is from body language and facial cues , and some trainers and medical professionals think that dogs are picking up on the most miniscule of changes in the brain as they are reflected in a person 's behavior right before a seizure .
Another theory suggest that a dog's incredible sense of smell allows them to detect changes in a person 's scent .
Seizure disorders can impact the brain 's chemistry , and it 's entirely possible that this disruption in brain chemistry manufactures itself in the release of a certain scent that we 're unable to process , but a dog can .
Once the dog associates that smell with a seizure , they 're aware of what 's coming .
No one knows exactly how seizure dogs are able to detect seizures , but it 's inarguable that they can do it .
Medical professionals have seen the benefits of dogs that are formally and informally trained , and have seen the health and safety benefits of these companions .
Not all dogs will and some are better than others , knowing as much as an hour before the seizure is triggered that it 's coming .
It 's also been found that the longer a dog is with his companion , the stronger the bond and the better the dog is able to detect whatever changes alerts him to the upcoming seizure ; just one more thing that shows the strength of the connection between a dog and his human companion .

JamVM
Latest version is JamVM 2.0.0 , released on 30th July 2014 .
See the release notes for the changes since 1.5.4 .
JamVM is an open - source Java Virtual Machine that aims to support the latest version of the JVM specification , while at the same time being compact and easy to understand .
You can download the latest release of JamVM from the download area or have a look at the project summary page .
This contains links to the public forums and facilities for bug reporting and feature requests .
I welcome feedback of any kind , e.g. bug reports , suggestions , etc .
I 'm always interested to hear how and if people are using JamVM so even if you do n't have a problem drop me an email ( email address at the bottom ) .
Class Libraries
JamVM must be used in conjunction with a Java class - library to make a full Java Runtime Environment .
Compatible class - libraries are GNU Classpath or the class - library from OpenJDK .
GNU Classpath
GNU Classpath is a community - driven reimplementation of the Java class - libraries .
For many years it was the only library supported by JamVM .
Since the open - sourcing of Java , development of GNU Classpath has slowed but it is still active and maintained .
The latest release is 0.99 , released on 16th March 2012 .
When configured for GNU Classpath , JamVM provides a shared library ( libjvm.so ) for use with the JNI Invocation API , and a standalone executable ( jamvm ) to run Java programs .
GNU Classpath is mostly Java 1.5 compliant , with some APIs from Java 1.6 .
Although JamVM supports Java 7 and Java 8 , these features are disabled when used with GNU Classpath .
GNU Classpath , however , is much smaller than OpenJDK , which makes it suitable for embedded systems .
By default , if no class - library is specified when configuring JamVM , JamVM is built to use GNU Classpath .
OpenJDK / IcedTea
OpenJDK is the official open - source implementation of the JDK resulting from the open - sourcing of Java in 2007 .
It consists of a class - library , a virtual machine ( HotSpot ) and a java compiler ( plus other tools ) .
JamVM is compatible with the class - library from OpenJDK 6 , 7 and 8 ( the latest ) .
When configured for use with OpenJDK , JamVM provides a shared library ( libjvm.so ) which can be used to replace the libjvm .
so containing HotSpot .
The existing OpenJDK launcher ( java ) is used , which now runs JamVM .
IcedTea is a build harness for OpenJDK that initially replaced encumbered parts of OpenJDK with free components .
In addition to HotSpot , IcedTea also packages and supports alternative virtual machines such as JamVM .
To use JamVM , the - jamvm option is given on the java command line .
This directs the launcher to load the libjvm .
so from the jamvm directory rather than the standard server or client directory .
The easiest way to get OpenJDK / IcedTea is to install a pre-built package for your system .
You can then replace HotSpot or the existing JamVM library with the library you have built .
Supported Platforms / Architectures
JamVM has been written for a Unix / Posix - compliant system .
Unfortunately , incompatibilities between Unixes still exist , and JamVM needs to use several non-portable calls ( mostly threading related ) .
In addition , some architecture specific definitions are required ( memory barriers , etc. ) .
Finally , the native calling convention ( or ABI ) is both platform and architecture dependent .
This is needed by JamVM when constructing a call frame to invoke a native method .
For most platform / architectures this is provided by highly - efficient hand - written native assembler , although libffi is also supported for all platforms ( specified by -- with - libffi when configuring ) .
Libffi is less efficient than the hand - written assembler although recent versions of JamVM also includes stubs for common method signatures .
The following platforms / architectures are recognised by configure .
Those marked with * must be configured to use libffi .
Linux : x86 , x86_64 , ARM , PowerPC , PowerPC64 (* ) , MIPS , HPPA
FreeBSD : x86 , x86_64 , ARM , PowerPC , PowerPC64 (* ) , SPARC (*)
OpenBSD : x86 , x86_64 , ARM , PowerPC , PowerPC64 (* ) , SPARC (*)
Mac OS X / Darwin : x86 , x86_64 , ARM , PowerPC , PowerPC64
Solaris / OpenSolaris : x86 , x86_64
KFreeBSD : x86
JamVM " Features "
For those interested in the design of virtual machines , JamVM includes a number of optimisations to improve speed and reduce foot - print .
A list , in no particular order , is given below .
Execution engine supports many levels of optimisation from basic switched interpreter to inline - threaded interpreter with stack - caching ( equivalent performance to a simple JIT ) .
Uses native threading ( posix threads ) .
Full thread implementation including Thread.interrupt ()
Object references are direct pointers ( i.e. no handles )
Supports class loaders
Efficient thin locks for fast locking in uncontended cases ( the majority of locking ) without using spin-locking
Two word object header to minimise heap overhead ( lock word and class pointer )
Stop - the - world garbage collector , with separate mark / sweep and mark / compact phases to minimise heap fragmentation
Thread suspension uses signals to reduce suspend latency and improve performance ( no suspension checks during normal execution )
Full object finalisation support within the garbage collector ( with finaliser thread )
Full support for Soft / Weak / Phantom References ( with Reference Handler thread )
Full support for class and class - loader garbage - collection and unloading ( including associated shared libraries )
Garbage collector can run synchronously or asynchronously within its own thread
String constants within class files are stored in hash table to minimise class data overhead ( string constants shared between all classes )
Supports JNI and dynamic loading for use with standard libraries
Uses its own lightweight native interface for internal native methods without overhead of JNI
VM support for invokedynamic ( JSR 292 )
VM support for type annotations ( JSR 308 )
VM support for lambda expressions ( JSR 335 )
VM support for method parameter reflection
JamVM is written in C , with a small amount of platform dependent assembler , and is easily portable to other architectures .
That 's it !

[ This piece got massively cut for space in the paper , fair enough but personally I can’t bear to look .
Here ’s the last version I saw , with added email action from Professor Weber at the bottom . ]

The Guardian
September 1st , 2007
“ Jessica Alba has the perfect wiggle , study says ” .
You have to respect a paper like the Telegraph , especially when they report an important piece of science news like this on their news pages , especially when it gets picked up by other people like Fox news , and especially when it ’s accompanied by a photograph of some hot totty .
“ Jessica Alba , the film actress , has the ultimate sexy strut , according to a team of Cambridge mathematicians . ”
This important study was the work of a team – apparently – headed by Professor Richard Weber of Cambridge University , and I was particularly delighted to see it finally in print since , in the name of research , I discussed the possibility of prostituting my own good reputation for this same piece of guff with the very same PR company in June .
Here was their opening email : “ We are conducting a survey into the celebrity top ten sexiest walks for my client Veet ( hair removal cream ) and we would like to back up our survey with an equation from an expert to work out which celebrity has the sexiest walk , with theory behind it .
We would like help from a doctor of psychology or someone similar who can come up with equations to back up our findings , as we feel that having an expert comment and an equation will give the story more weight . ”
It got them on to the news pages of the Daily Telegraph .
I replied immediately .
“ Are there any factors you would particularly like to have in the equation ?
Something sexual perhaps ? ” “ Hi Dr Ben , ” replied Kiren .
“ We would really like the factors of the equation to include the thigh to calf ratio , the shape of the leg , the look of the skin and the wiggle ( swing ) of the hips …
There is a fee of £ 500 which we would pay for your services . ”
And there was survey data too .
“ We have n’t conducted the survey yet , ” Kiren told me : “ but we know what results we want to achieve . ”
That ’s the spirit !
“ We want Beyonce to come out on top followed by other celebrities with curvy legs such as J - Lo and Kylie and celebrities like Kate Moss and Amy Winehouse to be at the bottom e.g – skinny and pale unshapely legs are not as sexy .
I will find out when we will have the results of the survey for you .
Are you pretty free this month to work on it ? ”
So .
Clarion Communications do a survey , but they ’ve already decided what the result is , beforehand .
Then they employ Professor Weber .
Then they have the gall to put out a press release with the headline : “ Jessica Alba voted sexiest walk : with the figures to prove it . ”
Nice .
Who does their surveys for them ?
It was an internal email sent around the company .
The press release continues .
“ Professors have hailed the waist - to - hip ratio as a significant factor in judging female attractiveness – women with a waist - to - hip ( WHR ) ratio near 0.7 ( waist circumference that is 70 % of the hip circumference ) are invariably rated as most attractive . ”
And why ?
“ The 0.7 WHR also gives Jessica the torso strength to produce a better angular swing and bounce to the hips when she walks , helping her to show off her best assets when she walks – her shapely curves and smooth , glossy legs . ”
Ooh look it ’s all sciencey .
But it ’s already perfectly well known from real research that European men prefer women with a waste - hip ratio of 0.7 , and I would n’t be so sure that has anything to do with their “ wiggle ” , “ torso strength ” , “ bounce ” , or any ridiculous rigged survey .
More than that , students of comparative sociobiology who enjoyed last week ’s nonsense on “ why girls prefer pink ” might also be interested to know that cultural variations have been identified : the preferred ratio has been reported as 0.6 in China ; 0.8 or 0.9 in parts of Africa and South America ; and there is even variation related to ethnicity within nations , although this kind of thing was n’t in the “ cut me and paste ” Clarion press release .
Then I managed to get hold of Professor Weber at a remote location in Greece .
He told me this : “ The Clarion press release was not approved by me and is factually incorrect and misleading in suggesting there has been any serious attempt to do serious mathematics here .
No “ team of Cambridge mathematicians ” has been involved .
Clarion asked me to help by analysing survey data from 800 men in which they were asked to rank 10 celebrities for “ sexiness of walk ” .
And Jessica Alba did not come top .
She came 7th . ”
These “ cash for bad science ” stories add nothing to our understanding of the world , and they do nothing to promote science .
They sell products , pay money , misrepresent the very notion of doing research , and sell the idea that scientists are irrelevant boffins engaged in pointless head scratching .
And did they really get 1,000 respondents from an internal email survey ?
Well maybe : Clarion Communication are part of WPP , one of the world ’s largest “ communications services ” groups .
They do advertising , PR and lobbying , they have a turnover of around £ 6 billion , and they employ 100,000 people in 100 countries .
These corporations run our culture , and they riddle it with bullshit .
Here ’s the email from Weber :
It ’s pretty damning .
Dear Dr Goldacre , I have heard that you have taken an interest in the press release that has
been put out by Clarion Communications about the analysis of what makes a
“ sexy walk ” .
I am presently away on a research trip abroad , but my
attention has been drawn to this item in the press today .
I have not been
pleased to read the nonsense that has been written and I thought you might
like some background .
The Clarion press release was not approved by me and is factually
incorrect and misleading in suggesting there has been any serious attempt
to do mathematics here .
No such thing has happened .
No “ team of Cambridge
mathematicians ” has been involved in producing the results that have been
reported .
I do not endorse what the press release says .
I did not approve
it and would not have done so if asked .
I have emailed my contact in
Clarion Communication to ask for an explanation , but I have had a reply
that she is on holiday .
Clarion asked me to help by analysising survey data on from 800 men in
which they were asked to rank 10 celebrities for “ sexiness of walk ” .
Jessica Alba was 7th on the list , near the bottom .
I reported that there
was little one could conclude from the data on the 10 names , but that of
the variables I looked at , waist / hip ratio WHR had the greatest
correlation with rank order in the list .
Top of the list was Angelina
Jolie , who had the second greatest WHR .
Beyonce had the greatest WHR and
was ranked 4th .
Clarion were looking for something to help with a
promotion for Veet .
I suggested that as a bit of fun and nonsense , but no
more , that they could say something like the following : “ I have studied how 10 celebrities have ranked for “ sexiness of walk ” in
relation to their bust - waist - hip measurements .
Jolie ’s measurements at
36-27-36 mean she has the biggest waist surveyed , and a waist - hip ratio
( WHR ) of 0.75 .
Scientists have repeatedly discovered that WHR is a
significant factor in judging female attractiveness .
See , for example , news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6444851.stm
Women with a WHR near 0.7 are invariably rated as most attractive .
However , it ’s probably ‘ the way she moves ’ which attracts , not just shape .
Angelina ’s slightly larger waist may give her the torso strength with
which to produce a better angular swing and bounce to the hips than
minuscule stars such as Eva Longoria and Kylie Minogue can achieve with
32-21-33 and a WHR of only 0.64 . ”
I fear that the Clarion press release is an example of disingenuous and
perverted use this simple remark , not of any bad science .
I trust you will
not wish to follow their lead .
Do please contact me by email if you ’d like any more information .
yours sincerely , Richard Weber

And here is the press release from Clarion Communications :
JESSICA ALBA VOTED SEXIEST WALK : WITH THE FIGURES TO PROVE IT Hollywood beauty , Jessica Alba , is ‘ strutterly ’ desirable – she has the sexiest ever walk , according to new research revealed today by Veet .
Veet , the hair removal expert , has teamed up with mathematicians at Cambridge University to reveal a ratio to work out who has the hottest walk , and the Fantastic Four star clocked up the top score , thanks to her luscious legs and curvy frame .
Jessica scored a text - book perfect 0.7 when her vital statistics were ploughed into the ‘ sexiness ratio ’ , below .
WAIST MEASUREMENT ÷ HIP MEASUREMENT = RATIO
Professors have hailed the waist - to - hip ratio as a significant factor in judging female attractiveness – women with a waist - to - hip ( WHR ) ratio near 0.7 ( waist circumference that is 70 % of the hip circumference ) are invariably rated as most attractive .
The 0.7 WHR also gives Jessica the torso strength to produce a better angular swing and bounce to the hips when she walks , helping her to show off her best assets when she walks – her shapely curves and smooth , glossy legs .
Other beauty icons who rated highly : Screen siren Marilyn Monroe who scored an almost perfect 0.69 – who can forget her small part in the Marx Brothers movie , Love Happy , in which she debuted her very sexy walk , or the Seven Year Itch , which exposed Marilyn ’s legs to the world ?
Catwalk queen Kate Moss has a WHR of 0.67 , helping her to carry off the catwalk strut perfectly .
Desperate Housewives babe Eva Longoria scores a near perfect 0.67 – as a former dancer in the Pussycat Dolls , it ’s no wonder she ’s perfected the perfect wiggle .
With a WHR of 0.75 , curvy Mr and Mrs Smith star , Angelina Jolie is also listed by experts to be amongst the top stars with the sexiest walk .
The Veet research also asked 1,000 men and women what they viewed as the perfect figure .
A whopping 70 % of British men62 % of women envied the slighter frames of Cameron Diaz and Keira Knightley .
revealed that they prefer the curvier figures of R ‘n ’ B diva Beyonce Knowles or British beauty Kelly Brook to very - thin physiques like Victoria Beckham .
But Veet Beauty Panellist , Sarah Bunkell , comments : “ It ’s great to see such an eclectic mix of women scoring high on the ‘ sexiness ratio ’ .
Variety is the spice of life – long legs , larger waists , small hips and big busts can all contribute to a very sexy walk ! ”
To work out your waist - to - hip ratio , simply measure the waist and the hips and divide the measurement of your waist by that of your hips .

A snorkeller whose arm was bitten off and swallowed by a monster alligator underwent a major operation to re-attach it after the beast was shot and the arm found in its belly .
The 12 - foot long alligator attacked 59 - year - old Bill Heddon and chewed off his arm as he snorkelled on a lake .

Witnesses raised the alarm and emergency services and officers from the Department of Natural Resource rushed to Lake Moultrie near Charleston , South Carolina .
As medics treated the injured man , officers shot the alligator .
When they slit open the alligator 's stomach they discovered the limb has been swallowed whole .

A group of Filipinos gathering for a nearby religious ceremony offered a box of ice and a cooler for the severed arm and the man and his limb were rushed to hospital .
Doctors are waiting to see whether the operation to re-attach the arm has been successful .
I often receive comments about the line work on my web comic .
People have asked for example if I draw the comic on paper and then scan it into the computer .
The answer would be no .
In order to create my line work as well as the finished product of each strip I do , I use Adobe Illustrator CS3 .
I ’d never claim to be an expert in Illustrator but I do have enough knowledge of the software in order to get it do what I want it to .
When you draw with traditional media whether it be pencil or pen , the thickness of your lines will usually vary depending on the pressure you apply with each stroke .
You can mimic that effect in Illustrator .
I ’m going to show how to create a custom brush which will make it quite simple to do so .
Step 1 : Open up Illustrator and create a new document .
Once you ’ve done this you ’re going to be using the oval tool .
Step 2 : Using the oval tool , draw yourself a somewhat thin oval like the example below .
Step 3 : Go ahead and select that oval .
It should now be outlined and have visible end points .
Step 4 : Next we ’re going to be using the Convert Anchor Point tool , which you will find by selecting your pen tool and holding down on it until a drop menu appears like in the following example .
Step 5 : Using the Convert Anchor Point tool go ahead and click on both end points of your ellipse .
This will cause them to taper , creating a fine point .
You should see something like the following image .
Step 6 : With your ellipse still selected , the next thing you need to do is open your Brush palette .
You can do so by choosing Window in the menu across the top of the application and then navigating to Brushes .
Alternatively you can just press F5 which is the keyboard shortcut .
Step 7 : On the right upper corner of the Brush palette you ’re going to look for an arrow and click on that in order to open the Brush palette menu .
Choose New Brush …
Step 8 : Now a window should pop up giving you several different options .
You want to select the option to create a New Art Brush .
Step 9 : Now you ’re going to choose the proportional option , or in the case of my screenshot “ proportiona ” .
Do n’t ask me why the L was cut off .
I have no idea ;)
Now click Okay .
Now your new brush should appear in the brush palette , like so .
Go ahead and test out your new brush .
I use a Wacom Tablet and Pen when doing anything in Illustrator , but if you do n’t have one , a mouse will work adequately enough .
You ’ll notice with the proportional setting turned on that your lines will look thicker or thinner depending on how long they are .
You ’re all set !
Enjoy your new custom brush !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China is seeking to unseat the United States as the dominant power in cyberspace , a U.S. Air Force general leading a new push in this area said Wednesday .

“ They ’re the only nation that has been quite that blatant about saying , ‘ We ’re looking to do that , ’ ” 8th Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. Robert Elder told reporters .
Elder is to head a new three - star cyber command being set up at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana , already home to about 25,000 military personnel involved in everything from electronic warfare to network defense .
The command ’s focus is to control the cyber domain , critical to everything from communications to surveillance to infrastructure security .
“ We have peer competitors right now in terms of doing computer network attack ... and I believe we ’re going to be able to ratchet up our capability , ” Elder said .
“ We ’re going to go way ahead . ”
The Defense Department said in its annual report on China ’s military power last month that China regarded computer network operations -- attacks , defense and exploitation -- as critical to achieving “ electromagnetic dominance ” early in a conflict .
China ’s People ’s Liberation Army has established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks , the Pentagon said .
China also was investing in electronic countermeasures and defenses against electronic attack , including infrared decoys , angle reflectors and false - target generators , it said .
The Chinese Foreign Ministry rejected the U.S. report as “ brutal interference ” in China ’s internal affairs and insisted Beijing ’s military preparations were purely defensive .
Elder described the bulk of current alleged Chinese cyber- operations as industrial espionage aimed at stealing trade secrets to save years of high - tech development .
He attributed the espionage to a mix of criminals , hackers and “ nation - state ” forces .
Virtually all potential U.S. foes also were scanning U.S. networks for trade and defense secrets , he added .
“ Everyone but North Korea , ” he said .
“ We ’ve concluded that there must be only one laptop in all of North Korea -- and that guy ’s not allowed to scan ” overseas networks , Elder said .
In October , the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff defined cyberspace as “ characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store , modify , and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures . ”
The definition is broad enough to cover far more than merely defending or attacking computer networks .
Other concerns include remotely detonated roadside bombs in Iraq , interference with Global Positioning Satellites and satellite communications , Internet financial transactions by adversaries , and radar and navigational jamming .
Taylor 's ' inoperable ' tumor successfully removed
Laurie Radtke tells
Taylor what a fighter she is after she had her surgery Thursday .
Laurie and Jeff Radtke embrace after hearing the good news that their daughter Taylor 's surgery went better than expected .
Laurie Radtke hears the good news from from Dr. Peter Nakaji that Taylor 's surgery went well .
Surgeons keep an eye on a monitor as they work on Taylor Radtke today in Phoenix .
Laurie Radtke comforts her daughter Taylor before her surgery Thursday at St. Joseph Hospital nd Medical Center in Phoenix Arizona .
Less than an hour after her daughter 's brain surgery , Laurie Radtke went into the recovery room and pressed her forehead against her little girl 's brow .
" Thank you for fighting so hard , Pumpkin , " Laurie said .
Her daughter , 7 - year - old Taylor , gave a groggy nod in response and faded back to sleep .
The small gesture , which lasted only seconds , reduced her mother to tears .
Laurie Radtke wept out of relief following an emotional two - week odyssey that led her Johnsburg family to an Arizona doctor willing to operate on Taylor 's brain tumor .
Earlier Coverage Seven - year - old Taylor Radtke , diagnosed with a rare tumor that threatens her vision and mobility , needs life - saving surgery that few doctors are willing to perform .

She wept out of exhaustion after several sleepless nights spent wondering whether the surgeons could even partially remove the lesion that threatened her daughter 's mobility and , ultimately , her young life .
And she wept out of sheer joy following a successful operation that defied expectations and left no visible trace of the potentially fatal tumor .
" I 'm still having a hard time comprehending what we 've been given , " Laurie said via telephone from her daughter 's bedside .
" We 've been given a life with our daughter .
We have been given a future . "
Doctors have cautioned the family that there could still be post - operative complications such as paralysis .
But Taylor has shown many positive signs of recovery , including mobility in her limbs , a strong eye test and the ability to stick out her tongue .
In the coming hours , the medical staff at St. Joseph 's Hospital & Medical Center in Phoenix will monitor the second - grader 's condition for any buildup of cerebral fluid .
If there are no complications , she could be released as early as today .
" Things went well , " said neurosurgeon Peter Nakaji , who performed the surgery .
" We could n't be more pleased .
She has an excellent chance of living a great life . "
Earlier this month , Laurie Radtke and her husband , Jeff , found themselves in a battle against both time and modern medicine to save Taylor .
Their daughter had been diagnosed with a brain tumor , and 27 doctors had refused to operate on the lesion because it was anchored too close to the carotid artery .
After the Daily Herald chronicled the family 's plight , a reader recommended the Radtkes meet with Arizona neurosurgeon Robert Spetzler , director of St. Joseph 's Barrow Neurological Institute .
Spetzler agreed to operate on Taylor , and the family began a journey across the United States that , among other things , included a stop in Southern California to fulfill Taylor 's dream of visiting the San Diego Zoo .
" It 's hard to believe that all of this has happened in less than three weeks , " Laurie said .
" We were so desperate to find a miracle and now we have one .
It just took one doctor to say ' yes ' to us . "
The Radtkes ' miracle began hours before the sun rose over the Arizona desert Thursday .
Jeff and Laurie donned " Cheering for Taylor " T - shirts -- a nod to her passion for cheerleading -- and headed to the hospital where she was being prepped for surgery .
The family laughed and told silly jokes in the room until the medical staff came to wheel Taylor into surgery around 7 a.m .
The couple kissed their eldest child , told her they loved her and promised to be there when she woke up .
Jeff and Laurie wept in those final moments .
Taylor smiled .
" She 's a fighter , " Laurie said .
" And she still has a lot of fight left in her . "
During the surgery , the family -- including Taylor 's 5 - year - old brother , Blake -- sat in the waiting area and read messages people had left for them on their personal Web site .
The words of hope , inspiration , introspection and prayer sustained them as the minutes slowly ticked by .
Inside the operating room , doctors had entered Taylor 's brain through her nose and were pleased with what they discovered .
The tumor was a millimeter away from the carotid artery , a minuscule space large enough for the surgeons to go in and remove it entirely .
" We always go in full of hope , " Nakaji said .
" When we saw it was n't stuck to the artery , we knew that was all we needed . "
Doctors emerged from the operating room nearly three hours later and told Taylor 's parents that things had gone better than expected .
They would have to await an MRI , however , to determine exactly how well .
" This is awesome news , " Laurie said after the initial briefing .
" We could not have asked for more . "
And yet she could .
Less than an hour later , the doctors returned to report that the MRI showed no visible signs of the tumor .
Spetzler extended his hand to shake Laurie's .
" We 're way beyond that , " Laurie said as she pulled him into an emotional hug .
The Radtkes spent the rest of the afternoon in the recovery room , where they told a sleeping Taylor how much they loved her and that her surgery had gone well .
Laurie sang " You Are My Sunshine " to her daughter and promised her mashed potatoes and ice cream once she was cleared to eat .
" The gift we 've received is beyond comprehension , " Laurie said .
" This is better than the best feeling I 've ever had . "
While basking in the family 's euphoria , Taylor 's father softly asked for a few more blessings upon his daughter :
No more hospitals , no more surgeries , no more life - threatening illnesses .
" Hopefully , " he said , " she can just be a little girl now . "

In this latest White House " Benchmark Assessment Report " ( pdf ) released yesterday , Bushco now claims the Iraqi government has " satisfactorily " met 9 of the 18 specific benchmarks the White House itself set back in May , up from the 8 benchmarks Bush claimed they had achieved in July , which not surprisingly is a far cry from the sobering GAO report just last week which found that only 3 of the White House 's benchmarks for progress in Iraq had yet been met .
Download Download
CNN 's Ed Henry explains how the White House 's crack team of number crunchers came to their much rosier assessment :
" The White House is getting awfully creative in how it 's grading the Iraqi Government 's success or failure . " (....)
" The White House gave a positive rating on any benchmark where " present trend data demonstrates a positive trajectory , which is tracking toward satisfactory accomplishment "
In other words : Thumbs - up for a benchmark that might be met eventually . "
So , even if we accept the White House 's flawed formulary claiming success for all of the benchmarks that " might be met eventually , " is that not then an implicit admission that none of the remaining benchmarks stand any chance of being met at all ??
The White House had already set the bar fairly low for the Iraqi Government as the entire purpose for their creating these 18 benchmarks in the first place was so they could trumpet their great success in tandem with Gen Potemkin 's report right before the upcoming '08 Defense budget showdown in Congress .
Now , having failed their own ' No Iraqi Government Left Behind Act , ' they want another F.U. so they can take a make - up test whereby they 're already foreshadowing that by then the Iraqi Government might possibly meet but half of the White House 's standard .
sigh
Ed Henry : " Now , in July when the preliminary report on White House benchmarks came out and had bad grades for the Iraqi Government , the White House said wait until September , and now September 's here .
The report card is not good again , The White House is saying , ' Wait until March , ' when there will be yet another report card .
Where have we heard that , Suzanne ? " Suzanne Malveaux : " We 've heard it again and again . "
You know , " There 's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it 's in Texas , probably in Tennessee ... "
CNN 's Cafferty : Bush putting the poor out in the cold to fund war Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Amid $ 190 billion Iraq request , 30 million Americans wo n't be able to heat homes this winter
As he prepares to ask for $ 190 billion to fund the war in Iraq , President Bush refuses to approve an extra half - billion dollars that help one in four American households pay skyrocketing home - heating bills this winter .
The debate illustrates what critics say are Bush 's out - of - wack spending priorities , after he vetoed a popular measure that would have expanded healthcare available to poor children .
" No money for kids ' health insurance , no money to help poor families pay their heating bills but President Bush wants $ 190 billion additional for 2008 for his wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , " CNN commentator Jack Cafferty said Monday .
" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the president 's new request means the cost of Iraq war is now approaching $ 650 billion .
I wonder if the Democrats will give him the money . "
Rising oil prices are creating a " heat or eat " dilemma for families struggling near or below the poverty line .
" Parents know that children can freeze to death more quickly than they starve to death , and so most decrease food purchases first to pay for heat , " wrote Dr. Deborah A. Frank , director of the Grow Clinic for Children , and Joseph P. Kennedy II , chairman and president of Citizens Energy Corp. , in the Boston Globe Sunday .
The home heating debate involves grants distributed through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program , known as LIHEAP .
The program operates with an annual budget of $ 2.16 billion -- just $ 300 million more than when the program started in 1991 , as Cafferty notes .
The House wants to bump LIHEAP funding to $ 2.66 billion per year , while the Senate has approved a bill that would maintain its current funding level , which would only cover 16 percent of the 38 million eligible American households , according to Reuters .
But even static funding is too much for Bush , who wants to cut the program to $ 1.78 billion for fiscal year 2008 .
That 's less than 1 percent of the $ 192 billion he has requested to fund dual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and it amounts to about a week 's worth of Pentagon war spending , according to CNN .

My last post discussed the critical relationship between knowledge and confidence .
One point I failed to mention is that at regular intervals in the learning process confidence should actually decrease as knowledge increases .
At first it might seem logical that an increase in knowledge consistently leads to an increase in confidence , but this is not always the case .
The more a person learns , the more they discover holes in their own personal knowledgebase .
A steady increase in knowledge on a particular subject will actually create fluctuations in a person ’s level of confidence pertaining to the same subject matter .
As a person increases their knowledge they open new doors leading to information that was formerly unknown .
When a new door is first open a person ’s confidence actually decreases slightly due to the sudden realization of what they do n’t know .
Their confidence will then slowly increase as all the new information is addressed and accounted for .
Eventually another new door will open and the cycle will carry on .
If your level of confidence in what you know never ever decreases , you may not be learning enough .

Some of the best - loved ad images of the 20th century have names like Tony , Betty and Ronald .
Others , like the Marlboro Man , may not be as beloved , but grew to have tremendous worldwide impact as an instant identifier of Philip Morris Co. 's Marlboro cigarettes .
From frozen vegetables to packaged cake mix , from fast food to automobile tires , these carefully drawn characters are the personifications of businesses that began small but grew to become dominant brands in their fields -- thanks in large part to their famous icons .
1. THE MARLBORO MAN PRODUCT : Marlboro cigarettes
DATE INTRODUCED : 1955
CREATOR : Leo Burnett Co .
The most powerful -- and in some quarters , most hated -- brand image of the century , the Marlboro Man stands worldwide as the ultimate American cowboy and masculine trademark , helping establish Marlboro as the best - selling cigarette in the world .
Today , even a mention of the Marlboro Man as an effective ad icon brings protests from healthcare workers who see first - hand the devastation wrought by decades of cigarette smoking .
More than any other issue , the ethics of tobacco advertising -- both morally and legally -- have divided the advertising industry .
2. RONALD MCDONALD PRODUCT : McDonald 's restaurants
DATE INTRODUCED : 1963
CREATOR : McDonald 's franchisee Oscar Goldstein and his local ad agency
McDonald 's Corp. advertising executive Roy Bergold can testify to the reach and recognition of Ronald McDonald .
But even he could n't believe what he witnessed one day in Milwaukee .
" Ronald was visiting sick children and he came upon a youngster in a coma , " recalls Mr. Bergold .
" I watched as the child 's eyes began to flicker as Ronald stood by his side .
The boy actually regained consciousness during his visit .
There 's no way to explain how it happened or why , but it was nothing short of amazing . "
3. THE GREEN GIANT PRODUCT : Green Giant vegetables
DATE INTRODUCED : 1928
CREATOR : Minnesota Valley Canning Co .
The Green Giant 's national ad debut in 1928 was disappointing .
Minnesota Valley Canning Co. developed the Giant as a product trademark , but in his earliest days he was stooped and scowling , wore a scruffy bearskin and looked more like the Incredible Hulk than the grand old gardener he is today .
4. BETTY CROCKER PRODUCT : Food products including cake mixes , frostings , microwave popcorn and biscuit mixes
DATE INTRODUCED : 1921
CREATOR : Washburn Crosby Co. , a forerunner of General Mills
Long before Martha Stewart , there was Betty Crocker .
Betty was created in 1921 after a promotion for Gold Medal flour flooded Washburn Crosby Co. with questions about baking .
To answer customers in a more personal manner , the company created a fictitious kitchen expert , pulling the name " Crocker " from a recently retired director of the company and adding the first name " Betty " because it sounded friendly .
5. THE ENERGIZER BUNNY PRODUCT : Eveready Energizer batteries
DATE INTRODUCED : October 1989
CREATOR : Chiat / Day
Say what you will about his long ears and drumming hands , the Energizer Bunny is one icon who 's got legs .
Marketing experts call it the " ultimate product demo " because it does such an effective job of showcasing the product 's unique selling proposition -- long - lived batteries -- in an inventive , fresh way .
" The Bunny has become the ultimate symbol of longevity , perseverance and determination , " says Mark Larsen , communications category manager for Energizer .
During the past decade , everyone from politicians to sport stars used the Energizer Bunny to describe their staying power .
6.THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY PRODUCT : Assorted Pillsbury foods , including refrigerated dough , bakery mixes and rolls
DATE INTRODUCED : 1965
CREATOR : Leo Burnett Co .
Burnett creative director Rudy Perz was sitting at his kitchen table in the mid-1960s when he dreamed up the idea of a plump , dough figure that would pop out of a tube of refrigerated rolls .
Since then , Pillsbury has used Poppin ' Fresh in more than 600 commercials for more than 50 of its products .
Although Perz had originally conceived His Doughness as an animated character , he changed his mind after seeing a stop- action tilting technique used in the opening credits for " The Dinah Shore Show . "
7. AUNT JEMIMA PRODUCT : Aunt Jemima pancake mixes and syrup
DATE INTRODUCED : 1893
CREATOR : Chris Rutt / Davis Milling Co .
Few commercial icons deserve to be called " cultural touchstones " of significant political and social change .
But the Aunt Jemima trademark is one of them .
The image of the smiling black woman first appeared on thousands of boxes of pancake mix in the early 1890s , but throughout the 20th century , Aunt Jemima 's trademark mirrored America 's changing perceptions of African - American women .
The idea of Aunt Jemima was first conceived by newspaperman and entrepreneur Chris Rutt , according to the Afro- American Almanac .
Mr. Rutt and his partner , Charles Underwood , had developed and packaged a ready - mixed , self - rising pancake flour but they had not settled on a name or brand positioning .
8. THE MICHELIN MAN PRODUCT : Michelin tires
DATE INTRODUCED : 1898
CREATOR : Idea conceived by Edouard Michelin ; artist 's rendition created by O'Galop ; DDB Needham Worldwide handled later executions
Andre Michelin commissioned the creation of this jolly , rotund figure after his brother , Edouard , observed that a display of stacked tires resembled a human form .
The artist 's sketches of a bloated man made of tires was exactly what the brothers had in mind .
One in particular , picturing the character lifting a beer glass and shouting , " Nunc est bibendum !
( Now is the time to drink ! ) " seemed to embody Michelin 's slogan at the time , " Michelin tires swallow up all obstacles . "
9. TONY THE TIGER PRODUCT : Kellogg 's Sugar Frosted Flakes ( later Frosted Flakes )
DATE INTRODUCED : 1951
CREATOR : Leo Burnett Co .
Only one famous feline ( sorry , Morris ) can rightfully claim he 's the cat 's meow of commercials : Tony the Tiger .
Adland 's premier promotional pussycat was born in 1951 , when Burnett was hired to create a campaign for Kellogg 's new cereal , Sugar Frosted Flakes .
Tony was originally one of four animated critters created to sell the cereal , but he quickly edged out Katy the Kangaroo , Newt the Gnu and Elmo the Elephant to become the sole star of the cereal maker 's ad efforts .
ELSIE PRODUCT : Borden dairy products
DATE INTRODUCED : 1939 ( first general magazine ad )
CREATOR : Stuart Peabody , Borden 's director of advertising
Elsie started out as one of four cows ( Mrs. Blossom , Bessie and Clara were her sidekicks ) that appeared in a 1936 cartoon series featured in medical journals -- just four friendly bovines chatting together in a pasture .
The ads were a big hit and doctors ordered reprints for their offices .
One day a radio commercial writer penned a letter supposedly written by Elsie and directed it to commentator Rush Hughes , who read it on the air .
The gimmick proved popular and additional letters were read in subsequent broadcasts .
By 1939 , Elsie was being featured in her own magazine ads and her campaign was voted the best of the year by the Jury of the 1939 Annual Advertising Awards .
With the World 's Fair approaching , Borden decided to feature a live Elsie in its exhibit , so company executives looked at 150 cows before settling on a 7 - year - old Jersey named " You 'll Do Lobelia . "

I love a backlash , so as soon as I heard Radiohead ’s choose - your - own price gambit for the digital download of their new album , I said , “ Wow , they ’ve entirely created a new model of distribution for millionaire rock bands .
” It was my way of being dismissive about their breakthrough move .
Insouciantly , I IMed my friends :
What does this do for the all the amazing bands that ca n’t get heard or earn a living because no one buys records ?
The truth is that the life of an unknown band has become easier every minute since MTV broke the stranglehold radio had on music in the early ‘ 80s .
And what Radiohead has done has not only set the precedent for what millionaire rock bands should be doing but also for what every content provider on this planet should be doing .
Now that the real backlash about has come ( and I think gone ) , we should actually quantify what Radiohead has figured out .
The truth is that every piece of content ( of some acceptable quality ) should come in ( at least ) three flavors : 1. FREE - Low quality2 .
MOVIE TICKET PRICE - High quality download3 .
LIVE THEATER PRICE - Special collectors editionI ’d add for music and movies and books you ’d also want another tier between 2 and 3 for 2b .
MOVIE THEATER PLUS LARGE POPCORN PRICE - Simple jewel - case / paperback edition .
The only thing I think Radiohead could have done better was by offering 2 and 2b .
Oh well , they still did have done the best job of changing the music industry since Shawn Fanning .
The funny thing is that the music industry could have done this before Shawn Fanning liberated the playlist from the stranglehold of actually paying for music .
Why did it take so long ? .
Seth Godin blames mediocrity which is hard to argue with .
I think denial played a part too .
No matter what people want to pretend , people grew up thinking was music was free before Napster .
It was called radio .
And that 's what the free version should be called " The Radio Version . "
If you want better , it 's there .
The quality they are offering is SUPERIOR to any radio station feed and , again , it is free .
Also , CDs and their antecedents have been free to reviewers and tastemakers .
Who is n't a reviewer or a tastemaker now ?
Aimee Mann has said she was surprised more major artists have n’t taken to selling their own music directly .
She started her own label back in the 20th century and makes a decent living selling her music primarily through her website .
Radiohead was the perfect band to answer Mann ’s challenge .
We needed a band that transcends culture to really show us the way .
Once marginalized over numerous instant messages as the “ Nirvana of Britpop , " ( I love saying decisive things that anger people who are too nuanced by facts ) this new album is n’t just a marketing leap forward into the future , a new time I call ARIR — After Radiohead ’s , it ’s amazing album that connects the rock ofwith the roll of the band ’s last three albums .
Thank you , Radiohead .
And I ’m sorry I only paid a penny .
I just wanted to see if it would work !
Until quite recent history , the writing of the Ancient Egyptians was a secret to man .
Eventually , with the help of the Rosetta stone , Jean - François Champollion was able to solve the ancient mystery .
Since that time , there have been many other attempts to decipher ancient languages , or to crack codes that have been made for fun or fortune .
This is a list of the ten most famous ciphers and writing systems that are still unsolved .
10 . D’agapeyeff Cipher

The D’Agapeyeff cipher is an as - yet unbroken cipher that appears in the first edition of Codes and Ciphers , an elementary book on cryptography published by the Russian - born English cartographer Alexander D’Agapeyeff in 1939 .
Offered as a “ challenge cipher ” at the end of the book , it was not included in later editions , and D’Agapeyeff is said to have admitted later to having forgotten how he had encrypted it .
It has been argued that the failure of all attempts at decryption is due to D’Agapeyeff incorrectly encrypting the original text .
However , it has been argued that the cipher may still be successfully attacked using computational methods such as genetic algorithms .

9. Kryptos
Kryptos is a sculpture by American artist James Sanborn located on the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in Langley , Virginia , in the United States .
Since its dedication on November 3 , 1990 , there has been much speculation about the meaning of the encrypted messages it bears .
It continues to provide a diversion for employees of the CIA and other cryptanalysts attempting to decrypt the messages .
The ciphertext on one half of the main sculpture contains 869 characters in total , however Sanborn released information in April of 2006 stating that an intended letter on the main half of Kryptos was missing .
This would bring the total number of characters to 870 on the main portion .
The other half of the sculpture comprises a Vigenère encryption tableau , comprised of 869 characters , if spaces are counted .
The first person to publicly announce solving the first three sections , in 1999 , was James Gillogly , a computer scientist from southern California , who deciphered 768 of the characters .
The portion that he could n’t solve , the remaining 97 or 98 characters , is the same part which has stumped the government ’s own cryptanalysts .
8. Shugborough Hall Enscription
The Shepherd ’s Monument at Shugborough Hall carries a relief ( pictured above ) that shows a woman watching three shepherds pointing to a tomb .
On the tomb is depicted the Latin text “ Et in arcadia ego ” ( “ I am also in Arcadia ” or “ I am even in Arcadia ” ) .
The relief is based on a painting by the French artist Nicholas Poussin , known itself as Et in Arcadia ego , but the relief has a number of modifications — most noticeably that it is reversed horizontally .
Another difference is a change in which letter of the tomb a shepherd is pointing at .
In the painting the letter R in ARCADIA is being pointed to .
The finger in the sculpture is broken , but was pointing to the N in IN .
The sculpture also adds an extra sarcophagus to the scene , placed on top of the one with the Latin phrase .
Below the image of the monument are the following letters :
D O.U.O.S.V.A.V.V. M
For adherents of the modern Grail - conspiracy legend , the inscription is alleged to hold a clue to the location of the Holy Grail .
Following the claims in the book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail that Poussin was a member of the Priory of Sion and that the painting contains a message about the location of the grail , it has been speculated that the inscription may encode secrets related to the Priory .
7. Chinese Gold Bar Cipher
In 1933 , seven gold bars were allegedly issued to a General Wang in Shanghai , China .
These gold bars appear to represent metal certificates related to a bank deposit with a U.S. Bank .
The gold bars themselves have pictures , Chinese writing , some form of script writing , and cryptograms in latin letters .
Not surprisingly , there is a dispute concerning the validity of the claim for the deposit .
It may help to resolve the dispute if someone can decipher the cryptograms on the bars .
Nobody has yet put for the a theory as to their meaning .
The Chinese writing has been translated , and discusses a transaction in excess of $ 300,000,000 .
It also refers to these gold bars which weigh a total of 1.8 kilograms .
You can see the cryptograms here if you want to have a go at cracking the code .
6. Chaocipher
John F. Byrne invented Chaocipher in 1918 and tried unsuccessfully for almost 40 years to interest the U.S. government in his cipher system .
He offered a reward to anyone who could break his cipher but the reward was never claimed .
In 1989 , John Byrne , son of John F. Byrne , demonstrated Chaocipher to two Cryptologia editors to determine if it had any commercial value .
After making some improvements and providing additional information they jointly issue a new challenge to would - be solvers .
In his autobiography , Silent Years , John F. Byrne , a lifelong friend of James Joyce , devoted the last chapter to Chaocipher which he had invented in 1918 .
Byrne described his attempts starting in 1920 to interest the State , War , and Navy Departments in his indecipherable cipher and his frustration with the disinterest shown by William F. Friedman and other cryptanalytic experts after he had demonstrated his machine .

5 . The Dorabella Cipher
Probably Elgar ’s most popular work is his ‘ Enigma ’ Variations which , apart from its undoubted musical merit , still tantalises the musical detectives with the hidden ‘ secrets ’ which Elgar cleverly wove into the fabric of the score .
But Elgar , who was fascinated by codes , ciphers , riddles and other forms of puzzles , has left us another mystery – the ‘ Dorabella ’ cipher ( pictured above ) .
One hundred and ten years ago – to be precise , on the 14 July 1897 – Elgar sent a letter to a young friend , Miss Dora Penny , the 22 year - old daughter of the Rev. Alfred Penny , Rector of St Peter ’s , Wolverhampton .
The unusual feature of the letter was that it was in a cipher which , a century later , still presents a challenge .
There have been a couple of attempts at solving it but neither of these seem entirely satisfactory .
4. Beale Ciphers
In 1885 , a small pamphlet was published in Virginia containing a story and three encrypted messages .
According to the pamphlet , around 1820 a man named Beale buried two wagons - full of treasure at a secret location in Bedford County , Virginia .
He then left a small locked box with a local innkeeper , and left town , never to be seen again .
The pamphlet went on to state that the innkeeper , after having not heard from Beale for many years , opened the box and discovered encrypted messages .
Never able to read them , he eventually passed them along to a young friend shortly before the innkeeper ’s death in 1863 .
According to the pamphlet , the friend spent the next 20 years trying to decrypt the messages , solving only one which detailed the tons of gold , silver and jewels that were buried , along with a general location .
The still unsolved messages supposedly give exact directions , and a list of who the treasure belongs to .
There have been many exhaustive searches for the treasure , and much effort spent on decoding the other messages , without ( confirmed ) success .
There are many claimed solutions , usually bannered in combination with a book that someone is trying to sell , but no one has ever been able to produce a duplicatable decryption method .
3. Linear A
Linear
A is one of two linear scripts used in ancient Crete ( a third script is Cretan Hieroglyphs ) .
They were discovered and named by Arthur Evans .
Linear B was deciphered in 1952 by Michael Ventris and was used to write Mycenaean Greek .
Linear
A is far from being totally deciphered but it is partially understood and it may be read through Linear B values .
Though the two scripts share many of the same symbols , using the syllables associated with Linear B in Linear A writings produces words that are unrelated to any known language .
This language has been dubbed Minoan or Eteocretan , and corresponds to a period in Cretan history prior to a series of invasions by Mycenean Greeks around 1450 BC .
It is believed that there may be some connection between Linear A and The Phaistos Disk .
2. Voynich Manuscript
At least 400 years old , this is a 232 - page illuminated manuscript entirely written in a secret script .
It is filled with copious drawings of unidentified plants , herbal recipes of some sort , astrological diagrams , and many small human figures in strange plumbing - like contraptions .
The script is unlike anything else in existence , but is written in a confident style , seemingly by someone who was very comfortable with it .
In 2004 there were some compelling arguments which described a technique that would seemingly prove that the manuscript was a hoax , but to date , none of the described techniques have been able to replicate a single section of the Manuscript , so speculations continue .
Over its recorded existence , the Voynich manuscript has been the object of intense study by many professional and amateur cryptographers , including some top American and British codebreakers of World War II fame ( all of whom failed to decipher a single word ) .
This string of failures has turned the Voynich manuscript into a famous subject of historical cryptology .
1. The Phaistos Disk
The disc of Phaistos is the most important example of hieroglyphic inscription from Crete and was discovered in 1903 in a small room near the depositories of the “ archive chamber ” , in the north – east apartments of the palace , together with a Linear A tablet and pottery dated to the beginning of the Neo- palatial period ( 1700 - 1600 B.C. ) .
Both surfaces of this clay disc are covered with hieroglyphs arranged in a spiral zone , impressed on the clay when it was damp .
The signs make up groups divided from each other by vertical lines , and each of these groups should represent a word .
Forty five different types of signs have been distinguished , of which a few can be identified with the hieroglyphs in use in the Proto- palatial period .
Some hieroglyphic sequences recur like refrains , suggesting a religious hymn , and Pernier regards the content of the text as ritual .
Others have suggested that the text is a list of soldiers , and lately it has suggested to be a document in the Hittic language in which a king discusses the erection of the Palace of Phaistos .

For a year and a half , middle - level officials of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Pittsburgh participated in a series of private and sometimes harrowing meetings with activists who had been conducting vigils against the company because of its nuclear - weapons work .
But Westinghouse rebuffed the protesters ' proposal that the company establish an ethical - review process on defense contracts , and the activists have continued passing out their leaflets at the company 's headquarters .
MINNEAPOLIS , SEPARATED from its sister city , St. Paul , by the Mississippi River , is a green and clean community graced with lakes and parks .
Many of its 365,000 people are descended from Scandinavian and German settlers .
The work ethic is strong there - lots of people get to the office by 7 A.M.
Honeywell , which employs 18,000 people in the area , has been a good corporate citizen for many years , supporting youth development and special - education programs and giving more than $ 1 million for the renovation of houses in the low - income neighborhood where its home office is located .
Honeywell also produces guidance - system components for B - 52 bombers and Trident and MX missiles .
When Sue Ann Martinson , a poet and Honeywell Project activist , asserts that the Government gives money to the company '' to plan for the mass murder and destruction of the world , '' the charge angers not only thousands of Minnesotans whose lives have been touched for the better by Honeywell over the years , but also many older people who still identify proudly with the World War II image of the Honeywell worker as '' the man behind the man behind the gun . ''
The company had its first encounters with public protest beginning in 1969 because it was manufacturing components for cluster bombs that were killing civilians in Vietnam .
The bitterness between the company and the members climaxed in 1977 with the filing of a lawsuit charging that the Federal Bureau of Investigation , working with Honeywell , had infiltrated the protest group .
( Two years ago , the Federal Government and Honeywell agreed to pay $ 35,000 each in settlement of the suit . )
After almost a decade of demonstrations , the Honeywell Project fell into quiescence .
Then , in 1981 , an activist of the Plowshares movement passed through the city and goaded some of the members into tak- ing the company on again because of its nuclear work .
Plowshares - whose leaders have included Daniel and Philip Berrigan - is the most audacious of the antinuclear protest groups .
In more than 20 actions since 1980 , Plowshares activists have invaded Government and corporate nuclear - weapons facilities and damaged nuclear missiles , submarines and airplanes with hammers ; they have also poured human blood on weapons and blueprints .
Some have been sentenced to as many as 18 years in prison .
While their tactics have alienated elements of the broader peace movement , their influence has been critical .
Says Marv Davidov , a leader of the Honeywell Project , '' They move all the rest of us . ''
Spurred by the visitor from Plowshares , the Honeywell Project launched its first mass protests on the nuclear issue in 1982 .
Within a year , more than 1,000 people were turning out for the demonstrations .
Honeywell closed its plaza to the demonstrators ; they trespassed .
The company took out full - page advertisements in local newspapers to present its side of the issue , arguing , for example , that '' voters , not companies , have the responsibility to determine defense decisions . ''
At first , according to Anthony Bouza , the police chief , Honeywell told police , '' You 're not arresting them fast enough . ''
Bouza says he tried '' to strike a balance in a tortured path . ''
By the end of 1986 , the court system was so clogged that small groups of trespassers were being tried as ' ' representatives ' ' of larger groups .

Scientists aim to regrow human limbs Tadpoles can heal wounds without scars , but the ability is lost once they become frogs .
READ MORE STORIES LIFE - CHANGING TECH ( CNN ) -- Scientists in England are exploring ways for humans to regrow missing limbs and prevent scarring after surgery by researching frogs and salamanders .
Both sets of amphibians have a set of genes that enable them to recreate their own severed limbs .
The scientists , from the University of Manchester 's faculty of life sciences , will work with The Healing Foundation , a charity funding research into all aspects of disfiguring conditions , in a 25 - year partnership .
Enrique Amaya , professor of tissues regeneration at the university , said studies showed that salamanders can grow entire new limbs in less than a month due to cells known as blastema , which can regenerate body parts .
He said tadpoles whose tails were amputated grew them back in nine days , but they lost their regenerative ability after becoming frogs .
Human embryos could also heal wounds without scarring but only up to six months gestation .
The underlying genetic and cell biological mechanisms in frogs are essentially the same as those in humans , Amaya said .
" With the new tools and technologies we have at our disposal , I hope we will be able to make quick progress in our understanding of the basic biology of healing and regeneration , " Amaya said .
" Within this generation , it will be possible to develop new treatments for amputees , survivors of major burns or trauma ... a future where wounds heal without scars and perhaps even new limbs can be partially or completely regrown . "
He said the scientists would first work to establish whether frogs could regenerate as adults .
They would then be able to identify mechanisms to enable mammals to regenerate limbs in the same ways as salamanders .
More than 14,000 people are admitted to United Kingdom hospitals with serious burns each year , while four million surgical procedures take place in the UK each year , many leaving visible scars .
Meanwhile , 11,000 amputations of the hand , foot , arm or leg are carried out in the UK each year , according to The Healing Foundation .

When ancient retroviruses slipped bits of their DNA into the primate genome millions of years ago , they successfully preserved their own genetic legacy .
Today an estimated 8 percent of the human genetic code consists of endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs ) -- the DNA remnants from these so - called " selfish parasites . "
Surprisingly , the infected hosts and their primate descendants also appear to have benefited from this genetic invasion , new evidence suggests .
The ancient retroviruses -- distant relatives of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -- helped a gene called p53 become an important " master gene regulator " in primates , according to a new study published in the online early edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study , led by researchers at the University of California , Santa Cruz , offers an explanation for how regulatory networks of genes evolved .
Not all genes are created equal ; some are masters that can selectively turn on and off many other genes .
The advent of gene regulatory networks allowed for greater control over gene expression in higher vertebrates .
With tightly controlled variations in gene expression , species that had very similar genetic codes -- for instance , humans and chimpanzees -- could nevertheless exhibit striking differences .
Scientists have long wondered how a master regulator such as p53 gained the ability to turn on and off a broad range of other genes related to cell division , DNA repair , and programmed cell death .
How did p53 build its complex and powerful empire , so to speak ?
Using the tools of computational genomics , the UCSC team gathered compelling evidence that retroviruses helped out .
ERVs jumped into new positions throughout the human genome and spread numerous copies of repetitive DNA sequences that allowed p53 to regulate many other genes , the team contends .
" This would have provided a mechanism to quickly establish a gene regulatory network in a very short evolutionary time frame , " said Ting Wang , a post - doctoral researcher at UCSC and lead author of the paper .

Thus , p53 was crowned " guardian of the genome , " as biologists now call it .
Its job is to coordinate the surveillance system that monitors the well - being of cells .
Indeed , p53 is so important that when it fails , cancer often results .
About half of all human tumors contain a mutated or defective p53 gene .
" Our work provides a new window on the complex biology of p53 , " said coauthor David Haussler , a professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator .
" From a biomedical standpoint , it 's important because these changes only occurred in the primate lineage , not in mice . "
By analyzing and comparing genetic data from different species , the team estimated that certain ERVs entered the genome about 40 million years ago , and spread rapidly in primates about 25 million years ago .
Scientists have long suspected that retroviral elements could play a role in gene regulation .
More than 50 years ago , Nobel Laureate Barbara McClintock observed that transposable elements -- or " jumping genes " -- altered gene expression in maize .
In 1971 , Roy Britten and Eric Davidson theorized that commonly observed repetitive DNA sequences actually served as codes for gene regulatory networks .
The DNA remnants of retroviruses tend to be repetitive sequences and can jump around , when active .
The UCSC team finally gathered concrete evidence to support Britten and Davidson 's hypothesis .
The group trolled the human genome for ERVs , identified p53 binding sites in them , and tested their ability to activate genes regulated by p53 .
More than one - third of all known p53 - binding sites turned out to be associated with ERVs , they discovered .
advertisement
These results raise new questions about the role of so - called " junk DNA , " the vast regions of the genome that do n't code for proteins .
ERVs fall into that category .
Many scientists once believed that such DNA served no purpose , but new data from the Haussler lab and other labs are challenging that view .
" We 're starting to uncover the treasure in this junk , " said Wang .
Moreover , the team has proposed a new mechanism for evolutionary change .
Conventional wisdom says that evolution is driven by small changes -- point mutations -- to the genetic code .
If a change is beneficial , the mutation is passed onto future generations .
Now it appears that another level of evolution occurs that is not driven by point mutations .
Instead , retroviruses insert DNA sequences and rearrange the genome , which leads to changes in gene regulation and expression .
If such a change in gene regulation is beneficial , it is passed onto future generations .
This research should have broad implications , according to Wang .
" Our prediction is that this is a general mechanism that has been around ever since viruses , " Wang said .
" ERV - mediated expansion of a gene regulatory network probably happened more than once and not just in primates .
We predict it led to other master gene regulators , not just p53 . "
BERKELEY , CA  Make way for the real nanopod and make room in the Guinness World Records .
A team of researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) and the University of California at Berkeley have created the first fully functional radio from a single carbon nanotube , which makes it by several orders of magnitude the smallest radio ever made .
This QuickTime video was recorded on the nanotube radio using a Transmission Electron Microscope .
At the beginning of the video , the nanotube radio is tuned to a different frequency than that of the transmitted radio signal so the nanotube does not vibrate and only static noise can be heard .
As the radio is brought into tune with the transmitted signal , the nanotube begins to vibrate , which blurs its image in the video but allows the music to become audible .
The song is the theme music to Star Wars by John Williams .
To see and hear the nanotube radio , click on the image .
“ A single carbon nanotube molecule serves simultaneously as all essential components of a radio — antenna , tunable band - pass filter , amplifier , and demodulator , ” said physicist Alex Zettl , who led the invention of the nanotube radio .
“ Using carrier waves in the commercially relevant 40 - 400 MHz range and both frequency and amplitude modulation ( FM and AM ) , we were able to demonstrate successful music and voice reception . ”
Given that the nanotube radio essentially assembles itself and can be easily tuned to a desired frequency band after fabrication , Zettl believes that nanoradios will be relatively easy to mass - produce .
Potential applications , in addition to incredibly tiny radio receivers , include a new generation of wireless communication devices and monitors .
Nanotube radio technology could prove especially valuable for biological and medical applications .
“ The entire radio would easily fit inside a living cell , and this small size allows it to safely interact with biological systems , ” Zettl said .
“ One can envision interfaces with brain or muscle functions , or radio - controlled devices moving through the bloodstream . ”
It is also possible that the nanotube radio could be implanted in the inner ear as an entirely new and discrete way of transmitting information , or as a radically new method of correcting impaired hearing .
Zettl holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division ( MSD ) and the UC Berkeley Physics Department where he is the director of the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems .
In recent years , he and his research group have created an astonishing array of devices out of carbon nanotubes - hollow tubular macromolecules only a few nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) in diameter and typically less than a micron in length – including sensors , diodes and even a motor .
The nanotube radio , however , is the first that – literally – rocks !
“ When I was a young kid , I got a transistor radio as a gift and it was the greatest thing I could imagine - music coming from a box I could hold in my hand ! ”
Zettl said .
“ When we first played our nanoradio , I was just as excited as I was when I first turned on that transistor radio as a kid . ”
The carbon nanotube radio consists of an individual carbon nanotube mounted to an electrode in close proximity to a counter - electrode , with a DC voltage source , such as from a battery or a solar cell array , connected to the electrodes for power .
The applied DC bias creates a negative electrical charge on the tip of the nanotube , sensitizing it to oscillating electric fields .
Both the electrodes and nanotube are contained in vacuum , in a geometrical configuration similar to that of a conventional vacuum tube .
Kenneth Jensen , a graduate student in Zettl ’s research group , did the actual design and construction of the radio .
Alex Zettl ( left ) and his graduate student , Kenneth Jensen have created the first fully functional radio from a single carbon nanotube , which makes it by several orders of magnitude the world ’s smallest radio .
“ We started out by making an exceptionally sensitive force sensor , ” Jensen said .
“ Nanotubes are like tiny cat whiskers .
Small forces , on the order of attonewtons , cause them to deflect a significant amount .
By detecting this deflection , you can infer what force was acting on the nanotube .
This incredible sensitivity becomes even greater at the nanotube ’s flexural resonance frequency , which falls within the frequencies of radio broadcasts , cell phones and GPS broadcasting .
Because of this high resonance frequency , Alex ( Zettl ) suggested that nanotubes could be used to make a radio . ”
Although it has the same essential components , the nanotube radio does not work like a conventional radio .
Rather than the entirely electrical operation of a conventional radio , the nanotube radio is in part a mechanical operation , with the nanotube itself serving as both antenna and tuner .
Incoming radio waves interact with the nanotube ’s electrically charged tip , causing the nanotube to vibrate .
These vibrations are only significant when the frequency of the incoming wave coincides with the nanotube ’s flexural resonance frequency , which , like a conventional radio , can be tuned during operation to receive only a pre-selected segment , or channel , of the electromagnetic spectrum .
Amplification and demodulation properties arise from the needle - point geometry of carbon nanotubes , which gives them unique field emission properties .
By concentrating the electric field of the DC bias voltage applied across the electrodes , the nanotube radio produces a field - emission current that is sensitive to the nanotube ’s mechanical vibrations .
Since the field - emission current is generated by the external power source , amplification of the radio signal is possible .
Furthermore , since field emission is a non-linear process , it also acts to demodulate an AM or FM radio signal , just like the diode used in traditional radios .
“ What we see then is that all four essential components of a radio receiver are compactly and efficiently implemented within the vibrating and field - emitting carbon nanotube , ” said Zettl .
“ This is a totally different approach to making a radio - the exploitation of electro - mechanical movement for multiple functions .
In other words , our nanotube radio is a true NEMS ( nano - electro - mechanical system ) device . ”
Because carbon nanotubes are so much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light , they cannot be viewed with even the highest powered optical microscope .
Therefore , to observe the critical mechanical motionof their nanotube radio , Zettl and his research team , which in addition to Jensen , also included post - doc Jeff Weldon and graduate student Henry Garcia , mounted their nanotube radio inside a high resolution transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) .
A sine - wave carrier radio signal was launched from a nearby transmitting antenna and when the frequencies of the transmitted carrier wave matched the nanotube resonance frequency , radio reception became possible .
“ To correlate the mechanical motions of the nanotube to an actual radio receiver operation , we launched an FM radio transmission of the song Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys , ” said Zettl .
“ After being received , filtered , amplified , and demodulated all by the nanotube radio , the emerging signal was further amplified by a current preamplifier , sent to an audio loudspeaker and recorded .
The nanotube radio faithfully reproduced the audio signal , and the song was easily recognizable by ear . ”
All four essential components of a radio , antenna , tuner , amplifier , and demodulator , may be implemented within a single carbon nanotube .
When the researchers deliberately detuned the nanotube radio from the carrier frequency , mechanical vibrations faded and radio reception was lost .
A “ lock ” on a given radio transmission channel could be maintained for many minutes at a time , and it was not necessary to operate the nanotube radio inside a TEM .
Using a slightly different configuration , the researchers successfully transmitted and received signals across a distance of several meters .
“ The integration of all the electronic components of a radio happened naturally in the nanotube itself , ” said Jensen .
“ Within a few hours of figuring out that our force sensor was in fact a radio , we were playing music ! ” Added Zettl , “ Our nanotube radio is sophisticated and elegant in the physics of its operation , but sheer simplicity in technical design .
Everything about it works perfectly , without additional patches or tricks . ”
Berkeley Lab ’s Technology Transfer Department is now seeking industrial partners to further develop and commercialize this technology .
A paper on this work is now on - line at the Nano Letters Website .
It will also be published in the November 2007 print edition of Nano Letters .
The paper is entitled “ Nanotube Radio ” and the co-authors are Zettl , Jensen , Weldon and Garcia .
In that same print edition , there appears a paper by Peter Burke and Chris Rutherglen of UC Irvine , reporting on the use of a carbon nanotube as a demodulator .
The nanotube radio research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and by the National Science Foundation within the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems .

It must have been embarrassing for Onterrio Smith , the Minnesota Vikings ' part - time running back and full - time substance abuser , to have airport security people find a plastic penis and bags of dehydrated urine in his luggage .
Hey , I blush when the airport security people examine my electric nose - hair trimmer .
I never want to be asked , " Sir , is this your penis ? "
In Smith 's carry - on bag , inspectors found a Whizzinator kit , which includes bags of powdered pee and the ersatz male genitalia designed to fool drug testers .
But every cloud has its silver lining .
Maybe Smith , who has cost himself millions of dollars by flunking several drug tests over the years , can pick up a lucrative endorsement deal with Whizzinator .
Joe DiMaggio was Mr. Coffee ; Smith could be Mr. Whizzy .
Instead of SMITH on the back of his Vikings ' jersey , he could petition the league to let him wear HE TEST ME .
I hate to stamp myself as an old coot pining for the good old days .
But I miss the innocent era of substance abuse , when the most degrading situation an athlete might face was to be caught in a locker room toilet stall with a pants - down teammate .
Fortunately for Smith at the airport , he had an alibi .
The rig , he said , belonged to his cousin .
Pity that cousin , so desperate to pass a drug test that he relies on the help of Onterrio Smith , serial drug - test - flunker .
The guys I feel most sorry for , though , are Paul Tagliabue and Gene Upshaw .
The Smith incident may cost them the Nobel Prize for fighting drug abuse .
Remember what heroes those two were at those House committee hearings ?
It would have been a different story had the Smith incident come to light before the hearings .
Imagine the painful moment when a congressman waves a Whizzinator and demands , " Mr. Tagliabue and Mr. Upshaw , do you know what this is ? "
Look , I appreciate the potential for comedy in Whizzinatorgate .
I would be shocked if this product does n't show up soon in various forms in movies and TV sit-coms .
I 'm thinking mini-series -- " Desperate Drug - Test Takers . "
What 's sad is that this plastic prosthetic penis is no more fake than the drug testing systems it is designed to fool .
Urine testing for drugs is a poor second cousin to blood testing .
The urine tests , for one thing , do not detect human - growth hormone , a potent performance enhancer with potentially serious side effects .
But Major League Baseball and the NFL , and their respective players unions , settle for urine tests .
The unions reject every proposed upgrade in testing and consider their stance a sign of union strength .
Here 's the funny thing about the players ' unions :
Every time they must choose whether to protect illegal - drug - abusing players or non-using players , the unions always put their weight behind the juicers .
Only when painted into a public - relations corner does a union accept more stringent testing .
The positive fallout from the Smith airport incident is that players who rely on the Whizzinator to keep their careers alive might find their pet trick is now null and void .
Onterrio Smith let the cat out of the bag , so to speak .
Drug -test inspectors who allowed players to produce a specimen without completely disrobing will now demand the Full Monty .
As for Smith , his only hope of staying in the NFL is to give up drugs , and that does n't seem to be an option .
He was kicked out of the University of Tennessee after failing so many drug tests that he lost count .
" It was at least two , probably more , " he said a few years ago .
" I never really thought I had a problem .
It was just something you did coming from the neighborhood I was raised in . "
In that neighborhood , apparently , one thing you did n't do was take responsibility for your actions .
After getting the boot at Tennessee , Smith played victim , saying , " I 'm pretty sure they gave other guys more chances . "
He did allow that flunking all those tests at Tennessee " Was all part of my maturing process .
You learn things the hard way . "
Or not .
Smith got through two years at Oregon with no busts , but despite being a Heisman Trophy candidate he was n't drafted until the fourth round , costing him a truckload of cash ( injuries were a contributing factor ) .
Last season , Smith failed an NFL drug test for either the second or third time and was suspended four games .
It 's not known if his positive tests have been for recreational drugs or for steroids , but at 5 - 10 and 214 pounds Smith is built like a brick Whizzinator .
In an in - depth interview with the El Paso Times yesterday , National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell offered new details about the government 's surveillance activities and the administration 's recent full - court press for expanded wiretapping powers .
McConnell described the hectic week of negotiations that led up to the passage of this month 's FISA legislation , and he denied charges that he had negotiated in bad faith .
Several versions of the legislation were circulated on Capitol Hill in the last week before the August recess , and McConnell said he did n't have time to review the Senate 's latest draft until Friday evening .
At that point , he found provisions he considered unacceptable and insisted that the Senate pass a different version that had first circulated two days earlier .
The Senate passed McConnell 's preferred version and adjourned , forcing the House to either pass the Senate 's language or no language at all .
" Some Americans are going to die "
McConnell charged that as a result of press reports and Congressional debates regarding surveillance activities , " some Americans are going to die . "
That 's because disclosures about surveillance activities will tip off terrorists to the existence of American surveillance programs and prompt them to use alternate communication methods , making it more difficult for the authorities to stop terrorist attacks before they occur .
McConnell did n't elaborate on which specific revelations undermined anti-terrorism efforts .
It can hardly have been a surprise to Al Qaeda that the U.S. government was spying on them or that they were using American voice and data networks to do it .
Still , fear of terrorism is a potent force in American politics , and so McConnell 's charges , however dubious , may persuade some members of Congress to support the administration 's position .
McConnell portrayed this month 's FISA legislation as merely preserving the government 's historic power to conduct overseas surveillance without court oversight .
But as we 've written before , the legislation allows much broader surveillance .
It requires only that surveillance be " directed at " a person outside of the United States , an amorphous requirement that could easily be interpreted to include tapping the domestic telephones of a foreign suspect 's friends , relatives , business partners , and other associates .
Moreover , because the names of specific people being targeted will never be reviewed by a judge , there 's no way to guarantee that the government will heed even that minimal standard .
And because telecom providers are shielded from liability for their participation in any surveillance program put together under the program , they have little incentive to challenge overly broad spying .
The American people are simply being asked to take the administration at its word that it is not abusing its powers .
McConnell declined to give details about what he considered unacceptable in the Senate 's earlier drafts .
And the El Paso Times did not press McConnell on whether he would have been satisfied with narrower legislation that simply clarified that FISA did not apply to communications between two foreign individuals .
Impact on EFF lawsuit
McConnell also acknowledged " under the president 's program , the terrorist surveillance program , the private sector had assisted us .
Because if you 're going to get access you 've got to have a partner and they were being sued . "
Although he did n't mention AT&T by name , McConnell 's statement appears to be a tacit admission of the accusations in the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's lawsuit against AT&T .
That 's a surprising admission because in April , McConnell filed a sworn statement that " The disclosure of any information that would tend to confirm or deny ... an alleged classified intelligence relationship between the NSA and MCI / Verizon would cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security . "
EFF lost no time in pointing out the inconsistency .
" On the government 's theory , the truth that is as plain as the nose on your face remains secret until the private sectors ' assistance has been officially acknowledged by the Administration , " writes Derek Slater on the EFF blog .
" The evidence already on the record is sufficient to move forward with the case , but McConnell 's statement should absolutely settle the question . "
McConnell must have realized that his statements would weaken the government 's state - secret arguments , suggesting that the White House may have decided to shift its legal strategy in the telecom liability cases .
The administration may be worried about an embarrassing legal setback if the Ninth Circuit rejects its state secrets argument .
McConnell may have concluded that going public about the program would help him obtain legislation from Congress granting telecom companies retroactive blanket immunity for their participation in the wiretapping program .
Expect the White House to push hard for immunity legislation when Congress reconvenes in September .
Know Your Food Coloring Posted by Pile ( 15971 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Used in everything from soft drinks to canned vegetable , food coloring is pervasive in our society .
Here 's a short guide to the various food colors and whether or not you 'll be that excited about seeing them in your food from now on ..
Seven Major Food Color Additives
Today , because of chemical advances , not only are more vibrant and often superfluous colors available , but the usage of these chemicals is far more widespread .
Often on a list of ingredients , one can find “ for color ” rather easily .
However , until the Food and Drug Act of 1906 , regulation for coloring was not in place for the United States of America .
The current regulations allow for seven main dyeing agents .
Blue No. 1
First among the accepted list is Blue No. 1 , or Brilliant Blue FCF , which creates — as you might have guessed — a medium blue shade .
This coloring was actually banned in Austria , Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Greece , Italy , Norway , Spain , Sweden , and Switzerland , but has since been let back into most of the countries under the European Union .
Blue No. 1 can be found in some dairy products , sweets , and drinks .
Blue No. 1 uses coal tar as one of its components .
Because of the use of coal tar , many organizations and circles are speaking out and boycotting products using colors with coal tar because it is a carcinogenic in large quantities , known to cause tumors in lab rats .
It is also feared because only 50 % of coal tar ’s components have been identified .
One thing that Blue No. 1 does not cause is hyperactivity , which was disproved after testing .
Only 95 % of the coloring is absorbed by the body ’s gastro - intestinal lining .
Blue No. 2
Second is Blue No. 2 , which is commonly added to tablets and capsules , but is also used in ice cream , sweets , baked goods , confectionery , and cookies .
Also known as Indigotine , the color was extracted originally from several species of plant as well as one of the two famous Phoenician sea snails or from woad , but nearly all indigo dye produced today for food or textile is synthetic .
It is possible to have an allergic reaction to Blue No. 2 .
Green No. 3
Green No. 3 , or Fast Green FCF , can be used for tinned green peas and other vegetables , jellies , sauces , fish , desserts , and dry bakery mixes at level of up to 100 mg / kg .
Fast Green FCF produces a sea green .
Green No. 3 is poorly absorbed by the intestines .
Red No. 40
Red No. 40 was introduced as a replacement for Red No. 2 because Red No. 2 , or Amaranth , was a suspected carcinogenic .
It has the appearance of a dark red powder .
Red No. 40 can be found in sweets , drinks and condiments , medications , and cosmetics .
Despite the popular misconception , Allura Red AC is not derived from the cochineal insect .
Red AC is derived from coal tar .
Carmine ( or Crimson Lake , Natural Red 4 ) , however , is the coloring extracted from dried cochineal beetles .
It is banned in Denmark , Belgium , France , Germany , Switzerland , Sweden , and Austria .
It was once feared as a carcinogenic , but this has since been disproved .
It has , however , caused allergic reactions in people as well as hyperactivity in children .
Red No. 3
Also known as Erythrosine , Red No. 3 is a cherry - pink coal tar - based food dye .
It is also used in printing inks , as a biological stain , a dental plaque disclosing agent and a radiopaque medium .
It is used in cherries , canned fruit , custard mix , sweets , baked goods , and snack foods .
It can cause sensitivity to light and learning difficulties , can increase thyroid hormone levels and lead to hyperthyroidism , and was shown to cause thyroid cancer in rats in a study in 1990 .
Yellow No. 5
Yellow No. 5 , or Tartrazine , is used for yellow coloring , but can also be used with Brilliant Blue FCF or Green S to produce various green shades .
Use of tartrazine is banned in Norway and was banned in Austria and Germany , before European Parliament lifted the ban .
Yellow No. 5 can be found in soft drinks , instant puddings , flavored chips ( Doritos , etc ) , cake mixes , custard powder , soups , sauces , kool - aid , ice cream , ice lollies , candy , chewing gum , marzipan , jam , jelly , marmalade , mustard , horseradish , yogurt , noodles , pickles and other pickled products , certain brands of fruit squash , fruit cordial , chips , tim tams , and many convenience foods together with glycerin , lemon and honey products .
Yellow No. 6
Also known as Sunset Yellow FCF , this dye is an orange coal tar - based food dye found in orange squash , orange jelly , marzipan , Swiss roll , apricot jam , citrus marmalade , lemon curd , fortune cookies , sweets , hot chocolate mix and packet soups , trifle mix , breadcrumbs and cheese sauce mix and soft drinks .
It is the color most prominently seen in DayQuil .
It is capable of causing allergic reactions such as abdominal pain , hyperactivity , hives , nasal congestion , and bronchoconstriction , as well as kidney tumours , chromosomal damage , and distaste for food .

Blue No 2 & Red No 40 researched for its anti-cancer properties
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-08 19:53:18
In my following reference to these two food coloring agents , also used in various condiments and sweets , I wish to underline my suspicion that the allergic reactions reported could vary due to impurities or possible slight variations in chemical composition due to various haphazard or uncontrolled production lines .
In other words , I feel that more research could be needed in order to understand better which production process gives a most reliable coloring agent - that could be further tested for purity and to identify possible causes or allergy , irritability or other side effects .
Generally simple natural processes contain least toxic biproducts and risky impurities - but we must remember that not all purified natural sources are necessarily healthy , until thoroughly understood .
Fruit extract coloring agents appear to be with least side effects , but there could be a problem of shelf life from oxidation , exposure to light , bacteria or simple internal reactions due to sustained temperature .
Proper research on how to preserve and apply natural coloring agents , in my view , could be a step ahead in the future of turning foods and nutrition into cures for illnesses - not to speak of the psychological effect of nice colors - yet positive aromas have also been discovered to have a positive effect due to their abilities to kill off bacteria and viruses .
Recent efforts in the US State of Oregon can help pave the way towards understanding at least two specific coloring agents , Blue No 2 and Red No 40 .
To my humble opinion , it is important to note that Red No 40 and Blue No 2 , as any other good coloring , can vary somewhat in chemical composition , and this may have made a huge difference for various Food and Drug administrations who may have been forced to ban various food additives due to their negative effects .
When trying to produce coloring agents , dyes or lakes , even uniform extraction and further manipulation can cause a huge difference .
EVEN if a uniform chemical composition is acheived , molecules can vary in parts and on their ' molecular side chains ' while retaining the desired color , but not necessarily with the same effect on human body .
Therefore , more investigation is needed to ensure a uniform natural product that could prove to be less ' allergenic ' or allergy causing .
With this prologue explanation , I feel more comfortable to go on to my reference source :
It was through Foxnews Health section that I heard about these two coloring agents being presently being investigated for their anti-cancer properties .
Both coloring agents apparently have anti-cancer properties .
Blue No 2 and Red No 40 were tested in trout and found to counter a potent carcinogen toxin called Aflatoxin that causes liver cancer .
Aflotoxin can be found in certain mouldy peanuts and pistachios .
Red No 40 may also counter a cancer causing compound called dibenzopyrene found in cigarettes .

All this said and presented , I feel it is paramount to help change public culture towards preventing the constant pollution of the environment with POPs ( Persistant Organic Pollutants ) and other more transient pollutants that endanger the lives of unaware innocent people .
I have previously called to main UN members as the USA to help ensure that all petrochemical producers as well as oil exporting countries should take the lead on paying taxes in order to help contribute towards global health and security .
I feel it is unjust to expect the USA to automatically bear all burdens of tyranny , terror and drug cartel corruption horrors - but by advancing mutual understanding , people in the USA too will feel encouraged and more and more happy and enabled to help more where people need it most .
With the help of leading nations as the USA , a global economical system of taxes , subsidies and rewards could help encourage people who are devoted to good works and towards helping make industry and traffic more environment friendly and healthy .
Kind hearted educators and teachers must needs also be rewarded and encouraged so that people sooner realize that efforts towards healthy food and environment are essential , with a kindly mindst , to help towards preventing disease - instead of leaving problems to the a last moment act of desperation .
We can help color each others ' lives with good kindly deeds , and when we change ' color of attitude ' the world will become a more hopeful place for good people everywhere .
May the Almighty bless ,

The Peace Canal Israel - Jordan Project Aims to Save Dead Sea
The Dead Sea is rapidly shrinking .
Its coastlines are crumbling and its water is becoming too salty .
Now Israel and Jordan plan to build a huge canal to divert water from the Red Sea in a bid to save the ailing sea .
Maliki blasts Blackwater firm for other incidents
By Leila Fadel — McClatchy Newspapers
BAGHDAD — Blackwater security guards who protect top U.S. diplomats in Iraq have been involved in at least seven serious incidents , some of which resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki said Wednesday .
Maliki did n’t detail the incidents , which he said add to the case against the North Carolina - based security firm .
Blackwater ’s license to operate here has been revoked while U.S. and Iraqi officials investigate a shooting Sunday that Iraqi officials now say left at least 11 people dead .
But Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammed al Askari told McClatchy Newspapers that one of the incidents was former Iraqi Electricity Minister Ahyam al Samarrai ’s escape from a Green Zone jail in December .
Samarrai had been awaiting sentencing on charges that he had embezzled $ 2.5 billion that was intended to rebuild Iraq ’s decrepit electricity grid .
Another incident , Askari said , was the shooting death last month of a Baghdad taxi driver when Blackwater guards led a convoy the wrong way down a street .
When the taxi driver failed to stop quickly enough as the convoy approached , the Blackwater guards opened fire , Askari said .
Maliki left no doubt that he had already made up his mind about Blackwater ’s culpability in Sunday ’s incident , which Blackwater has characterized as an ambush , but which survivors and witnesses have described as an unprovoked shooting spree .
The prime minister said Iraqi citizens were shot in “ cold blood . ”

The giant words seem jarring on the wall of a synagogue — “ Resident Evil : Extinction ” — and , indeed , they have stopped pedestrians in their tracks along West 34th Street , between Eighth and Ninth Avenues .
The sign on the side of Congregation Beth Israel - West Side Jewish Center advertises the latest installment of an apocalyptic , zombie - filled movie series based on the “ Resident Evil ” video games .
It was installed by OTR Media , which manages the sign space .
And it has apparently offended no one in the Orthodox congregation , said the congregation ’s rabbi , Jason Herman .
The billboard is a source of helpful income for building maintenance , Rabbi Herman said .
He said the congregation has the right to veto the advertising content but that OTR Media generally tried to be mindful of the synagogue ’s sensibilities .
For his part , he said , he tries to be judicious in using his veto power , limiting it to ads that use profanity or feature “ immodestly dressed people . ”
As to the current sign , Rabbi Herman said , “ Not every ad that goes up there would be 100 percent to our liking , but we did n’t feel this was something that was worth making the ad agency ’s job more difficult . ”
Craig Venter , the controversial DNA researcher involved in the race to decipher the human genetic code , has built a synthetic chromosome out of laboratory chemicals and is poised to announce the creation of the first new artificial life form on Earth .
The announcement , which is expected within weeks and could come as early as Monday at the annual meeting of his scientific institute in San Diego , California , will herald a giant leap forward in the development of designer genomes .
It is certain to provoke heated debate about the ethics of creating new species and could unlock the door to new energy sources and techniques to combat global warming .
Mr Venter told the Guardian he thought this landmark would be " a very important philosophical step in the history of our species .
We are going from reading our genetic code to the ability to write it .
That gives us the hypothetical ability to do things never contemplated before " .
The Guardian can reveal that a team of 20 top scientists assembled by Mr Venter , led by the Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith , has already constructed a synthetic chromosome , a feat of virtuoso bio-engineering never previously achieved .
Using lab - made chemicals , they have painstakingly stitched together a chromosome that is 381 genes long and contains 580,000 base pairs of genetic code .
The DNA sequence is based on the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium which the team pared down to the bare essentials needed to support life , removing a fifth of its genetic make - up .
The wholly synthetically reconstructed chromosome , which the team have christened Mycoplasma laboratorium , has been watermarked with inks for easy recognition .
It is then transplanted into a living bacterial cell and in the final stage of the process it is expected to take control of the cell and in effect become a new life form .
The team of scientists has already successfully transplanted the genome of one type of bacterium into the cell of another , effectively changing the cell 's species .
Mr Venter said he was " 100 % confident " the same technique would work for the artificially created chromosome .
The new life form will depend for its ability to replicate itself and metabolise on the molecular machinery of the cell into which it has been injected , and in that sense it will not be a wholly synthetic life form .
However , its DNA will be artificial , and it is the DNA that controls the cell and is credited with being the building block of life .
Mr Venter said he had carried out an ethical review before completing the experiment .
" We feel that this is good science , " he said .
He has further heightened the controversy surrounding his potential breakthrough by applying for a patent for the synthetic bacterium .
Pat Mooney , director of a Canadian bioethics organisation , ETC group , said the move was an enormous challenge to society to debate the risks involved .
" Governments , and society in general , is way behind the ball .
This is a wake - up call - what does it mean to create new life forms in a test - tube ? "
He said Mr Venter was creating a " chassis on which you could build almost anything .
It could be a contribution to humanity such as new drugs or a huge threat to humanity such as bio-weapons " .
Mr Venter believes designer genomes have enormous positive potential if properly regulated .
In the long - term , he hopes they could lead to alternative energy sources previously unthinkable .
Bacteria could be created , he speculates , that could help mop up excessive carbon dioxide , thus contributing to the solution to global warming , or produce fuels such as butane or propane made entirely from sugar .
" We are not afraid to take on things that are important just because they stimulate thinking , " he said .
" We are dealing in big ideas .
We are trying to create a new value system for life .
When dealing at this scale , you can't expect everybody to be happy . "
Borse Dubai agreed today to take a stake in the Nasdaq stock exchange and become the first government - controlled stock exchange of the Middle East to hold a significant stake in an American rival , a step that may stir political controversy in Washington .
In a complex four - way deal , Borse Dubai plans to take a 19.9 percent stake in Nasdaq and buy Nasdaq ’s 28 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange .
Dubai will in turn let Nasdaq buy OMX , the Stockholm - based stock exchange operator , over which the two have been locked in a six - week bidding war .
In a separate statement , Qatar , which competes with Dubai as a financial center in the region , said it bought 20 percent of the London exchange but does not currently intend to make an offer .
The agreement allows Borse Dubai , the fastest - growing financial center in the Persian Gulf , to gain access to expertise for its one - month - old enterprise and help it develop into a capital market center in the developing world .
For Nasdaq ’s chief executive , Robert Greifeld , the deal means he can finally fulfill his goal of creating a more global stock exchange after he failed to combine with the London exchange in the past while the rival NYSE Group successfully merged with Euronext .
“ Our primary objective is to build a world class , growth oriented exchange out of Dubai and to become the center for capital markets activities in the emerging markets , ” Borse Dubai ’s chairman , Essa Kazim , said in a statement today .

Appearing on Fox News Sunday , White House adviser and ' Bush 's Brain ' Karl Rove spoke carefully about his role in the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame , refusing to divulge anything more than what was already on the public record , due to his fear of a civil lawsuit .
Fox anchor Chris Wallace asked Rove , " Why did you discuss with two reporters that Valerie Plame , the wife of Ambassador Joe Wilson , worked for the CIA ? "
" First of all , " Rove answered , " let me say that there is a civil lawsuit filed by Wilson and Plame against a wide variety of people . "
" But that 's been dismissed , " Wallace said .
" But they announced they intend to appeal , " Rove countered , " and so I 'm not going to add anything to the public record .
What I did say to one reporter was ' I 've heard that , too , ' and what I said to another reporter , in essence , was ' I do n't think you should be writing about this . ' "
When asked specifically about the second reporter , Matt Cooper from Time , Rove said that he did n't " recall " the conversation and would " let his notes stand as a record of it , " but that " it 's clear that I 'm talking to him ' off the record ' " in order to warn him off the story .
" But whether it was ' off the record , ' whether you were saying ' I heard that , too , ' whatever it is you were saying , you 're a goverment official , " Wallace noted .
" Why traffic at all in the fact that his wife worked for the CIA ? "
" Look , I didnt confirm it , " Rove insisted .
" If you as a reporter asked ' I 'd like you to confirm this , ' my answer would have been to say ' I can 't . ' "
" But that 's not what you said to Bob Novak , " Wallace interjected .
" That was not confirmation , " Rove argued .
Wallace pressed again , " Should you have even been discussing a CIA operative ? "
Rove struggled to respond , before suggesting that Plame was n't a CIA operative , at the time .
" Look , there are thirty - something thousand people who work at the CIA , I did not ... I 'm not even certain to this day that she fit the definition of a CIA operative , " Rove said .
" I would remind you also if she were , " Rove added , " I suspect the special prosecutor would have done something different about both Richard Armitage , who was the person who had an extensive conversation with Mr. Novak about this , and would have done something different about me . "
Wallace then showed clips from the fall of 2003 in which Bush and former White House spokesman Scott McClellan " denied that you had spoken to anyone about Valerie Plame . "
" Question , " asked Wallace , " Did you mislead the president and Scott McClellan ? "
Rove responded , " No , I did n't , " and claimed that he was " very clear right from the beginning on this . "
The outgoing presidential adviser then stumbled over special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald 's name , calling him " Peter Fitzpatrick . "
" When was the first time you told the president ? "
Wallace asked Rove .
Rove would n't answer .
" Im not going to  again , nice try , " Rove said .
" I 'm not going to expand on the public record . "
At The Corner , Andy McCarthy observes , " Karl Rove really comes across as smart and likeable ... perhaps because he is smart and likeable . "
While Think Progress , reporting on Rove 's appearances on CBS , NBC and Fox on Sunday , argued that he " was treated largely with kid gloves by the hosts and was not forced to confront many difficult questions about his ethical improprieties while serving in the White House . "

So , many of you may have seen the erroneous report that JetBlue has canceled the Yearly Kos sponsorship .
Well , like nearly everything you see on the Faux News channel , that report is out and out false .
Here are the facts :
JetBlue confirmed that it will remain a sponsor of the Yearly Kos Convention .
As a sponsor , it donated 10 free roundtrip JetBlue tickets for speakers and staff to fly to and from the convention .
JetBlue has confirmed that its logo will remain on the Yearly Kos frontpage as an in - kind sponsor .
JetBlue has acted as real heroes here .
They have put up with 1,000's of vicious , hateful emails as a result of Faux News 's false reporting .
And yet they are standing by us .
Please show JetBlue some love .

Physicists used lab experiments and mathematics to generate digital drawings of knots , which vary in the amount of tangling .
The results show how knots form and which factors increase the likelihood of such knots .
Tangled telephone cords and electronic cables that come to resemble bird nests can frazzle even the most stoic person .
Now researchers have unraveled the mystery behind how such knots form .
Two physicists used string - tumbling experiments and mathematical models to create a step - by - step recipe for knot formation and determined which factors cause the knottiest knots .
Their research , published online this week by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , sheds light on an everyday phenomenon about which little was known beyond the madness it incites .
" It 's a common annoyance in everyday life , that anything that 's like a string inevitably seems to get itself into a knot , ” said the study 's senior author Douglas Smith of the University of California , San Diego .
He added , “ Very little experimental work had been done to apply knot theory to the analysis and classification of real , physical knots . "
All tied up
Smith and UCSD colleague Dorian Raymer ran a series of homespun experiments in which they dropped a string into a box and tumbled it for 10 seconds ( one revolution per second ) .
They repeated the string - dropping more than 3,000 times varying the length and stiffness of the string , box size and tumbling speed .
Digital photos and video of the tumbling strings revealed : Strings shorter than 1.5 feet ( .46 meters ) did n't form knots ; the likelihood of knotting sharply increased as string length went from 1.5 feet to 5 feet ( .46 meters to 1.5 meters ) ; and beyond this length , knotting probability leveled off .
Observations could only go so far .
“ It is virtually impossible to distinguish different knots just by looking at them , ” Raymer said .
Raymer developed a computer program to try and mimic their observations .
From the model , they created a simplified " lifecycle " of a knot from tidy beginning to titanic tangle .
Once dropped , the string formed concentric coils .
Next , the string 's free end weaved through the coils , with a 50 percent likelihood of crossing under or over the coil and following a path to the left or right .
Knot busters
The best knotting came from very flexible , long string contained in a large box .
" A highly flexible string placed in a very large container will have a higher probability of becoming knotted than a stiff one that 's confined in a smaller container , " Smith told LiveScience .
The researchers suggest that cramped quarters limit the tumbling motion that facilitates the string weaving through the coils .
That would explain why knots were less likely to form in smaller compared with larger boxes .
But in real life , most people do n't tumble cords and wires on a daily basis .
Smith explained that while this tumbling is not a requirement for knots to form , some motion is necessary .
" Surprisingly little disturbance or motion is even needed , " Smith said .
" It 's quite easy for something to get knotted . "
Even the act of picking up the phone and placing it back down could be enough jostling to trigger knot formation .
While there is no magical knot buster , Smith advised what all sailors , cowboys , electricians , sewers and knitters know : to avoid tangles , keep a cord or string tied in a coil so it can't move .
Snipers say they felt pressure to raise kill count in Iraq John Byrne

The murder trial of the " Painted Demons , " an elite US sniper unit that prided itself on fomenting fear in the so - called triangle of death has revealed a shocking -- but perhaps not unexpected -- product of war .
According to the LA Times , the Painted Demons ' trial at Camp Victory , on the grounds of the Baghdad airport , portrays a group of young soldiers who say they were pressured to kill .
" Interviews and court transcripts portray a 13 - man sniper unit that felt under pressure to produce a high body count , a Vietnam - era measure that the Pentagon officially has disavowed in this war , " writes Times reporter Ned Parker .
" They describe a sniper unit whose margins of right and wrong were blurred : by Hensley , if you believe Army prosecutors ; by the Army , if you believe the accused .
The main line of defense for two of the soldiers is that officers advocated that they leave weapons as bait and allowed snipers to kill anyone who came to pick them up .
The Army says this practice amounts to murder , and paints the soldiers as " rogue " elements of a professional force .
Not everyone agrees .
James Culp , defense attorney for 23 - year - old Evan Vela , who stands accused of murder , says the Pentagon is trying to blame a widespread practice on a few men .
" I do n't know how far up the chain this baiting program goes right now .
I know the government is trying to dummy this down to the lowest level possible , " Culp told the LA Times .
He and other attorneys say the baiting practice came down from on high -- from the battalion commander if not higher .
A recent Washington
Post report alleged that at the urging of Pentagon experts in special operations , US military snipers operating in Iraq are " baiting " Iraqis by scattering items like detonation cord , plastic explosives and ammunition and then ambushing and killing those who pick them up .
The newspaper said the classified program was described in investigative documents , that the Army refused to comment upon .
Documents supplied by family members of the accused soldiers allegedly claim that members of the Pentagon 's Asymmetric Warfare Group visited his the alleged murderer 's unit in January and passed along ammunition boxes filled with the " drop items " to be used to disrupt ... attempts at harming Coalition Forces and give us the upper hand in a fight . "
Prior to this practice , commanders repeatedly seemed unhappy with the snipers ' performance , the LA Times says .
" There was a moral question hovering over the sniper team , " he writes .
" If they had been authorized to bait an area with bomb - making materials and other props , then lie in wait to kill anyone who fell for the trap , could n't they also lay the props down after they killed someone ?
The Army 's stance : absolutely not .
But there was pressure to produce results .
" The directions to the snipers in the swamps seemed to be that it was OK to interpret rules of engagement liberally . "

" QUANTUM SHOT " # 127
Top 10 Most Curious States of Equilibrium .
These simple experiments you can try at home .
They are described in a book " La Science Amusante " by Tom Tit ( pen name of Arthur Good ) with illustrations by Poyet , published in Paris in 1890 .
( translated from Russian version by Avi Abrams )
1. Pencil + pocket knife
Simply stick the pocket knife 's blade into a pencil and balance it on its tip .
( depending on how wide you open the knife , the pencil will tilt accordingly )
------------------
2 . Soup ladle + pocket knife
Try to fill the spoon with sugar , increasing its weight : the whole structure will still stand , with knife rising higher till the new state of balance is achieved .
------------------
3. Overturned Plate + soup ladle + spatula
Even more interesting is the stable equilibrium of overturned plate , balancing on the bottle 's edge .
------------------
4. Egg + bottle
Stick a couple of identical forks into a cork ( make a small indent in this cork to make a better fit with an egg 's surface )
Then you can easily balance the egg - on the edge of a bottle !
------------------
5 . Two forks + a quarter
It 's possible to pour water , with a coin balancing on the rim of a pouring glass ( with two forks attached to the coin ) .
Ask your friend to try it , and he 'll probably refuse , but it 's really not that difficult .
------------------
6 . Balancing a plate on a needle
Most of the time the object has to rotate in order to achieve such balance , but in this case the plate is STANDING STILL .
Slice a couple of corks in half , and place them as shown on the plate 's edge , with forks hanging slightly on the angle .
Place the plate on a tip of a needle .
Voila !
You can even rotate this system , and it should rotate steadily for long time .
------------------
7. Amazing Equilibrium of Pens and Pencils
This is a bit more complex structure , but even more fascinating .
Hang a pencil with a thread attached to its tip ( and 2 balancing knifes ) , add another pencil , balanced with 2 sharp - tipped pens .
------------------
8. Lift 15 matches with one
First place 14 matches on top of one match , laying perpendicular to the rest ( as shown ) .
Then you can lift all of these matches from the table , if you put one more match on top of crisscrossed ones .
------------------
9 . Balance all 28 domino pieces on one !
Exactly as shown .
Start building with three pieces for support .
Then remove the other two supporting pieces from the sides - the structure will balance on one domino piece ( just do n't move the table )

10 . Candle Wax Motor
This engine will work without any steam , gas or electricity .
All you need is a ... candle .
First , balance the candle ( pierced with a pin ) between two glasses .
Then light the candle from BOTH ends .
As the wax melts , it will drip into a cup , making corresponding end of a candle lighter - so the other end will swing lower , causing the wax to drip from this other end faster , making this end lighter ... etc .
The candle 's oscillations will soon increase , and you will observe A WAX MOTOR in action .
You can even carve out little people figures , attach them to both ends , and watch them ceaselessly work .

EWD831 by E.W. Dijkstra , 1982 .
When dealing with a sequence of length N , the elements of which we wish to distinguish by subscript , the next vexing question is what subscript value to assign to its starting element .
Adhering to convention a ) yields , when starting with subscript 1 , the subscript range 1 ≤ i < N+1 ; starting with 0 , however , gives the nicer range 0 ≤ i < N .
So let us let our ordinals start at zero : an element 's ordinal ( subscript ) equals the number of elements preceding it in the sequence .
And the moral of the story is that we had better regard â€” after all those centuries !â€ ” zero as a most natural number .
Remark
Many programming languages have been designed without due attention to this detail .
In FORTRAN subscripts always start at 1 ; in ALGOL 60 and in PASCAL , convention c ) has been adopted ; the more recent SASL has fallen back on the FORTRAN convention : a sequence in SASL is at the same time a function on the positive integers .
Pity !

I 'm beginning to think that the epithet " consumerism " is just another word for freedom in the marketplace .
It 's true that the market is delivering goods , services , and technological advances by leaps , day after day .
People claim that they are so inundated with techno advances that they do n't want any more .
Say no to the latest gizmo !
But we really do n't mean it .
No one wants to be denied web access , and we want it faster and better with more variety .
We want to download songs , movies , and treatises on every subject .
No amount of information is too much when it is something specific we seek .
And that 's not all .
We want better heating and cooling in our homes and businesses .
We want more varieties of food , wine , cleaning products , toothpaste , and razors .
We want access to a full range of styles in our home furnishing .
If something is broken , we want the materials made available to repair it .
We want fresh flowers , fresh fish , fresh bread , and new cars with more features .
We want overnight delivery , good tech support , and the newest fashions from all over the world .
The libraries are going online , as is the world 's art .
Commerce has made the shift .
New worlds are opening to us by the day .
We find that phone calls are free .
We can link with anyone in the world through instant messaging , and email has become the medium that makes all communication possible .
We are abandoning our tube - televisions and landline telephones — staples of 20th - century life — for far superior modes of information technology .
We want speed .
We want wireless .
We want access .
And improvements .
Clean and filtered water must flow from our refrigerators .
We want energy drinks , sports drinks , bubbly drinks , juicy drinks and underground spring water from Fiji .
We want homes .
We want safety and security .
We want service .
We want choice .
We are getting all these things .
And how ?
Through that incredible production and distribution machine called the market economy , which is really nothing but billions of people cooperating and innovating to make better lives for themselves .
There ’s no dog - eat - dog .
Competition is really nothing but entrepreneurs and capitalists falling over themselves in a quest to win the hearts and minds of the consuming public .
Sure , it 's easy to look at all this and shout : ghastly consumerism !
But if by " consume " we meant to purchase products and services with our own money in order to improve the human condition , who can't help but plead guilty ?
The whole history of ideas about society has been spent trying to come up with some system that serves the common man rather than just the elites , the rulers , and the powerful .
When the market economy , and its capitalistic structure , came into being , that institution was finally discovered .
With the advent of economic science , we came to understand how this could be .
We began to see how it is that billions of unplanned economic choices could conspire to create a beautiful global system of production and distribution that served everyone .
And how do the intellectuals respond to this ?
By denouncing it as providing too much to too many .
But are people buying superfluous things that they can do without ?
Certainly .
But who is to say for sure what is a need as versus a mere want ?
A dictator who knows all ?
How can we know that his desires will accord with my needs and yours ?
In any case , in a market economy , wants and needs are linked , so that one person 's necessities are met precisely because other people 's wants are met .
Here is an example .
If my grandchild is desperately sick , I want to get her to a doctor .
The urgent care clinic is open late , as is the drug store next door , and thank goodness .
I 'm in and out , and I have the medicine and materials necessary to restore her to health .
No one would say that this is a superficial demand .
But it can only stay open late because its offices are nestled in a strip mall where the rents are low and the access is high .
The real estate is shared by candy stores , sports shops selling scuba gear , a billiard hall , and a store that specializes in party favors — all stores selling " superficial " things .
All pay rent .
The developer who made the mall would n't have built the place were it not for these less urgent needs .
The same is true for the furniture and equipment and labor used in the urgent - care clinic .
They are less expensive and more accessible than they otherwise would be due to the persistence of non-essential consumer demands .
The computers they use are up - to - date and fast precisely because technicians and entrepreneurs have innovated to meet the demands of gamers , gamblers , and people who use the web to do things they should n't .
The same point can be made about " luxury goods " and bleeding - edge technologies .
The rich acquire them and use them until the bugs are gone , the imitators are aroused , capitalists seek out cheaper suppliers , and eventually prices tumble and the same technology hits the mass market .
Moreover , it is the rich who donate to charity , the arts , and to religion .
They provide the capital necessary for investment .
If you think through any service or good that is widely considered to be a need , you will find that it employs products , technologies , and services that were first created to meet superficial demands .
Maybe you think quality of life is no big deal .
Does it really matter whether people have access to vast grocery stores , drug stores , subdivisions , and technology ?
Part of the answer has to do with natural rights : people should be free to choose and buy as they see fit .
But another argument is buried in data we do n't often think about .
Consider life expectancy in the age of consumerism .
Women in 1900 typically died at 48 years old , and men at 46 .
Today ?
Women live to 80 , and men to 77 .
This is due to better diet , less dangerous jobs , improved sanitation and hygiene , improved access to health care , and the entire range of factors that contribute to what we call our standard of living .
Just since 1950 , the infant mortality rate has fallen by 77 percent .
Population is rising exponentially as a result .
It 's easy to look at these figures that suggest that we could have achieved the same thing with a central plan for health , while avoiding all this disgusting consumerism that goes along with it .
But such a central plan was tried in socialist countries , and their results showed precisely the opposite in mortality statistics .
While the Soviets decried our persistent poverty amidst rampant consumerism , our poverty was being beaten back and our longevity was increasing , in large part because of the consumerism for which we were being reviled .
Nowadays we are being told that consumption is aesthetically displeasing , and that we should strive to get back to nature , stop driving here and there , make a compost pile , raise our own vegetables , unplug our computers , and eat nuts off trees .
This longing for the primitive is nothing but an attempt to cast a pleasing gloss on the inevitable effects of socialist policies .
They are telling us to love poverty and hate plenty .
But the beauty of the market economy is that it gives everyone a choice .
For those people who prefer outhouses to indoor plumbing , pulling their teeth to dentistry , and eating nuts from trees rather than buying a can of Planters at Wal - Mart , they too have the right to choose that way of life .
But do n't let them say that they are against " consumerism . "
To live at all requires that we buy and sell .
To be against commerce is to attack life itself .
National Assembly Elections
8. Sir Nicholas Winterton ( Macclesfield ) :
What assessment he has made of the level of voter turnout in the last elections for the National Assembly for Wales on 1 May . [ 116429 ]
The Secretary of State for Wales ( Peter Hain ) :
The turnout in the recent Assembly elections was disappointing and the Government and the Electoral Commission are looking at ways of addressing that issue .
Sir Nicholas Winterton : The Secretary of State is absolutely right .
The actual turnout for the Assembly elections in Wales was extremely disappointing at 38 per cent .
If that had been the turnout at a general election , the House would be bewailing the end of representative democracy .
Does it not show that the people of Wales do not believe their Assembly is worth anything at all and that their local government and this House are where decisions are made ?
When will he understand that devolution is not always the answer to the problem ?
Peter Hain : Presumably , exactly the same logic applies to the borough of Macclesfield , where the
4 Jun 2003 : Column 145
turnout was just 30 per centDoes the hon .
Gentleman suggest , therefore , that that item of representative democracy should disappear ?
Of course not .
Sir Nicholas Winterton :
It is very well represented .
Peter Hain :
The hon .
Gentleman is a great patriot for Macclesfield I will not take that from him and an excellent Member of Parliament but the truth is that turnout in all elections at every level has been falling across the democratic world .
It is a great concern and we should all address it seriously .
Llew Smith ( Blaenau Gwent ) : Does the Secretary of State accept that the reason for the low turnout in the Assembly elections is probably that voters did not believe that the Assembly was relevant to the problems in the communities ?
If we are to increase the turnout in the next Assembly election , can he advise the leadership of the Assembly to stop wasting money on projects such as the glorified opera house in Cardiff bay , which cost £ 100 million , and instead spend that money to create jobs in some of the most deprived valley communities ?
Peter Hain :
It is important that we recognise that Cardiff and Wales should be going for world - class excellence in every area .
The valley communities that my hon .
Friend and I represent are part of that drive to make Wales a world - class nation .
In respect of turnout , I do not think that one can draw the conclusion that he has reached .
The turnout at the Scottish elections was much lower but the Scottish Parliament has greater powers .
The turnout at the last general election was lower than at the previous one .
We must address the issue across democratic politics on a non-party basis .
Higher and Further Education
9. Alan Howarth ( Newport , East ) :
What plans he has to encourage closer links between higher education and further education institutions in Wales . [ 116430 ]
The Parliamentary Under - Secretary of State for Wales ( Mr. Don Touhig ) : My right hon .
Friend the Secretary of State and I are very aware of the Assembly Cabinet 's strategy for reconfiguration within the Welsh continuing education sector .
We strongly welcome the progress that is being made towards greater collaboration between higher education and further education institutions in Wales .
Alan Howarth :
Will my hon .
Friend continue to study the proposals from University of Wales college , Newport and Coleg Gwent for close integration of the work of the two institutions to enable students in south - east Wales to progress seamlessly to higher levels of skills and qualification , and will he commend that model elsewhere in Wales and the United Kingdom ?
Mr. Touhig : I join my right hon .
Friend in welcoming the important work on closer links between Coleg Gwent and the University of Wales college , Newport .
I know that he takes a keen interest in that issue .
I also welcome the support being given by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales for that
4 Jun 2003 : Column 146
Broadband
reconfiguration and closer collaboration .
A total of £ 5.3 million is being made available across the principality .
I will continue to take an interest in the progress on that work .
Those close links are important to the development of education in Wales .
10 . John Robertson ( Glasgow , Anniesland ) : What discussions he has had with National Assembly colleagues regarding implementation of the Broadband Wales programme . [ 116431 ]
May I congratulate my right hon .
Friend 
Mr. Speaker : Order .
The hon .
Gentleman must first wait for the answer .
The Secretary of State for Wales ( Peter Hain ) :
That is always wise , Mr. Speaker .
I have regular bilateral meetings with National Assembly colleagues , and Broadband Wales is one of the many subject areas discussed .
John Robertson : I apologise , Mr. Speaker I was so excited about getting in on Wales questions .
May I congratulate my right hon .
Friend and his colleagues in the National Assembly on the roll - out of broadband in Wales , and on the £ 110 million that has been invested to ensure affordable broadband in the region ?
Does he agree that the roll - out of broadband is as important in Wales as it is in Scotland , that it is rapidly improving and that a celtic alliance between the two nations should be supported ?
Peter Hain :
The answer is yes , and I welcome the highest talent from all parts of the House to Wales questions .
PRIME MINISTER
The Prime Minister was asked 
Engagements
Q1 . [ 116549 ]
Ms Oona King ( Bethnal Green and Bow ) :
If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 4 June .
The Prime Minister ( Mr. Tony Blair ) :
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others .
In addition to my duties in the House , I will have further such meetings later today .
Ms King : UN weapons inspectors said 12 weeks ago that it was their " strong presumption " that Saddam Hussein had not destroyed , among other things , 10,000 litres of anthrax , 80 tonnes of mustard gas and large quantities of VX nerve agent .
Where are these weapons and what does the Prime Minister say to allegations that their threat has been exaggerated ?
Does he share my
4 Jun 2003 : Column 147
hope that one day , every leader who gases , tortures and buries dead and alive hundreds and thousands of his own people will be removed by force ?
The Prime Minister : In relation to weapons of mass destruction , my hon .
Friend is of course right to say that it was accepted by the entire international community , and not least by the UN Security Council , that Saddam Hussein did indeed have weapons of mass destruction and was a threat to the security of the world , which is why the resolution was passed last November .
In respect of the search for weapons of mass destruction , I would point out to the House that the Iraq survey group , which is 1,300 to 1,400 - strong , is literally now just beginning its work , because the priority after the conflict was to rebuild Iraq and to make sure that the humanitarian concerns of the Iraqi people were achieved .
Perhaps I can take this opportunity to inform the House that the Intelligence and Security Committee actually contacted the Government in early May to conduct an inquiry into the role of intelligence in Iraq .
I welcome this and I can assure the House that the Government will co-operate fully with it .
As for my hon .
Friend 's other point , I hope that we all recognise that in addition to the weapons of mass destruction issue , as I saw for myself in Iraq , the people of Iraq , whatever the problems of rebuilding that country , are delighted that a brutal dictator who murdered hundreds of thousands of their people has gone .
And the British Army and the British people should be proud of the role that this country played in removing him .
Mr. Iain Duncan Smith ( Chingford and Woodford Green ) : The Leader of the House has said that rogue elements within the intelligence services are undermining the Government and that their numbers are growing .
Does the Prime Minister agree with him ?
The Prime Minister :
It is obvious from what the " Today " programme has said if that source is to be believed that of course there was somebody from within the intelligence community who spoke to the media .
But I want to say that the security services and intelligence services do a superb job on behalf of this country .
Over the six years that I have been Prime Minister , they have been magnificent in the information that they have given , in their professionalism and in their integrity .
Mr. Duncan Smith :
The question is not the " Today " programme but that the Leader of the House made very serious allegations about the security services .
I agree with the Prime Minister that the security services fulfil a monumental role on behalf of the Government , but the Leader of the House said that they are seeking deliberately to undermine the Prime Minister .
The Prime Minister can clear this up right now .
Can he tell us how senior he believes these people are and how many of them there are , and what he intends to do about these allegations ?
The Prime Minister : In fairness to the Leader of the House , he did not say that the security services were engaged in anything , but that somebody from the security services was talking and it is pretty obvious
4 Jun 2003 : Column 148
that that is the case .
The right hon .
Gentleman asks me who it is and how senior , but according to the BBC , the source is anonymous , so obviously I do not know .
There is serious point in what the right hon .
Gentleman says , but I do not believe that the person who is talking is a member of the Joint Intelligence Committee and I want to make it clear to the House I have spoken and conferred with the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee that there was no attempt , at any time , by any official , or Minister , or member of No. 10 Downing street staff , to override the intelligence judgments of the Joint Intelligence Committee .
That includes the judgment about the so - called 45 minutes .
It was a judgment made by the Joint Intelligence Committee and by that committee alone .
Mr. Duncan Smith : But the Prime Minister is equivocating .
[ Interruption . ]
Mr. Speaker : Order .
Let the Leader of the Opposition speak .
Mr. Duncan Smith : The Leader of the House , in an interview with The Times and on the " Today " programme , did not talk about one person , but about a growing number of members of the security services .
The Leader of the House made allegations about the security services  [ Hon .
Members : " Oh ! " ] and the Prime Minister is not supporting him .
We are also hearing allegations from others in the security services that the Prime Minister misled Parliament and the country in the run-up to the war .
Those are highly serious allegations .
Surely the essential way to deal with the problem is for the Prime Minister to publish the dossier given to him by the JIC before the one that he published in September .
Will he do that today ?
The Prime Minister :
In relation to all those issues , the Intelligence and Security Committee is at full liberty to go through all the Joint Intelligence Committee assessments and produce a report on them .
Because of the importance of the issue , it is only right that a report be published so that people can make a judgment on it .
However , the claims that have been made are simply false .
In particular , the claim that the readiness of Saddam to use weapons within 45 minutes of an order to use them was a point inserted in the dossier at the behest of No. 10 is completely and totally untrue .
Furthermore , the allegation that the 45 - minute claim provoked disquiet among the intelligence community , which disagreed with its inclusion in the dossier I have discussed it , as I said , with the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee is also completely and totally untrue .
Instead of hearing from one or many anonymous sources , I suggest that if people have any evidence , they actually produce it .
Mr. Duncan Smith : But the Leader of the House is not an anonymous source .
The Prime Minister stands in his place saying that these allegations are wrong .
If so , and if he did not add the 45 - minute point to the dossier , why will he not publish the dossier given him by the JIC before he finally published the one in September ?
Surely that would clear up the point , because it was given to him as evidence that could be put in the public domain .
He can do that now and clear the matter up .
Of course
4 Jun 2003 : Column 149
we welcome the fact that the Intelligence and Security Committee will look into it , but I remind the whole House that the Prime Minister will let that Committee see only the intelligence reports that he wants it to see .
It reports directly to him and he can withhold any part of , or all of , its reports .
However , the Committee is being asked to investigate the Prime Minister 's role and that of his closest advisers .
Given the allegations made by the Leader of the House today , surely the only way to clear up the problem is to have an independent inquiry ?
The Prime Minister : As far as I am aware , the Leader of the House was not making an allegation about the intelligence being wrong .
On the contrary , he was rebutting the allegation that the intelligence was wrong .
In relation to the Intelligence and Security Committee , it is not true that I will withhold from it the Joint Intelligence Committee assessments .
I will give it all the JIC assessments .
In addition , the Committee can , in accordance with its normal practice , interview those people in the security services who drew up the JIC reports .
That is surely a fair way to proceed .
I will then publish the report .
If I may say so to the right hon .
Gentleman , he had intelligence briefings as well .
I suspect that the problem for him is that he has been wondering over the past few days whether to jump on this particular bandwagon or not , and he has made the wrong choice .
Mr. Duncan Smith rose 
Hon . Members : More !
Mr. Speaker : Order .
Mr. Duncan Smith : The allegations made by the Leader of the House today have changed everything .
He is alleging that elements of the security services are actually seeking to undermine the Government .
The Prime Minister cannot pretend that this is just a simple and small issue .
The whole credibility of his Government rests on clearing up these charges .
I simply say to the Prime Minister that these allegations are not going to go away .
He has one former Cabinet Minister who says that he has duped the Cabinet ; another says that he committed a monumental blunder ; and , today , the Leader of the House has attacked members of the security services .
Surely the reality is that the only way is to hold an independent judicial inquiry , if he will not produce the evidence , and to do it today .
The Prime Minister : I have already said that we will produce all the evidence for the Intelligence and Security Committee .
I really think that that is the sensible and right way to proceed .
It can then come to a considered judgment and I will publish the report .
I repeat that all the allegations that have been made are completely without any substance .
Indeed , if the right hon .
Gentleman wants me to , I shall go through a few more .
For example , it was reported that there was a meeting in New York between the Foreign Secretary and Colin Powell in which they expressed their doubts about weapons of mass destruction .
On the day concerned , the Foreign Secretary was in France .
As for the allegation in The Mail on Sunday that the German Foreign Minister ,
4 Jun 2003 : Column 150
Joschka Fischer , ambushed me over weapons of mass destructionlies .
I have the following statement from the German embassy :
" The German embassy rejects in the strongest possible terms your " 
" claims made on today 's front page article . . .
The content and the quotations attributed to Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer are pure fiction . "
That at least is consistent .
It was alleged that the source for the 45 minute claim was an Iraqi defector of dubious reliability .
He was not an Iraqi defector and he was an established and reliable source .
Mr. Duncan Smith :
The truth is that nobody believes a word that the Prime Minister is saying now .
[ Interruption . ]
That is the truth .
We now have the unedifying sight of the Leader of the House being sent out to do the Prime Minister 's bidding and to attack elements of the security services , which is disgraceful .
Will the Prime Minister either publish that dossier right now , or hold an independent inquiry so that the public can judge for themselves ?
The Prime Minister : Again , let me point out to the right hon .
Gentleman that what the Leader of the House was saying was what was clearly true , which is that there were people speaking anonymously to the media .
I want to repeat , however , that in respect of Iraq and of every issue that I have handled over the past few years , our intelligence services have been absolutely magnificent .
I say , with the greatest respect to the right hon .
Gentleman , that the fact is that in the end there have been many claims made about the Iraq conflict .
It was claimed that hundreds of thousands of people were going to die in it ; that it would be my Vietnam ; that the middle east would be in flames ; and the latest claim that weapons of mass destruction were a complete invention by the British Government .
The truth is that some people resent the fact that it was right to go to conflict .
We won the conflict ; thanks to the magnificent contribution of the British troops , Iraq is now free , and we should be proud of that .
Hon .
Members : Hear , hear .
Mr. Speaker : Order .
Q2 . [ 116550 ]
Mr. Andrew Dismore ( Hendon ) : May I remind my right hon .
Friend of the serious school funding problems in my constituency ?
While there are arguments about whether the Government provided enough money or whether the local authority has passed on all that it should have done , parents and teachers are not bothered about who is at fault .
They look to us to sort out the problems , to make sure that there is enough money for this year , and that there is no repeat next year .
Will my right hon .
Friend do all that he can to get to the bottom of the story of what has gone wrong this year and guarantee that sufficient money will be made available next year to ensure that education in schools in my constituency is of the high standard that we have come to expect ?
The Prime Minister : Again , let me say that I totally understand the concerns that my hon .
Friend raises .
4 Jun 2003 : Column 151
They are the reason why Ministers have had several meetings with representatives of the Barnet authority .
As my honourable Friend knows , Barnet received a 7 per cent .
floor increase in education formula spending share per pupil .
That was a significant uplift , but it is true that some schools still have problems .
We are working hard to see exactly where those problems are located and how to deal with them .
However , along with a significant uplift in pension contributions and extra teachers ' pay , there has been real pressure on local education authority budgets .
In some cases , the full amount of education spending has not been passed through .
We need to make sure that it is passed through .
That is what we are looking at , in respect of both this year and next year .
Mr. Charles Kennedy ( Ross , Skye and Inverness , West ) :
The Prime Minister is saying that more time is needed and asking for public patience when it comes to finding categoric evidence of weapons of mass destruction , but does he not understand that many people , in this country and internationally , treat that with some scepticism ?
More time and a degree of patience with regard to the progress already being made were exactly what Dr. Hans Blix appealed to the UN for .
The Prime Minister was unwilling to extend that courtesy to Dr. Blix , despite having voted for it .
Why then does he expect people to extend that courtesy to him ?
The Prime Minister : For two reasons , the situation is completely different .
First of all , what I said in relation to Hans Blix : I do not have the words in front of me now , but I think that what I said in this House , when asked many times , was that , if Saddam was co-operating fully , time was not the issue .
The process could take as much time as Dr. Blix needed .
However , if Saddam was not co-operating fully and even Dr. Blix found that he was not that meant that Saddam was in breach of resolution 1441 .
The second point is that of course the situation is different now that Saddam has been removed from power .
The first priority after the conflict and this , quite rightly , is the reason for the pressure on usis to take the humanitarian and reconstruction measures necessary to put Iraq back on its feet .
The Iraq survey group is 1,300 or 1,400 strong , and it is the main group charged with going into Iraq , investigating all the sites and interviewing the scientists and witnesses .
That group is starting its work nowliterally now .
The reason I ask people to be patient is that the group has just gone into Iraq : it should be allowed to get on with its job , investigate the sites , interview the witnesses and then report back to us .
Mr. Kennedy :
If the Prime Minister acknowledges that public scepticism exists , rightly or wrongly , will he acknowledge also that it is liable to be increased by the comments of the Leader of the House about the rogue elements in the security services ?
Who are the public to trust if the Government are letting it be known that they cannot wholeheartedly trust their own security services ?
Does not that underline the need for a fully independent judicial review of just what has gone on ?
The Prime Minister :
The intelligence that formed the basis of the dossier that we put out last September was
4 Jun 2003 : Column 152
based on Joint Intelligence Committee assessments .
There was never any question of Ministers , officials or anyone else trying to override that .
With the greatest respect to the right hon .
Gentleman , the Intelligence and Security Committee will be able to go through all those intelligence assessments .
If the Committee wants to refer to those assessments , it can .
That will then be published in its report .
Rather than having allegations made by anonymous sources that are completely untrue , is it not better that people with evidence should present it to the Intelligence and Security Committee and allow that Committee to make a judgment ?
The right hon .
Gentleman says that there is scepticism about the matter , but perhaps he should go back and look at some of the words that he has used and the false allegations that he has made .
Then he will see where the scepticism might have originated .
DIGG THIS
It ’s been said often that while everyone is entitled to his own opinion , no one is entitled to his own facts .
Today , we hear misstatements all the time .
Some of them are deliberate lies .
Some of them are just mistakes .
A House committee has just exposed the terrible fact that Army officials fabricated a story about the death of Pat Tillman and lied through their teeth .
The Army knew from Day One that Tillman died from so - called friendly fire , but it was five weeks before Army officials got around to telling the family .
In the meantime , the Army falsified a citation to give him a Silver Star at his memorial service , which was turned into a media event — conveniently timed , his family now believes , to distract attention from the scandal of Abu Ghraib prison .
Tillman did not die fighting the enemy .
He died of American bullets .
The girl from West Virginia , Jessica Lynch , hailed as a female Rambo , in fact was knocked unconscious in a vehicle wreck before she ever had a chance to fire a shot .
She woke up in an Iraqi hospital .
To her credit , as soon as she recovered from her serious injuries , she always told the truth .
The story had been spread by a " government source " that she had fought heroically until the last bullet .
Lies and faulty memories ( Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testified under oath 71 times that he could not recall or recollect ) should not be tolerated even by this pathologically tolerant society .
Mistakes can be forgiven , but deliberate lies are hostile acts .
The liar is trying to subvert your mind and manipulate you into a position favorable to him .
Calling a man a liar was once an act that would prompt a duel , but today people seem to shrug it off .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , recently misstated some information about Saddam Hussein in his attempt to defend the president ’s position .
He said , for example , that Saddam fired " at our planes every day in defiance of U.N. resolutions . "
Not true .
The no-fly zones were never authorized or approved by the Security Council .
They were imposed by George H.W. Bush .
After the end of Gulf War I , the CIA grossly miscalculated the damage done to Saddam ’s army .
Consequently , the CIA urged the Shiites and the Kurds to rise up in rebellion and finish off Saddam ’s government .
When Saddam ’s army began to slaughter both the Shiites and the Kurds , an embarrassed U.S. hurriedly imposed the no-fly zones .
Graham said Hussein sent checks to the families of suicide bombers in Palestine .
This is a partial truth .
Saddam had been sending checks to the families of all Palestinians killed in the struggle for independence before the suicide - bombing tactic was taken up .
He was not subsidizing terror .
He was subsidizing the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation .
The members of the House and Senate have great resources available to them .
Not only do they have large staffs , but there are also the Congressional Research Service , the Government Accountability Office , the great Library of Congress and the Congressional Budget Office .
It seems they should have no excuse for not getting their facts straight .
The problem is that most of them , most of the time , concentrate on getting re-elected .
In the 18th and 19th century , a contemptuous description of such people was " officeholders . "
Seems mild , but it was meant to separate the statesmen from the politicians with no agenda but their own political welfare .
It ’s impossible to have a legitimate debate about anything if the participants lie , do n’t know the basic facts of the issue or deliberately distort their opponents ’ position .
Self - government is the most difficult of all the forms of government , and it requires honesty on everyone ’s part to function .

The Best of Charley Reese
Well , we tried to keep it a secret as long as we could , but to be honest , we 've been dying to tell you about the bun we 've got in the oven .
We 'll soon be welcoming a new addition to the Google Docs & Spreadsheets family : presentations .
First of all , we want to welcome the team from Tonic Systems to Google .
Tonic , which we 've just acquired , is based in San Francisco and Melbourne , Australia .
They have some great technology for presentation creation and document conversion , and it will be a great addition as we add presentation sharing and collaboration capabilities to Google Docs & Spreadsheets .
We 've already freed those of you working in teams from the burdens of version control and email attachment overload when going back and forth on word processing and spreadsheets .
It just made sense to add presentations to the mix ; after all , when you create slides , you 're almost always going to share them .
Now students , writers , teachers , organizers , and , well , just about everyone who uses a computer can look forward to having real - time , web - based collaboration across even more common business document formats .
Our due date is this summer .
We promise to share family photos just as soon as we can .
If you 've ever used GNU / Linux , chances are good that you 've used bash .
Some people hold the belief that using a GUI is faster than using a CLI .
These people have obviously never seen someone who uses a shell proficiently .
In this tutorial , I hope to show you just a few of the amazing features bash provides that will increase your productivity in the shell .
Bang Bang and history
Everyone knows about bash history , right ?
You'd be surprised .
Most modern distributions come with bash history enabled and working .
If you 've never done so before , try using the up and down arrow keys to scroll through your command history .
The up arrow will cycle through your command history from newest to oldest , and the down arrow does , well , the opposite .
As luck would have it , different terminals handle arrow keys differently , so the brilliant minds behind bash came up with additional methods for accessing and making use of the command history .
We 'll start with history .
This command simply gives you a numbered list of the commands you 've entered with the oldest command having the smallest number .
Simple right ?
Here 's an example of history output :
190 ps - axu | grep htt 191 /www/bin/apachectl start 192 vi /usr / local/lib/php.ini 193 cat /www/logs/error_log 194 ps - auxw | grep http 195 pwd
This brings us to bang - bang or !!. !!
tells bash " repeat the last command I entered . "
But the magic does n't stop there , if you order now , you 'll also receive ! xyz .
! xyz will allow you to run the last command beginning with xyz that you typed .
Be sure to add enough to the abbreviation to make it unique or you could run into problems , for instance :
In the example above , ps was ran twice , then pwd .
If you typed ! p you 'd get the output of pwd .
Typing ! ps is just enough to be unique and will execute the ps - auxw | grep http entry in history .
By typing just enough to make your history request unique , give you a much better chance of hitting your targeted command .
: p is n't just an emoticon
If you need to be very sure of the command you 're targeting , :p can be a huge help .
! xyz : p will print the command that would be executed rather than executing it .
:p is also clever enough to add the printed command to your history list as the last command executed ( even though it did n't execute it ) so that , if you decide that you like what was printed , a !!
is all you need to make it happen , cap'n .
Bash provides a couple of methods for searching the command history .
Both are useful in different situations .
The first method is to simply type history , find the number of the command you want and then type !N where " N " is the number of the command you 'd like to execute .
( : p works here too . )
The other method is a tad more complex but also adds flexibility .
^r ( ctrl - r ) followed by whatever you type will search the command history for that string .
This can also be very helpful in cases where you suspect you may have a hard disk failure .
The bonus here is that you 're able to edit the command line you 've searched for before you send it down the line .
While the second method is more powerful , when doing some redundant task , it 's much easier to remember !
22 than it is to muck with ctrl -r type searches or even the arrow keys .
Bang dollar - sign
!$ is the " end " of the previous command .
Consider the following example :
We start by looking for a word in a file
grep - i joe / some / long / directory / structure/user-lists/list-15
if joe is in that userlist , we want to remove him from it .
We can either fire up vi with that long directory tree as the argument , or as simply as
vi !$
Which bash expands to :
vi / some / long / directory / structure/user-lists/list-15
A word of caution : !$ expands to the end word of the previous command .
What 's a word ?
The bash man page calls a word " A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell . "
If you have n't changed anything , chances are good that a word is a quoted string or a white - space delimited group of characters .
What is a white - space delimited group of characters ?
It 's a group of characters that are separated from other characters by some form of white - space ( which could be a tab , space , etc . )
If you 're in doubt , :p works here too .
Another thing to keep in mind when using !$ is that if the previous command had no agruments , !$ will expand to the previous command rather than the most recent argument .
This can be handy if , for example , you forget to type vi and you just type the filename .
A simple vi !$ and you 're in .
Similar to !$ is !*. !* is all of the arguments to the previous command rather than just the last one .
As usual , this is useful in many situations .
Here 's a simple example :
vi cd / stuff
oops !
[ exit vi , twice ]
!*
Which bash expands to : cd / stuff
Circumflex hats
Have you ever typed a command , hit return and a micro-second later realized that you made a typo ?
Seems like I 'm always typing mroe filename .
Luckily , the folks who wrote bash were n't the greatest typists either .
In bash , you can fix typos in the previous command with a circumflex ( ^ ) or " hat . "
Consider the following :
vi /etc/X11/XF86config
oops !
^ 6c^6C
Which bash turns into :
vi /etc/X11/XF86Config
What happened there ?
The name of the file that I was trying to edit was /etc / X11/XF86 Config ( note the capital " C. " )
I typed a lower - case " c " and vi saw my error as a request for a new file .
Once I closed out of vi I was able to fix my mistake with the following formula : ^error ^correction .
Hats need n't be only used for errors ...
Let 's say you have a few redundant commands that can't be handled with a wildcard , hats will work great for you .
For example :
dd if=kern.flp of=/dev/fd0
^kern ^mfsroot
Which bash turns into :
dd if=mfsroot.flp of=/dev/fd0
A few handy movement commands
Sometimes a mistake is noticed before the enter key is pressed .
We 've already talked about terminals that do n't translate cursor - keys properly , so how do you fix a mistake ?
To make matters worse , sometimes the backspace key gets mapped to ^H or even worse something like ^ [ [ ~ .
Now how do you fix your mistake before hitting the enter key ?
Once again , bash comes through for us .
Here are some of the movement keystrokes that I use most often :
^w erase word
^u erase from here to beginning of the line ( I use this ALL the time . )
^a move the cursor to the beginning of the line
^e move the curor to the end of the line
There are more of course , but those are the ones you simply can't live without .
For those who do n't know the ^N notation means ctrl+N , do n't confuse it with hats mentioned above .
tab -tab
One of my favorite features of bash is tab - completion .
Tab - completion works in a couple of ways , it can complete filenames in the current directory or in your $ PATH .
Like the !
commands above , you just need to give bash enough of the filename to make it unique and hit the tab key -- bash will do the rest for you .
Let 's say you have a file in your home directory called ransom.
note , consider the following :
mor [ tab ] ran[tab ]
Will expand to
more ransom.note
Let 's say you also have a file named random in your home directory .
ran above is no longer enough to be unique , but you 're in luck .
If you hit tab twice , bash will print the list of matching files to the screen so that you can see what you need to add to make your shortcut unique .
Aliases
Using aliases is sort of like creating your own commands .
You decide what you want to type and what happens when you type that .
Aliases can live in a few of different places , ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.profile and ~/.aliases are some , but not all .
In fact , you 're not really limited to keeping them all in one place .
Those different files behave differently based upon what kind of shell you 're running , but that 's beyond the scope of this document .
For the purposes of this discussion , we 'll settle on ~/.bash_profile ( used for login shells . )
In that file , usually at the bottom , I assemble my aliases .
Here 's some examples :
alias startx= ' startx 2>&1 | tee ~/.Xlog &'
alias ls='ls -- color=auto '
alias mroe= ' more '
alias H='kill - HUP '
alias getxcvs= 'CVS_RSH=ssh ; export CVS_RSH ; cvs -d [ email protected ] : / cvs checkout xc '
The bottom one will probably wrap , but it provides a great example of why aliases are great .
A whole string of commands has been reduced to something short and easy to remember .
I hope this tutorial has been useful to you .
The most difficult hurdle here is not the learning curve , but simply becoming accustomed to using these built -ins .
Just like learning vi , once you get good with these , you 'll be amazed you ever lived without them .
This is just the tip of the bash iceberg .
If you enjoyed this , you might want to look around the Net for more bash information , or even buy a book !
Do n't miss part 2 !

Ex -Gonzales deputy ' heard rumors ' of political hiring and firing in Justice Department Michael Roston
Published : Thursday May 3 , 2007 Print This Email This
The former top deputy to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told the House Judiciary Committee today that he had " heard rumors " that Justice Department White House Liaison Monica Goodling was using political criteria in making personnel decisions among non-political , career staff .
Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) asked James B. Comey , former Deputy Attorney General , if he had knowledge of Goodling , who recently resigned from the Justice Department and is the subject of an internal investigation , using political criteria in making hiring and firing decisions for career staff .
" I had heard rumors to that effect , and read in the newspaper most recently about an investigation on that subject , after I left the government in the last six months or so , " Comey told Conyers after being subpoenaed to testify before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law .
Comey served as Deputy Attorney General from October 2003 to August 2005 , beginning during the tenure of Attorney General John Ashcroft and continuing after Gonzales ' move to the Justice Department from the White House .
When Ashcroft was obliged to recuse himself from the investigation into the leak of the identity of covert CIA Agent Valerie Plame Wilson , Comey appointed US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald to serve as Special Counsel in the case .
Comey currently serves as General Counsel to Lockheed Martin .
Monica Goodling resigned last month from her position in the Justice Department after invoking her Fifth Amendment rights against self - incrimination and refusing to testify before of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees .
The House Judiciary Committee recently offered her partial immunity from prosecution in order to gain her testimony .
Also during the hearing , Comey testified that he was not aware of problems with the US Attorneys who were fired .
" My experience with those Attorneys was very positive .
The names that I have read in the newspaper have not been consistent with my experience , " he told the subcommittee 's chair , Rep. Linda Sánchez .
Comey explained that he had a primary oversight role on the US Attorneys during his tenure and had been contacted by D. Kyle Sampson , Gonzales former chief of staff who resigned over the manner of the firings , to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various US Attorneys .
" We had a February 28 , 2005 , 15 minute meeting , with him asking me , as best I can recall , who did I think were the weakest , " he said .
However , other than Kevin Ryan , the former US Attorney for the Northern District of California , he said that none of the fired US Attorneys had come to mind as " weak or ineffective . "
Comey also noted that he had similar conversations with Attorney General John Ashcroft 's Chief of Staff in the previous year , and did not recall Sampson bringing up the White House in the Feb. 2005 meeting .
At the same time , Comey said he had no awareness that there was a process initiated to fire the US Attorneys .
" I was not aware that there was any kind of process going on , or that my very brief conversation with Mr. Sampson was part of a process to fire US Attorneys , " he said .
The Committee 's Republicans offered little in the way of inquiry , sticking to a handful of questions on whether or not Comey was aware of any improper reasons for the firings of the US Attorneys .
" So far , this seems to be a fishing expedition that has come up dry , " said Rep. Chris Cannon ( UT ) , the ranking Republican on the Subcommittee , in an opening statement .
" There 's been nothing , at least that I can see up there , that warrants the continued reference to stonewalling , corruption , and other , I think extreme statements by the majority . "
Rep. Mel Watt ( D - NC ) took exception to Cannon 's remark .
" We have an obligation to get to the bottom of this and reassure the public if there has been no wrongdoing , " he said .
Rep. Sánchez also criticized Rep. Cannon 's later suggestion that the subcommittee 's Democrats were " grasping at straws . "
" Nobody at the DOJ seems to know who created the list , or who put the names on the list , " she pointed out .
Additional details can be read at Fire Dog Lake which live - blogged the hearing .
A Little Math Puzzle to Ponder
My good friend Dave Eldan sends me interesting tidbits on a regular basis .
More often than not , they are pulled from obituaries .
Everyone needs a hobby , I guess .
I found his latest missive very interesting .
It is from an obituary by Morton White for the great philosopher and mathematician Willard Van Orman Quine .
( Unless I am dreaming , I actually had dinner once with Quine at the Harvard Society of Fellows .
He was almost 90 at the time and quite a wit .
I remember when the topic of Thomas Kuhn ‘s work on scientific revolutions came up , Quine shook his head ruefully and said , “ Paradigm Lost . ” )
White tells the following story about Quine : Upon hearing that White ’s son Steve was not taught multiplication properly due to a switch in school districts , Quine sent him a letter with the following passage :
Since Stevie misses multiplication , he may enjoy gorging on this one .
Well , so you have these two numbers , see , and you want to multiply one of them by the other .
O. K. , so you write them down more or less side by side , as potential headings of two potentially parallel potential columns , roughly thus : 19 27 Then you go to work on the left one , cutting it in half .
Write the half underneath .
No fractions , though .
If it was odd , just forget the fraction .
If it was 58 .. 537 , just put down 29 .. 268 as its half .
That ’s near enough .
Then , under that in turn , put its half ( ignoring , again , the fraction if any ) ; and so on , until you get down to 1 .
That completes your left - hand column .
19 27
9
4
2
1 Then go to work on the right - hand number , making a column under it by exactly the opposite method : doubling each time .
This could go on forever , but do n’t let it .
Keep your right - hand column lined up with your left - hand column , entry by entry , and stop as soon as you are opposite the bottom of your left - hand column .
19 27
9 54
4 108
2 216
1 432 O. K. , so now you have the two columns side by side .
The next thing to do is to start in on the right - hand column and cross out a lot of it .
Cross out all the entries which have even numbers opposite them in the left - hand column .
Keep only those entries in the right - hand column which have odd numbers opposite them in the left - hand column .
All right , now add up the right - hand column , what ’s left of it after all the crossing out .
The result , unless I have made a mistake somewhere , is the answer to your original multiplication problem .
19 27
9 54
4 108 [ XXXed out ]
2 216 [ XXXed out ]
1 432
— –
513 [ 19 * 27 = 513 ]
It may be that this information reaches Stevie a bit too late to be altogether useful .
If I had tipped him off earlier , he would never had [ sic ] had to learn the multiplication table .
The algorithm actually works , which you will see if you play around with it .
And indeed , although certain aspects of the storytelling are played up to make it seem like magic , after a little study it becomes clear ( even to someone as mathematically handicapped as I am ) why it works .
If you like this sort of thing , it is fun to figure out .
Do any readers know who first invented this trick ?
I doubt it was Quine , but it ’s possible .
Why Are Parents Buying Their Girls the Gift of Surgery ?
Parents shell out for plastic surgery for their teenager daughters .
July 16 , 2007  --
This story originally aired June 24 , 2005 .
Lulu Diaz was excited to show her friends the high school graduation present she got from her parents -- her new breasts .
At Lulu 's high school and at the beauty school she attended on New York 's Long Island , she said the talk among her friends is about how they look , and getting breast implants .
Some of Lulu 's friends have gotten them .
" It just made me want to get them done right there .
And then when I graduated , my parents were like , all right , congratulations , you got a boob job . "
When she was 18 , her parents had bought her a Jaguar for graduation .
She did n't want a car .
They told her : " OK , you can trade it in for new breasts . "
She did .
When " 20/20 " met Lulu 's friend Jennifer O'Brien , she was self - conscious about having smaller breasts .
It showed in her body language .
She covered up her breasts and padded her bra .
Jennifer envied Lulu 's new look .
" Look how much confidence she has .
Like , look at my shirt and look at her shirt , like , you know , " she said .
Jennifer thought she could get Lulu 's confidence by getting breast implants herself .
So , she did .
Six months later , Jennifer said her new breasts have changed her personality .
" I am a loving and caring person , and I 'm outgoing , but the way I used to dress and my body language did n't say that .
And now it does , " she said .
" I feel like a different person .
I have so much confidence , I like , do and say as I want , like , I do n't hold anything back anymore . "
Who paid for Jennifer 's new look ?
Her parents .
" This is a gift of love from us , and we see a difference in her , " Jennifer 's mom , Doreen O'Brien , said .
The gift of breast implants costs about $ 7,000 .
" But I do n't think you can put really a price on your child 's happiness , " she said .
Nineteen - year - old Catherine Houtrids wanted implants too .
She was about to have the implant surgery when I interviewed her .
" I 'm nervous of the pain afterward , just like any human , I think , would be .
But I 'm more excited , you know ?
Like I said , it 's something that I 've wanted and today I get to go have it , " she said .
I do n't get it .
Maybe Catherine has a body image problem ?
I told her she looks fine .
" If I did n't get them and I was in the circumstances where I can't afford them or it just was n't possible , I would be fine with my body , " she said .
But Catherine could afford it because it was her parents writing the check .
Catherine 's mom wanted Catherine to be happy .
" I think she looks fine the way she is but it 's not my choice and ... if it makes her happy , I 'm happy for her , " she said .
Catherine 's parents also wanted to give her a car , but Catherine preferred the breast implants .
Of course , cars can be dangerous .
But so can breast enhancement surgery .
The Food and Drug Administration lists 25 complications , including pain , inflammation , calcification , chest wall deformity , toxic shock syndrome , wrinkling and scarring .
Most patients later have to have second or even third operations because the implants do things like move or break open .
The surgery can later interfere with mammography , increasing the chance that a tumor will go undetected .
And women who have the surgery are less likely to have enough milk for breast - feeding .
The FDA says about 40 percent of augmentation patients have at least one serious complication within three years .
Jennifer was n't bothered by the possibility of complications .
" Well , then I had one to three years of my life where I felt great about myself , and you can't take that back , " she said .
' Quick Fixes ' for Problems Kids Should Work Through
Why would a parent pay for an operation that is risky and medically unnecessary ?
" It 's really fun to give things to your kids and to say yes and to have them like you , " said psychotherapist Laura Gray , who specializes in treating teens .
She said it 's a parent 's job to teach kids that , despite what popular culture says , a better body is not the route to happiness .
I told her how happy Jennifer was in our interview .
It was almost like a commercial for the surgery .
She 's more outgoing .
It 's changed her personality for the better .
Some people who see the interview are going to think , " I want to be that happy . "
But Gray said her question for Jennifer would be : " What was happening for you that was so difficult in life that you were unable to manage it without having breast implants ? "
Gray said it 's a question parents should ask instead of buying their daughters what they hope will be a quick fix .
" What I see today a lot is parents who can not bear for their kids to be uncomfortable .
They do not want them to suffer .
They do n't want them to struggle , " she said .
Why should they suffer , if their parents can afford to give them things , like implants , that will make them happy ?
Jennifer said she was unhappy and did n't feel good about herself with her size A breasts .
" I would have to say , let 's talk about that or what 's that like for you .
That 's what I would encourage a parent to do instead of immediately jumping to their checkbook and saying , ' Let me fix this for you , ' " Gray said .
Gray said when parents try to fix everything , kids do n't develop resilience and coping skills .
" Later in life , my hope is they 'll draw on some of those skills and say , ' You know what ?
I remember a time when things were really hard or really awful or I felt terrible about myself .
But I got through it and I did OK , ' " she said .
Dr. Stephen Greenberg , who performed Catherine and Jennifer 's surgeries , wo n't operate on kids under 18 .
" We have to be the ones to say , ' No , you 're not ready -- psychologically , you 're not old enough .
Let 's just wait , ' " he said .
Peers Differ on Implants and Self - Confidence
Curious what other teens would think about getting the gift of new breasts , we played a clip of my interview with Jennifer for some students at a suburban high school .
" That is saying to your child , well , maybe you are n't as beautiful as you are , " one boy said .
" I think it 's really sad that our society has come to the place where to make a teenage girl happy , you need to spend thousands of dollars increasing her breast size .
When she was obviously a beautiful girl before , " a girl in the group told us .
Another girl agreed , saying , " I think she should have had a little more confidence .
Breast implants should not change your life that drastically . "
On the other hand , some of the kids thought it was just fine .
" That feeling of confidence could stay with her , " one girl said .
Another girl told us she thought the girls ' surgeries were OK since their parents could afford it .
" They have the money to do so and the means to do so and there 's really nothing wrong about giving their child what they want , " she said .
Kara , who had had a nose job , told us she understands why implants would make a girl more confident .
" I had plastic surgery .
So I know that it made me happy inside , " she said .
Jennifer admitted it 's difficult to describe why breast implants would boost her confidence .
" It 's something so hard to explain , how something so materialistic and stupid can just make someone feel so much better about themselves , " she said .
Materialistic and stupid sounds right to me .
" But it 's what I wanted , " Jennifer said .
" And it 's something that 's going to make me happy , and I do n't have any regrets at all . "
Apple Says No Sun File System For Leopard
Despite claims by Sun's CEO , the 128 - bit ZFS that appears in Solaris will not be spotted in Mac OS X .
[ Update , June 12 , 5 pm : This article is based on reporting the statements of an Apple representative who subsequently said he had misspoken about ZFS 's role in Leopard .
A second article reporting the complete , corrected details about ZFS can be found here . ]
An Apple official on Monday said Sun Microsystems ' open - source file system would not be in the next version of the Mac operating system , contradicting statements made last week by Sun 's chief executive .
During an interview with InformationWeek , Brian Croll , senior director of product marketing for the Mac OS , said , " ZFS is not happening , " when asked whether Sun 's Zettabyte File System would be in Leopard .
Instead , Leopard would use Apple 's current hierarchical file system , called HFS +.
The Apple file system was first introduced in 1998 in Mac OS 8.0 .
Leopard is Apple 's sixth iteration of its Mac OSX operating system and is expected to ship in October of this year .
Apple CEO Steve Job highlighted its near completion at the company 's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday .
Croll declined to comment on statements made last week by Sun Chief Executive Jonathan Schwartz , who said the use of ZFS would be announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco .
Upon further questioning , Croll would only confirm that Apple had never said ZFS would be a part of Leopard .
A representative with Sun did not have any immediate comment .
During a Sun event in Washington , D.C. , last week , Schwartz said , " In fact , this week you 'll see that Apple is announcing at their Worldwide Developers Conference that ZFS has become the file system in Mac OS 10 , " Schwartz said .
A video of Schwartz 's speech making the claim also is available online .
Introduced in May , 2006 , the 128 - bit ZFS is part of Sun 's commercial operating system Solaris and its OpenSolaris project .
With a higher bit count than typical file systems , ZFS can create more unique addresses for storing data and files .
Linux , Microsoft Windows Vista , and most Unix systems employ either 32 - bit or 64 - bit file systems , which are expected to meet the needs of even the largest computer systems for the next 10 years .
With ZFS , Sun is thinking beyond the next decade .
ZFS , available under the Common Development and Distribution License , was introduced by Sun in 2004 .
Unlike traditional file systems , ZFS has built - in data integrity and disk volume - management capabilities , instead of requiring its users to add on storage software that tries to overcome a file system 's shortcomings .
Skeptics have said that ZFS as the default file system in Leopard made no sense .
Among the problems in using ZFS is that it was n't designed for consumer use , and it uses up a lot of processing power .

[ EDIT : since this post still seems to get a good deal of traffic , I should note that ( as you can see if you read the comments ) the code I gave here is not quite correct .
Still , it ’s interesting enough that I ’ll leave it up . ]
JD2718 posted a puzzle the other day : the idea is to count how many possible results you can get by combining the numbers 4,3,2,1 ( in that order ) with the four arithmetic operators and parentheses .
Naturally I decided to write some Haskell code to solve this one .
First , instead of thinking in terms of possibly using parentheses , I just generate all possible postfix expressions .
But instead of creating some sort of algebraic data type to represent expressions , generating all possible expressions , and evaluating , I sort of interleaved the processes .
First , I generate the list 4,3,2,1 with operations optionally applied along the way in all possible ways , then reduce them in all possible ways to a single result , discarding duplicates the whole time .
Here ’s the code :
import Data .
Ratio import Data .
List type Op = ( Rational -> Rational -> Rational ) type Stack = [ Rational ] -- make a special kind of division to ignore division by zero .
This -- does n't give any spurious results since if we can get zero as one -- of the arguments , we can legitimately create another zero by -- multiplying .
( // ) :: Rational -> Rational -> Rational a // 0 = 0 a // b = a / b -- turn a normal binary operator into a function which operates -- on the top two elements of a stack .
mkStackOp :: Op -> Stack ->
Stack mkStack Op op ( x1 : x2 : xs ) = ( x2 `op` x1 ) : xs mkStack Op op s = s negateTop :: Stack ->
Stack negateTop ( x : xs ) = ( negate x ) : xs -- operations that reduce a stack ( i.e. binary operations ) stackReducers :: [ Stack ->
Stack ] stackReducers = map mkStackOp [ ( + ) , ( - ) , ( * ) , ( // ) ] -- operations that transform a stack without reducing it ( unary -- operations ) .
to allow unary negation , just add negateTop to the -- list .
stackTransformers :: [ Stack ->

There ’s a little ambiguity in the description of the problem : are we allowed to use – as prefix negation , or just as binary subtraction ?
The code above treats it only as binary subtraction .
In that case we get 52 distinct results ranging from - 5 = 4 – 3 * ( 2+1 ) to 36 = 4 * 3 * ( 2+1 ) .
8 are negative , 28 are integers :

If we allow unary negation , then we get 87 distinct possibilities , 47 of which are integers ( and , of course , exactly half of the nonzero possibilities are negative , since they are just the negations of the positive possibilities ) .
Sunday ’s Washington
Post has an article which highlights the extent to which we ’ve been fighting a losing war for 36 years :
Thirty - six years and hundreds of billions of dollars after President Richard M. Nixon launched the war on drugs , consumers worldwide are taking more narcotics and criminals are making fatter profits than ever before .
The syndicates that control narcotics production and distribution reap the profits from an annual turnover of $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion .
And it ’s not just criminal syndicates like the Mafia that are reaping the profits of the War on Drugs , terrorists are getting into the game too :
Poppies were the first thing that British army Capt .
Leo Docherty noticed when he arrived in Afghanistan ’s turbulent Helmand province in April 2006 .
“ They were growing right outside the gate of our Forward Operating Base , ” he told me .
Within two weeks of his deployment to the remote town of Sangin , he realized that “ poppy is the economic mainstay and everyone is involved right up to the higher echelons of the local government . ”
Poppy , of course , is the plant from which opium — and heroin — are derived .
Docherty was quick to realize that the military push into northern Helmand province was going to run into serious trouble .
The rumor was “ that we were there to eradicate the poppy , ” he said .
“ The Taliban are n’t stupid and so they said , ‘ These guys are here to destroy your livelihood , so let ’s take up arms against them . ’
And it ’s been a downward spiral since then . ”
Despite the presence of 35,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan , the drug trade there is going gangbusters .
According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , Afghan opium production in 2006 rose a staggering 57 percent over the previous year .
Next month , the United Nations is expected to release a report showing an additional 15 percent jump in opium production this year while highlighting the sobering fact that Afghanistan now accounts for 95 percent of the world ’s poppy crop .
But the success of the illegal narcotics industry is n’t confined to Afghanistan .
Business is booming in South America , the Middle East , Africa and across the United States .
In other words , the War On ( Some ) Drugs is putting money into the hands of the people who would use it to buy weapons that would kill Americans , at home and abroad .
The War On ( Some ) Drugs is corrupting the very regime we ’d hoped to put in power to replace the Taliban .
And , it ’s sacrificing the liberties of American citizens .
Think about it this way .
If drugs were legal , the Taliban and Al Qaeda would n’t be profiting from their illegal production .
If they were legal , street gangs in New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago , would n’t be profiting from their distribution .
And , if they were legal , the Fourth Amendment might just be a little more secure .
Verizon , AT&T broadband policies allow for censorship of unfriendly opinions Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 10 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Companies insist they do n't censor customers Buried deep within the dense , legalistic agreements two of the country 's largest telecommunications carriers force subscribers to accept are provisions that could allow the companies to cut access to subscribers who criticize them online .
Los Angeles Times business columnist David Lazarus uncovered the little - noticed clauses in AT&T and Verizon 's service contracts .
In a Wednesday column , Lazarus writes that the companies say they can terminate Internet access " for any behavior that AT&T or Verizon believes might harm its ' name or reputation , ' or even the reputation of its business partners . "
Both companies told the columnist that they have not enforced the policies , which critics view as an inappropriate corporate check on Americans ' freedom of speech .
" Not being able to speak your mind about something is contrary to public policy , " University of Wisconsin law professor Frank Tuerkheimer told the LA Times .
But Tuerkheimer , a specialist in Internet - related issues , said such corporate blocks are not illegal because the 1st Amendment does n't apply to private companies .
The discovery comes after Verizon faced harsh criticism for blocking text - message alerts from Naral Pro-Choice America , an abortion rights group ; the company reversed its decision after an outcry from subscribers .
Earlier in the year , a Pearl Jam concert webcast by AT&T did not include lead singer Eddie Vedder 's criticism of President Bush ; AT&T blamed a contractor for censoring the comments .
A one - line disclaimer in AT&T 's 14,000 - word service contract gives the company right to boot from the Internet any customer who might cross the telecom giant .
Along with " defamatory , fraudulent , obscene or deceptive " behavior , Lazarus writes , customers can be suspended for anything that " tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T , Yahoo [ AT&T's online partner ] or their respective parents , affiliates and subsidiaries . "
An " acceptable use policy " issued to Verizon customers alongside its 10,000 - word contract contains similar prohibitions on obscene , pornographic or racist content , and it tells customers they risk losing service if they " damage the name or reputation of Verizon , its parent , affiliates and subsidiaries , or any third parties . "
A Verizon spokesman , Jon Davies , told the paper that the policy is designed to prevent customers from setting up Web sites that look like Verizon 's to attempt to defraud customers and steal personal information .
Such behavior is explicitly prohibited elsewhere in the contract , meaning Verizon 's terms give the company wider latitude to censor customers ' online communications , the columnist notes .
" But whether or not it 's interpreted that way is irrelevant , " the Verizon spokesman said , " because we 've never used it that way .
Actions speak louder than words . "
AT&T also stressed it had no plans to censor customers and insisted its language was " common " and " designed to protect the brand . "
A spokesman , John Britton , told the paper that the company would be revising its policies to more explicitly enshrine customers ' free speech .
" We are going to clarify the policy , " Britton said , " to make clear that nobody is faced with losing service because they express an opinion about the company . "
A Canadian Doctor provides a fascinating , and for anyone who cares about freedom , troubling , inside view of the kind of medical system that Hillary , Barack , and Michael Moore would like to bring to America :
I was once a believer in socialized medicine .
As a Canadian , I had soaked up the belief that government - run health care was truly compassionate .
What I knew about American health care was unappealing : high expenses and lots of uninsured people .
My health care prejudices crumbled on the way to a medical school class .
On a subzero Winnipeg morning in 1997 , I cut across the hospital emergency room to shave a few minutes off my frigid commute .
Swinging open the door , I stepped into a nightmare : the ER overflowed with elderly people on stretchers , waiting for admission .
Some , it turned out , had waited five days .
The air stank with sweat and urine .
Right then , I began to reconsider everything that I thought I knew about Canadian health care .
But that ’s just the beginning , consider this :
Government researchers now note that more than 1.5 million Ontarians ( or 12 % of that province ’s population ) ca n’t find family physicians .
Health officials in one Nova Scotia community actually resorted to a lottery to determine who ’d get a doctor ’s appointment .
These problems are not unique to Canada â€ ” they characterize all government - run health care systems .
Consider the recent British controversy over a cancer patient who tried to get an appointment with a specialist , only to have it canceled â€ ” 48 times .
More than 1 million Britons must wait for some type of care , with 200,000 in line for longer than six months .
In France , the supply of doctors is so limited that during an August 2003 heat wave â€ ” when many doctors were on vacation and hospitals were stretched beyond capacity â€ ” 15,000 elderly citizens died .
Across Europe , state - of - the - art drugs are n’t available .
And so on .
And yet , here in the United States , we are being told by the elites that it is the Canadian , and British , and European , health care systems that we need to emulate .
I do n’t know about you , but if the cost of government run health care is having to wait for necessary surgery and people dying because there are n’t enough hospital beds , something you never hear of happening in the United States by the way , then I , for one , am not willing to pay the price .
Unfortunately , the media , aided and abetted by the Democratic candidates for President and propagandists like Michael Moore , never tell you about the costs of government run health care .
And , they also never tell you about just how good we have it here :
One often - heard argument , voiced by the New York Times ’ Paul Krugman and others , is that America lags behind other countries in crude health outcomes .
But such outcomes reflect a mosaic of factors , such as diet , lifestyle , drug use and cultural values .
It pains me as a doctor to say this , but health care is just one factor in health .
Americans live 75.3 years on average , fewer than Canadians ( 77.3 ) or the French ( 76.6 ) or the citizens of any Western European nation save Portugal .
Health care influences life expectancy , of course .
But a life can end because of a murder , a fall or a car accident .
Such factors are n’t academic â€ ” homicide rates in the U.S. are much higher than in other countries .
In The Business of Health , Robert Ohsfeldt and John Schneider factor out intentional and unintentional injuries from life - expectancy statistics and find that Americans who do n’t die in car crashes or homicides outlive people in any other Western country .
And if we measure a health care system by how well it serves its sick citizens , American medicine excels .
Five - year cancer survival rates bear this out .
For leukemia , the American survival rate is almost 50 % ; the European rate is just 35 % .
Esophageal carcinoma : 12 % in the U.S. , 6 % in Europe .
The survival rate for prostate cancer is 81.2 % here , yet 61.7 % in France and down to 44.3 % in England â€ ” a striking variation .
Yes , there are plenty of things wrong with health care in America .
Most of them , I would submit , are attributable to unnecessary government regulation and the existence of a health - care insurance system , encouraged by tax subsidies , which hides the true cost of much routine health care from consumers .
In other words , while America is thankfully far from the socialized mess of Canada , Britain , and Europe , there still is n’t a truly free market in health care in this country .
Until that happens , things will continue to be screwed up .

His comments led event organisers to cancel his appearances
Dr Watson has drawn severe criticism over remarks he made in a British newspaper at the weekend .
In the interview , he was quoted as saying Africans were less intelligent than Europeans .
The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory had already distanced itself from the scientist 's comments but its trustee board has now suspended him .
A statement from the Long Island , New York , institution said the action was being taken " pending further deliberation by the board " .
Unreserved apology
Dr Watson was due to give a lecture at the Science Museum in London on Friday as part of a book tour .
But the museum cancelled the event , saying the scientist had gone beyond the point of acceptable debate .
The Bristol Festival of Ideas has also cancelled an appearance by Dr Watson .
And further critical comment of Dr Watson 's views has come from Dr Craig Venter , the scientist / businessman who led the private effort to decode the human genome , and who , by coincidence , is also visiting the UK to promote a book .
" Skin colour as a surrogate for race is a social concept not a scientific one , " Dr Venter said .
" There is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code for the notion that skin colour will be predictive of intelligence . "
Dr Watson helped unravel the structure of DNA
Profile : Dr James Watson
He was further quoted as saying that his hope was that everyone was equal but that " people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true " .
The scientist has since said that the way the words were presented did not reflect properly his position .
" I can certainly understand why people , reading those words , have reacted in the ways they have , " he said .
" To all those who have drawn the inference from my words that Africa , as a continent , is somehow genetically inferior , I can only apologise unreservedly .
" That is not what I meant .
More importantly from my point of view , there is no scientific basis for such a belief . "
Scientific endeavour
And in comments published in The Independent newspaper on Friday , Dr Watson tries to clarify his position .
" We do not yet adequately understand the way in which the different environments in the world have selected over time the genes which determine our capacity to do different things , " he is quoted as saying .
" The overwhelming desire of society today is to assume that equal powers of reason are a universal heritage of humanity .
" It may well be .
But simply wanting this to be the case is not enough .
This is not science .
To question this is not to give in to racism .
This is not a discussion about superiority or inferiority , it is about seeking to understand differences , about why some of us are great musicians and others great engineers . "
Dr Watson was a joint winner in 1962 of the Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA , the molecule that lies at the heart of heredity in living organisms .
When , some 40 years later , Dr Venter and colleagues were finally able to read all of the DNA in our cells , they concluded the concept of race could not easily be described by our genetics .
Venter and his team pointed to the fact that people from different racial groups could be more genetically similar than individuals within the same group .
Genetic studies show that there is more variability in the gene pool in Africa , than outside .
1. Jeff Sutherland welcome to InfoQ .
Tell us what 's your claim to fame ?
In 1993 I was trying to figure out a better way to build software .
I 've been CTO and VPO Engineer at nine software companies ; this was my fifth company in 1993 , and we figured out a way to use a practice which is now called Scrum that worked really , really well .
In 1995 I got together with Ken Schwaber who was CEO for a project management and software company , I brought him in and showed him the team who I 'd been working with and delivering software for many iterations , and he looked at it and he said " this is really the right thing " .
So Ken has helped us for many years to roll this out across the world .
And in recent years I have been able to spring free at least some of the time from my company , because I 'm still CTO of a software company , but I spent a lot of my time travelling around the world talking about Scrum .
2 . Last time I visited the Scrum alliance I noticed that there were 10.000 people trained as certified Scrum masters .
Tell me , who 's doing Scrum ?
Scrum is really taking off , there are a lot of people doing Scrum , we have a certification course that is doubling the number of Scrum masters every year , there are now about 12,000 Certified Scrum Masters , and we know for every Certified Scrum Master there are at least 10 Scrum teams out there that have n't been to any kind of training .
I expect that probably this morning there are 120,000 Scrum teams around the world having their daily meeting .
There are a lot of people doing Scrum .
3 . Is it all really Scrum ?
Are there many flavors of Scrum that you are seeing ?
This is really interesting , because as with anything that explodes in adoption , there are people at various phases of doing it .
In my recent meetings with people who are in training sessions , I have been asking " how many of you are doing Scrum ? "
In fact here at this conference , at Qcon , on Monday we had 30 people at a Certified Scrum Master training course , and I said " how many people are doing Scrum ? " and 15 people raised their hands .
So then I said : Nokia has maybe more Scrum masters than almost any other company , in fact we know Finland is the highest per capita Scrum master in the entire world , mainly because of Nokia .
And they have come up with some simple ideas that allow them to determine whether a team is really doing Scrum . "
4 . How does Nokia tell if a team is doing Scrum ?
They first address the issue of iterative development .
In object technology we 've been doing iterative , incremental development for many years and that 's kind of fundamental to all the Agile processes .
First they want to ask the teams : " are you doing iterative development ? " because you can't even do Agile process unless you are .
The first thing that they say is " Do you have fixed iterations ?
Do you have an iteration that starts at a specified time and ends at a fixed time ? "
And that iteration has got to be less than 6 weeks .
This is not Scrum but this is just their policy .
It 's not iterative unless it 's a time box that 's less than 6 weeks .
If you are not doing that you are not doing iterative development .
Then if people answer " yes " to that they go to the next step and they say " Well , at the end of the iteration , do you have working software ? " and this tends to rule out a lot of people , because if you do n't have working software you are not doing iterative development .
And then they say " Ok , you want to have this working software at the end , so at the beginning you want to be able to start it in an Agile way .
Do you have to have a specification in complete detail before you can start the iteration ? "
If you need to have that , that is not incremental development .
And finally they say " It 's important for working software at the end to have testing as part of the increment :
Do you have testing in the middle of the development ? "
That tends to rule out about half of the Scrum teams before they even need to go on to Scrum issues .
5 . Why does it matter if teams are " doing iterative development ? "
It matters because the whole point of Agile development , in fact there are several interlocking points : you want to get everybody in the process working together , you want to get the people responsible for formulating the product : the people that are building the product , the people that are testing the product , and the users that are going to use the product .
You want them all working together and if you separate things into " these people over here build the spec and they hand over a document to the people that are going to build it , and they hand over software to the testers , and then the testers hand it over to the customer , " the customer says it 's not what they wanted .
And so you cycle back to the beginning and then you go through it again .
And if you go through this 3 times they cancel the project .
That 's why there are so many projects killed all over the world .
You have to be doing everything at once .
6 . You sound like you agree with the criteria that Nokia is applying .
Is it important that all those things be happening at once ?
Yes , this is really a subset of a bunch of points that need to be met to run Scrum well .
And before I just enumerate it , these are just 4 of Nokia 's 8 points that they use .
They use those 8 points to determine if you are even doing Scrum .
Then there 's a whole bunch of questions about " are you doing Scrum really well ?
Is your velocity of delivery really high ?
Are your customers ecstatic about your product ? "
All of these things are about doing Scrum well .
But that check list is to determine if you are even doing Scrum , then we can start talking about improving the process .
7. Nokia has rules about general iterative development , but can you tell us what their additional " Scrum rules " are ?
They have 4 additional rules that apply to Scrum .
The first question they ask the team is " Do you have a product owner ?
Do you have someone that represents the customer who is working with you ? "
That 's one person that you can interact with to determine what the product is that you should build .
And there are many teams , when you ask them that , they say " no , we do n't know who the product owner is . "
The second thing that Nokia asks is " If you have a product owner , do they have a product backlog , a list of features to be developed ?
Is that backlog prioritized by business value , and is it estimated how long it is going to take to build those pieces ? " .
This is what allows the product owner to build a road map for a release .
And if the answer to the question is " yes " then they go on to " When the team is doing the development , do you have a burndown chart that shows how much work is remaining in the iteration as you are moving forward , so you can track your progress ?
And from that , can you tell the velocity of the team , how fast is the team moving ? "
This is basic to : first , for the product owner to be able to build a release plan ; but also for the team themselves to actually improve their progress .
They want to know what their velocity is ; it helps them estimate better it also helps them improve the velocity with which they move forward .
And then finally the Scrum teams depend on self organization in the sense that the team is responsible for choosing the work , assigning themselves the work and the response for figuring out the fastest path to deliver the work .
Nokia has a rule that you can't have a project manager interfering with the team in the middle of an iteration because that stops the self organization and it guarantees you are going to have a suboptimal path to a solution .
8 . Why do these rules matter ?
Agile processes in general and Scrum in particular are a way to get a team working together with the customer , with the people that are going to use the product , and to actually improve the software and be able to deliver it faster , and be able to improve the quality of the product .
In order to do that you need all the pieces working together .
Both Scrum and XP and other Agile processes were designed at a time when we were figuring out how to do object oriented development best .
They are built out of a set of interlocking pieces , and one of the things that companies are trying to do is say " well , let 's pick this Agile process because it's hard to do the other ones , and we 'll get some improvement " .
But the improvement is often not what they expect , is as if you look at object oriented technology and say " well our developers can do everything with objects except they have a tough time with inheritance and besides we have this rule in the company coding standards and it does n't fit into our company standard .
So we are going to do everything but inheritance " .
Now the product comes out , and it 's brittle , it 's not adaptable , it 's not flexible , all the qualities that you expect to get are missing .
And then management says " well , we are doing object oriented development , we invested a lot in this , and we are not getting the benefits " .
9 . How does this selective implementation show up in Scrum ?
Scrum was designed basically to put a team into a state where they can deliver 5 to 10 times as much as normal and with really good Scrum teams that 's what you 'll see .
With the average Scrum implementation a company should be able to double its throughput with software , and more than double the quality of the implementation .
That 's one of the reasons why Scrum is extending because where people really implement it , it does work and it gives you that .
If a company is not getting that a fact the first thing I do is go down the list of Nokia questions , and I almost always find out they do n't meet the basics of doing Scrum , and they can't expect to get the benefit unless they are doing the basics .
10 .
Is it better then , not to just pick a couple of Agile practices that look useful and bring them into your traditional team ?
There are many companies that will start with some pieces and actually doing things like having a daily meeting are probably going to make things better .
But that by itself will only make it slightly better you wo n't get the big benefit .
There is an interesting example at Google with the AdWords project : , it is fascinating because AdWords is software that puts the ads on Gmail or on your blog , if you have Google ads , and it is the thing that makes most of the money for Google .
It has to integrate with every other product at Google , plus anybody that 's external to Google that 's putting ads on their website .
They have a bigger release problem than most Google applications , and they are trying to get better with their delivery dates and with their integration , everything has to work .
And so the product owner Mark Striebeck presented the paper at Agile 2006 conference last year and what he did to improve the process with ad words , and to do it in a way he calls " a googly way " because at Google , they do n't have much process and they do n't want any process overlaid on them .
His strategy was he knew what he wanted to get , he knew all the pieces of Scrum , but he asked the development team " What is our biggest problem ?
Let 's list our biggest problems and let 's put them in priority order " .
And they said " Our biggest problem is we are not meeting our dates and we have a whole bunch of people counting on that " .
And he said " Why do n't we use one of the practices from Agile called the burndown chart ( and actually he just used a release burn down chart ) , and let 's see what happens ? "
Now Mark knew all the pieces of Scrum and he knew that would n't fix the problem but that it will surface more problems .
And as it began to surface more problems he began to asking questions : " Ok , let 's assume the release burn down is going to get us to the date , what 's your problem now ? "
And they started to say " Well , we have a lot of problems , people are checking out code , AdWords has 5 distributed teams in 5 different places in the world , so we have people checking our code , working on the same code , doing duplicate effort , the code is clashing , it is causing bugs , this is a big problem . "
And Mark said " Why do n't we try another Agile practice , it is called the daily meeting , you get together and you talk about what people have been doing yesterday and what they are doing today , what problems are getting in the way , I think that this might fix this problem " .
So they started their daily meetings .
And it did fix a lot of it but it also began to surface more problems because in the daily meeting you begin to build a larger impediment list , and prioritizing that .
But Mark systematically put the entire process of Scrum in place , and in the end when it was all done he said " Guess what guys ?
This is Scrum . "
He did it without even telling you he was doing it and he did it in a way that really worked .
So I recommend when people are trying to do pieces of Agile , that they look at that paper at Google - http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/AGILE.2006.48 - and they use the same intelligence that Mark used , in the way he systematically put the process in place .
11 . What kind of experience would you need to shepherd an organization through that kind of incremental change ( as at Google AdWords ) ?
You need to have Agile experience , you really need to have done work with Agile teams , work with good teams that would meet the Nokia test , that have been delivering software well using Scrum or any other Agile process .
You need to understand what makes that work .
Then you can go to another company or another team and you can guide them through the process of adoption as they did at Google .
12 . In this environment everybody is working hard to improve the software process to increase the bottom line , to produce a better product .
So , what should people be calling their processes when they are using only parts of Scrum ?
People are looking at Agile processes , in particular Scrum , and they are noticing that other people are having some success and they know they need to change their process , deliver software earlier and deliver higher quality .
And also improve the lives of the developers , so they can hire better developers and they can keep the ones they have and have a good work experience .
It 's normal for them to start introducing incrementally Agile practices .
What they need to understand is that they wo n't get the full benefits unless they have a full package of processes .
They need to have a plan where they consciously implement step by step , and they need to understand , just as they did at Google , when they do one thing it does n't solve the problem it actually makes other problems more apparent .
They need to address them and again use the Scrum strategy : prioritize your impediment list and start working on the top of the list and then introduce the next practice that removes that impediment , and if they systematically do that step by step , they would get there , and they will get minor improvements all along the way .
That is a good thing but it needs to be done consciously , and they should get some Scrum training or bring in people who have done this well in other teams that actually know what they are doing in introducing piece - by - piece Agile development .
13 .
While they are on their way there , is it Scrum ?
I like the Nokia test .
The people at Nokia say that test saved them so much pain and confusion over so many years , they would not be without it .
No MCL Reunion Plans
Alexander Repenning on info-mcl :
So , the good news is that we can do amazing things in Lisp and they even run very efficiently .
The bad news is that at a time when Apple is doing really well and producing some pretty exciting hardware we have reached a new low in terms of Lisp development .
Regarding MCL / OpenMCL we are all a bit frustrated here .
We do not want to have to pick between Intel & SLIME versus PPC & real IDE .
What is keeping MCL and OpenMCL from reuniting into a really useful version of Lisp for the Mac ?
At a technical level , what went wrong with MCL 's compiler that it cannot produce code working at least with Rosetta ?
How com the LispWorks stuff works with Rosetta , can produce PPC , Intel and even Universal Binaries working on ALL Intel Macs ?
From a business point of view , why can Hazem not let go of a company that does no longer appear to be viable ?
Clozure 's Andrew Shalit responds :
There is no current collaborative relationship between Clozure and Digitool , beyond Clozure 's hosting the mailing list .
[...]
We do n't have plans to reunite them .
As for the future of OpenMCL :
We 've recently been able to put more resources into OpenMCL development .
The command - line ( non - GUI ) version of OpenMCL now runs on Linux , Free BSD and OS X , supporting PPC and 64 - bit Intel processors .
We hope to have a 32 - bit Intel port at some point , but we do n't have anything to announce about that today .
Gary Byers has written an Objective - C interface that allows you to write Cocoa applications for the Mac in OpenMCL .
This is not as simple as the MCL carbon interface was , but that 's mostly a result of the fact that Cocoa is a much more complete object - oriented framework , and we are providing complete access to it : you can add Lisp methods to Objective C objects , you can subclass across the languages , etc .
For those who want something simpler , we are working on an example library that provides a quick - and - easy gui programming interface along the lines of what MCL offered .
We have used the Cocoa tools to create a GUI - based IDE for OpenMCL on the Mac .
The IDE is approaching beta quality and we intend to keep putting resources into it as much as we can .
It 's not the same as the MCL IDE , but we think Macintosh people will be happy with it .
It 's a real Macintosh app .
This currently runs on PPC Macs , and it will run on 64 - bit Intel Macs as soon as Leopard is released .
( Leopard is required to run Cocoa as a 64 - bit process . )
But the downtown security plan involves much more than keeping track of license plates .
Three thousand surveillance cameras would be installed below Canal Street by the end of 2008 , about two - thirds of them owned by downtown companies .
Some of those are already in place .
Pivoting gates would be installed at critical intersections ; they would swing out to block traffic or a suspect car at the push of a button .
Unlike the 250 or so cameras the police have already placed in high - crime areas throughout the city , which capture moving images that have to be downloaded , the security initiative cameras would transmit live information instantly .
The operation will cost an estimated $ 8 million to run the first year , Mr. Kelly said .
Its headquarters will be in Lower Manhattan , he said , though the police were still negotiating where exactly it will be .
The police and corporate security agents will work together in the center , said Paul J. Browne , the chief spokesman for the police .
The plan does not need City Council approval , he said .
The Police Department is still considering whether to use face - recognition technology , an inexact science that matches images against those in an electronic database , or biohazard detectors in its Lower Manhattan network , Mr. Browne said .
The entire operation is forecast to be in place and running by 2010 , in time for the projected completion of several new buildings in the financial district , including the new Goldman Sachs world headquarters .
Civil liberties advocates said they were worried about misuse of technology that tracks the movement of thousands of cars and people ,
Would this mean that every Wall Street broker , every tourist munching a hot dog near the United States Court House and every sightseer at ground zero would constantly be under surveillance ?
In “ Web of Suspicion : An Agent ’s Career Ruined , ” Los Angeles Times staff writer H.G. Reza reports on the case of retired FBI special agent Rita Chiang , whose career was cut short in the aftermath of a failed polygraph screening examination .
This case is eerily similar to that of former FBI special agent Mark Mallah and is an example of precisely the kind of self - inflicted wound that retired FBI scientist and supervisory special agent Dr. Drew C. Richardson , Ph.D. warned against in a February 2001 memo to then FBI Director Louis Freeh .
Freeh , who never responded , began a program of increased reliance on polygraph screen in the aftermath of the Robert Hanssen espionage case — a policy made permanent by his successor , current FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III .
It ’s worth noting that Leandro Aragoncillo , the only FBI spy caught since Hanssen , passed his polygraph .
L.A. Times reporter H.G. Reza writes :
The two male agents pictured with Rita Chiang in the FBI poster were smiling , but her stare left no doubt that she was all business .
Chiang was a recruiting magnet for the FBI , but it was her skill as an investigator that got her noticed .
The photo appeared in magazines and on billboards throughout the country in the 1990s , the picture cropped so tightly that only a sliver of her face could be seen .
Anonymity was an asset in her job , where she matched wits with agents from the People ’s Republic of China in the furtive world of counterintelligence .
But on Jan. 14 , 2002 , Chiang was stripped of her badge and gun and escorted out of the West Los Angeles office .
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III suspected that she was a mole for Chinese intelligence and ordered her suspended with pay while she was investigated .
Chiang was later cleared when her boss was identified as the security leak , but she contends that by then her reputation was ruined and her career derailed .
She filed a discrimination suit against the agency , but it was tossed out of court .
The case is on appeal , but her lawyer concedes it has been all but impossible to overcome the FBI ’s position that her case — if it went to trial — could jeopardize national security .
Chiang ’s boss — the security leak — was John J. Smith , who had a long running extra-marital affair with confidential informant Katrina M. Leung .
For past discussion of the Smith - Leung affair and its connection with polygraph policy , see Ex-FBI Agent and Informant Accused in Spy Case .
To this day , Chiang says she has never seen the evidence that triggered her suspension , not even the results of a failed polygraph test that apparently provided the first suspicion that she was a mole .
During her 10 - month suspension , Chiang said she was uncertain why she had been whisked from the bureau that day .
“ It was torturous .
I lost 20 pounds .
I had to seek counseling to make sure I was n’t going to do something stupid to myself , ” Chiang , 53 , said during a recent interview .
“ They took me back , but it wiped out my whole career .
I ’m ruined in terms of my identity as an FBI agent and professional . ”
Chiang ’s story is virtually unknown outside the covert world she traveled in , and her fight for justice became a mere detail in one of the biggest sex - and - spy scandals to rock the FBI .
But her discrimination lawsuit offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the Los Angeles China Squad during one of the FBI ’s lowest moments .
Information gleaned from the 2005 lawsuit and an FBI inspector general ’s report filed the following year shows that Chiang popped into the bureau ’s cross hairs in the summer of 2001 , when the FBI began looking into reports that Chinese intelligence had infiltrated the China Squad .
The unit is a special team that keeps tabs on Chinese spies and their attempts to steal U.S. technology .
A subsequent investigation identified Chiang ’s boss , squad leader James J. Smith , as the security risk .
Katrina Leung , a Chinese American described in the inspector general ’s report as Smith ’s informant and lover and a spy for the People ’s Republic of China , was also exposed .
Chiang returned to her job in November 2002 but with several caveats , including that her computer use would be monitored , Chiang said .
Court records show that she worked under a “ risk mitigation ” plan , because , FBI officials said , she “ probably harbors significant resentment for the process she has been through . ”
The price of the investigation was steep :
Though cleared , she was viewed with even deeper suspicion .
“ They said I was a bigger security risk because now I had a grudge against the bureau , ” said Chiang .
She retired in 2006 after a 21 - year career .
Chiang believes she came under suspicion because she is Chinese American .
“ That ’s the only explanation I can derive from self - examination and review . ”
But Mueller , in a statement filed with the court , said it was the polygraph test , not ethnicity , that led to her suspension .
FBI officials declined to comment .
Let all FBI employees then be put on notice that they may be arbitrarily suspended merely because their polygraph squiggles zigged when they should have zagged .
A leaflet produced by the FBI Polygraph Unit about its “ Personnel Security Polygraph Program ” states regarding the rights of those who fail the polygraph :
Q : If it is determined that I have failed my polygraph , what recourse do I have ?
A : The SPM or other appropriate officials within the Counterintelligence Division will conduct a review or investigation to explain your polygraph test results .
A Senior Review Panel ( SRP ) composed of the Assistant Directors or their designees from your division , the Counterintelligence Division , the Office of Professional Responsibility , and the Administrative Services Division will monitor the equity and reasonableness of the PSP process .
The General Counsel or his designee will participate on the panel as a legal advisor .
The SRP will also reserve the right to invite representatives of other FBI components , as appropriate , to provide counsel .
The SRP will consider both the requirement to safeguard national security and the rights of those taking the test .
Given Chiang ’s experience , it would seem that the foregoing is little more than bureaucratic mumbo jumbo and that FBI employees who fail the polygraph have no recourse .
Reporter H.G. Reza continues :
Government attorneys argued that Mueller acted legally and for national security reasons when he suspended Chiang while the FBI attempted to “ locate a suspected mole . ”
A U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles dismissed the suit , ruling that she could not sue the FBI because federal law prevents employees from challenging an employment action taken for national security reasons .
Getting a job as an FBI agent was not easy for someone born in Taiwan .
Chiang ’s family settled in South San Francisco after her father retired as a Taiwanese diplomat .
She was hired in 1984 after becoming a U.S. citizen and undergoing an extensive background check .
“ She ’s a recruiter ’s dream , ” said retired FBI Agent Chris Loo , who recruited Chiang .
“ She ’s sharp , analytical and speaks Cantonese and Mandarin .
Rita was no ordinary agent . ”
Loo said she was the FBI ’s first female Chinese American agent .
Jo Craycraft , a retired FBI agent who also worked in counterintelligence in Los Angeles , said she never doubted Chiang ’s honesty and loyalty .
“ Without resorting to exaggeration , Rita is a great agent .
She was an excellent mentor for me and for her squad , ” Craycraft said .
“ She did n’t have very many equals . ”
According to court records , Chiang received “ the highest annual performance rating possible , ” even while she was on suspension .
Mueller ’s statement , dated March 31 , 2004 , said he suspended her because she failed the polygraph test , in which she was asked if she had ever spied against the United States .
He said the suspension was also based on his personal “ knowledge of other specific national security risk and vulnerability factors , ” which he did not list .
In a signed statement included in court documents , one of her supervisors said Chiang probably would not have failed the polygraph had it been administered by an examiner experienced in conducting National Security Division exams .
Agent Daniel K. Sayner went on to note , “ I believe that Chiang was discriminated against because of her ethnicity . ”
Polygraphy is voodoo science regardless of who conducts administers the procedure .
As the National Academy of Sciences more diplomatically put it , “ [ polygraph testing ’s ] accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies . ”
According to court records and the FBI inspector general ’s report , it appears FBI officials in Washington feared that Chiang might be providing information to Leung , the suspected spy .
The inspector general ’s report released in May 2006 said authorities believed Leung had a secret contact in the China Squad .
Suspicions about Leung , who earned $ 1.7 million as an informant , surfaced as far back as 1987 , five years after Smith became her handler .
Concerns about Leung ’s loyalty continued for more than a decade .
For reasons not explained in the report , 14 years after the first red flag went up , the FBI finally began investigating Leung .
A “ special squad ” from the Los Angeles office led the investigation , and each member was required to pass a polygraph test .
Chiang believed she had been tapped for a role in the investigation because she was asked in August 2001 to take a polygraph examination .
A 2003 affidavit by Agent John J. Quattrocki , then head of counterintelligence programs for the National Security Council , suggests that the FBI had no reason to believe Chiang would have “ a problematic polygraph . ”
Quattrocki called her “ a very good agent ” who “ would be the best person to conduct the investigation . ”
But she apparently failed the polygraph , and FBI officials began investigating her too .
Quattrocki and Sayner said in affidavits that they expected Chiang would remain at work while under investigation .
Quattrocki said he was “ shocked ” when Mueller ordered her suspended .
On Feb. 13 , 2002 , barely a month after Chiang ’s suspension , FBI officials in Los Angeles recommended that she be immediately reinstated , her attorney , Marvin L. Rudnick , said .
The attorney said the recommendation turned up in a classified report Chiang found in her personnel file , which she obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request .
But it was an additional nine months before she was reinstated .
Rudnick charged that Mueller invoked national security in Chiang ’s case to protect the FBI from liability .
“ Mueller used national security to hide behind a discriminatory action .
A mistake was made he knew the FBI would pay for , and the only way he could get immunity was by saying it was a national security matter , ” Rudnick said .
Sayner , who supervised Chiang , said in his statement , “ I cannot understand why the bureau treats people the way Chiang was treated when the bureau has a need for a specific expertise . ”
There was a final irony that troubled Chiang : Smith and Leung got off relatively easy , though they compromised national security .
Leung pleaded guilty to lying about the affair and filing a false income tax return .
She was fined $ 10,000 and put on three years ’ probation .
She had been charged with illegally copying and possessing classified documents , but the case was dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct .
Leung spent three months in jail after her arrest on this charge .
In 2005 , Smith also pleaded guilty to lying about his affair with Leung and was sentenced to three months ’ house arrest and three years ’ probation and fined $ 10,000 .
“ Smith got three months ’ house arrest .
I spent 10 months at home with restrictions , ” Chiang said .
“ Smith went on with his life .
My life and career were ruined . ”
It ’s time for the FBI to wake up to the fact that polygraph “ testing ” is a pseudoscientific sham .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 31 — The Federal Reserve gave investors what they wanted today , lowering short - term rates for the second time in two months .
But it quietly warned Wall Street not to expected to assume that more reductions are ahead .
The move , to reduce short - term rates by a quarter point to 4.5 percent , was aimed at preventing the meltdown in housing from crippling the rest of the economy .
But the vote was not unanimous , reflecting disagreement among policymakers about the risks that confront the economy .
Investors were generally pleased , and stocks were up modestly after briefly giving up most of their gains for the day immediately after the announcement .
But Treasury prices fell , reflecting some concerns that lower interest rates could stoke inflation .
Oil prices surged nearly 4 percent and gold futures were up about 1 percent .
The dollar modestly weakened against other major currencies .
In a statement accompanying its decision , the Fed acknowledged that the housing collapse is likely to slow the economy .
But it said “ some inflation risks remain ” and that the risks of inflation were “ roughly balanced ” against the risk of slower growth .

Blackwater Massacre Cover-Up
James Joyner · · 9 comments
The four contractors murdered , burned , and dragged through the streets of Fallujah in 2004 were sent out by a Blackwater manager despite protests that they were understaffed and unprepared , according to a report in the Raleigh - Durham News and Observer .
While tragic and perhaps even outrageous , that ’s not particularly newsworthy .
There are incompetent managers in all walks of life .
Blackwater was founded by former Special Operations leaders and their hiring profile leans heavily toward those with similar backgrounds .
Presumably , this sort of thing could have happened within our own military then ; indeed , it almost surely has .
Here ’s the difference :
The memos surface amid heightened congressional scrutiny of Blackwater , a private security firm based in Moyock [ North Carolina ] , and the private security industry , which grows ever more valuable to the Pentagon .
Reports last week indicate that there are now more private contractors than troops operating in Iraq .
[ But the reports are misleading .
- ed. ]
Blackwater has received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracts .
The aftermath of the killings shows one difference between contractors and the military .
Had an officer sent four lightly armed soldiers into Fallujah , he would likely have faced public scrutiny in the military justice system .
In this case , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has been trying to get documents such as these memos from Blackwater without success .
The families of the four men killed in the ambush — Jerry Zovko , Wesley Batalona , Scott Helvenston and Michael Teague — sued Blackwater in Wake County Superior Court in an effort to find out what happened .
Blackwater countersued the estates of the four men in federal court , successfully arguing for arbitration , in which the proceedings are closed to the public and the investigation of the incident can be much more limited .
As I ’ve noted several times since this incident , contractors are in a legal limbo , not subject to the UCMJ but not quite accountable under civilian law , either .
Practically , one ca n’t expect men to sign on to work in a war zone and subject themselves to the vagaries of host nation law , especially in a murky political situation as exists in Iraq .
At the same time , however , they ought to be subject to American law .
The terms of their contract , though , make that difficult .
That is , to say the least , problematic .

Medieval Sourcebook :
Stephen de Bourbon ( d. 1262 ) : De Supersticione : On St. Guinefort 353 .
Further on the said error of heretical depravity , something must be said about the superstition of the vain cult of divinations , incantations , oracles , the diverse devilish delusions by which the Devil attacks the Christian people , drawing after him with the tail of fallacious seduction innumerable souls of the stupid .
There is an infinite number of these Master Jacques [ de Vitry ] :
When the king of Castille mustered an army to go against the Saracens , a flock of tiny crows met the army .
Some of the king 's knights advised him to go back , saying that evil would arise , they would be defeated by the enemy if they went on .
They claimed to have learned this from the prattle of the crows and the way they were flying around .
The king answered them with some mockery : " These crows are hardly four years old , while I have campaigned against the Saracens for more than twenty years and know the science and means of warfare better than them .
Maybe they have come from another region where they were born and brought up .
So they will not know how to tell us much about the Saracen problem , which I have known and lived through .
You ought better to put your trust in me than them . "
And despising their advice , he went on to defeat the Saracens .
354 .
I also heard of a Spanish schoolman who believed in auguries .
He was all ready for a journey to return to his homeland , when one of his companions stopped him from leaving by crowing outside the house door as if he was a crow .
He thought it was an evil omen !
355 . Master Jacques also tells of a man who gave lodging to a countryman at fair time .
When the guest wanted to leave , his host finding him profitable made a noise with a bladder and when the countryman heard it he said it was a bad omen and came right back .
The host only let him go when other guests arrived .
356 .
He tells also of an old woman who fell sick and was warned to make confession .
She said she was sure she would live another five years because she had heard on Mayday le cucu as if calling to her five times .
When she was again admonished [ to confess ] , she could no longer speak and just called out cucu , gesturing with her five fingers .
And so she died deceived without viaticum [ the last rites ] or confession .
357 .
It is not just demons that seduce men but also those who hold themselves out as diviners since they really know nothing of the future .
I have heard of a woman who owned a great enclosed manor , with at the furthest end her house where she would speak with visitors .
In the beginning she lived in the house with her household ( familia ) .
When her people indicated that strangers were coming to her , she would lurk in her chamber to hear why they were traveling and where they were coming from and other details ( circumstancias ) which her people astutely asked about .
When she had heard all this , she hurried to another house by secret ways , working out en route how she would answer them .
Someone from her household would lead the travelers by a roundabout route to the other house , making believe that it was very far away .
Then when she met them she would greet them by their proper names and tell them the reasons for their journey , where they had been and other stuff .
They thought she had total foreknowledge and had divined all this .
I heard of another woman that she had her rogues ( ribaldos ) out on the roads to question travelers and give her advance knowledge about them .
358 . 370 .
The sixth thing to say is about insulting superstitions , some of which are insulting to God , others to man .
The superstitions which attribute divine honors to demons or any other creature insult God .
Idolatry is one example , or when wretched women sorcerers seek salvation through the adoration of saddles ( sambuca ) to which they make offerings , through the condemnation of churches and relics of the saints , through carrying their children to ant - hills or other places in search of healing .
This is what they did recently in the diocese of Lyons .
When preaching there against sorcery and hearing confessions , I heard many women confess that they had carried their children to St. Guinefort .
I thought he was some saint .
I made inquiries and at last heard that he was a certain greyhound killed in the following way .
In the diocese of Lyons , close to the vill of the nuns called Villeneuve , on the land belonging to the lord of Villars - en - Dombe , there was a certain castle whose lord had a baby son from his wife .
But when the lord and lady and the nurse too had left the house , leaving the child alone in his cradle , a very large snake entered the house and made for the child 's cradle .
The greyhound , who had remained there , saw this , dashed swiftly under the cradle in pursuit , knocking it over , and attacked the snake with its fangs and answering bite with bite .
In the end the dog killed it and threw it far away from the child 's cradle which he left all bloodied as was his mouth and head , with the snake 's blood , and stood there by the cradle all beaten about by the snake .
When the nurse came back and saw this , she thought the child had been killed and eaten by the dog and so gave out an almighty scream .
The child 's mother heard this , rushed in , saw and thought the same and she too screamed .
Then the knight similarly once he got there believed the same , and drawing his sword killed the dog .
Only then did they approach the child and find him unharmed , sleeping sweetly in fact .
On further investigation , they discovered the snake torn up by the dog 's bites and dead .
Now that they had learned the truth of the matter , they were embarrassed ( dolentes ) that they had so unjustly killed a dog so useful to them and threw his body into a well in front of the castle gate , and placing over it a very large heap of stones they planted trees nearby as a memorial of the deed .
But the castle was in due course destroyed by divine will , and the land reduced to a desert abandoned by its inhabitants .
The local peasants hearing of the dog's noble deed and innocent death , began to visit the place and honor the dog as a martyr in quest of help for their sicknesses and other needs .
They were seduced and often cheated by the Devil so that he might in this way lead men into error .
Women especially , with sick or poorly children , carried them to the place , and went off a league to another nearby castle where an old woman could teach them a ritual for making offerings and invocations to the demons and lead them to the right spot .
When they got there , they offered salt and certain other things , hung the child 's little clothes ( diapers ? ) on the bramble bushes around , fixing them on the thorns .
They then put the naked baby through the opening between the trunks of two trees , the mother standing on one side and throwing her child nine times to the old woman on the other side , while invoking the demons to adjure the fauns in the wood of " Rimite " to take the sick and failing child which they said belonged to them ( the fauns ) and return to them their own child big , plump , live and healthy .
Once this was done , the killer mothers took the baby and placed it naked at the foot of the tree on the straws of a cradle , lit at both ends two candles a thumbsbreadth thick with fire they had brought with them and fastened them on the trunk above .
Then , while the candles were consumed , they went far enough away that they could neither hear nor see the child .
In this way the burning candles burned up and killed a number of babies , as we have heard from others in the same place .
One woman told me that after she had invoked the fauns and left , she saw a wolf leaving the wood and going to the child and the wolf ( or the devil in wolf 's form , so she said ) would have devoured it had she not been moved by her maternal feelings and prevented it .
On the other hand , if when they returned they found the child alive , they picked it up and carried it to a swiftly flowing river nearby , called the Chalaronne [ tributary of the Saône ] , and immersed it nine times , to the point where if it escaped dying on the spot or soon after , it must have had very tough innards .
We went to the place and assembled the people and preached against the practice .
We then had the dead dog dug up and the grove of trees cut down and burned along with the dog 's bones .
Then we had an edict enacted by the lords of the land threatening the spoliation and fining of any people who gathered there for such a purpose in future .
371 .
Another of the things insulting to God is when prophecies are made from the sacraments or sacramental things or sacred things pertaining to the divine services .
There was an exemplum of this placed above in the section about sacrilege and irreverence to holy things [ s. 317 ] , about the peasant who retained Christ 's body in a beehive to examine the bees .
I have also heard that when a certain woman from the diocese of Lyons at her Easter communion had retained [ in her mouth ]
Christ 's body to do sorcery with , she wound it in cloth and put it in her purse .
Then while she was asleep she saw a most beautiful choir descending from Heaven adoring a very beautiful youth and taking him back to the heavens with them .
She was so terrified and excited by this vision that she determined never to admit what she had done .
But she was soon struck by an amazing pain and could not find Christ 's Body where she had put it .
She now felt her feet and hands unbearably wrenched about .
As a result she turned to penitence , called the priest , confessed her sin with weeping and bitterness and was restored to health .
ANOTHER VERSION in ref The Sorceress .
Le Moine et la sorcière , aka The Sorceress France ( 1987 ) : Historical / Drama , 97 minutes .
Director : Suzanne Schiffman ; Cast includes Tchéky Karyo and Christine Boisson
The Sorceress was written by a professional Medieval scholar - Pamela Berger of Boston College - and was shot in both French and English .
It is based on a genuine medieval text by the 13th - century Dominican , Etienne de Bourbon , about the cult of St. Guinefort near Lyons in France .
St. Guinefort ( probably derived from " Cynephoros " in Greek , sometimes a name for St. Christopher ) was a sainted greyhound !
The story , which is slow but involving , focuses accurately on early 13th century historical issues : the survival of " folk " culture ; the role of women ; the beginnings of the Dominican order ; the use of profit - based farming techniques ( in this case carp ponds ) by local nobilities .
The actors are professional , and the story has interesting twists .
A very good film for classroom use .

Although after my recent effort to get people to talk about Alexius I and Robert of Flanders ' I am not sure anyone is interested in texts ! ]
Stephen of Bourbon ( Etienne de Bourbon ) ( died about 1262 ) : De Supersticione :
On the Worship of the Dog Guinefort Sixthly , I should speak of offensive superstitions , some of which are offensive to God , others to our fellow men .
Offensive to God are those which honour demons or other creatures as if they were divine : it is what idolatry does , and it is what the wretched women who cast lots do , who seek salvation by worshipping elder trees or making offerings to them ; scoming churches and holy relics , they take their children to these elder trees , or to anthills , or to other things in order that a cure may be effected .
This recently happened in the diocese of Lyons where , when I preached against the reading of oracles , and was hearing confession , numerous women confessed that they had taken their children to Saint Guinefort .
As I thought that this was some holy person , I continued with my enquiry and finally learned that this was actually a greyhound , which had been killed in the following manner .
In the diocese of Lyons , near the enclosed nuns ' village called Neuville , on the estate of the Lord of Villars , was a castle , the lord of which and his wife had a baby boy .
One day , when the lord and lady had gone out of the house , and the nurse had done likewise , leaving the baby alone in the cradle , a huge serpent entered the house and approached the baby 's cradle .
Seeing this , the greyhound , which had remained behind , chased the serpent and , attacking it beneath the cradle , upset the cradle and bit the serpent all over , which defended itself , biting the dog equally severely .
Finally , the dog killed it and threw it well away from the cradle .
The cradle , the floor , the dog's mouth and head were all drenched in the serpent 's blood .
Although badly hurt by the serpent , the dog remained on guard beside the cradle .
When the nurse came back and saw all this she thought that the dog had devoured the child , and let out a scream of misery .
Hearing it the child 's mother also ran up , looked , thought the same thing and screamed too .
Likewise the knight , when he arrived , thought the same thing and drew his sword and killed the dog .
Then , when they went closer to the baby they found it safe and sound , sleeping peacefully .
Casting around for some explanation , they discovered the serpent , tom to pieces by the dog 's bites , and now dead .
Realising then the true facts of the matter , and deeply regretting having unjustly killed so useful a dog they threw it into a well in front of the manor door , threw a great pile of stones on top of it , and planted trees beside it , in memory of the event Now , by divine will , the manor was destroyed and the estate reduced to a desert , * was abandoned by its inhabitants .
But the peasants , hearing of the dog's conduct and of how it had been killed , although innocent , and for a deed for which it might have expected praise , visited the place , honoured the dog as a martyr , prayed to it when they were sick or in need of something , and many there fell victim to the enticements and illusions of the devil , who in this way used to lead men into error .
Above all , though , it was women with sick or weak children who took them to this place .
They would go and seek out an old woman in a fortified town a league distant and she taught them the rituals they should enact in order to make offerings to demons , and in order to invoke them and she led them to the place .
When they arrived , they would make offerings of salt and other things ; they would hang their babies ' swaddling - clothes on the bushes roundabout : they would drive nails into the trees which had grown in this place ; they would pass the naked babies between the trunks of two trees the mother , on one side , held the baby and threw it nine times to the old woman , who was on the other side .
Invoking the demons , they called upon the fauns in the forest of Rimite to take the sick , feeble child which , they said , was theirs , and to return their child that the fauns had taken away , fat and well , safe and sound .
Having done this , the infanticidal mothers took their children and laid them naked at the foot of the tree on straw from the cradle ; then , using the light they had brought with them , they lit two candies , each an inch long , one on each side of the child 's head and fixed them in - the trunk above it .
Then they withdrew until the candles had burnt out , so as not to see the child or hear him crying .
Several people have told us that while the candies were burning like this they burnt and killed several babies .
One woman also told me that she had just invoked the fauns and was withdrawing from the scene when she saw a wolf come out of the forest towards the baby .
If maternal love had not made her feel pity and go back for him , the wolf , or as she put it , the devil in the shape of a wolf , would have devoured the baby .
When a mother returned to her child and found it still alive , she carried it out into the fast - flowing waters of a nearby river , called the Chalaronne [ a tributary of the Sa6nel , and plunged it in nine times ; if it came through without dying on the spot .
or shortly afterwards , it had a very strong constitution .
We went to this place , we called together all the people on the estate , and we preached against everything that had been said .
We had the dead dog disinterred , and the sacred wood cut down and burnt , along with the remains of the dog .
And 1 had an edict passed by the lords of the estate , warning that anyone going thenceforth to that place for any such reason would be liable to have his possessions seized and then sold .
END * The O.E.D. gives 'an uninhabited and uncultivated tract of country ; a wilderness : a. now conceived as a desolate , barren region , waterless and treeless .
and with but scanty growth of herbage .
. . b. formerly more widely applied to any wild , uninhabited region , including forest - land . '
It is in the latter sense that the word is employed here .
Tr. COMMENT : Although this document has been available to scholars for a hundred years it has never previously been fully studied .
Graus , the great historian of early medieval hagiography , mentions it in a footnote , but his book , outstanding though it is , is grounded in a set of concerns and a methodology which prevents him from making fuller use of it .
Most of the references to this document are by folklorists ; some , notably Baring - Gould in England and Saintyves in France , are interested exclusively in the narrative of the dog's death , which they compare to similar narratives in medieval literature or in more recent popular literature .
and some literary historians , Gaston Paris in particular .
have shared this approach .
Other folklorists have concentrated their attention upon the child - healing rite , so as to demonstrate the antiquity of ritual practices still surviving in the countryside .
Finally , local historians have seen the text as a picturesque illustration of the 'primitivism ' which has long been attributed to the inhabitants of the Dombes .
Very few have sought to give this document the thorough investigation that it deserves . "
One can perhaps account for this silence , and for the inadequate treatment that this document has received in the last hundred years , in terms of a fundamentally ideological reluctance to admit that such a cult could have existed .
One could also invoke the general positivism of the period , and the lack of contact between disciplines .
This new attempt at an interpretation has not come about by chance , however , but is the outcome of a collective enquiry into the literature of exempla , the narrative genre to which this document belongs .
This enquiry is itself part of a broad current of research into ' popular literature ' , ' oral traditions ' .
' popular culture ' ' popular religion ' and so on .
I do not propose , however , to survey the various and often contradictory approaches that these expressions cover , " nor even to situate my own work in relation to them .
My approach and methodology will become clear as I proceed with the analysis of the text .
Meanwhile , I shall simply set out the main questions that the text raises , and try to explain how I think one might answer them .
There is one question that is in urgent need of an answer .
It concerns the relationship between the two cultures , one of which is literate , Latinate , urban , clerical , responsible for Christian orthodoxy , drawing its strength from its powers of temporal and spiritual coercion , and which produced this text , the other of which is popular ( in the limited , sociological sense of the word ) , oral , vernacular , peasant , secular , Christian also ( although in a different sense ) , and which , in the text , is the object of both a description and a repression .
I shall follow the conventional usage , and call the former ' learned culture ' and the latter ' folk culture ' .
( The advantage of this latter term is that it avoids the ambiguities attached to the term ' popular , although it admits those attached to the term ' folk ' , or to ' folklore ' . )
However , regardless of the customary use of the term ( ' folk ' /' folklore ' ) , my choice of ' folk culture ' clearly situates the present work within a scientific anthropological perspective .

Adverganza alerts us to this opening video from last night ’s Hatch Awards in Boston , in which Arnold holds a focus group to evaluate a slightly updated version of Apple ’s classic “ 1984 ” spot .
Evidently , none of the participants ( we ’re told they ’re not actors ) have seen the original , and of course the proposed new ad gets ripped to bits — too depressing , too much Nazi imagery , etc .
And the line “ You ’ll see why 2008 wo n’t be like ‘ 1984 ’ ” does n’t have quite the same ring to it .

Seymour Hersh , investigative reporter for The New Yorker , has been writing for the past three years about the abuse of prisoners in U.S. custody at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere , and Donald Rumsfeld 's alleged involvement in U.S. torture policy .
Now Hersh has apparently dug up some further evidence indicating that Rumsfeld clearly knew about the prisoner abuse before it became public , even as he lied to Congress about being unaware of it .
Furthermore , the investigators were prevented from looking very high up the chain of command , and were scrutinized themselves , lest they learn or share too much .
>> Read Hersh 's article in The New Yorker online : The General 's Report
This is really nothing new .
Hersh 's latest piece just gives us some more details of what we 've known all along :
That the low - level American soldiers in the Abu Ghraib photos did n't make the decision on their own to abuse and torture the detainees in their custody .
It had to have come from much higher up .
After all , the treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib bears a striking resemblance to the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
You can't blame Lynndie England for our Guantanamo policies .
And , of course , there were the torture memos .
But accountability in the press is one thing .
We need accountability in a court of law .
Will we ever see it ?

Twins can be identical , fraternal and apparently semi-identical , scientists now report .
Researchers discovered twins who are identical on their mom's side of the equation but share only half their genes from dad .
Here 's how it happened :
Two sperm cells fertilized one egg — an event assumed to be very rare — then split into two embryos .
" Their similarity is somewhere between identical and fraternal twins , " said geneticist Vivienne Souter , of the Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix , Arizona .
" It makes me wonder whether the current classification of twins is an oversimplification . "
The finding , detailed in the Journal of Human Genetics , was reported today by news@nature.com , the online site of the journal Nature .
Identical twins are created when one fertilized egg splits into two embryos .
They share the same placenta and are always of the same sex .
Fraternal twins result from two eggs being fertilized at the same time , each by a different sperm .
Each has its own placenta , and they can be the same sex or not .
The semi-identical twins only came to the attention of Souter and her colleagues because one had ambiguous genitalia .
The child was born a " true hermaphrodite " with both ovarian and testicular tissue .
The other twin is a male , anatomically .
The twins are now toddlers , according to the report .
They were conceived and born normally and appear to be mentally normal and are growing normally .

" Israel will pay the price for invading Syrian airspace , " warned Imad Moustapha , Syria 's Ambassador to the US , in an interview published in Newsweek Magazine , Saturday .
" The Israelis did n't bomb anything .
When they were detected by our defense systems and we started firing at them , they dumped fuel and turned around , " he said , adding that the Israeli bombs dropped by the Israeli Air Force , landed in open areas without causing any damage .
Potential response Possible scenarios for Syrian response Roee Nahmias
So what is really happening in Damascus following reported violation of airspace by Israeli aircraft ?
Dr Boaz Ganor details Syria 's options Possible scenarios for Syrian response
Responding to the reports saying that the IAF was after a nuclear power plant , built with Syrian - North Korean cooperation , Moustapha said : " these are ridiculous claims .
Syria does not have nuclear facilities .
" This is a familiar game , " he added .
" There were those who said that Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction were smuggled into Syria .
This is nothing new .
We hear stories like that all the time . "
Syria , said Moustapha , is one of the few friends North Korea has in the world , adding that while on friendly terms , the two states merely share commerce relations .
As for the rumors of an arms deal between the two , Moustapha simply said " I leave these kinds of things to the military experts .
I am not one . "
Israel , he added , has made a serious mistake by invading Syrian airspace : " Over the past three months Israel has been sending us calming messages , saying it has no interest in escalating the relations between the two countries and then it sends its fighter jets into Syria – that is a serious provocation .
" If the Israelis think they can do whatever they like , they are sorely mistaken , as they were last summer , " he said , adding .
" Israel 's actions will have their consequences .
Israel will pay "
Recently the dollar has seen troubled times .
After reaching parity with the Canadian dollar and the offloading of US Treasuries from Asian countries , things just are n’t looking good .
Find out what financial experts have to say about the dollar ’s future .
Paul Robinson , Barclays : " We expect it to get quite a bit weaker . "
The Telegraph reports , " Barclays expect the Fed to cut rates by another quarter point to 5 pc in a move that further erode one of the dollar ’s key props . "
Paul Robinson , strategist for Barclays , explains , " We ’re dollar bears .
The dollar is coming up for an important few weeks .
We expect it to get quite a bit weaker . "
They believe that it ’s possible the dollar could fall to $ 1.50 on the euro .
Thomas Stopler , Goldman Sachs : " The data suggests there will be a weaker dollar . "
Thomas Stopler , economist for Goldman Sachs , predicts a troublesome future for the dollar .
Based on the negative capital - flows situation , he interprets data to mean that " there will be a weaker dollar . "
Marc Ostwald , Insinger de Beaufort : " Woe betide US Treasuries if inflation does not remain benign . "
According to a report from The Telegraph , " data from the US Treasury showed outflows of $ 163bn ( £ 80 bn ) from all forms of US investments . "
Mac Ostwald of Insinger de Beaufort finds these numbers " absolutely stunning , " and warns that inflation could make things even worse for the dollar : " " Woe betide US Treasuries if inflation does not remain benign . "
$ 52 billion worth of the treasuries in the outflow are from Asian investors , including Japan , China , and Taiwan .
Ian Stannard , Paribas : Data is " extremely negative . "
According to Ian Stannard of Paribas , things are n’t looking good for the dollar , as " it is not just foreigners who are selling US assets .
Americans are turning their back as well . "
He believes that this situation " exceeds the worst fears , " and ultimately , the data is " extremely negative " for the dollar .
Rodrigo de Rato , IMF : " The dollar remains overvalued . "
Although the dollar has fallen quite a bit already , International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo de Rato asserts that it ’s still " overvalued relative to medium - term fundamentals . "
Digital Journal reports that the IMF hinted " the dollar may be headed for further decline , " with the US trade deficit , slow - growing economy , and cut in interest rates to blame .
Jerome Booth , Ashmore Group : " The dollar will keep falling in the near term no matter what . "
Jerome Booth is n’t optimistic for the dollar , either .
He believes that it ’s just not a good investment vehicle : " It ’s a question of returns , and returns in dollar - denominated assets are simply very low when compared with other regions . "
Because of this , his prediction is grim , asserting that " the dollar will keep falling in the near term no matter what . "
Nick Bennenbroek , Wells Fargo Bank : Recent " strength in the greenback is corrective . "
In a note to clients , Wells Fargo currency strategist Nick Bennenbroek asserts that there ’s still room for a greater dollar fall .
He explains , " We do believe the greenback is consolidating and not too far from bottoming out , but today ’s price action suggests there is still potential for some further weakness . "
According to Bennenbroek , recent gains in the dollar ’s strength are " corrective . "
Michael Woolfolk , Bank of New York Mellon : " The dollar has further room to fall regardless of incoming US data . "
Senior Bank of New York Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk seems to think data and opinionated buzz points to a weakening dollar .
" Bearish dollar - sentiment appears to be solidly in place going into the weekend , " he said .
Because of this , Woolfolk thinks that , regardless of incoming US data , " the dollar has further room to fall . "
Alan Greenspan , Former Federal Reserve Chairman : China offloading of US Treasuries " wo n’t trigger any rapid drop in the US dollar . "
Greenspan does n’t see doom in the dollar ’s near future .
Although China sales of US Treasuries are troublesome , he believes that " markets are clever enough not to overreact . "
He says this is old news , and does n’t expect to see a large reaction .
An attendee of Greenspan ’s presentation reports his sentiment as , " It ’s already - known information that wo n’t trigger any rapid drop in the U.S. dollar . ”
Eisuke Sakakibara , former top Japanese Ministry of Finance official : " We could see a plunge in the dollar . "
Eisuke Sakakibara is concerned that if US economic growth " fall[s ] below 1 percent , " the dollar may " plunge . "
This plunge , according to Sakakibara , would require intervention from the US , Japan and the EU to put a stop to it .
Masashi Kurabe , Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ : " Negative implications for the dollar . "
Masashi Kurabe sees the possibility of stagflation , a period of both inflation and economic stagnation .
" Economic data raise the question whether the U.S. economy will fall into stagflation , ” he says .
A period of stagflation could have " negative implications for the dollar . "
Alan Moldawer 's adopted twins , Matt and Andrew , had always thought of themselves as white .
But when it came time for them to apply to college last year , Mr. Moldawer thought it might be worth investigating the origins of their slightly tan - tinted skin , with a new DNA kit that he had heard could determine an individual 's genetic ancestry .
The results , designating the boys 9 percent Native American and 11 percent northern African , arrived too late for the admissions process .
But Mr. Moldawer , a business executive in Silver Spring , Md. , says they could be useful in obtaining financial aid .
" Naturally when you 're applying to college you 're looking at how your genetic status might help you , " said Mr. Moldawer , who knows that the twins ' birth parents are white , but has little information about their extended family .
" I have three kids going now , and you can bet that any advantage we can take we will . "
Genetic tests , once obscure tools for scientists , have begun to influence everyday lives in many ways .
The tests are reshaping people 's sense of themselves -- where they came from , why they behave as they do , what disease might be coming their way .
There was a wide variation in salt content of food surveyed
Lobby group , Consensus Action on Salt and Health ( Cash ) , found one meal from Pizza Hut contained four times the daily limit of salt for a six - year old .
KFC also did poorly in the analysis of hundreds of food items , which also included McDonalds and Burger King .
All the restaurant chains said they had reduced salt levels considerably in their products in recent years .
The government recommends a maximum of 6g of salt per day for adults , 5g a day for children aged 7 - 10 and 3g for children aged 4 - 6 .
How can these companies justify selling food that contains more than the maximum daily limit for adults and children in a single meal
Professor Graham MacGregor
According to the Cash survey , a family of four sharing a Pizza Hut meal deal - consisting of one Cheesy Bites Meat Feast , one medium Super Supreme , a portion of garlic bread , a portion of potato wedges , chicken wings , and a cheesecake dessert - could eat 12.3g of salt each .
The amount of salt consumed in one meal is more than twice the daily limit for an adult and four times the daily limit of a six year old .
A family meal from KFC - consisting of eight mini breast fillets , two regular popcorn chicken portions , four regular fries , a large portion of BBQ beans , a large coleslaw and a 1.5 litre Pepsi shared equally between four - could contain 5.2g of salt per person .
Of meal combinations aimed specifically at children , the salt content varied from 4.3g of salt in a Pizza Hut chicken wrap and a soft drink to 0.6g in a McDonald 's Happy Meal of chicken nuggets and a fruit bag .
Informed choice
CASH said all the restaurants had information on the salt content of their food on the company websites , but Pizza Hut and KFC had no information at the point of sale .
The saltiest individual meals Pizza Hut Meat Feast Italian Pizza Plus ( meat feast pizza , potato wedges , cheesecake ) 9.7g KFC Variety Meal ( three chicken pieces , two hot wings , Colonel 's Crispy Strip , regular fries , regular diet coke ) 6.3g Burger King Chicken BLT Baguette Meal ( chicken BLT baguette , regular fries , regular coca cola ) 4.8g McDonalds Quarter Pounder with Cheese Meal ( quarter pounder burger with cheese , medium fries , medium coca cola ) 3.2g
They called for all restaurants to carry nutrition information so people could make informed choices .
" It is over four years since the maximum daily limits for salt were established for adults and children , " said Professor Graham MacGregor , chairman of Cash .
" And yet this survey shows that the salt levels in some of these meals are staggeringly high .
" How can these companies justify selling food that contains more than the maximum daily limit for adults and children in a single meal ? "
He added that high levels of salt in childhood contributed to increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack in later life .
A spokesperson for Pizza
Hut said the pizzas highlighted in the survey are not part of a family meal deal and that they had been working since 2004 to cut the salt in their foods .
Lower salt options McDonalds Chicken McNuggets
Meal ( six chicken nuggets , medium fries , medium coca cola ) 1.5g KFC Colonel 's Meal ( two chicken pieces , regular fries , regular diet coke ) 2.5g Burger King Hamburger Meal Deal ( hamburger , regular fries , regular coca cola ) 2.96g Pizza Hut Seafood Lovers Pan Pizza Plus ( seafood pizza , garlic bread , chocolate fudge cake ) 4.7g
" Every sensible parent knows that Pizza Hut is an enjoyable treat and we have significantly reduced the salt levels in our products over the past few years . "
A spokesperson for KFC said they had reduced salt by up to 30 % .
" We were the first - and remain the only - fast food chain to have removed salt from our fries , leaving customers to choose whether they want to add salt or not . "
McDonalds said they had worked hard to make significant reductions in salt levels and would continue to do so .
Burger King said their burgers had no added salt .
OpenID [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is a single sign - on system for the Internet which puts people in charge .
OpenID is a user - centric technology which allows a person to have control over how their Identity is both managed and used online .
By being decentralised there is no single server with which every OpenID - enabled service and every user must register .
Rather , people make their own choice of OpenID Provider , the service that manages their OpenID .
One key function which OpenID supports is the ability for a person to have ‘ single sign - on ’ across multiple OpenID - enabled services .
Having provided their OpenID to the Relying Party they want to access , users are then redirected to their OpenID Provider in order to check their credentials .
This means that sites which implement OpenID do not ever know the user ’s actual password ( or other credentials ) .
The benefit to users is increased security , particularly by employing a strong approach such as a one - time - password to login to their Provider , and a much simpler login experience on the Web .
Note that although true single sign - on is achievable using OpenID it is not a requirement and there may be reasons why an individual will want to retain multiple online identities ( i.e. multiple OpenIDs ) for their different online activities .
OpenID grew primarily out of the blogging community where there was a requirement for people to take the identity used to write their own blog and use it when commenting on other people ’s blogs .
OpenID was originally deployed to 9 million users on LiveJournal.com ; it has since seen steadily increasing adoption across the Internet .
It is particularly interesting to look at its rate of adoption over the past few months .
Not only have the number of OpenID - enabled users grown to around 90 million ( estimated from various OpenID 1.1 Providers , with the majority of users coming from AOL ) but the number of places where OpenID can be used is growing at an increased rate .
Although OpenID started with the blogging community , it is beginning to see adoption in technologies like the Ruby on Rails framework , the Zend PHP framework , and the Django Python framework .
In addition , services such as Technorati , WordPress.com , 37 Signals , and Digg.com ( in progress ) have added support for OpenID .
Large service providers and enterprises such as AOL , Symantec , VeriSign , Mozilla , Novell , Microsoft , and Reebok have also begun working with OpenID in various products and services .
In the majority of cases , an OpenID is a URL , which means that the Relying Party can easily use it to determine the location of the OpenID Provider without recourse to some kind of directory service ( such as the Where Are You From ( WAYF ) service used in Shibboleth [ 3 ] ) .
Additionally , the formulation of the OpenID as a URL has the added advantage that information about the owner of the identity can be made available to interested parties .
URLs are also fairly easy to remember and can be book - marked for later use in services such as del.icio.us [ 4 ] .
An example of this can be seen at the OpenID - enabled site Doxory.com [ 5 ] , a service that tries to discover any friends you have listed via FOAF ( Friend of a Friend ) [ 6 ] at your OpenID URL .
For example , if you log into Doxory using a LiveJournal.com OpenID , Doxory automatically shows you which of your LiveJournal friends are already using the service .
The combination of OpenID and Microformats [ 7 ] such as hCard also makes it possible to discover public contact information about the owner of an OpenID .
Thus OpenID begins to provide the core pieces of infrastructure required for truly portable and user - owned social networks .
OpenID is a relatively simple standard that does a relatively simple job - single sign - on in a distributed and free environment .
It does not try to provide trust or distributed authorisation solutions but is an enabling technology on which these sorts of services can be built .
For example , it supports the transfer of attributes ( information about the owner of the OpenID ) upon which decisions about trust and authorisation can be based .
This also means that users are able to easily share information such as their email address , nickname , or zip code when logging into OpenID - enabled sites , if they choose to do so .
It therefore provides the benefit of more accurate information , as users do not need to re-type it every time they sign - up with a new service .
That ’s the theory anyway .
Let ’s take a closer look at how it works in practice .
An Example
As an example , consider registering with and logging into a Web 2.0 social service called Ziki [ 8 ] .
The OpenID used in these examples is http://andypowell.myopenid.com/, which is often shortened to ‘ andypowell.myopenid.com ’ for convenience .
This OpenID was obtained by registering with the MyOpenID service [ 9 ] .
There are now many OpenID Providers to choose from , though people often use the OpenID provided by their blog hosting service .
Note that the process of creating an OpenID is not shown here .
The Ziki home page has an option for signing up for a new Ziki account .
See Figure 2 .
Selecting the ‘ Create your Ziki now ’ button takes the user to the registration page which indicates that the service supports OpenID as a registration mechanism .
The usual convention is to present the OpenID logo next to any OpenID - enabled login boxes , though at the time of writing Ziki does not seem to have done so .
Putting in the OpenID and selecting the ‘ Sign - up with OpenID ’ button takes users to their chosen OpenID Provider .
To help protect users from phishing attacks [ 10 ] , it is recommended that the Provider ’s login page is bookmarked and used whenever a new browser session is launched .
Many providers , including MyOpenID , have the notion of a ‘ Safe Sign - in Page ’ which is displayed instead of the login form when coming from Relying Parties ( Ziki in this case ) .
As we discuss later , using other more secure authentication methods , rather than a password , can greatly help to reduce these sorts of attacks .
Once users are authenticated to their Provider , they will be shown some additional information about the Relying Party that is being logged into .
Notice that the password is only supplied to the OpenID Provider , not directly to the Ziki service .
Information is also provided on which attributes about the user are going to be passed back to Ziki .
The option of authenticating for this session only , forever , or not at all , is offered .
In this case the choice is made to ‘ Allow Forever ’ .
See Figures 4 and 5 .
At this point the user is passed back to the Ziki site where they can complete the registration process .
Typically this will include supplying additional site - specific registration information , over and above the information that was supplied as attributes by the OpenID Provider .
It may also include an email confirmation step .
See Figures 6 and 7 .
Note that work currently being done on the OpenID Attribute Exchange specification means that in the future all the required information will be able to be requested from the person at their Provider .
Finally , the button to create an account is selected .
Now imagine that users then log out of Ziki and sometime later opt to log back in .
They go to the login page and choose to use the OpenID authentication option , putting their OpenID into the box provided .
Selecting the ‘ Login ’ button takes the user back to their OpenID Identity Provider , where the password or other credentials can be confirmed .
However , because the “ Allow Forever ” option was previously chosen for the Ziki service , this step is completely invisible .
It takes place behind the scenes .
As far as the user is concerned they are passed directly to their Ziki home page and already logged in .
A similar process can be followed for every OpenID - enabled service that the user wishes to use .
Lists of services that support OpenID are beginning to appear , for example , see The OpenID Directory [ 11 ] , but it is still fairly early days in the development of OpenID .
While they are certainly growing in number , not many of the high profile Web 2.0 services support it yet ; we hope this will change in due course .
OpenID and e-Learning
So , what is the relevance of OpenID to e-learning ?
Proponents of Learning 2.0 [ 12 ] and Personal Learning Environments ( PLEs ) argue that we are going to see far greater use of ‘ informal ’
Web 2.0 services as part of the delivery of learning in our ‘ formal ’ learning institutions ( schools , colleges , universities , etc. ) .
If we accept this argument , then the use of OpenID is likely to become increasingly important to our learners .
It can also be argued that the rhetoric of ‘ single sign - on ’ does not carry much weight if what we really mean is one username / password pair for our formal learning services and a second pair for ‘ external ’ services .
As a community , we need to set ourselves the target of enabling true single sign - on to services delivered both inside and outside our institutions .
Doing so almost inevitably means adopting solutions that come from outside our own sector .
Secondly , it also seems fairly clear that our learners are likely to want an online identity ( or several online identities ) that span the different phases of their education and that span the individual institutions within any particular phase .
Why should we expect our learners to adopt a different online identity simply because they have moved from school to college or from college to university ?
Indeed , why would learners want their online identity to change because they have left formal education and moved into the longer - lasting and more flexible environment of lifelong learning ?
Why should learners have to adopt different online identities just because the modules on their chosen course happen to be delivered by several institutions ?
Much the same arguments can be made about researchers , as well as for employees and individuals .
In the future , it may be the case that our institutions remain as Identity Providers ( i.e. as the providers of usernames and passwords ) in the way they are now .
But it also seems increasingly likely that our students will begin turning up at schools , colleges and universities with perfectly good online identities ( in much the same way that they now turn up with perfectly good email addresses ) and that our educational institutions will have to begin functioning as Relying Parties ( i.e. as the recipients of externally authenticated users ) .
In short , students are part of the wider online community and their educational identity ( persona ) is only one facet of their lives .
OpenID and Shibboleth
Within the UK education community there is fairly widespread commitment through JISC [ 13 ] and Becta [ 14 ] to a Shibboleth - based approach [ 3 ] to access and identity management , realised primarily through the development of the UK Access Management Federation for Education and Research [ 15 ] .
Shibboleth leaves identity management within the remit of the institutions ( though they may choose to outsource the provision of the service to a third party [ 16 ] ) .
It therefore does not meet all the potential requirements for user - centric , lifelong identity management outlined in the discussion above .
However , one of the key requirements for institutions adopting Shibboleth is to clean up their internal directory service provision and to take a strategic view of the management of their users ’ online identities .
In adopting Shibboleth , institutions are likely to put the internal ‘ identity ’ infrastructure in place that will make it relatively easy for them to become OpenID Providers and Relying Parties .
Although it is clear that a transition to fully open identity technologies such as OpenID will not happen overnight , institutions must start looking at how identity is managed and how that process can be enhanced the better to support the changing world of online learning .
Open Issues
Like any standard in the area of access and identity management , OpenID is not without some open issues - nor without its critics .
As mentioned above , one potential problem lies in the area commonly known as phishing .
In a phishing attack , a service provider presents a login box on their Web pages that takes users to a page that looks like that of their OpenID Provider , but which is in fact a service hosted by someone else .
Such a service could gather the passwords of unsuspecting OpenID account holders .
There have been some lightweight attempts to circumvent this problem , in part relying on user education about such dangers , the use of HTTPS rather than plain HTTP to communicate with the Provider and user - specific watermarks or other images embedded into the Identity Provider page .
More recently , some OpenID Providers have offered support for browser certificates to get around the phishing problem [ 17 ] [ 18 ] .
In addition , the recently launched MyVidoop.com [ 19 ] service is designed to help further resolve the phishing issue with OpenID , changing how users authenticate online by removing traditional passwords .
VeriSign has also demonstrated a Firefox extension , to be released at the Internet Identity Workshop in May 2007 [ 20 ] , which looks to help solve these issues from within the browser itself .
VeriSign ’s OpenID Seatbelt plugin [ 21 ] is designed both to make OpenID more convenient by automatically filling in a user ’s OpenID URL , providing information as to whether the user is logged into his or her Provider or is on the correct page to do so , and looks at the OpenID interactions to help fight phishing proactively .
However , at the time of writing , it remains an issue in need of a complete solution .
Implementation Options
Various toolkits and libraries are available to help with OpenID implementation , for both Identity Providers and Relying Parties , in a huge variety of programming languages .
More detail about this can be found on the OpenID wiki [ 22 ] .
Conclusions
OpenID is a technology around which there is a growing interest .
Recent commitments to OpenID by AOL , Microsoft , and many other Web 2.0 services place it very firmly in the centre of online identity and access management discussions .
It seems highly likely to have a significant impact on the services that learners and researchers will use in the future .
It is unfortunate that , at the time of writing , there is not greater adoption of OpenID by some of the better known Web 2.0 services .
However , as time passes it seems clear that we are likely to see its adoption by more and more of them .
We also encourage readers of this article to reach out to services online that you ’d like to see OpenID enabled .
For UK educational institutions , OpenID is likely to become one of several access and identity management standards that they need to support .
Therefore , strategic planning in the area of access and identity management needs to take account of the requirement to support multiple standards , and changes to those standards , for some time to come .

When I visited Serta ’s Las Vegas showroom , an executive named Andrew Gross was eager to show me that a traditional innerspring company like his was just as capable of selling better sleep .
Right off the bat , he pointed me to the Serta Perfect Day mattress , noting its emphasis on the mattress as a facilitator of perfect days .
Eventually , he led me to an all - foam bed conceived with the participation of the clothing designer Vera Wang and sold under the Vera Wang by Serta label .
Gross reached down and picked an almost invisible black speck of something off the top of the bed , then began describing its specifications .
In conclusion , he told me that , like all of Serta ’s products , this particular mattress was designed to “ relieve stress . ”
I asked him how it did that .
We stood there for a second , side by side .
Then he said , “ Well , it ’s a combination of the sleep surface materials and the peace of mind that comes from it being a Vera Wang . ”
I looked around the showroom .
A man painted white , wearing a toga , stood on a podium , changing statuesque positions every few minutes .
In the corner , a harpist played “ Desperado . ” I began to wonder if much of the hyperrational mattress talk I ’d been hearing also provided this kind of emotional , Vera Wang benefit .
The hard - to - follow , layer - by - layer tours of each bed ’s many patented technologies ; the scientific studies and pressure maps ; the frequent invocations of NASA engineers ; and even the outsize , sleep - obsessed persona of Pete Bils , senior director of sleep innovation and clinical research , himself — they reassure us that a mattress maker is serious and capable ; that , given how precarious a thing we ’ve turned sleep into , their bed will give us the best shot of succeeding when we climb into it .
Even our relationship with the mattress , then , appears muddled up in the same mysterious space between a subjectively good night ’s sleep and an objectively good one — how we feel and whether or not we can prove it .
And whether the industry realizes it or not , its fledgling campaign to sell better sleep is grappling with the question of which is actually more important to us and which we ’re willing to pay for .
If ramping up messages about sleep science and technology while bombarding us with medical incentives helps sell more beds , it will be because it speaks to our view that better sleep is primarily a requirement for better wakefulness — that we “ sleep to succeed , ” as a recent industry - financed release puts it .
( This same report notes that “ sleep deprivation currently costs U.S. businesses nearly $ 150 billion annually in absenteeism and lost productivity . ” )
And yet it ’s this very view — that sleep is a bothersome means to an end , like eating enough Omega - 3’s — that problematized sleep in the first place .
It encouraged us to power through sleep as efficiently as possible or look for shortcuts .
We all might be better off if the industry sold sleep as something to be savored for its own sake , if it just sold sanctuaries and not sanctuaries that are also clinically proven “ sleep systems . ”
That might help us shed an anxiety about sleeping correctly for a more tolerant love of sleeping well , in whatever form sleeping well might take .
Oddly , in some cases , that may be the most efficient way of getting empirical results anyway .
That is , the industry may only be able to truly offer the kind of life - changing mattresses it sometimes claims to if it fixes the people sleeping in them first .
But that may be just too big a job .
When I carried on about this to David Perry in Las Vegas , he told me that enjoying sleep is wonderful but it , by itself , is a hopeless way to move mattresses given how results - oriented the American consumer is .
“ Remember , ” he said , “ the key benefit is what happens the next morning . ”
To make sure I understood , he tossed off a few slogans in the direction he thought the business ought to be heading : “ Sleep better , lose weight . ”
“ Sleep better and live longer . ”
“ Sleep better and be more productive the next day . ”
Ultimately the Las Vegas Market wore me out .
Everywhere I went people were selling me mattresses — if not a particular mattress , then the mystique of mattresses in general .
I left exhausted , making my way down the tower ’s endless segments of escalators .
When I got halfway , I started to find , on each of the landings , a man strumming a ukulele and a woman in a grass skirt and coconut bikini , hula dancing .
The “ Polynesian Dreams ” luau was getting under way .
Below , in the atrium , the staff was rolling thatched - roofed tiki bars into place and stocking them with ice and mugs with totemic faces painted on them .
A massive sea horse rose from an hors d’oeuvres table .
The same salesmen I ’d been seeing around the showrooms turned up wearing leis , loosening up for what looked like a late night .
I caught a shuttle back to my hotel , set two alarms for seven the next morning and eventually drifted off watching “ Knocked Up ” on pay - per-view .
As far as I know , I slept well enough .
Ever since the first couple of times I 'd smoked it , in my early 20s , I had always maintained a great interest in heroin .
I 'd sort of fallen in love with the warmth of it - the way it felt like crawling back into the womb .
Heroin delivered .
LSD does a bit , especially when all the things that are familiar to you peel away and you suddenly realise the fragility of how you normally see the world .
Marijuana does n't really , although it 's a laugh for a while ( I say that having smoked it constantly for a decade ) .
Alcohol makes you sick and gives you a headache .
Crack is like inhaling plastic , but so brief and flimsy and brittle as a high .
Normal cocaine just makes you nervous , amphetamines are even worse , and ecstasy never really agreed with me .
But heroin gets the job done .
All of us , I think , have a vague idea that we 're missing something .
Some say that thing is God ; that all the longing we feel - be it for a lover , or a football team , or a drug - is merely an inappropriate substitute for the longing we 're supposed to feel for God , for oneness , for truth .
And what heroin does really successfully is objectify that need .
It makes you feel lovely and warm and cosy .
It gives you a great big smacky cuddle , and from then on the idea of need is no longer an abstract thing , but a longing in your belly and a kicking in your legs and a shivering in your arms and sweat on your forehead and a dull pallor on your face .
At this point , you 're no longer under any misapprehension about what it is that you need : you do n't think , " Nice to have a girlfriend , read a poem , or ride a bike , " you think , " Fuck , I need heroin . "
And I never had much trouble getting it , especially when I was working as a presenter at MTV's Camden studios .
Heroin was everywhere in Camden : little blue bags the size of , I suppose , two peas .
That 's how big a £ 10 bag is - half the size of a Malteser , twice the size of a pea .
Just in case you ever become a junkie and you need to score in north London , you can take this article with you as a guide to weights and measures .
" That 's not £ 10 worth , you scumbag .
Look at this Malteser . "
Possibly that 'll be the last sentence you utter before being flung into a canal .
The dealers keep the bags in their mouths .
When you buy one they spit it into their hand and you have to put it directly into your mouth .
Even though you want the heroin , a little bit of you is thinking , " Eeugh !
He 's had it in his mouth . "
After a while , though , you stop thinking that .
It 's a bleak day when that happens .
You know that 's another little boundary that you 've crossed , another principle chalked off to experience , another thing you 've put behind you , because there 's so little in front of you .
" All my days are empty and the pages of my diary are all silver foil , with nought but an inky black snake carving its way through the days , " I once wrote .
Probably to impress a girl .
Once I started hanging out with homeless people in the West End , scoring heroin with them , I realised that there 's this secret culture of people going up and down Oxford Street , whistling and yelping to each other in a kind of tropical slang - men on BMX bikes delivering £ 10 bags of heroin to be purchased with grubby fists full of 50 p and 10 p and 2 p coins ;
West Indian housewife - type women perambulating past Topshop , cheeks wedged with packets of smack .
You do n't see this bustling underworld until you need to .
There have been occasions , thrilling to me , when I went off to score , cutting a purposeful stride down past Tottenham Court Road tube station in the company of three or four homeless people , their sleeping bags worn about their shoulders , like the cloaks of Roman legionaries .
I must have cut a ridiculous figure , dressed in my MTV - presenter attire - skintight white jeans , graffitied tops , Ray - Ban sunglasses - jostling along with them , as they set off in search of a bag in Covent Garden .
Until recently , when I gratefully gave up public transport , I would see people I 'd scored drugs with begging in tube stations .
There was one bloke - I do n't know if he 's still around - whose eyes were missing .
First he lost his wife , then his house , then his shoes , then his eyes ; heroin is a greedy drug , robbing you by increment first of your clothing , then of your skin ; when it finally comes for your life it must be a relief .
The first time I realised I 'd become addicted to heroin , I was staying with Amanda , the woman I 've come closest to loving , in a risible 70s - style hotel in Ibiza .
We lived together for six years , on and off , sometimes in Spain , where she came from , and sometimes in Britain , but there was never any prolonged period when we were what you 'd call comfortable together .
I 'd go to see her in Ibiza , and we'd just ricochet from argument , to sex , to argument .
( I remember chasing her down the street in nothing but a towel once , shouting , " Please come back ! " )
Then I 'd return home to London , to a life of whores and heroin .
I wanted Amanda with me always , but because we spent most of our time apart , I went through a lot of psychological tumult , and increasingly used heroin to take the edge off .
When things went well , I 'd smoke heroin to celebrate , and when they went badly , I 'd smoke some to comfort myself .
" Mustafa Skagfix " , my mate Matt nicknamed me , after I acquired a predilection for wearing Arabian robes .
Amanda did n't like me using heroin .
She knew I 'd been doing it in London , but I 'd told her I 'd given up , so I had to hide my drug - taking from her .
On this occasion , though , there had been no opportunity for me to smoke it in secret .
When I said I thought I might go for a walk , Amanda was suspicious and insisted on coming with me .
At that point I began to get anxious .
I could feel myself heating up and breaking out in a sweat , and then my legs started kicking and jumping .
That 's the worst symptom of heroin withdrawal ; I can tolerate the nausea and the sweating , but I hate it when your legs go all kicky .
That 's where the phrase " kicking the habit " comes from .
Amanda eventually fell asleep , and I had to go into the bathroom and quietly unfold all the things I needed , which I 'd managed to secrete about the place .
I got the foil out , sat on the toilet , lit the lighter under the foil , and the tiny lump of heroin started to liquefy and bubble .
Then it begins to run along the foil , and as it does so a vapour escapes , and you have to hover above it , sucking it up with a tube .
I remember being very conscious of the sound of the lighter , then almost as soon as the smoke had hit the back of my throat , that feeling - the kicky leg , the sweating - it just went .
It was like turning off a light .
Then I could lean back and everything was suddenly all relaxing and beautiful .
It was at this point that I knew that I was an addict , though the pain of that realisation was greatly mitigated by the impact of the heroin : that 's how it gets you .
I used to get in a lot of trouble going back and forth between London and Ibiza .
One time , my pursuit of drugs led me to be shot at with what Matt describes as " a tiny gun " .
I was on my way to the airport , and I had to go to this estate in Swiss Cottage , taking the dealer with me in the MTV account car .
I had dealings with this individual over a long period of time without ever being sure if he / she was a man or a woman .
Anyway , me and the androgynous creature went to the tower block where Goldie used to live ( the drum 'n ' bass pioneer plays no further part in this anecdote - it was just that whenever you had to go anywhere near that place , people always used to point it out and say , " Goldie lived there " ) .
The driver took the dealer 's bike out of the back of the car , while he / she went inside to get the drugs , and as he / she did that a pellet pinged off the top of the car .
Someone was firing at us from inside the block .
It might seem a bit reckless to be picking up drugs on the way to Heathrow , but my need for a regular supply of narcotics would not be constrained by the exigencies of international air travel .
I generally travelled with drugs up my arse in the belief that if customs officers decided to pursue this unsavoury line of inquiry , my day would already be ruined , and the discovery of crack or heroin could n't make it much worse .
Eventually I succeeded in convincing Amanda to leave Spain and come and live with me in London .
Her two conditions for doing this were that 1 ) I quit heroin , and 2 ) I get us somewhere to live .
In pursuit of the first of these goals , my friend Martino booked the three of us a cottage in the Cotswolds .
The last night ( as I grandly , though ultimately inaccurately , styled it at the time ) of my using , I was presenting the annual awards for some dance music magazine .
I had a coterie of friends around me , including Amanda .
I smoked abundant marijuana , smack and crack , and drank a skinful , as well as taking four tabs of Viagra , so I could still fuck .
At one point , I mispronounced the name of a famous DJ ( I think it was Danny Tenaglia , but I 'm not sure even now ) and fell off the stage .
Boy George wrote in his Daily Express column that I had been brilliant and had done it all deliberately .
The canyon between the perception of me and my actual reality seemed to be widening on a daily basis .
The next day , me , Amanda and Martino took an MTV cab to the Cotswolds , costing them £ 400 .
I took a bottle of Jack Daniel 's , an ounce of weed , and loads of videos to get me through my rattle ( as we denizens of the drugs underworld term it ) .
It was awful - hot and cold , nausea , and , worst of all , I remained horrifically awake all weekend .
The best thing about heroin is it turns your life into a waking dream , but then , when I needed it most , my mistress sleep had deserted me .
I still made it through , though , with Amanda and Martino 's help , and managed to fulfil the other precondition for Amanda moving to London , by renting this ridiculously gorgeous flat , just off Brick Lane .
This glamorously empty warehouse - style apartment soon echoed with misery , as our relationship almost instantly became a psychological war .
Amanda was a strong , beautiful woman .
After a string of infidelities on my part , she finally had the good sense to leave me .
I just came home one night , and all her clothes were gone .
I thought this a flabbergasting affront , and threw myself with ever more self - destructive intensity into my work , womanising and , above all , a renewed and increasingly all - encompassing relationship with heroin .
I thought , " Well , at least now she 's left me , I can just take loads of drugs again " .
Not content with damaging myself physically , I set about dismantling my career .
Gritty was the main dealer I used to get heroin off when I worked at MTV .
I liked the fact that destiny had allotted him the name " Gritty " .
Just as Ned Ludd , leader of the Luddites who opposed the Industrial Revolution , would have struggled to make such an eloquent case against the spinning jenny had his name been Fabrizio Zodiac , so the name Gritty seemed well adapted to the needs of his profession .
He seemed a nice sort of man , though .
He had quite a caring side to him , for a drug dealer .
I remember one occasion when I was buying drugs off him near Camden Bridge .
Having just sold me my two £ 10 bags of smack and two £ 10 rocks of crack , he gave me a sincere look and said , " Be careful with that , wo n't you Russell ? "
I was thinking , " What do you mean , ' Be careful with that ' ?
They 're drugs .
What does he think I 'm gonna do with them ?
' Oh no , I seem to have taken them .
Why did n't I heed Gritty 's prophecy ? ' "
One day Gritty asked me once if he could bring Edwin , his eight - year - old son , into MTV to have a bit of a look round .
I said , " Sure , why not ? "
What could possibly go wrong ?
We could call it Bring Your Drug Dealer to Work Day .
The date that the inaugural BYDDTWD happened to fall upon was September 12 2001 , the day after the destruction of the World Trade Centre .
With typical restraint , I decided to go into work dressed in a camouflage flak jacket , a false beard and a tea towel on my head , held in place by a shoelace .
I had been aware of Osama bin Laden for about a year .
He was n't someone people of my age group generally knew about , but he'd been involved with some other bombings and he was top of the FBI 's most wanted list , and I was fascinated by that sort of stuff .
That day , I was going to present this programme called Select , where kids phoned in and chose videos for us to play , and pop stars would come on to flog their records .
Our guest was to be Kylie Minogue .
Me , Gritty and Edwin went into the toilet and the two older members of our party smoked some crack .
Edwin did n't have any .
He was just a little boy , and seemed quite upbeat about life anyway .
Children do n't need drugs , because they have sweets .
We blearily swaggered out of the disabled toilet .
On the other side of the foyer - with its round console , banks of TVs , trendy turnstile and endless parade of beautiful young people of both genders and every sexual persuasion trundling in and out - I saw Kylie Minogue , all famous and everything .
Somewhere in my mind , the artist within me - the situationist within me - thought : " I can create a moment here .
When am I ever going to get an opportunity like this again ? "
Before I knew it , I 'd walked across that foyer , made a kind of " Woo - ooh " noise - in a mum - across - a - neighbour 's - fence sort of way - and said : " Kylie , meet Gritty . "
Then I just stood back to watch it unfold .
What were these two going to talk about ?
It 's the day after 9/11 , and Kylie and Gritty are having a sort of awkward chat , with Gritty trying to be polite and Kylie asking , " What do you do ? " sort of like the Queen would .
And there 's me standing beside them , still dressed as Osama bin Laden .
I thought : " It do n't get any better than this . "
And it did n't , cos they sacked me about two days later .

原文 : Firefox 3 Alpha 8 review by Percy Cabello -- September 20 , 2007 予定通り、 Firefox 3 の8番目のマイルストン 開発版がリリースされました。広範囲なテストが必要な多くの新機能と改善のため、これがベータではなく未だアルファであることは当然のことでしょう。ダウンロードマネージャは最近多くの注目を集めていました。一番印象に残っているのは、ダウンロードの一時停止、再開、キャンセルなどのボタンの追加、ダウンロードの詳細な情報を提供する情報ボタンなどの 広範囲の改修 です。これらは従来のテキストリンクに取って代わり、より一貫性があり直感的な見栄えを提供します。検索バーが追加になり、ダウンロード済みのファイルは自動的に下に移動され、実行中のダウンロードが上部に表示され見やすくなっています。ダウンロードアイテムのソースアドレスをコピーするオプションも追加になりました。また、ダウンロードファイルは自動的に、マシンにインストールされているアンチウィルスソフトに渡されます( Windows )
。Windows Vista のペアレンタルコントロールにも対応しており、同居人が悪意あるソフトウェアをインストールしてしまうことを防ぎたい人や親たちには歓迎されることでしょう。しかし、間違いなく、最も劇的な改善は セッションをまたがった一時停止と再開 機能の追加でしょう : 大きなファイルをダウンロード中にコンピュータの電源を落としてしまったら、、、。心配いりません。Firefox
を再起動するとダウンロードが再開されます。これはサーバがその機能をサポートするかに依存しますが、現在では多くがサポートしています。ダウンロードの再開機能は最近、バグのためにバックアウトされました。しかし、新しいダウンロードマネージャのインターフェースと密接に結び付いているこの機能を有効にしたテストビルドで試してみたところ、見事に動作しました。よって間違いなく次のマイルストーンには載ることでしょう。Places はブックマークと履歴の新統合管理システムであり、新機能の中でも最も期待される機能です。Alpha 7 では必要となるバックエンド機能が提供されました。Alpha 8 ではそれにアクセスするために必要なユーザインタフェースが怒涛の勢いで入ってきています。最も重要なものは
スターとタブ機能 の追加です。ロケーションバーの横にある新しいスターアイコンをクリックするとそのページがブックマークに保存されます。もう一度クリックするとブックマークツールバーや新しいブックマークメニューフォルダなど特定のフォルダに保存することができます。また、そのウェブページをあらわすタグをあなた自身の言葉で追加したり、既存のものから選んだりできます。タグは パーソナルウェブ コンセプトの中で大きな基盤を担っています :
WWW の一部として訪問済みやお気に入りなどをあなたが望むように管理、表現します。（訳注：前半部分の意味が不明）The presented the way you want part of the equation is brought by the new Places Organizer that replaces the previous Bookmarks organizer to better .
今のところ、唯一の変更点はメニューとメインツールバーが places 検索バー付きのひとつの横長のツールバーに置き換えられたことです。管理画面には検索バーとスマートフォルダが追加されました : ブックマークを検索しその検索結果を、閲覧やブックマークの追加･削除に応じて更新される動的リストとして保存します。また、最も多く閲覧、最も最近に追加、最も最近に訪問などの組み込みの検索結果を使うこともできます（訳注：新しい管理画面である
Place Organizer は Alpha 8 には実装されていません）。予定されている
Places 機能の重要なパートではないとはいえ、まだユーザインタフェースは十分ではなく、それは今月末に9番目のアルファがリリースされる主な要因であるといえます。（訳注：誤訳の可能性あり。原文：User interface is not ready for this as it is n’t for a large part of the expected Places functionality and the main reason I believe there will still be a ninth alpha to be released later this month .
）（訳注：次のリリースは10月末のはず）新しいメニューがに追加されました。私は正しく理解していないかもしれませんが、import/export オプションはどういうわけか backup/restore 機能と重なっているように思います。どちらも似たような
HTML ファイルを用います。すばらしいことに、Firefox の自動バックアップ（ 知ってますよね ?）結果を Restore サブメニューから簡単に利用できます。これは誤ってブックマークを消してしまった人のサポートに大いに役立つことでしょう。ブックマークメニューの動作に関しても小さな改善があります。最初に、そして最も歓迎すべきことですが、ブックマークエントリの削除、ライブブックマークのリロード、セパレータやブックマークフォルダの追加の後もメニューは開いたまま残るようになりました。次に、オプションがブックマークフォルダで利用できるようになり、ブックマークのエントリを現在開いているページに置き換える形で開くことができます。また同時に置き換えられたコンテンツ上でバックスペースにより前のページに戻ることができデータ損失を防止できます。しかし、一度にすべてのタブのコンテンツを復元するオプションは無いようです。最後に、ライブブックマークメニューフォルダのメニューの上にフィードを提供しているウェブサイトを開くオプションが利用できるようになりました。ローカルフォルダと
FTP のリスト表示それ に
Gopher が新しいきれいな表示スタイルになりました。FTP とローカルフォルダはより機能的になりました : カラムヘッダの名前、サイズ、日付の上でクリックするとコンテンツが昇順または降順に並べ替えられます。Firefox は最初に実行したときにはちょっと怖いです : ウェブに暗号化されていない情報を送信しようとしているとか、暗号化されたサイトを離れるときやその他の状況であなたに警告を発しますが、これらは多くのケースで避けることのできないものです。この警告は、弱い暗号が使用されている場合や、暗号化されたページが暗号化されていないコンテンツを含む場合に制限されました。それらがフィッシングやクロスサイトスクリプティング攻撃と関係するかどうかはわかりませんが、しかしそれらは確実に関連が高いのです。 toolbar resizer がツールバーのカスタマイズパレットに追加され、検索バーとロケーションバーのサイズを好きなサイズに設定できるようになりました。これはまだ見栄えがひどいものですが、そのうちきれいになるでしょう。タブにいくつかの新しいトリックが実装されました : カーソルをファビコンの上にのせるとカーソルが手の形に変化して、それがドラッグ可能であることを示してくれます。そして以前の大雑把な動きに対して今では
タブはとてもスムーズにスクロールします
Windows Vista の Firefox が ネイティブメニュー をサポートし、見栄えが良くなりました 。Firefox は ログイン後にパスワードを保存する かどうかを問い合わせるようになり、（正しくログインしたことを確認後に）保存するかどうかを判断することができるようになりました。これで自動補完メニューにゴミが入る込むことを避けることができます。ロケーションバーがより情報豊かになり、スターアイコンを表示してそのサイトがブックマークされているかが簡単にわかりるようになりました。さらに興味深いことには、ロケーションバーに文字を入力すると、訪問したウェブのアドレス、ページのタイトル、タグの検索を開始するので、一度訪問したサイトを簡単かつ高速に見つけることができます。アンチフィッシングのために、デフォルトでは、ロケーションバーはポップアップを表示するウェブサイトからも隠すことができなくなりました。主な変更 : アドオンマネージャに プラグインマネージャが追加され 、プラグインの有効化・無効化が簡単にできるようになりました。セキュリティの観点では、拡張機能の更新にはセキュアな接続が必要になりました。これは攻撃者がセキュアでない接続を通じてアドオンサイトになりすまし、マルウェアを配布することができるという
5 月 に公開された脆弱性 に応えるものです。ウィンドウ経由でアドオンマネージャにアクセスできるようになりました。私がこれができるようになることを知ったとき、大昔の
Firefox のようにアドオンマネージャがオプションウィンドウに統合されるのかと思いました。これは、拡張機能の設定を行うつもりでたびたび間違ってウィンドウを開いてしまったときに私を救ってくれました。しかしそれだけではありません。これは単にページの一番下にあるアドオンマネージャを開くためのボタンです。これは新規ユーザのために、彼らをアドオンに導く、あるいは設定を集約化することを目指しているのでしょう。私が使う場合、間違ったときにクリックする回数を減らしてくれるでしょうが、それ以上の利点はありません。もうひとつの重要な変更は、ウィンドウからページの削除、より正確にはその拡張です。それは今ではと呼ばれ、ウェブフィードに対するのと同じようにすべてのコンテントタイプに対してウェブサービスとの関連付けを行います。Firefox 2 のように、ウェブフィードを Netvibes 、Page Flakes や Google Reader のようなオンラインフィードリーダで開くよう設定できます。 オンラインフィードアグリゲータをもっと追加 することもできます 。
Firefox 3 では任意のコンテンツタイプに対して同じことが可能です。マルウェア警告のためのユーザインタフェースが実装されました。マルウェアを配布する疑いのあるウェブサイトを訪問すると、Firefox は警告メッセージを表示します（テストサイトが下に表示されています）。最初は、マルウェアサイトのリストは
Google から提供されますが 、Mozilla は Stop Badware と調整しています。これは独立したマルウェア追跡サイトで、バーバードおよびオックスフォード大学、Google、Lenovo、Sun、Consumer
Reports から支援を受けています。もし合意されれば 、Firefox は Stop Badware のリストを利用できます。私はそれが置き換えになるのか、選択になるのかはわかりませんが（訳注：原文はalternative or exclusively ）、しかしこれ は
Google 提供のリストを利用して昨年実装された Firefox のライブアンチフィッシング機能のように プライバシーの懸念 を防止するのに役立つでしょう。バックエンドの変更は今のところ少ないですが、注目すべきものがあります : カラーマネジメントシステム はデジタルカメラがデジタル写真に組み込む特別なカラープロファイルを
Firefox が利用できることを意味します。このプロファイルは、写真が取られた条件を再現して、色をいかに正しく表示するかをソフトウェアに教えるものです。もろもろを考慮すると、12月のリリースは怪しいところです。前に述べたとおり、まだ重い機能がいくつかリリースされると思われます：
ダウンロードの再開のバックエンドと UI、マイクロフォーマットのサポートのバックエンド、それに多くの
Places UI です。私は PDF としての保存がリリースに間に合うかもしれないと思っていますが、その進捗は非常に少ないと聞いています。オリジナルスケジュールによると、既にベータ2に達しているはずであり、少なくとも数ヶ月は遅れています。リリース候補のための1ヶ月を加えるとクリスマスシーズンはすぐそこであり、Firefox 3は2008年の未来に送られることになるでしょう。
個人的には、高品質でのリリースのために待ちたいと思います。
Have fun !

Was it retaliation by the the Democratic Leadership that exempted Dennis Kucinich from appearing with fellow Presidential candidates at Friday 's Jefferson Jackson Day fundraiser in Iowa ?
Was it Speaker Pelosi 's vindictive payback to Kucinich for his impudent dismissal of her " impeachment is off the table " dictum that kept Kucinich out of the Jefferson Jackson Day party ?
After all , had n't Kucinich introduced HR 333 on the House Floor just that week , calling for the impeachment of Vice President Cheney , in defiance of the prescripted cowardice in Pelosi 's House of Wacks ?
( http://kucinich.house.gov/UploadedFiles/int2.pdf)
Until that moment when Congressman Kucinich introduced impeachment resolution HR 333 on to the House Floor , members of Pelosi's Democratic majority had fallen spinelessly in line , kowtowing to Pelosi 's disavowal of Article I Section 2 of the Constitution , which grants the House the authority to impeach .
( http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h231.html).
Speaker Pelosi's wanton subversion of the Constitution , which has subjected this nation and the world to the continued atrocities of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , will be far more relevant in the annals of history than her singular honor as the nation 's first woman Speaker of the House .
Pelosi 's legacy ( thus far ) , as the most powerful woman in the history of this land , has been shamefully tarnished by catastrophic failures in leadership and courage - predicated principally on her refusal to hold President Bush and Vice President Cheney accountable for their crimes .
On the heels of September 11 , 2001 , George W. Bush squandered his chance to capitalize on the support of the world by not taking the appropriate multilateral actions against the rogues who 'd assaulted our nation from without .
On the heels of January 4 , 2007 , after becoming Speaker , Nancy Pelosi squandered her chance to capitalize on the support of the world by not taking the appropriate multilateral actions against the rogues who 'd assaulted our nation from within - namely George Bush and Dick Cheney .
Pelosi's failure to form the necessary coalitions to pursue Bush and Cheney for their crimes against America is as damaging as George Bush 's failure to form the necessary coalitions to pursue Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri for theirs .
As Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri plot further assaults from without against America , Bush and Cheney plot further assaults from within .
Some may argue the difference between the two - evil - duos is that Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri knowingly harmed America , while Bush and Cheney 's harm is unwitting .
Unwitting or not , Bush and Cheney have done more long - term damage to the safety and stability of America than Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri had ever hoped to achieve .
It 's this failure on the part of Pelosi to use her authority to thwart Bush and Cheney that has incensed Democrats , and growing numbers of Republicans , all across this land .
It 's Pelosi 's suppression of the members of her House , and their willingness to be suppressed , that has incensed Americans all across this land .
Sadly , to the lawmakers ensconced inside the Washington bubble , the intensity of Americans ' anger is likely not known - which makes the need to intensify the levels of activism , including outreach to their offices , that much more necessary .
Constant contact is critical to make them understand .
If only both Houses of Wacks would empty in 2008 - to follow the Great White .
If only we could replenish them all with real leaders .
During the dozen years the Republicans held the majorities in the U.S. Senate and House , there was ample sympathy from the frustrated constituents of the long suffering Democratic minority .
It was believed , and certainly hoped , that if given control , the Democrats would summon the courage and moral authority to end the war and reinstate America 's Constitutional principles and respectability in the world .
Now , a full year has passed since November of 2006 and nothing of the sort has happened .
In retrospect , it was sheer whimsy .
Instead , over the past year , Congress members , under the leadership of the well - mannered , genteel Speaker Pelosi , and Senators , under the leadership of the well - mannered , genteel Senator Reid , are fodder for brawling Republicans .
Instead of backbone , Democrats govern by courtesy .
How does one quantify how many American lives have been lost in Iraq due to courtesy ?
Or how many limbs have been lost ?
Or how many Iraqis have been murdered , maimed and displaced ?
How many Iraqi children have been orphaned ?
How many emergency rooms in America would still be open ?
How many Americans would have health care ?
How many homes would be rebuilt in New Orleans ?
How many fire - fighting planes would have flown over California ?
How many ?
How many ?
We will never know .
In different times - less urgent times - there is much to be said for courtesy .
BUT THESE ARE NOT THOSE TIMES !!!
Then there is Dennis Kucinich - the diminutive giant in the House of Representatives .
The American Congressman from the 10th District of Ohio who refuses to be silenced .
The Democratic candidate for President who passionately upholds his oath to protect the people and Constitution of the United States of America from all enemies both foreign and domestic .
Not as an oral exercise when sworn into office - but as a moral exercise every day in office .
For Dennis Kucinich , NOTHING and NO ONE will suppress his allegiance to his country and to his abiding principle of " strength through peace . "
So when Speaker Pelosi tells the cowards in her House that " impeachment is off the table " because the fight to impeach is too hard , Kucinich does n't believe her .
No one ever told him being a Congressman would be easy .
No one ever told him maintaining democracy was a cinch .
When the President and Vice President commit acts as egregious as lying the nation into illegal war , illegally surveilling their own citizens , endorsing and allowing torture , AND MORE , the strong do n't stay quiet .
It 's the weak , like Pelosi , Hoyer , Emanuel , Clyburne , Boehner , Murtha , Blunt , and over 400 others in Pelosi 's House of Wacks - Democrats and Republicans alike - who do .
As do Reid , Durbin , Lott , McConnell , Feinstein and around 93 more in the Senate House of Wacks - absent Boxer and Feingold who have earned our respect .
At the October 31st Democratic candidates ' debate in Philadelphia , NBC's Tim Russert tried to discredit Dennis Kucinich by questioning him about a UFO .
Kucinich , accustomed to being blind - sided by agenda - minded practitioners like Russert , fielded the question with resilience and cool .
Working in tandem , the networks and Democratic Leadership were trying to force Kucinich out of the running .
It 's amazing how much pressure the honest must endure , while the compliant seem to get a free ride .
At Friday 's Jefferson Jackson Day Democratic fundraiser in De Moines , Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel were n't invited .
Gravel , in all likelihood , was persona non grata to the Democratic Leadership for challenging his " fellows " on their lies , deceits and inadequacies .
Gravel never seemed to " get " that his " fellows " CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH !!
Iowa Democrats , when challenged on Kucinich and Gravel 's absence from the Jefferson Jackson Day event , stated that Kucinich and Gravel were ineligible to attend because they did n't have an office or staff in Iowa .
( http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/outside-the-jefferson-jackson-day-dinner/)
Point of fact , Kucinich had garnered more than enough popularity amongst Democrats to warrant his inclusion .
He 's been polling quite high over the past two months , often running 4th in the field of eight .
( http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/28227)
For those who understand the politics of Pelosi's House of Wacks , it 's clear Kucinich 's dismissal of her no impeachment bray , ensured his own dismissal from her Jefferson Jackson Day .
Particularly since , Pelosi , herself , was emcee .
As of now , Kucinich 's House Resolution 333 to impeach Vice President Cheney has been sent to the House Judiciary Committee , chaired by former progressive hero , John Conyers .
Hopefully , Congressman Conyers will be the fortunate recipient of COUNTLESS letters , phone calls , faxes and emails asking him to give HR 333 SERIOUS consideration when it comes to his committee .
He can change the House of Wacks to a House of Facts - and restore his nation to sanity .
Et tu John Conyers ?
Will you remain silent , as you have , since winning re-election on November 7 , 2006 ?
Or will you remember Article I Section 2 of the Constitution and the oath you swore to uphold it ?
Support Congressman Dennis Kucinich's House Resolution 333 to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .

Download Torrents remotely with Furk.net
piracy
It looks like there is a new solution for students to bypass their college 's P2P ban out there :
File hoster Furk.net offers the ability to remotely download Torrent data onto their web server and then access it as a regular HTTP download .
Furk is one of gazillions of one click file hosters , offering free , anonymous file hosting with an admittedly much less cluttered interface than Rapidshare or Megaupload .
The service imposes some limits on non-paying users , but it has a special value proposition for those who decide to pay 10 Euros ( about 13 USD ) per month :
You can upload . torrent files and start the download through Furk 's web server .
I just tested the service and must say it 's pretty impressive .
Remote download speeds are up to 350 kB per Second , making it possible to have access to a 336 Megabyte file in roughly 24 Minutes .
Of course this is still Bittorrent , so actual download speeds depend on the seeding of the particular file .
Plus the data is not on your hard drive yet , so speed might not be the primary reason to use Furk .
Of course there are some other reasons that make a service like this attractive .
Remote downloading might be a great idea if your college blocks Bittorrent and threatens you with expulsion .
Also ,
Furk makes it possible to download Torrents from your office PC and then access the media effordless from your home PC without tinkering with the Web UI of your Bittorrent client .
And then there isprivacy .
Furk does n't have a privacy policy , and their Terms of Service feature some rater strong words against abuse :
This does however seem to be boilerplate TOS language .
The very same warning is part of the TOS of two other file hosting servics that do n't seem to be related to Furk .
Still , you do n't really know who you are dealing with here - the Whois information of Furk .
net is fake , and the servers seem to reside somewhere in the Netherlands .
Security
Watch thinks that it might be a good idea to use the service with an anonymous pre-paid debit card .
A few more things that are noteworthy about Furk :
You get an email receipt as soon as your download is on their hard drive .
Your disk space is limited to 10 GB , and there is a bandwidth limit of 32 GB per month in place .
The site encourages the use of download managers , allowing up to 25 connections per IP address .
Also , it seems like premium users can share their downloaded Torrents amongst each other .
No words on whether Furk actually seeds content as well though .
IBM JOINS OPENOFFICE.ORG COMMUNITY
IBM joins the OpenOffice.org community to develop and promote OpenOffice.org technology
10 September 2007 --
The OpenOffice.org community today announced that IBM will be joining the community to collaborate on the development of OpenOffice.org software .
IBM will be making initial code contributions that it has been developing as part of its Lotus Notes product , including accessibility enhancements , and will be making ongoing contributions to the feature richness and code quality of OpenOffice.org .
Besides working with the community on the free productivity suite 's software , IBM will also leverage OpenOffice.org technology in its products .
" In the seven years since Sun founded the project , OpenOffice.org has fueled and filled the need for document data and productivity tools that are open and free .
Open source software and ODF are having a profound impact around the world , with numerous communities and organizations coming together to support these initiatives and governments , and corporations and schools standardizing on the software .
We look forward to working with IBM and the other members of OpenOffice.org to ensure that this momentum continues .
We invite others to join us in the community and participate in building the future as OpenOffice.org and ODF continue to gain popularity across the planet , ” said Rich Green , Executive Vice President , Software at Sun Microsystems , Inc .
" IBM is very pleased to be joining the OpenOffice.org community .
We are very optimistic that IBM 's contribution of technology and engineering resources will provide tangible benefits to the community membership and to users of OpenOffice.org technology around the world , ” said Mike Rhodin , General Manager of IBM 's Lotus division .
" We 're particularly pleased to be teaming with the community to accelerate the rate of innovation in the office productivity marketplace .
We believe that this relationship will improve our ability to deliver innovative value to users of IBM products and services .
We also believe that the collaboration will lead to an even broader range of ODF - supporting applications ( ISO 26300 ) and solutions that draw from the OpenOffice.org technology . "
“ This is great news for the tens of millions of users of OpenOffice.org and the thousands of individual members of the project ” , said John McCreesh , OpenOffice.org Marketing Project Lead .
“ We welcome IBM 's contributions to further enhancing the OpenOffice.org product .
But equally important is IBM 's future commitment to package and distribute new works that leverage OpenOffice.org technology supporting the ISO ODF standard .
ODF is a once in a generation opportunity for the IT industry to unify round a standard , and deliver lasting benefit to users of desktop technology . ”
Others involved in the project or distributing the code were equally enthusiastic about IBM "s step .
Mark Shuttleworth , founder of Ubuntu , the Linux distribution , said , " We are excited about IBM joining Sun and other contributors to the OpenOffice.org community in pushing development of OpenOffice.org and the OpenDocument Format .
We are firmly committed to help set , drive and promote open standards like the ODF world - wide to free all users from any dependency on single vendors and proprietary software .
The OpenOffice.org community is showing that it is possible for large , competing companies to collaborate and deliver extraordinary value to all of their users . "
OpenOffice.org is distributed with Ubuntu .
And Hu Caiyong , CEO of Beijing 's Redflag Chinese 2000 Software Co. , Ltd. , whose company contributes significant resources to OpenOffice.org , stated , " We acclaim IBM as a welcome contributor to the OpenOffice.org community !
It 's great to have such a strong partner on our side , one which , with its extraordinary technical expertise and marketing power , will help drive this project so important to free software and open standards .
We are looking forward to a truly productive partnership and harmonious collaboration with IBM , Sun and other contributors on OpenOffice.org . "
Scott Crenshaw , Red Hat 's Vice President of Enterprise Linux , agreed : " IBM continues to show their commitment to the proliferation of open - source software and we applaud them on joining the OpenOffice.org community .
We look forward to continuing our strong relationship with IBM as we work toward a common goal of bringing value to our customers and fostering the adoption of open standards and ODF . "
OpenOffice.org® is the leading open - source productivity suite .
It includes word processing , spreadsheet , presentation , drawing , database , and other modules ; it uses the ODF as its native file format as well as fully supporting other common file formats ( including Microsoft Office ) .
The software runs on all major platforms , including Windows , Vista , Linux , Solaris , Mac OS X , and is available in over 100 languages .
OpenOffice.org is fully interoperable with other popular suites and may be used free of charge for any purpose , private or commercial ; the license is LGPL .
Since the project 's creation by Sun Microsystems in 2000 , nearly 100 million have downloaded the product ; thousands contribute to it .
As an international team of volunteer and sponsored contributors , the OpenOffice.org community has created what is widely regarded as the most important open - source project in the world today .
The OpenOffice.org community acknowledges generous sponsorship from a number of companies , including Sun Microsystems , the founder and primary contributor .

But there are many options .
Fictionwise.com , a bookseller that supports many formats , sells some new novels as multiformat packages that let users choose among 10 readers from companies like Microsoft , Franklin or Adobe .
Microsoft ’s Reader ( www.microsoft.com/reader), for instance , works only with versions of Windows running on PCs or PocketPCs .
Adobe distributes a PDF reader for most major platforms , including cellphones , which runs the Symbian OS found most commonly on Nokia phones .
The basic readers are available free , but some companies offer enhanced versions for a price .
The “ pro ” software from eReader.com costs $ 9.95 and offers a bundled dictionary and more sophisticated features like auto scrolling .
There are also open source packages like Plucker ( plkr.org ) available free .
Many people install several readers so they have at least one that matches the format of the book they want to read .
Advanced cellphones with large screens , like the Palm Treo or the Apple iPhone , can usually display e-books formatted in basic standards like the PDF or HTML , but their controls are not optimized for long texts .
( The drawback : many cellphones have bright displays that drain batteries faster . )
The iPhone also has a screen that is larger than most other cellphone models , and what is on the screen is displayed more crisply .
But it has no custom book reader and no easy way for developers to rewrite their reader package for the phone .
The company is deliberately pushing programmers to package their content for Safari , the Mac Web browser bundled with the phone .
Users who want to read books on their iPhone need to choose HTML or PDF formats .
It is only a matter of time before users create tools specifically for the iPhone , said Michael Hart , the founder of Project Gutenberg , a repository of e-books no longer under copyright protection .
“ The iPod was only out one week before we had e-book readers running on them , so it will be no surprise if there are multiple sets of programs , readers and formats for the iPhone , ” he said .
Indeed , Stephen Pendergrast , the chief technology officer at Fictionwise.com , said his company is trying several formats , including narrow PDF files with margins set to the screen ’s width .
Prices for digital books are often lower than those of printed versions , but the difference may not be as great as people assume .
“ On the e-book side , the author gets a higher percentage , ” said Mr. Pendergrast .
A bigger cut for the author means less for the publisher , and so the publisher charges more to cover costs .
The price of a best seller at Fictionwise is $ 6.79 with no shipping charge when you download it from the site .
Amazon typically charges $ 7.99 for a paperback best seller and requires an order of $ 25 to qualify for free shipping .
Don Chance , a finance professor at Louisiana State University , says it dawned on him last spring .
The semester was ending , and as usual , students were making a pilgrimage to his office , asking for the extra points needed to lift their grades to A's .
" They felt so entitled , " he recalls , " and it just hit me .
We can blame Mr. Rogers . "
Fred Rogers , the late TV icon , told several generations of children that they were " special " just for being whoever they were .
He meant well , and he was a sterling role model in many ways .
But what often got lost in his self - esteem - building patter was the idea that being special comes from working hard and having high expectations for yourself .
Now Mr. Rogers , like Dr. Spock before him , has been targeted for re-evaluation .
And he 's not the only one .
As educators and researchers struggle to define the new parameters of parenting , circa 2007 , some are revisiting the language of child ego - boosting .
What are the downsides of telling kids they 're special ?
Is it a mistake to have children call us by our first names ?
When we focus all conversations on our children 's lives , are we denying them the insights found when adults talk about adult things ?
Some are calling for a recalibration of the mind - sets and catch - phrases that have taken hold in recent decades .
Among the expressions now being challenged :
" You 're special . "
On the Yahoo Answers Web site , a discussion thread about Mr. Rogers begins with this posting : " Mr. Rogers spent years telling little creeps that he liked them just the way they were .
He should have been telling them there was a lot of room for improvement .
...
Nice as he was , and as good as his intentions may have been , he did a disservice . "
Signs of narcissism among college students have been rising for 25 years , according to a recent study led by a San Diego State University psychologist .
Obviously , Mr. Rogers alone can't be blamed for this .
But as Prof .
Chance sees it , " he 's representative of a culture of excessive doting . "
Prof .
Chance teaches many Asian - born students , and says they accept whatever grade they 're given ; they see B's and C's as an indication that they must work harder , and that their elders assessed them accurately .
They did n't grow up with Mr. Rogers or anyone else telling them they were born special .
By contrast , American students often view lower grades as a reason to " hit you up for an A because they came to class and feel they worked hard , " says Prof.
Chance .
He wishes more parents would offer kids this perspective : " The world owes you nothing .
You have to work and compete .
If you want to be special , you 'll have to prove it . "
" They 're just children . "
When kids are rude , self - absorbed or disrespectful , some parents allow or endure it by saying , " Well , they 're just children . "
The phrase is a worthy one when it 's applied to a teachable moment , such as telling kids not to stick their fingers in electrical sockets .
But as an excuse or as justification for unacceptable behavior , " They 're just children " is just misguided .
" Call me Cindy . "
Is it appropriate to place kids on the same level as adults , with all of us calling each other by our first names ?
On one hand , the familiarity can mark a loving closeness between child and adult .
But on the other hand , when a child calls an adult Mr. or Ms. , it helps him recognize that status is earned by age and experience .
It 's also a reminder to respect your elders .
" Tell me about your day . "
It is crucial to talk to kids about their lives , and that dialogue can enrich the whole family .
However , parents also need to discuss their own lives and experiences , says Alvin Rosenfeld , a Manhattan - based child psychiatrist who studies family interactions .
In America today , life often begins with the anointing of " His Majesty , the Fetus , " he says .
From then on , many parents focus their conversations on their kids .
Today 's parents " are the best - educated generation ever , " says Dr. Rosenfeld .
" So why do our kids see us primarily discussing kids ' schedules and activities ? "
He encourages parents to talk about their passions and interests ; about politics , business , world events .
" Because everything is child - centered today , we 're depriving children of adults , " he says .
" If they never see us as adults being adults , how will they deal with important matters when it is their world ? "

First image stored and retrieved from a single photon ( Credit University of Rochester )
Researchers at the University of Rochester have made an optics breakthrough that allows them to encode an entire image 's worth of data into a photon , slow the image down for storage , and then retrieve the image intact .
While the initial test image consists of only a few hundred pixels , a tremendous amount of information can be stored with the new technique .
The image , a " UR " for the University of Rochester , was made using a single pulse of light and the team can fit as many as a hundred of these pulses at once into a tiny , four - inch cell .
Squeezing that much information into so small a space and retrieving it intact opens the door to optical buffering — storing information as light .
" It sort of sounds impossible , but instead of storing just ones and zeros , we 're storing an entire image , " says John Howell , associate professor of physics and leader of the team that created the device , which is revealed in today 's online issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .
" It 's analogous to the difference between snapping a picture with a single pixel and doing it with a camera — this is like a 6 - megapixel camera . "
Diagram of the encoding device .

" You can have a tremendous amount of information in a pulse of light , but normally if you try to buffer it , you can lose much of that information , " says Ryan Camacho , Howell 's graduate student and lead author on the article .
" We 're showing it 's possible to pull out an enormous amount of information with an extremely high signal - to - noise ratio even with very low light levels . "
Optical buffering is a particularly hot field right now because engineers are trying to speed up computer processing and network speeds using light , but their systems bog down when they have to convert light signals to electronic signals to store information , even for a short while .
Howell 's group used a completely new approach that preserves all the properties of the pulse .
The buffered pulse is essentially a perfect original ; there is almost no distortion , no additional diffraction , and the phase and amplitude of the original signal are all preserved .
Howell is even working to demonstrate that quantum entanglement remains unscathed .
To produce the UR image , Howell simply shone a beam of light through a stencil with the U and R etched out .
Anyone who has made shadow puppets knows how this works , but Howell turned down the light so much that a single photon was all that passed through the stencil .
Quantum mechanics dictates some strange things at that scale , so that bit of light could be thought of as both a particle and a wave .
As a wave , it passed through all parts of the stencil at once , carrying the " shadow " of the UR with it .
The pulse of light then entered a four - inch cell of cesium gas at a warm 100 degrees Celsius , where it was slowed and compressed , allowing many pulses to fit inside the small tube at the same time .
" The parallel amount of information John has sent all at once in an image is enormous in comparison to what anyone else has done before , " says Alan Willner , professor of electrical engineering at the University of Southern California and president of the IEEE Lasers and Optical Society .
" To do that and be able to maintain the integrity of the signal — it 's a wonderful achievement . "
Howell has so far been able to delay light pulses 100 nanoseconds and compress them to 1 percent of their original length .
He is now working toward delaying dozens of pulses for as long as several milliseconds , and as many as 10,000 pulses for up to a nanosecond .
" Now I want to see if we can delay something almost permanently , even at the single photon level , " says Howell .
" If we can do that , we 're looking at storing incredible amounts of information in just a few photons . "

Ebbsfleet United are six points off the play - offs
The 20,000 MyFootballClub members have each paid £ 35 to provide a £ 700,000 takeover pot and they will all own an equal share in the club .
In a landmark for English football , members will vote on player selection , transfers and all major decisions .
" We are united in believing this is a great opportunity , " Ebbsfleet chairman Jason Botley told BBC Sport .
" This extra finance and support will enable our club to progress . "
The deal is expected to be completed in a few weeks after a due diligence process and the website will purchase a 51 % controlling stake , while also having the option to buy the club outright in the future .
The takeover is unprecedented in English football , given the website 's stated intention of involving the members so radically in the running of the club , particularly with team selection .
Picking 11 players and formations is n't a precise science
Ebbsfleet boss Liam Daish
After the takeover goes through the current board will stay in place , as will manager Liam Daish , although his title will change to head coach .
Daish insisted that he was happy for fans to have an input on team matters .
" Picking 11 players and formations is n't a precise science and luck often plays its part , " stated the Ebbsfleet boss .
" During and after matches , Ebbsfleet supporters often give me their opinion on which players should or should n't start games .
Now they can have their say .
" My job wo n't change that much .
As a club , we 'll select the starting 11 players and formation together .
" But just as before , what goes on at the training ground and in the dressing room on the day of the match is down to me .
" It 's the supporters ' money that finances this club and pays my wages and those of the players .
" So there 's a good argument for them having a say in what players they want to see . "
Ebbsfleet were formerly Gravesend and Northfleet but the club 's name was changed in May in a bid to tap into the regeneration of the area .
They are currently ninth in the Blue Square Premier , six points off a play - off place for entry to the Football League .
Daish played for Portsmouth , Birmingham and Coventry and has five caps for the Republic of Ireland
And Ebbsfleet 's push for a spot in League Two will receive a boost as some of the funds raised by MyFootballClub members will be available in the January transfer window .
MyFootballClub members will be given the option to vote on who the club should buy .
Daish added that he was fully behind the radical model for the club .
" We all agree we need something extra to take us to the next step , " he said .
" As a football fan , I think the MyFootballClub idea is fantastic .
" As the coach , I look forward to the challenge of working with thousands of members to produce a winning team .
" My assistant Alan Kimble and myself are 100 % committed to making this work . "
Since the website 's launch in April , 50,000 members have signed up , with 20,000 of those paying the registration fee .
The membership subscription is paid annually so new members can join and become owners at any time , adding to the club 's finances .
MyFootballClub was approached by nine clubs and looked into seven of those before opting to take over Ebbsfleet .
The Financial Services Authority has approved the setting up of the MyFootballClub Trust to safeguard members ' interests in the eventuality of the club running into financial difficulties .
606 : DEBATE
" The MyFootballClub ownership model is an innovative way of funding a lower league club , " said Dan Jones , partner at Deloitte and editor of the Annual Review of Football Finance .
" Reports of having raised over £ 700,000 in 11 weeks suggests it is viable too .
" Deloitte has been following its progress with interest and we 're now looking forward to offering our experience in football finance to assist with advice and guidance during the due diligence process . "
MyFootballClub creator Will Brooks added : " We hope that MyFootballClub members and Ebbsfleet supporters will join forces and make the football club more sustainable and successful . "
Jessica McQueen , Ebbsfleet United Supporters '
Trust chair commented : " Being a Trust , our members understand the MyFootballClub concept immediately .
" We very much look forward to working with the MyFootballClub members for the benefit of Ebbsfleet United . "
But Supporters Direct , an organisation which has assisted in setting up over 150 supporters ' trusts in England and Scotland was less enthusiastic .
A Supporters Direct spokesman said : " The question needs to be asked what happens to the club finances and its supporters if the novelty starts to wear off ? "

One of the best - known and most influential present - day treatments of liberty is that of Sir Isaiah Berlin .
In his Two Concepts of Liberty , Berlin upheld the concept of " negative liberty " — absence of interference with a person 's sphere of action — as against " positive liberty , " which refers not to liberty at all but to an individual 's effective power or mastery over himself or his environment .
Superficially Berlin's concept of negative liberty seems similar to the thesis of the present volume : that liberty is the absence of physically coercive interference or invasion of an individual 's person and property .
Unfortunately , however , the vagueness of Berlin 's concepts led to confusion and to the absence of a systematic and valid libertarian creed .
One of Berlin 's fallacies and confusions he himself recognized in a later essay and edition of his original volume .
In his Two Concepts of Liberty , he had written that " I am normally said to be free to the degree to which no human being interferes with my activity .
Political liberty in this sense is simply the area within which a man can do what he wants . "
Or , as Berlin later phrased it , " In the original version of Two Concepts of Liberty I speak of liberty as the absence of obstacles to the fulfillment of a man 's desires . "
But , as he later realized , one grave problem with this formulation is that a man can be held to be " free " in proportion as his wants and desires are extinguished , for example by external conditioning .
As Berlin states in his corrective essay ,
If degrees of freedom were a function of the satisfaction of desires , I could increase freedom as effectively by eliminating desires as by satisfying them ; I could render men ( including myself ) free by conditioning them into losing the original desires which I have decided not to satisfy .
In his later ( 1969 ) version , Berlin has expunged the offending passage , altering the first statement above to read : " Political liberty in this sense is simply the area within which a man can act unobstructed by others . "
But grave problems still remain with Berlin 's later approach .
For Berlin now explains that what he means by freedom is " the absence of obstacles to possible choices and activities , " obstacles , that is , put there by " alterable human practices . "
But this comes close , as Professor Parent observes , to confusing " freedom " with " opportunity " in short to scuttling Berlin 's own concept of negative freedom and replacing it with the illegitimate concept of " positive freedom . "
Thus , as Parent indicates , suppose that X refuses to hire Y because Y is a redhead and X dislikes redheads ; X is surely reducing Y's range of opportunity , but he can scarcely be said to be invading Y's " freedom . "
Indeed , Parent goes on to point out a repeated confusion in the later Berlin of freedom with opportunity ; thus Berlin writes that " the freedom of which I speak is opportunity for action " ( xlii ) , and identifies increases in liberty with the " maximization of opportunities " ( xlviii ) .
As Parent points out , " The terms ' liberty ' and ' opportunity ' have distinct meanings " ; someone , for example , may lack the opportunity to buy a ticket to a concert for numerous reasons ( e.g. , he is too busy ) and yet he was still in any meaningful sense " free " to buy such a ticket .
Thus , Berlin 's fundamental flaw was his failure to define negative liberty as the absence of physical interference with an individual 's person and property , with his just property rights broadly defined .
Failing to hit on this definition , Berlin fell into confusion , and ended by virtually abandoning the very negative liberty he had tried to establish and to fall , willy - nilly , into the " positive liberty " camp .
" Berlin 's fundamental flaw was his failure to define negative liberty as the absence of physical interference with an individual 's person and property … "
More than that , Berlin , stung by his critics with the charge of upholding laissez faire , was moved into frenetic and self - contradictory assaults on laissez faire as somehow injurious to negative liberty .
For example , Berlin writes that the " evils of unrestricted laissez faire … led to brutal violations of ' negative ' liberty … including that of free expression or association . "
Since laissez faire precisely means full freedom of person and property , including of course free expression and association as a subset of private property rights , Berlin has here fallen into absurdity .
And in a similar canard , Berlin writes of
the fate of personal liberty during the reign of unfettered economic individualism — about the condition of the injured majority , principally in the towns , whose children were destroyed in mines or mills , while their parents lived in poverty , disease , and ignorance , a situation in which the enjoyment by the poor and the weak of legal rights … became an odious mockery .
Unsurprisingly , Berlin goes on to attack such pure and consistent laissez - faire libertarians as Cobden and Spencer on behalf of such confused and inconsistent classical liberals as Mill and de Tocqueville .
There are several grave and basic problems with Berlin 's fulminations .
One is a complete ignorance of the modern historians of the Industrial Revolution , such as Ashton , Hayek , Hutt , and Hartwell , who have demonstrated that the new industry alleviated the previous poverty and starvation of the workers , including the child laborers , rather than the contrary .
But on a conceptual level , there are grave problems as well .
First , that it is absurd and self - contradictory to assert that laissez - faire or economic individualism could have injured personal liberty ; and , second , that Berlin is really explicitly scuttling the very concept of " negative " liberty on behalf of concepts of positive power or wealth .
Berlin reaches the height ( or depth ) of this approach when he attacks negative liberty directly for having been
used to … arm the strong , the brutal , and the unscrupulous against the humane and the weak … .
Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep .
The bloodstained story of economic individualism and unrestrained capitalist competition does not … today need stressing .
The crucial fallacy of Berlin here is insistently to identify freedom and the free market economy with its opposite — with coercive aggression .
Note his repeated use of such terms as " arm , " " brutal , " " wolves and sheep , " and " bloodstained , " all of which are applicable only to coercive aggression such as has been universally employed by the State .
Also , he then identifies such aggression with its opposite — the peaceful and voluntary processes of free exchange in the market economy .
Unrestrained economic individualism led , on the contrary , to peaceful and harmonious exchange , which benefitted most precisely the " weak " and the " sheep " ; it is the latter who could not survive in the statist rule of the jungle , who reap the largest share of the benefits from the freely competitive economy .
Even a slight acquaintance with economic science , and particularly with the Ricardian Law of Comparative Advantage , would have set Sir Isaiah straight on this vital point .
The course of human history from the dawning of agriculture in the Near East about ten thousand years ago , to the present , can be understood as embodying the progressive development of ever more complex political economies .
Developing this complexity has required coordinating the actions of ever larger groups of humans together for collective purposes .
After 10,000 years of this process of political and economic complexification , civilization now finds itself confronting fundamental crises of survival due to peak oil , global climate change , and political and economic failures to deal with these crises .
Given this reality , an understanding of the dynamics of this process , using systems theory offers considerable insight into our history .
Furthermore , it offers insights into what we must do in the here and now to ensure that civilization can transform itself to survive and thrive in the face of these ever intensifying challenges .
Most accounts of ancient societies present them as being centered upon their unique pantheon of gods and goddesses .
Across the planet , the rise of civilization is centered upon the rise of that civilization ’s gods .
The center of each civilization is the place where its gods were worshipped .
The unification of a cultural region into a unified political body required the unification of the pantheon of gods for that civilization .
The story of civilization is the story of civilization ’s gods .
For example , at the dawn of history , by about 3200 BCE , ancient Sumeria possessed a common language and culture shared between diverse , often warring , city - states .
In conjunction with a common pantheon of major gods , each city state had its own unique patron deity .
The massive ziggurat near the center of each of these city - states was dedicated to this patron god .
For example , in Lagash the patron deity was Ningirsu .
In nearby Uruk it was Inanna .
Not only were these cities physically built around the temple of their patron god , so also was their political economy organized around the cult of this god as well .
The cult of the chief god , in conjunction with those of the lesser gods , unified the city ’s population .
Following the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in about 3,000 BCE , a composite pantheon of gods and goddesses for all Egypt was established which provided the basis for Egypt ’s unity and cohesion for 3,000 years .
The different agricultural regions of China developed a variety of gods .
These came to be merged into a unified pantheon during the Shang Dynasty beginning about 1750 BCE .
This pantheon of gods included Le Kun god of thunder , Kuan Ti , god of war , Kwan Yin , goddess of mercy and compassion , and many others .
With this religious unification came the political unification of China over the next millennium .
I could go on and on and on .
Looking at this relationship from the perspective of systems theory offers considerable explanatory utility .
A system is any group of elements which interact with one another in such a manner as to give the group on interacting elements a group identity .
Systems possess three fundamental characteristics :
1 ) interconnectedness
2 ) boundedness
3 ) emergence
Every element in a system is connected to , and so is affected by , every other element in that system .
Every system possesses a boundary , which distinguishes the area that is inside of a system and the area which lies outside of it .
The system ’s boundary can be either open or closed to this surrounding environment , either allowing movement through it or closing the system off from outside influence .
Systems can be either simple , in that they follow invariant , deterministic behaviors , or they can be complex in that their behavior at any future moment is not knowable .
Finally , systems possess group properties which cannot be attributed to the composite influences of their elements .
Emergence is a true scientific miracle of nature .
Consider the simple system formed by two hydrogen atoms combined with one of oxygen into a molecule of water .
This molecule possesses the group property of , call it , “ wetness ” .
Wetness cannot be reduced to the individual properties of its constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms .
Consider also a single neuron .
It is not aware of anything .
Yet billions of these neurons combined together into your brain — a complex system — possesses consciousness and self - identity .
These can not be attributed to its constituent neurons .
Rather , consciousness is an emergent property of complexly interconnected neurons .
As these neurons are made of ordinary atoms , consciousness is an emergent property of matter , complexly arranged .
With emergence , the whole is greater than the sum of the system ’s constituent parts .
Understanding this critical concept is the key to understanding the central role of gods in the emergence and subsequent development of human civilization towards increasing complexity .
It is also key to understanding what we must do now to preserve civilization at this moment of supreme crisis .
Organizing early agrarian societies required regulating and coordinating the behaviors of large groups of people who were not directly related .
Family hierarchies were not adequate for this purpose .
However , if everyone in a geographic community would not only speak the same language , but also worship the same gods , organizational problems could be resolved .
If the gods represented sacred Authority , and all members of a community acknowledged this sacred Authority , then earthly Representatives of these gods — Priests and or Kings , could command everyone in Their name .
A unified political economy could then emerge .

Click to viewBooting Linux from an external drive with the applications and settings of your choice has never been easier after this week 's release of Puppy Linux 3.0 .
Like Damn Small Linux , Puppy is small enough to fit on a USB thumb drive , and like Knoppix , you can boot it from CD .
Puppy can also add your favorite open source applications to the desktop and save multiple user profiles back to your writable CD or thumb drive , too .
Let 's take a look at how you can take your operating system , apps , data and user settings to go with Puppy Linux .

Puppy Linux 3.0 Now Available PC only : Minuscule Linux distro Puppy Linux got a major upgrade this week to version 3.0 , adding … Read more
What You Can Do with Puppy
The two main uses for Puppy Linux ( or any Linux live CD ) are to :
Rescue files imaging that drive
Compute on a machine without leaving a trace — like browser history , cookies , documents or any other files — behind on the internal hard drive
Advertisement
While there 's a wide range of Linux live distro's available , Puppy Linux is a fantastic option which offers a full computing environment with rich graphical apps like the Mozilla Seamonkey suite , Word and Excel equivalents , calendar , chat and photo editors , too .
What You 'll Need
Before we get started setting up Puppy Linux , you 'll need :
A CD or DVD burner
Software that can burn an .ISO file to CD or DVD , like ISO Recorder
A thumb drive ( the roomier the better , 1GB recommended )
A PC that can boot to CD or USB drive
The Puppy Linux 3.0 .ISO file .
Download it here .
Alternate location
Set Up and Boot Puppy Linux for the First Time

First burn the Puppy .ISO image to CD using ISO Recorder .
( With ISO Recorder installed , just right - click the disk image to copy to CD . )
Once your Puppy Linux CD is written , leave it in your CD drive , shut down your computer and restart .
If your computer is set to boot from CD , Puppy Linux will start .
( See step 2 listed here for more info on setting your computer to boot from CD if Windows starts up again , even with the Puppy CD inserted . )
When Puppy boots you 'll have to answer a few questions before you see a desktop : what keyboard layout it should use ( most likely the first choice , U.S. ) , and what video resolution it should use based on your video card and monitor .
The video setting can be a bit hit or miss , but you can test the various options to find the one that works .
( While I did n't have any trouble on a 5 year old Dell PC , at least one Lifehacker reader had a bit of trouble . )
Once you start up X ( Puppy 's windowing system ) , you 'll get a desktop that looks like this ( click to enlarge ) :

Puppy does n't automatically mount your thumb drives or connect to the network , you have to do that for it .
As the instructions embedded on the desktop say , click on the Connect icon ( just once , not twice ! ) to get your internet access set up .
Here 's what that looks like :

You do n't have to set up your network connection every time you boot Puppy .
Once you 've acquired an IP address , Puppy will ask you if you want to save the settings for your next session .
( More on session info saving below . )
The other thing you 'll want to do is mount your thumb drive , which Puppy also does not do by default .
Click on the Drives icon , then select your flash drive ( which should be plugged in , if not , do so and then click Refresh ) .
Advertisement
Save Your Puppy Linux Settings to Writable CD or USB Drive
Once you 've got your initial setup complete , shut down Puppy to save your settings either to your USB drive — or if you left your CD - R session open , to CD .
When you shut down Puppy it will ask you if and where to save your session , which you 'll also be able to give a custom name .
Advertisement
Next time you boot up Puppy with the USB drive plugged in ( or from that writable disk ) , it will automatically detect your session settings and the desktop will no longer have the initial run wallpaper included .
It will look more like this ( click to enlarge ) :

From here you can further customize your Puppy session ( use multiple workspaces , set your desktop background , timezone , shortcuts , etc . )
To save your session at any point to thumb drive , click once on the " Save " icon .
Add Applications to Puppy Linux
Puppy comes with a stunning array of rich desktop applications to start with ( do explore the menu to check ' em out ) , but not all of them might be familiar to you .
Luckily you can add your familiar favorites using Puppy 's package manager , its answer to Windows Install Wizard .
From the Menu's Setup area , launch the PETget package manager and pick and choose the apps you want to add to puppy .
( Click to enlarge screenshot ) :

Here you can see I 'm adding Firefox , Thunderbird , the Gimp , OpenOffice.org and an interesting looking money manager called PuppyMoney .
It 's a virtual software buffet !
Booting and Saving to Only a USB Drive
Sadly my old PC does n't have the ability to boot from a USB flash drive , but yours might .
To ditch the optical disk entirely , install Puppy to a USB drive using the universal installer ( located in the Menu 's Setup area . )
There you can install Puppy to the media of your choice :

Interview with Dutch Terror Expert ' I 'm Not All That Worried About Terrorism '
The terror arrests in Germany on Tuesday shocked the country .
SPIEGEL ONLINE spoke with terror expert Edwin Bakker about homegrown terror , what to do about radicalization and why he is n't terribly worried about terror .
Imagine the scene :
As angry protesters march outside , a nation ’s unpopular president prepares to address students and faculty at a prestigious university .
Introducing the president , the head of the university is bluntly critical of his guest speaker : “ You , quite simply , [ are ] ridiculous .
You are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated .
. . .
I doubt you will have the intellectual courage to answer [ our ] questions . . .
I do expect you to exhibit the fanatical mind - set that characterizes so much of what you say and do .
. . .
Your preposterous and belligerent statements . . . led to your party ’s defeat in the [ last ] elections . ”
Unfazed , the president rises to begin his speech .
His sometimes bizarre remarks generate hoots of derision .
But he plows on civilly , though he ducks and weaves when faced with critical questions from the audience .
When the clock runs out , many are dissatisfied with his answers .
But everyone applauds the courageous head of the university , who was n’t afraid to speak truth to power , and everyone praises the student protesters , who exemplified the democratic values of dissent and free expression .
Would n’t it be wonderful if something like that could happen in our country ?

No , no , I mean really happen in our country .
Tuesday ’s farce in New York at Columbia University , starring Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the Unpopular Presidential Guest and Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger as The Man Who Spoke Truth to Power , does n’t count because it was just that : a farce .
Ahmadinejad was playing to global public opinion , and though he lost some PR points for incoherence and general bizarreness of message ( “ In Iran , we do n’t have homosexuals ” ) , he gained some for coming off as a bit more mature than his prissy , infantile host .
( “ In Iran , when you invite a guest , you respect them , ” Ahmadinejad observed dryly . )
Bollinger , meanwhile , was playing to a different audience .
After taking a beating for giving Ahmadinejad a forum , he was eager to show the media , alumni , concerned Jewish organizations and a raft of bellicose neoconservative pundits that he was no terrorist - loving appeaser of Holocaust deniers .
In a narrow sense , both Ahmadinejad and Bollinger achieved their goals .
Ahmadinejad showed that he could be dignified in the face of crass American bullies , which will play well abroad -- and may even buttress his dwindling prestige in Iran .
And Bollinger showed that he can be a crass American bully , which , in our current political climate , is what passes for “ courage . ”
Advertisement
Bollinger ’s tactics went down well with the New York media , anyway : The New York Sun rhapsodized about a “ Teaching Moment , ” while the New York Times expressed the pious hope that “ what Americans and Iranians will remember is that image of professors and students , in a true democratic forum . ”
And Bollinger seemed quite pleased with his own performance .
The Bollinger - Ahmadinejad Show was “ free speech at its best , ” Bollinger modestly explained to reporters .
Sorry , no .
“ Free speech at its best ” is when someone really does speak truth to power , and power stops blathering long enough to engage with inconvenient ideas .
If an Iranian professor , inside Iran , had said what Bollinger said to Ahmadinejad , that would have been brave .
Or -- stay with me here -- if Bollinger had invited President Bush to Columbia and made those same unvarnished remarks to him , and Bush had toughed it out and struggled to answer half a dozen unfiltered , critical questions from an audience not made up of his handpicked supporters . . . .
Well , that too would have been free speech at its best .
Unfortunately , that ’s not the kind of thing you ’re likely to see in America .
Advertisement
It ’s odd , because Bush -- like Ahmadinejad -- makes plenty of statements that , to paraphrase the eloquent Mr. Bollinger , could be characterized as ridiculous , provocative , uneducated and fanatical .
( Take Bush ’s repeated suggestion of a link between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 attacks , for instance . )
And as in the case of Ahmadinejad , some of Bush ’s preposterous and belligerent statements contributed to the GOP ’s defeat in the last elections .
But so what ?
Here in the land of free speech , elites -- including those at universities -- too often collude to keep our own president in his safe little bubble .
( Those who forget to pretend that the emperor is fully dressed , such as Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents Assn. dinner or Jimmy Carter at Coretta Scott King ’s funeral , are instantly chastised for being “ inappropriate . ” )
This week , a global audience saw Iran ’s “ petty and cruel dictator , ” as Bollinger called him , courteously parrying questions from hostile students -- something viewers wo n’t see our democratically elected president doing .
So fine , let ’s congratulate ourselves for showing Iran just how many freedoms we have in America .
But when we get done congratulating ourselves on our fancy freedoms , let ’s figure out why we ca n’t be bothered to put them to use .

In an appearance on CNN along with her attorney Brian Toder , Jammie Thomas announced her decision to appeal last week 's $ 222,000 willful copyright infringement verdict .
The basis of her appeal will be jury instruction no .
15 , which told the jurors that they could find Thomas liable for copyright infringement if she made the recordings available over a file - sharing network , " regardless of whether actual distribution has been shown . "
The " making available " argument is a contentious one .
As we noted last night in " How the RIAA tasted victory , " judges have gone both ways on this issue .
The question of whether making a file available over a P2P network falls under the category of distribution as defined by the Copyright Act is by no means settled in the eyes of the law .
During the hearing over the jury instructions , the RIAA cited a number of cases in which a judge had ruled that making a file available constituted distribution .
In one such case , Atlantic v. Howell , the judge has since reversed his decision .
Copyright attorney Ray Beckerman reported late last week that Judge Neil V .
Wake overturned his earlier granting of a summary judgment , in which he had followed the RIAA 's interpretation of the making available argument .
According to a post on Thomas ' MySpace page , the appeal will center around the " making available " argument .
The hope is that the RIAA " would actually have to prove a file was shared and by someone other than their own licensed agent ( read MediaSentry ) , " writes Thomas .
Should the verdict be overturned due to faulty jury instructions , the RIAA and Thomas would both have expensive decisions to make on whether it would be worthwhile to try the case once again .
Although the RIAA freely admits that its lawsuit campaign is a money - losing proposition , the prospect of paying for another trial and spending another week in Duluth , MN , can't be very attractive .
Thomas , who is already facing legal fees of over $ 60,000 on top of the judgment , may not want to repeat the trial experience again , either , especially since much of the RIAA ' evidence against her was strong .
Ars contacted both the RIAA and Toder for comment , but did not immediately receive a reply .
The Southern Regional Education Board , a nonprofit organization started by governors , said that of the 1,200 high schools it works with in 32 states , about half now require students to specialize , though not all have gone so far as to require majors .
In New York City , where the small schools movement has spawned Food and Finance High School and the Academy of Hospitality and Tourism , education officials said that a handful of other schools that focus on business , science or math have established majors for their students .
“ This is like the middle - class version of what affluent families have been doing for years , ” said Mitchell Stevens , an associate professor of education and sociology at New York University , who sees the move as a way for public schools to provide a broader menu of educational choices .
“ They tailor academic instruction around the needs and desires of their children in order to encourage them to do well in school . ”
Here in Englewood , every eighth - grader already works with a guidance counselor to formulate a six - year academic career plan that stretches through the first year of college .
Elementary - school classrooms are named Harvard , Yale and Rutgers .
The district ’s 1,063 high school students attend classes in Gothic - style buildings on a 40 - acre campus named for Dwight Morrow , a former senator and diplomat whose daughter , Anne , married Charles Lindbergh .
Surrounded by top- performing school districts , Dwight Morrow ’s students have scored below the state average on basic skills tests .
In the 2005 - 6 school year , 79.6 percent passed the state reading test and 65.4 percent the math test , compared with 83.5 percent and 75.9 percent statewide .
District officials said they are establishing the majors to personalize the learning experience and engage students , and because college admissions officers have said over the years that they favor students with expertise in particular areas since it demonstrates commitment and passion .
“ We need to stay ahead of what traditional high schools are doing , ” said the superintendent , Carol A. Lisa .
“ We felt in this district we had to level the playing field so our children could compete and go to top schools . ”
Michael A. Polizzi , an assistant superintendent , said the district carefully researched future demand for jobs , examined college programs and surveyed students about their interests before settling on its first six majors : sports management , fine and performing arts , health sciences , international studies and global commerce , communications and new media and or liberal arts .
In 2008 , the school plans to add environmental studies and a “ preteaching institute . ”

Wednesday , September 19 , 2007 New : Take a Stand Analyst : China building world ’s largest navy as U.S. sea power is in ' absolute decline '
By Cliff Kincaid
Did you know that China could become the world ’s leading naval power by 2020 ?
That ’s the verdict of military analyst Tony Corn .
This may help explain why the U.S. Navy thinks a piece of paper called the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty provides some sort of protection for American forces on the high seas .
It offers no such protection , of course , but it creates the impression that Navy leaders are doing something about our increasing weakness and vulnerability .
However , like so many other U.N. treaties , including the 19 anti-terrorism treaties in effect on 9/11 , this one offers a false sense of security .
It will mask a dramatic decline in our military power .
The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) will be the subject of a September 27 hearing before Senator Joe Biden ’s Foreign Relations Committee .
All of the witnesses are pro-treaty .
Another hearing is scheduled to follow and a quick Senate vote on the pact is then predicted .
This process is better known as a railroad .
Like the illegal alien amnesty bill , our Senate leaders , in cahoots with Bush Administration officials , are trying to rush it through .
It remains to be seen whether the American people will wake up in time .
Can we count on the media to blow the whistle ?
The betting here is that talk radio and the Internet will have to carry the load .
Also In This Edition Before the Senate rushes into an embrace of this treaty , it might be advisable for our media to tell the complete story of the decline of the U.S. Navy and attempt to explain how and why this has happened .
But that would require that major news organizations pay less attention to O.J. and Britney .
And that may be too much to ask .
Corn explains what is happening right before our eyes .
“ Though globalization has increased the importance of maritime affairs , there has been both a relative and an absolute decline of U.S. sea power , with a U.S. Navy today at its lowest level in the post - World War II era , ” he notes .
“ For the first time in 20 years , the U.S. is in the process of drafting a new maritime strategy , but with a considerably reduced force that went from 600 to fewer than 300 ships , and with new responsibilities in terms of nonmilitary maritime security .
Hence the concept of the Thousand Ship Navy , which is meant to create a global maritime partnership with foreign navies . ”
According to the Navy ’s June 2007 Playbook , this 1,000 - ship Navy is one that traverses the high seas under “ hundreds of flags . ”
This plan depends on using foreign Navies , which are called “ partner countries , ” for our defense .
Perhaps a U.N. Navy will even be involved .
The Playbook declares , “ A groundswell of support from military leaders around the world has allowed us to move forward with this concept and make it a reality . ”
Military leaders around the world ?
They have “ allowed ” us to move forward with this concept .
Since when did U.S. Navy officials look to foreign officials and leaders for guidance on what to do about U.S. national security ?
It apparently started sometime after the decline from 594 Navy ships under President Reagan , who rejected UNCLOS , to only 276 today .
We are headed down to only 180 ships in 17 years .
Protecting U.S. national security has given way , according to the Playbook , to securing the “ global community . ”
That ’s on page 8 .
It also declares that “ Diversity is a strategic imperative for the U.S. Navy ” so that it can be “ more relevant . ”
Our Navy has not only been infected with the disease we all know as political correctness but it has come under the influence of international lawyers who pay homage to the U.N. Asked why U.S. Navy officials were supporting UNCLOS , one Navy Commander , with an important position in the Department of the Navy , told me , “ The political leaders do n’t really understand the issue , and they all listen to the lawyers .
And the lawyers are all liberal .
It is absolutely the problem .
The Navy JAGs and the OGC [ Navy ’s Office of General Counsel ] are liberal .
It is a tragedy . ”
We should have had some inkling of the problem when , in 2001 , a U.S. Navy EP - 3 reconnaissance plane was brought down and the crew made hostages by the Chinese .
The Chinese regime detained the crew for 11 days and the plane for more than three months .
The crew was released after a U.S. statement that China interpreted as an apology .
The U.S. military response was to dispatch Admiral William J. Fallon , then - commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific , to China to kiss the butts of Chinese officials .
According to press reports , he got excited on a 2006 visit because the Chinese allowed him to sit in the cockpit of a Chinese warplane .
Fallon , who has since been made the head of U.S. Central Command , said he wanted U.S. - China ties to be more “ open and transparent . ”
This constituted nothing less than groveling to officials of an outlaw regime .
Although the U.S. said the Navy plane was in international airspace , the Chinese charged that the flight was a violation of UNCLOS , which its government had ratified .
As one analyst noted , the U.S. and China interpreted the treaty text differently .
But because the U.S. had not ratified the treaty , we were free to ignore it , as well as the Chinese interpretation .
The U.S. did n’t have to grovel .
But we chose to do so .
Meanwhile , U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Mullen has just completed his own trip to China and has indicated he would improve ties with China when he takes over as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff next month .
Mullen is said to be the brain behind the 1,000 - ship Navy concept .
One story notes that Mullen ’s concept is “ to build on existing international security agreements to extend the global reach of sea power . ”
That power , he says , includes the ability to “ share and unite ” nations .
Sounding like a U.N. Secretary - General , rather than a U.S. military leader , Mullen says , “ Our vision is to extend the peace through an interconnected community of maritime nations working together . ”
That includes UNCLOS .
There is one big problem with Mullen ’s “ vision . ”
What happens when a country like China violates the treaty ?
It is clear , based on the EP - 3 incident , that the U.S. does n’t have the political will or military capability to confront China .
So what happens when the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea rules for China and against the U.S. ?
It can only mean further surrender by the U.S. in the face of Chinese military power .
This is just one of several questions that occur to those wondering why the U.S. is so eager to ratify a treaty that most certainly will be interpreted to go against American interests .
If anyone doubts that decisions of the tribunal or its subsidiary panels will go against America , one only has to note that the so - called Group of 77 , which includes China , is now the largest intergovernmental organization of developing states in the U.N.
Despite its name , it has increased to 130 countries .
It not only dominates the U.N. , it dominates the membership of UNCLOS .
The handwriting is on the wall .
Or , rather , the treaty .
The U.S. is walking into a trap .
What ’s worse , Navy officials should know it .

After what Los Angeles money manager Arnold Silver called " a brutal three days , " the question is :
What now for the market ?
A Wall Street superstar this year who runs Balestra Capital Partners , Jim Melcher , says he 's " worried about a recession .
Not a normal one , but a very bad one .
The worst since the 1930s .
I expect we 'll see clear signs of it in six months with a dramatic slowdown in the gross domestic product . "
Balestra Capital , a $ 350 million New York hedge fund , was up 3 % for the past three market sessions , when the Dow Jones Industrials , spearheaded by widespread declines in financial stocks and fears of more billion - dollar - plus asset write - downs , tumbled more than 677 points , or about 4.5 % .
The Nasdaq fared worse , skidding about 7 % , triggered by across - the - board declines in those fast - stepping technology stocks .
Balestra has increased in value by 175 % so far this year , Mr. Melcher tells me .
A 9 - year - old fund , it has posted compounded annual growth of about 30 % since its inception .
Mr. Melcher , a market bear , had some pretty discouraging words .
" What I think is not good for the country , but good for me . " he says .
His basic advice to the country 's roughly 80 million stock players :
Run for the hills  the worst is far from over .
An investor 's stock portfolio now , he believes , should be only about half of what it might normally be .
With the housing market in a state of collapse  and he says he believes it is far from over 
Mr. Melcher argues that average homeowners will not be able to withstand the kind of recession he sees , given the added burdens of rising energy and food costs , and continued deterioration in the credit markets .
Noting that consumption is already slowing , Mr. Melcher figures sharply rising unemployment is inevitable .
Another of his worries is that central banks around the globe , America 's included , are debasing their currencies , which is setting the stage for a new round of higher inflation .
Our bear figures the next six to 12 months will be awful for investors as the market goes down " pretty substantially . "
His frightening outlook calls for an additional 20 % to 30 % decline from current levels .
A drop of that magnitude would put the Dow down in a range of roughly 9,100 to 10,400 .
Asked how he could conceivably give credibility to such an ominous forecast , Mr. Melcher observes : " I 've never seen a market with more risk and what 's significant is that risk is not yet priced in . "
Given his grim expectations , he says there is no equity market in the world he would play right now .
" When the American market goes down , other equity markets around the world should follow , " he says .
As of now , his portfolio is pretty much devoid of stocks , save for an exchange - traded fund focused on leading companies in oil services , which he regards as an ongoing growth industry .
The ETF , the Oil Services Holders Trust , trades on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol OIH .
Although enthusiastic about the industry 's growth prospects , Mr. Melcher says he would be reluctant to recommend oil services stock because he believes the price of oil could easily drop 50 % in the recession he envisions .
Another danger he sees for the market is the prospect of huge withdrawals of funds from America by foreign investors due to the falling dollar , the credit crisis , and a slowing economy .
At the moment , Mr. Melcher 's chief investment strategy is shorting stocks and certain bonds , notably mortgage - backed and junk bonds , through the use of derivatives , put options , and credit default swaps .
He is also short ABEX , an index of residential mortgage - backed securities .
His short strategy is largely responsible for his super performance this year , as are his holdings in gold .
The fact he 's sticking to this strategy is evidence that he firmly believes the chaos in the financial markets is far from over .
Mr. Melcher is also gung - ho on several currencies , particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen .
The average investor , he believes , should seek to protect his assets by raising cash , putting money to work in short - term treasuries , and buying some gold ( notably through StreetTRACKS Gold Trust , an ETF that tracks the price of the precious metal and trades on the Big Board under the symbol GLD ) .
Is the world coming to an end ?
I asked our bear .
" I do n't think so , " he replied , " but as I mentioned , the ingredients are in place for the worst kind of a recession , which means it 's the wrong time to own stocks . "

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , President George W. Bush visited the Islamic Center in Washington , where he told his audience , “ These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith … .
The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam .
That ’s not what Islam is all about .
Islam is peace . ”
In Britain his sentiments were echoed by Prime Minister Tony Blair , who told the Arabic newspaper al - Hayat : “ There is nothing in Islam which excuses such an all - encompassing massacre of innocent people , nor is there anything in the teachings of Islam that allows the killing of civilians , of women and children , of those who are not engaged in war or fighting . ”
However reflective such views may be of the “ moderate ” Muslim majority , they are not uncontested .
As John Kelsay shows in his new book Arguing the Just War in Islam , debates about the ethics of conflict have been going on since the time of the Prophet Muhammad .
The scholars who interpreted the Prophet ’s teachings addressed issues such as the permissibility of using “ hurling machines , ” or mangonels , where noncombatants including women and children , and Muslim captives or merchants , might be endangered .
In the “ realm of war ” outside the borders of Islam a certain military realism prevailed : for example the eighth - century jurist al - Shaybani ( who died in 805 ) stated that if such methods were not permitted the Muslims would be unable to fight at all .
There may be a vast distance in time and technology separating al - Shaybani ’s authorization of mangonels and the attacks on New York and Washington , but the boundaries of legal discussion remain remarkably consistent .
In their 1998 Declaration Concerning Armed Struggle Against Jews and Crusaders following the deployment of US troops in the Arabian Peninsula , Osama bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri , and their cosigners belonging to the “ World Islamic Front ” cited rulings by thirteenth - century scholars including the celebrated jurist Ibn Taymiyya in order to justify their ruling that “ to fight the Americans and their allies , civilians and military , is an individual obligation for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible . ”
In a recent video bin Laden invites Americans to embrace Islam , a requirement the classical authorities insist on before a non-Muslim enemy may legitimately be attacked .
The critiques of bin Laden ’s statements coming from religious authorities focus on the means by which the ultimate objective of a “ restored ” Islamic polity under Sharia law may be achieved , rather than the objective itself .
For example , in a recent open letter to “ Brother Osama , ” the prominent Saudi cleric Sheikh Salman al - Oadah makes a scathing attack on bin Laden for the excessive violence and damage to Islam inflicted by his campaign — including the “ destruction of entire nations ” and the “ nightmare of civil war ” in Afghanistan and Iraq , with their impact on the surrounding countries .
But the sheikh ’s quarrel with bin Laden is essentially about means rather than ends .
The burden of his attack is that al - Qaeda ’s methods — and the …
In the first sign that the federal government is favouring a retreat from the coast rather than rebuilding , the Army Corps of Engineers is to present to Congress a radical plan which includes rebuilding the wetlands that have been disappearing at an ever - accelerating rate in recent years .
The Corps , the engineers responsible for protecting the coastline , has been working on the plan since Katrina struck in August 2005 .
President George Bush promised after the floods to rebuild New Orleans and other Gulf communities .
But federal agencies and environmentalists have concluded that climate change has increased the threat of further devastation and continued rebuilding makes no sense .
To be included in the overall plan is $ 40 bn ( £ 20 bn ) to be spent on the Mississippi coast .
Part of this would be for a voluntary buyout of 17,000 houses in Mississippi , particularly in Bay St Louis , east of New Orleans .
The corps is likely to extend the plan to New Orleans and Louisiana .
Susan Rees , project director , said : " The whole concept of trying to remove people and properties from the coast is very , very challenging .
The desire to live by the water is strong . "
The plan has had a mixed reception .
While some have welcomed the chance to leave the area rather than face further storms , others have rebuilt their homes and are reluctant to leave .
Local politicians said the plan would destroy communities because they could not be sustained if many people opted to take the money .
Fishing and tourist villages on the coast were already fragile after Katrina , with many families opting against return .
Among those opposed to the buyouts is Gene Taylor , a Democratic congressman : " It ai n't going to happen .
There 's no money for it , there 's no will for it and there 's no public support for it . "
He is rebuilding his home in Bay St Louis , which could lose about 60 % of its land to buyouts .
William Walker , director of Mississippi 's marine resources department , said some communities had opted to move out en masse .
" These areas probably should not have been developed in the first place .
It 's not practical to ask the federal government to keep rebuilding and repairing after repetitive floods , " he said .
Oliver Houck , a professor at Tulane University who has studied coastal controls , called buyouts a reasonable option .
" Any programme that attempts to subsidise their continuing to stay in place is simply subsidising another wipeout , " he said .
Part of the $ 40bn would also be spent on rebuilding the fast - disappearing wetlands , which provide a natural barrier against flooding .
The loss of wetlands is partly man-made : silt from the Mississippi that built them up has been prevented from reaching the Gulf by flood - protection levees constructed by the army corps .
Orrin Pilkey , director of a shoreline programme at Duke University , said the coast was eroding , sea levels rising and hurricanes may be becoming more forceful .
" A retreat is our only solution , " he said .
A 250lbs bear clings to a ledge on the Rainbow Bridge , near the town of Truckee , California .
The bear panicked and tried to jump over the bridge 's rail after two vehicles drove past it as it crossed the bridge - it was stranded for almost 24 hours .
Rescuers lower a nylon net from an army surplus store as the bear looks on .
More than 100 people gathered to see the rescue .
Rescuers shot the bear with a tranquiliser dart before using a pole to push it into the safety net .
An abseiler looks on as the bear is lowered to the ground .
The sheepish looking bear finally makes it back to land .
He then made a quick exit into the hills near the ski slopes of nearby Lake Tahoe .

BANGKOK ( Reuters Life ! ) - A
Thai bank is pitching into the battle against HIV / AIDS and handing out condoms to customers too shy to get them at the shop .
An employee of Kasikorn Bank shows a " K " condom at the bank 's headquarters in Bangkok October 2 , 2007 .
The bank is pitching into the battle against HIV / AIDS and handing out condoms to customers too shy to get them at the shop .
To match story THAILAND / CONDOMS REUTERS / Arthur Jones Dionio
Despite Bangkok ’s reputation as one of the world ’s sex industry centers , Thailand is a generally conservative country .
Kasikorn Bank launched the “ Condoms for Confidence ” campaign at 600 branches nationwide and said it would start giving out the sheaths , branded K - Condom and K - Excellence , later this month .
“ HIV / AIDS is returning to Thailand since the government awareness campaign started 20 years ago has fizzled out , ” said a bank spokesman who declined to be identified .
“ We want the teenagers to be aware of the problem . ”
Despite a tenfold plunge of overall new HIV / AIDS cases from 15 years ago , the health ministry has said it was concerned about the numbers of teenagers and homosexuals still being infected .
Disease Control Department chief Thawat Suntrajarn said embarrassment about buying condoms and ignorance in using them were the main causes of the new cases .
“ Research papers from all sorts of agencies have a consensus that many condom users are embarrassed to buy condoms from counters , ” Thawat told Reuters .
“ Women who buy condoms from convenience stores always get a strange look from people , so condom handouts are a good way to avoid such embarrassment . ”
New HIV / AIDS cases in Thailand , once praised by international health agencies for its aggressive campaign to tackle the epidemic , had fallen to 13,000 in 2006 from more than 100,000 a year in early 1990s , Thawat said .
But the worrying sign was that many of the new patients were teenagers and homosexual men , not heterosexual men in their 30s and prostitutes as in the past , he added .
A Health Ministry - commissioned survey last year showed 48 percent of 5,712 male high school students used condoms .
About 43 percent of 7,712 female high school students said their sex partners used condoms , it said .
Spurred by the findings ,
Thawat ’s department is running a television advertisement encouraging people to buy condoms despite criticism from conservatives who argue it encourages teenagers to be sexually active .
“ Even those bank customers who do n’t need to use the condoms , they can pass them on to their families or friends , ” he said .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 25  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice conceded on Thursday that there was a “ hole ” in United States law that had allowed Blackwater USA employees and other armed contractors in Iraq to escape legal jeopardy for crimes possibly committed there .
In an appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Ms. Rice said the administration would support new laws that would apply to contractors but expressed reservations about proposals to bring contractors under the military justice system .
She deferred a number of other questions about problems with the supervision of the thousands of private security guards in Iraq , saying she planned to meet with Robert M. Gates , the secretary of defense , to try to come up with new rules to avoid episodes like the shooting by Blackwater gunmen on Sept. 16 that Iraqi investigators have said left 17 Iraqis dead .
“ Obviously we need a better coordinated policy for all of them , ” she said .
Blackwater , meanwhile , under continuing siege in the courts , the news media and Congress , stepped up its public relations efforts this week with a mass e-mail message to its employees , suppliers , fellow security contractors and political allies , asking them to flood Congress with messages of support .

a member of the " Axis of Evil " with plans to develop nuclear weapons .
But , as Peter Hitchens found when he evaded the Marxist state 's ban on foreign journalists , it is a nation to be pitied rather than feared ...
If this is a showcase , then what can it be like in the parts they do not want us to see ?
North Korea 's capital , Pyongyang , is closed to all but the most favoured citizens .
Only friends of the regime may live here .
Yet in this citadel of privilege , every face I see is thin , every belt tight , every garment worn and faded , every child and adult under - sized , most windows unlit .
For the ordinary poor , who cannot even leave their towns without a permit ,
Pyongyang is almost as inaccessible as New York or Paris .
How thin and ragged are they ?
Those considered unreliable must live out their chilly , pinched lives amid the dreary spoil - heaps and miserable townships of the coalfields .
How wretched can they possibly be ?
As for those who offend the regime , a chain of labour camps , stretching from Yongchon on the west coast to Onsong in the far north east , is hidden in the northern mountains , where no foreigner penetrates and where people die of hunger and despair , unrecorded .
I am not sure how we can live our prosperous lives , knowing these wretches exist .
Here in the alleged paradise city of Pyongyang , the buildings are blistered and stained , the paint faded and cracked .
Except for a few main processional ways – and even here there are signs of decay – the shabbiness and gloom are overwhelming .
At dusk , when a normal city would begin to sparkle , an almost total darkness falls in the long interval before the first lights come on .
Later , when the government considers bedtime has arrived , the power is cut off from a million homes , whose occupants will be wakened at 5 am by plonky music leaking from loudspeakers , and ordered to work by a siren at 7 am , every day but Sunday ( and sometimes even then ) .
Now , in the early evening , silence is almost complete .
I can hear a drunken man singing from what feels like half a mile away .
Yet we are at the heart of a city of perhaps three million people .
And the lights , when they do come on , are so feeble that I am suddenly reminded – poignantly – of the austere British townscapes of my own childhood in the early Fifties .
Except that even they were never as austere as this .
Nor were they sinister and mad , as this place is .
If all politics is a sort of mental illness that gets worse as the politicians ' power increases , then this is the locked ward where absolute power has brought absolute insanity .
Brooding over the deranged cityscape is the ugliest building in the universe , a 1,000 ft pyramid , already a ruin though it has never been finished and never will be , perhaps because the money has run out , perhaps because it is so jerry - built that nobody would ever have dared stay in it .
Official guides pretend not to notice it though it is by far the tallest structure in Pyongyang .
This symbol of overweening ambition is by a strange coincidence the exact shape and size of the Ministry of Truth , the chief source of official lies in George Orwell 's prophecy of just such a state , and just such a city , in 1984 .
It is almost as if North Korea 's rulers have taken Orwell 's novel as a handbook rather than a warning .
But where Orwell 's ministry was a glittering white , the abandoned Ryugyong Hotel is a dingy dun-brown , its hundreds of glassless windows like sockets gazing at what its maker , the Great Leader Kim Il Sung , has wrought .
And what he has wrought is hopeless failure , a long , grim joke that has yet to reach its punchline .
Kim 's city is the capital of a state that is far more of a danger to its own people than it is to the rest of the world .
It may be – I think the evidence is sketchy – that North Korea has a nuclear bomb .
What is certain is that it has almost nothing else .
It cannot any longer even fake success at its very heart .
Its great propaganda festival , the Arirang Games where thousands of young Koreans create vast pictures with eerily synchronised movements , is a pathetic remnant .

It is the only show I have ever been to where the cast is far bigger than the audience .
The colossal May Day Stadium was three - quarters empty the night I went .
The performance , in which Joseph Stalin meets Walt Disney , was less confidently militaristic than in past times and most of the " soldiers and sailors " were attractive young women in pert skirts , none looking very menacing .
Sometimes it descended into circus , with platoons of dancing children dressed as boiled eggs , and a motorbike on a tightrope .
Every machine in the country is close to breakdown .
This even affects parts of the system that are on show .
I was there as a tourist , arriving in a Soviet - built Tupolev from the age of Yuri Gagarin , which shuddered and strained into the sky and was prudently kept clear of terminal buildings at the Chinese airport from which I began my journey .
My tour bus failed ( its fuel tank sprang a leak that the driver tried to plug with chewing gum ) on the way to a museum of gifts given to Kim Il Sung .
Our guide pedalled off for help on a borrowed bike but the bus that eventually rescued us also breathed its last , forcing us to walk the final few hundred yards to an unscheduled break for lunch .
We never arrived at the museum .
While the first bus was broken down , we were prevented from moving more than a few yards away from it – probably because we would then have been able to look closely at the nearby lorryload of runt - sized troops , part of the supposedly fearsome North Korean army .
The weapons they carried were ancient , probably more dangerous to their users than to their targets .

Vehicles everywhere were decrepit , clothes shabby and faded from much washing , in the greys , browns and greens that dominated our streets in the years before cheap and colourful fabrics .
I never saw anyone in jeans or a baseball cap .
The soldiers looked universally undersized and underfed , usually with prominent cheekbones .
And the ' military - first ' policy means that they get better food supplies than most civilians .
How do the ordinary people fare ?
We can not tell .
But here is one possibility .
Some years ago , the leading American expert on North Korea , Bradley Martin , had an accidental and obviously unintended glimpse , in a remote district , of a train bearing ordinary North Koreans : " They were a ghastly sight .
" Their clothing was ragged and filthy , their faces darkened with what I presumed to be either mud or skin discolourations resulting from pellagra .
There was no glass in the windows of their train . "
Yet much of the country is hauntingly lovely , willow - fringed fields in which peasants stagger under heavy sheaves , villages that are picturesque from a distance but squalid at closer quarters .
This month the roads are lined with flowers growing riotously in the verges , a hint that beneath the weight of despotism , Koreans seek freedom in ordinary things .
One of my five days in the country was a public holiday , an ancient festival of ancestor worship too powerful to be suppressed , when the whole country went picnicking in hilltop country graveyards .
But on a working day , in a 200 - mile drive , I saw just two tractors in operation in the fields – probably because there is no fuel for them .
In five days of travelling by road , I saw miles of electrified railway , but only four moving trains , and they were rolling slowly and hauled by diesel locomotives , suggesting the current is erratic or just switched off .
My allegedly luxury hotel in Pyongyang had its power cut off each morning as soon as the tour parties had set off on their various pilgrimages to the many shrines of the Great Leader .
Sometimes it was if we were witnessing a sort of Truman Show , in which even the casual passers - by might easily have been rehearsed actors pretending to be real people .

A promised visit to Pyongyang 's underground railway consisted of a trip between two stations , during which ordinary travellers were cleared from our carriage .
Many passengers stared at us with shock that we were there at all .
Even in Pyongyang , a foreigner is an event .
As we descended the immensely deep escalators , a party of women on the upward staircase were singing a song about how they could n't manage without their Dear Leader .
A similar hymn drifted from the loudspeakers .
Genuine ?
Accidental ?
Or staged ?
But not everything could be arranged or controlled .
A number of incidents lifted the veil without meaning to .
Richard Jones , the intrepid photographer who accompanied me , raised his camera towards an ancient , 5ft gentleman in a Mao cap , trimming the grass on a Pyongyang boulevard .
The old man , possibly a veteran of the Korean War , snarled and raised his sickle as if to strike .
Having been taught from childhood that Westerners are wolves in human form , he intended to defend the fatherland against the imperialist spy .
On another occasion , we arrived at our pre-booked restaurant to find a drunk – or possibly a corpse – sprawled outside .
Seeing us approaching , loyal citizens immediately formed a human barrier to shield the sight from alien eyes .
The trouble is , even if everything we saw was what we were meant to see , the impression given is of a society in an advanced stage of decomposition , held together by a fragile web of lies .
The cult of the Great Leader is much like that of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito before 1945 .
In fact it is probably modelled on it , since all Korea was under Japanese rule until 1945 and the people were compelled to worship the emperor as a god .
But it has other elements , too .
Confucianism demands respect for ancestors , perhaps the origin of the red-and - white obelisks in every town proclaiming that the Great Leader is " always with us " .
But there may be other roots for this .
Kim Il Sung as a teenager played the organ in his father 's Protestant church and seems to have liked it .
When American soldiers captured his offices in the Korean War , they found a sizeable organ , of all things , installed there .
Kim was bored by Christianity , preferring ( by his own account ) to go fishing than to church .
But he was paying attention , and many have wondered if the worship of father and son – Kim Il Sung and present leader Kim Jong
Il – is a blasphemous copy of Christianity .
In any case , it seems to work .
As we barrelled down the long , straight , empty motorway that leads to the closed border with South Korea , our guide asked merrily if we knew how the Korean War had started .
I said , cautiously , that our imperialist history books said that it had been started by the North .
The poor man 's face fell as if I had wounded him .
It is an essential part of North Korea 's founding myth that the war was started by the Americans and the South .
Even a mention of any other version of history upset him , an intelligent person with a sense of humour , judging by his behaviour the rest of the time .
He took it as a British person of my generation might take a claim that Britain was the aggressor in 1939 .
It was to avoid upsetting or scandalising him that I later made a shameful obeisance to the Kim Il Sung image , laying flowers and offering a perfunctory bow .
I feared that if I did n't , I would be treading on a real , living personal faith , not just showing disrespect to a cold , dead cult .
And I think I was correct in this judgment .
For this really is – as Eastern Europe and Russia never were – a wholly closed country where a large majority more or less believe the state propaganda .
East Germany tried to stop its people watching West German TV , but abandoned the effort because it was just too difficult .

Powerful transmitters – the BBC , Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe – broadcast to Russia and her empire so successfully that in Prague in the Seventies people would come up to me in trams to pass on their thanks for the existence of the BBC Czech service .
But not here .
Every radio and television has its tuning dial soldered so that it can receive only North Korean signals .
Inspectors visit frequently to check that nobody has tampered with this mental barricade .
And , while a few brave souls defy this ( resoldering the dials when an inspection is due ) , most are too frightened , or so loyal , that it would never occur to them to do so .
In Cold War days South Korea used to float radios across the border on balloons , but few dared use them even when they got through .
There is no internet access here for ordinary beings .
On a trip round a vast " people 's study centre " , we were shown North Koreans supposedly working at computers .
But when one of us tried to reach the Google search site , he could get nowhere .
The screens had no link to the outside world .
A librarian boasted of her stock of English - language books but , asked if she had a copy of 1984 , had plainly never heard of it .
A supposed economics expert , likewise , did not seem to have heard of the free - market economist Milton Friedman – and there was much consternation among the guides when I asked about these things .
North Koreans live under a thick blanket of darkness , with a hopelessly distorted or restricted picture of the outside world .
They have never seen pictures of the terrorist attack on New York 's World Trade Centre .
They are vaguely aware of The Beatles ( I was proudly offered the chance to listen to a rare tape of Ob La Di , Ob La Da in the People 's Study Hall ) .
One of my guides claimed to have heard of The Rolling Stones , but could n't name any of their songs .
It is easy to understand why North Korea does not want " I can't get no satisfaction " echoing round its darkened avenues .
But this skewed , half - blind view of the world has its serious side .
It is a judicious mix of truth and outrageous lies .
Heaven knows what is taught in schools ( we were not allowed near any ) but the authorities have produced an English - language version of a propaganda pamphlet called US – The Empire Of Terrorism , which is the local answer to American accusations that North Korea sponsors terrorist groups , and to George W. Bush 's accusation that North Korea belonged to an ' Axis of Evil ' .
Some of its charges against America are truthful .
But these are mingled with unhinged fantasies and lies .

After a relatively factual attack on the United States ' treatment of the Native Americans , and on seizure of Mexican territory , the pamphlet declares : " In April 1968 , the US administration organised the assassination of Martin Luther King , a black Baptist leader who advocated freedom and equality of the blacks .
" Enraged by this , the blacks rose in a revolt that swept across 46 cities simultaneously .
It was an act in self - defence .
However , the administration retaliated by going on a spree of white terror ...
" Black survivors of white hooliganism and terror are now confined to Detroit , Appalachia and the delta of southern Mississippi , where they live a dispirited life .
For fear of racist terrorism , the 22 million black population hesitate to go to schools , theatres , restaurants and even public lavatories ... "
I am not making up this rubbish , nor did anyone try to conceal it from me .
The bookstall attendant , in a pleasant mountain resort , who sold it to me ( for $ 1 ) was delighted by my purchase .
One of Pyongyang 's unexpected treasures is an American warship , the spy vessel USS Pueblo , which is moored as a trophy on the Taedong River , and is perhaps the last place on Earth where the Cold War is kept alive .
It is extraordinary to walk into the most secret rooms of this ship , where the ultimate espionage technology of 40 years ago is on open display ( including decoding machines marked ' NOFORN ' , which means that their products could not be shared with the British MI6 ) .

It still looks surprisingly modern .
An angry propaganda video records the ship 's capture in January 1968 , and the dismal humiliation of her captain and crew in an incident rather similar to ( but much nastier than ) Britain 's recent experience in the Persian Gulf .
If only , the North Korean government must wish , the Cold War could be brought back .
As a Soviet ally , Pyongyang received the aid that allowed it to build this concrete show city and sustain its unyielding regime with food for the loyal and brute force for the rebellious .
Now the concrete crumbles and there is no money for food or bullets .
North Korea , desperate and destitute , is accused of everything from drug- running and money - laundering to forging dollar bills to stay alive .
It reluctantly seeks food aid from the outside ( and gives most of it to friends of the regime ) .

Last October 's supposed nuclear blast ( which experts still dispute ) may well have been the leadership 's infuriated response to the freezing of its accounts in a Macau bank , accounts allegedly used to buy luxuries for the loyal elite who dwell behind police barriers in tree - shaded Changgwang Street near the old Soviet Embassy , venturing out in black 4x4s with tinted windows .
Certainly the unfreezing of these accounts has been a key part of the talks that reopened after the bomb went off .
Here , too , is " office Building No 15 " , headquarters of Dear Leader Kim Jong
Il who took over from his father in 1994 .
The younger Kim , short , podgy and unimpressive , has spoken in public only once and has been careful not to usurp too much of his father 's prestige .
The old man was , after all , a guerrilla leader in the war against the Japanese and is revered by older citizens who remember their country rising out of the flattened ruins of the Korean War before it was surpassed economically by the capitalist south .
Much effort was devoted to keeping him alive , for fear that his successors would fail to maintain his magical hold over the people .
Doctors at the Kim Il Sung Institute of Health and Longevity prescribed a special diet of extra-long dog penises ( minimum length 2.8 in ) to keep the Great Leader well .
Maybe it was this regime that kept him going until he was 82 , perhaps helped by the " Happy Corps " and the " Satisfaction Corps " of attractive young women recruited to serve in the chain of secret palaces and mansions inhabited by Kim Il Sung and his far - less - impressive son and heir , Kim Jong Il .
Female beauty is a passport to preferment in North Korea .

The Dear Leader is still rumoured to choose Pyongyang 's famously attractive traffic policewomen who , clad in fetching uniforms , control the sparse traffic with strangely provocative robotic gestures .
But the succession , a laughable breach of Marxist dogma , surely cannot go any further .
The Younger Kim was 65 in February and is said to suffer from diabetes and to have recently undergone unnamed major surgery .
He looked unwell when he appeared in public for Tuesday 's summit with the South Korean President , Roh Moo-hyun .
His eldest son , Kim Jong Nam , is an unlikely heir , though he is already 36 and was educated in Switzerland and China .
Inconveniently , he was caught in 2001 travelling to Japan on a false Dominican Republic passport , with two women ( neither of them his wife ) and a suitcase full of cash .
The passport was in the name Pang Xiong , Chinese for " fat bear " , a name that rather suits him .

The world needs to work out – quickly – how this murderous black comedy can be brought to an end that is not too painful .
The obvious answer would be reunification with South Korea .
But South Korea and North Korea alike are terrified by the example of Germany , where unity devastated the East and nearly bankrupted the West .
It also left the old East German elite jobless and humiliated , and pursued by the courts .
Economic experts believe a merger of the two Koreas would ruin the South .
As for the Dear Leader , he presumably thinks it safer to cling on than risk being strung up like Saddam , locked up like Slobodan Milosevic or hounded to death like Augusto Pinochet .
North Korea 's new version of nuclear blackmail is just that , crude extortion by people who have no honest way of supporting themselves .
Give us aid and money , they demand , or we may do something terrible .
If they do fulfil their threats , it is hard to know who will be most badly hurt .
Pyongyang 's Taepodong rockets are wildly unreliable and as likely to fall into the sea or strike the wrong country as to hit their intended targets .
Their nuclear technology is crude and possibly faked .
Meanwhile , increasing numbers of emaciated North Koreans are fleeing across the Chinese border or working abroad .
The long - hidden truth about the outside world filters back from them to their friends and families .
And the Dear Leader and his loyalists have no idea how they can secure the succession of the world 's first Marxist - Leninist hereditary monarchy , a problem that looks rather urgent .
Quite soon , it will have to be admitted that neither Kim Il Sung nor Kim Jong
Il are the godlike beings they are made out to be .
Quite soon , the entombed , defrauded North Koreans will realise their fatherland is not a great power and that it is bankrupt and backward .
It will be a hard moment for them and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
It is our responsibility to try to see that there is nothing worse .
Pretending that North Korea is a terrifying great power , when it is in truth a crippled nation stranded between two worlds by the end of the Cold War , and made increasingly irrational by poverty and pain , will not help .
It is a country to be pitied rather than feared .
The NYPD ’s new patrol chief has ordered that special overtime money earmarked for cops in violence - prone precincts be given to “ aggressive ” officers rather than “ do - nothings , ” The Post has learned .
Chief Robert Giannelli issued that edict last week during a meeting with his borough chiefs , who then relayed it to their precinct commanders , sources said .
His order affects a pool of funds known as Impact Overtime .
In some boroughs , that money has gone only to veteran cops permanently assigned to precincts that have high incidences of shooting and other violence .
In other boroughs , the funds have been made available to veteran patrol officers who work overtime in such precincts on special duty , without being permanently assigned to them .
But Giannelli , a 40 - year department veteran who took the top patrol job last month , now has said the system should reward cops who use their overtime shifts to make a lot of arrests involving higher - profile crimes such as gun possession , shootings and robberies .
Sources said Giannelli also wants to reward cops who use their overtime shifts to issue a lot of summonses and who do numerous “ stop - and - frisks ” of people who match the descriptions of criminal suspects .
“ The chief wants to give the overtime to aggressive cops and not to do - nothings , ” one source said .
“ Do - nothing ” cops are considered those who never leave their patrol cars or ones who primarily work inside a precinct house .
Another source said Giannelli wants the OT to go to “ intelligently aggressive ” cops , such as ones who manage to avert civilian complaints by adequately explaining to people why they are being stopped and frisked .
In response to the new policy , some precincts already have compiled lists of their top - performing officers – when it comes to arrests – and forwarded the lists to the borough commanders .
Sources also said bosses have been told not to worry in the future about their officers ’ names appearing on lists of cops who have received large amounts of overtime .
In the past , such bosses have been told to cut down on those officers ’ overtime .
Giannelli ’s overtime order comes amid an ongoing decline in the kinds of crimes considered a top priority by the NYPD .
As of Aug. 5 , there had been 289 murders in New York City since the beginning of 2007 .
That is a 13.2 percent drop from last year , when there were 333 murders as of Aug. 5 , according to the NYPD .
Shooting incidents have declined slightly , by 1 percent , with 842 so far in 2007 compared to 853 last year .
The number of people shot in those cases dropped 3 percent , to 994 from 1,025 in 2006 .
Overall , reported crime is down 6.8 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 .

This shadowy something is what someone says is a photo of the Loch Ness monster in Scotland . *
Image : Associated Press * 565 : The Irish monk St. Columba is said to have made the first sighting of the Loch Ness " monster " on this day while helping establish Christianity in the wilds of Scotland .
The legends , folk tales , accurate observations or complete hoaxes – your choice – that have come down to us as " Nessie " have bedeviled zoologists and everyone else who has tried to establish the existence of this cryptid over the centuries .
Descriptions of Nessie have depended almost solely on visual sightings and film and photographic evidence , which is of dubious quality at best .
She ( if that 's what the monster is ) has been variously identified as a plesiosaur , an exceptionally large eel , a long - necked seal and even a swimming elephant .
While most photos , eyewitness sketches and some physical evidence seem to suggest the plesiosaur , paleontologists believe that the aquatic dinosaur was a cold - blooded reptile requiring much warmer water than is found in Loch Ness , where the average temperature is around 42 degrees Fahrenheit .
Serious searching for Nessie began in the mid-20th century , and a number of technologies – cameras , submersibles , sonar – have been employed since , all in vain .
The Loch Ness monster remains as elusive , and as integral to the Scottish tourist industry , as ever .

' UFO Hacker ' Tells What He Found
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The State Department ’s top investigator recused himself on Wednesday from probes into the Blackwater security firm after discovering -- during a break in a congressional hearing -- that his brother was connected with the company .
Howard Krongard , who began a hearing of Rep. Henry Waxman ’s government oversight committee by denying the “ ugly rumors ” that his brother “ Buzzy ” was linked to Blackwater , returned after a recess to say he had just contacted his brother and learned he had attended a Blackwater advisory board meeting .
“ I had not been aware of that .
And I want to state on the record right now that I hereby recuse myself from any matters having to do with Blackwater , ” Krongard , who acts as an independent internal investigator for the State Department , told the panel .
Waxman ’s committee is examining allegations by current and former officials in Krongard ’s office that he thwarted probes into waste , fraud and abuse in Iraq , including alleged arms smuggling by Blackwater , which protects U.S. diplomats and other State Department officials in Iraq .
In September , the private security contractor denied it was involved in illegally shipping automatic weapons and military goods to Iraq after a report that federal officials were investigating .
The North Carolina firm is also under scrutiny after several violent incidents involving its contractors , including the shooting of 17 Iraqi civilians in a September incident .
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that FBI agents found at least 14 of those shootings were unjustified .
Waxman , a California Democrat with a reputation for tenacity as an investigator , has charged Krongard with interfering in ongoing investigations to protect the State Department and White House from political embarrassment -- a charge Krongard flatly denied .
“ I have never impeded any investigation , ” Krongard said , adding he had never worked in government before now , had no political ties and never met President George W. Bush .
Republicans belittled Waxman ’s investigation , saying the only thing he might pin on Krongard was an abrasive management style .
But they admitted surprise at Krongard ’s revelation his brother was in fact linked to Blackwater , after he started the hearing denying it .
“ He has done you tremendous damage , ” said Rep. Christopher Shays , a Connecticut Republican .
Krongard seemed unfazed .
“ I ’m not my brother ’s keeper , and we do not discuss our business with each other , ” he said .
A.B. “ Buzzy ” Krongard is a former executive director of the CIA .
Howard Krongard is a former general counsel at Deloitte & Touche .
Krongard contacted his brother after Democratic lawmakers waved e-mails showing Blackwater had invited him to be on the company ’s advisory board and attend a meeting in Williamsburg , Virginia , this week .
Several current and former staffers from Krongard ’s office said he threatened investigators with retaliation if they cooperated with Waxman ’s probe .
Krongard is also accused of telling the staff not to cooperate with the Justice Department , and impeding investigations into alleged arms smuggling by Blackwater and construction problems with a massive new U.S. embassy in Baghdad .
Greg Burch said :
" I think people should have a right to be stupid and , if they have that right , the market 's going to respond by supplying as much stupidity as can be sold . "
Greg Burch was speaking about sport-utility vehicles , which he feels are very poorly designed .
Note that Burch was not advocating banning SUVs .
Burch did not even advocate regulating SUVs .
Burch thinks people should have a right to be stupid .
But Burch also openly acknowledges the real - world consequence of that right , which is that the market will respond by supplying as much stupidity as can be sold .
Perhaps Burch is strongly libertarian , and sees the case against regulation as a slam - dunk regardless of the consequences , and therefore has an easier time acknowledging the downside of his policy .
Or perhaps Burch is just a skillful rationalist .
Either way , I hereby canonize his observation as Burch 's Law .
Burch 's Law is a special case of a more general rule :
Just because your ethics require an action does n't mean the universe will exempt you from the consequences .
If the universe were fair , like a sympathetic human , the universe would understand that you had overriding ethical reasons for your action , and would exempt you from the usual penalties .
The judge would rule " justifiable homicide " instead of " murder " and exempt you from the usual prison term .
Well , the universe is n't fair and it wo n't exempt you from the consequences .
We know the equations of physics in enough detail to know that the equations do n't contain any quantities reflective of ethical considerations .
We do n't send automobile manufacturers to jail , even though manufactured cars kill an estimated 1.2 million people per year worldwide .
( Roughly 2 % of the annual planetary death rate . )
Not everyone who dies in an automobile accident is someone who decided to drive a car .
The tally of casualties includes pedestrians .
It includes minor children who had to be pushed screaming into the car on the way to school .
And yet we still manufacture automobiles , because , well , we 're in a hurry .
I do n't even disagree with this decision .
I drive a car myself .
The point is that the consequences do n't change no matter how good the ethical justification sounds .
The people who die in automobile accidents are still dead .
We can suspend the jail penalty , but we can't suspend the laws of physics .
Humanity has n't had much luck suspending the laws of economics , either .
If people have a right to be stupid , the market will respond by supplying all the stupidity that can be sold .

The first rule of Usenet is , you do n't talk about Usenet .
This rule kept Usenet providers and users out of sight from anti-piracy organizations for years , but this is about to change .
Usenet is catching up with BitTorrent in terms of popularity , partly because it is considered to be safer .
However , this increased popularity also has a dark side to it , as anti-piracy organizations start monitoring newsgroups .
Tim Kuik , managing director of BREIN – the Dutch branch of the MPAA – told the Dutch news site Webwereld that the increased attention from computer magazines over the past year lowered the nerd - factor of the Usenet .
Because of this it ’s now become one of the main targets of anti-piracy outfits .
Kuik further said that BREIN made a blacklist of Usenet providers who structurally infringe copyright .
Their plan is to urge these providers to stop their services and compensate the content owners for their losses .
Some might argue that Kuik ’s words are yet another loose threat to make it seem like no pirate is safe , but there is some truth in his statements .
TorrentFreak talked to an insider , who works closely with anti-piracy organizations like the MPAA and RIAA , and he also noticed that the Usenet has been getting more attention lately .
“ BitTorrent is still enemy number one , but there is a significant growth in Usenet monitoring ” , he said .
Some Usenet providers now use BitTorrent sites to advertise their services and according to our source , this is another big reason why it caught the attention of anti-piracy outfits .
The people in charge at most anti-piracy organizations hardly know how to write an e-mail , if it ’s not in the media , it ’s not a target .
If only people kept to rule number one this probably would have never happened .
The Usenet providers are not impressed by BREIN ’s strong words though .
Remco Habets from Usenet provider Usenet4u said in a response : “ BREIN often makes statement that lead to nothing .
One and a half year ago they also said that they were going to take on newsgroups , we ’ll see ”
To be continued …
But Mr. Cheney reserved his harshest language for Iran .
Calling it “ the world ’s most active state sponsor of terrorism , ” he said , “ our country , and the entire international community , cannot stand by as a terror - supporting state fulfills its most aggressive ambitions . ”
That language is not radically different from what Mr. Cheney has used in the past .
But people at the conference said that , placed in the context of Mr. Bush ’s remarks , it represented a significant step toward increasing pressure on Iran .
The speech seemed to lay the groundwork for the threat of military action — either because the administration actually intends to use force or because it wants to use the threat of force to prod Europe into action .
“ This week we heard a significant ratcheting up of the rhetoric , ” said Dennis Ross , who served as a Middle East envoy for President Clinton and the first President Bush and is now a scholar at the Washington Institute .
Repeating Mr. Cheney ’s remark about serious consequences , he said those were “ strong words ” with “ serious implications . ”
Mr. Bush has repeatedly said the administration would not “ tolerate ” a nuclear - armed Iran .
But during a news conference on Wednesday , the president went further , saying of Iran : “ If you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
That distinction — having the knowledge to make a nuclear weapon , as opposed to actually having a weapon — is one the administration has not made in the past .
David Makovsky , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute who moderated a panel discussion before and after Mr. Cheney ’s speech , said the vice president also seemed to draw a new red line when , instead of saying it is “ not acceptable ” for Iran to have a nuclear weapon , he said the world “ will not allow ” it .
From a friend of IfP in New Mexico :
NM Senate Resolution 5 for the impeachment of Bush and Cheney will be heard by the Senate Public Affairs committee BEFORE it will go to the Judiciary , I was told it will most likely be heard this Friday or Sunday .
There are 3 “ swing ” Democrats on this committee , the only two [ sic ]
Democrats on the committee that have not shown support for SJR5 yet , that need to be contacted and urged to support SJR5 :
Mary Kay Papen 505-986-4270
David Ulibarri 505-986-4310
Michael S. Sanchez 505-986-4727
We need all 5 Democrats on the committee to vote yes for it to pass , it is expected none of the Republicans will show up for the vote again , like they did in the Senate Rules Committee , which is fine , as long as all the Democrats vote yes again .
Every day , material is raining down on the Earth .
Fortunately , we ’ve got an atmosphere to protect us .
As the tiny particles impact the atmosphere , air piles up in front of them , heating up , and blazing a trail in the sky .
That ’s a meteor .
According to a team of Japanese researchers , as the micrometeoroids rain down , they carve out tiny tunnels just a few millimetres across .
Astronomers used to believe that meteors opened up gaps in the atmosphere less than a metre across , but they were n’t exactly sure how wide they really were .
But new observations from the powerful Subaru telescope located atop Mauna Kea , Hawaii have narrowed the size down to just a few millimetres .
Observing meteors with the Subaru telescope is actually very difficult .
It was designed to observe deep space astronomical objects , nothing as close as the Earth ’s atmosphere .
This means that the meteor trails look blurry .
Even observations of satellites look blurry .
Despite the blur , the researchers were able to get their data .
Over the course of a 19 - hour observation , 13 meteor tracks were observed .
Scientists then carefully analyzed the images , to see how many photons were released as the meteor passed through the atmosphere .
Based on the number of photons they detected , the researchers were able to calculate that the trails are just a few millimetres across .

There is a certain gentleness to most Web 2.0 coverage .
Even when startups sound flat - out dumb , we all root for the little guy .
Not Ted Dziuba .
He 's the blogger behind Uncov , and he brutally dismisses most companies with a single word : Fail .
Dziuba is the anti-Arrington .
Of the startup Stixy , an online bulletin board , he writes : " It 's virtually the same product as Wixi , with virtually the same name .
Do n't get me wrong , both products are steaming shit heaps ; it 's just harder to tell them apart now . "
Of LingoZ , a user - written dictionary , he says : " These guys take themselves waaay too seriously to have a term like alligator fuckhouse in their lexicon .
Now where 's the fun in that ? "
The thing is , as scathing as he is hilarious , Dziuba tends to be spot-on .
Strip away the bombast , and Dziuba is a guilty pleasure that 's actually worth reading .
Despite diagnosing Silicon Valley woes with the vinegar of a crotchety old man , Dziuba , it turns out , is only 23 .
After getting his math degree from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2006 , the Connecticut native spent a year at Google , He left to create his own startup , Persai ( rhymes with Versailles ) with college buddies and occasional Uncov bloggers Matt Kent and Kyle Shank .
Persai , Dziuba says , will launch its first product – a sort of intelligent newsreader – in beta before the end of the year .
With all the debate over Bubble 2.0 , we figured whom better to ask than a critic whose tagline is " What .
The. Fuck . "
Lord knows he is n't afraid to be honest .
So we sat down with Dziuba at San Francisco 's Caffe Centro , epicenter of Bubble 1.0 , to talk about where Silicon Valley is still getting it wrong .
Wired News :
In your opinion , where is Web 2.0 going wrong ?
TD : What I 'm seeing now with a lot of these Web 2.0 companies is that they 're not based on technology , but on a dog - and - pony show .
Under the surface , there 's nothing noteworthy going on .
The majority of them are just rolling the dice , and they know it .
These are the people who will go to parties just to suck up to Arrington and say , " Hey come look at my startup .
Please plug me . "
For these guys TechCrunch is going to make or break the company .
If you look at a company 's traffic graph on Alexa when it hits TechCrunch , there 's a huge spike that day and then a month later it 's down to almost nothing .
In this world it 's all about creating the buzz .
It does n't matter about revenues or profits .
It 's just about how many users you can get .
WN : How do you personally differentiate between what 's worthy and what is n’t ?
TD : You know you 're a bullshit company when your core technology is Ajax .
If the business is every widget under the sun conglomerated into this giant application , there 's no real technology there .
There 's no noteworthy computer - science problem being solved .
The Ajax stuff is pre-written .
You just have to go to the libraries and put it all together .
When Gmail came out – and Gmail is a pretty kick - ass product – it was like , " Ha !
Ajax for dynamic web apps !
We can use it for everything ! "
So now you have companies like Zoho , for example .
Their sole goal is to take every desktop app that ever existed and reimplement it in Ajax with no added features or functionality .
It irritates me as an engineer that companies with no engineering merit , first off , are getting funded and , second off , are getting bought out .
WN : Why are n't more Silicon Valley bloggers trashing startups ?
TD : I 'm guessing they do n't want to piss off advertisers .
Or it would illegitimize them as a blogger to say something remotely critical of someone .
The whole scene is like a little league game where everyone 's a winner and everyone gets a trophy at the end .
You 've got people like Michael Arrington and Robert Scoble who are the coaches of the team and handing out the trophies , and then Uncov is like the creepy guy in the trench coat sitting in the stands .
People accuse us of saying negative stuff to get traffic .
Honestly , I do n't give a shit about the traffic .
People could stop coming tomorrow .
Great !
I do n't have to satisfy you vultures anymore .
We do n't have ads , although we 're talking to a couple advertisers now because we have to cover our hosting costs .
But it 's by no means a profit center .
WN : Where do you stand on the whole " Bubble 2.0 " issue ?
Is the bottom going to fall out ?
__TD : __
It 's going to happen slowly over time .
It 's not going to be like the first dot - com crash where the sky was falling within a month , only because it 's all private - equity deals .
There have been very few IPOs .
Google did n't do the world any favors when it overpaid so much for YouTube .
That set off a surge in the expected value of a startup .
A lot of people think that if you put $ 10,000 into enough of these , eventually one will pay off .
But this whole thing is eventually going to cave in on itself .
All these companies will keep getting bought up , but the acquirers are not going to see great returns .
WN : We 've talked a lot about what you do n't like .
What types of companies do you like ?
TD : Things that have actual technology behind them .
Take Joost , for example .
That is a really cool program , because the company spent a lot of time working on the quality of the picture .
It looks really good .
It also has exclusive content from big - name providers like Comedy Central that 's actually worth watching .
It 's not a guy riding his bike into a tree on YouTube .
Going out and getting licensing deals for content is hard work , and I 'm pretty sure they 're going to be well - rewarded for it .
WN : What did you do during the year you were at Google ?
TD : I worked on internal apps .
I got bored pretty quickly there and left to do something interesting .
WN : That 's my cue .
Tell me about Persai .
TD : The three of us are doing a company based around machine learning and artificial intelligence on an unreasonably large scale .
We essentially want to automate the understanding of all the information in the world .
WN : ( Pause . )
What ?
TD : We want to build machine programs that can learn things from information that 's out there on the web .
In the first application we 'll come out with , you tell us things that you 're interested in , and we 'll continuously go out and find stuff on the internet that 's related to that .
There 's a positive feedback loop where you tell us what you like and do n't , so the machine gets progressively better in learning what you like .
WN : Is it going to be like , " I like unicorns ; give me news about unicorns " ?
That sounds like a search engine .
TD : Search engine implies somebody 's actively going out and looking for information .
We 're more passive than that .
It 's more like a newsreader .
It 's like you have some time to burn , so you go to Digg and see what the top headlines are .
In that same style , except you take the community part completely out and leave all of it up to a machine .
WN : That 's the opposite of what 's trendy right now .
TD : Exactly .
We 're hoping that the tenet of " automation is key " still holds .
WN : Valleywag has commented that your ad - free blog is something of a bait and switch – build up attention without monetizing it and then introduce your for - profit startup .
TD : We 're pretty good friends with the Valleywag people , so we bust each other 's balls all the time .
We all recognize that it 's just the internet .
At the end of the day you still go outside and nobody knows who you are .
Valleywag is like Uncov :
We both force people not to take themselves too seriously .
WN : Well , I hope you do n't fail .
TD : Yeah , I hope so , too .

What next for Yankees ?

Facebook NEW YORK  Joe Torre sat at the podium and considered question after question about his future .
For the third consecutive year , his New York Yankees lost in the Division Series , this time to the upstart Cleveland Indians 8 - 4 in Game 4 on Monday night at Yankee Stadium .
But this year 's disappointment is different .
George Steinbrenner , in a surprising return to his trademark bluster , told The Record of Hackensack , N.J. , on Saturday that Torre 's future as the Yankees manager was " on the line " in this series .
Well , the Torre Watch is officially on .
" Whatever the hell happens from here on out , I 'll look back on these 12 years with great , great pleasure , " Torre said .
The future Hall of Famer appeared choked up during his postgame press conference , but it was unclear if it was because of another lost season or because Torre senses the end has arrived .
" This is all speculation , " shortstop Derek Jeter said .
" There will be changes , but right now I 'm not even thinking about next year . "
But it is time to think about next year .
A major retooling of this sputtering $ 200 million model must take place during the offseason .
No longer can the Yankees merely tweak the team .
Difficult decisions must be made , and by the time spring training begins in February in Tampa many familiar faces will be gone .
Third baseman Alex Rodriguez will likely opt out of his contract .
Closer Mariano Rivera and catcher Jorge Posada will be free agents with the mileage piling up at ages 36 and 38 , respectively , next opening day .
Left - hander Andy Pettitte holds a $ 16 million option , and the Yankees have a $ 16 million option for outfielder Bobby Abreu .
Roger Clemens is 45 and may have thrown the last pitch in his amazing career on Sunday .
But Torre 's status will set the tone .
' George is the boss '
Torre , the highest - paid manager in the history of baseball at $ 7 million this year , hung by a thread last October after the Detroit Tigers eliminated the Yankees but after twisting in the wind for a few days was brought back .
He was then told by the Boss , in so many words , he had to win this year .
" George is the boss and has been great to work for all these years , " Torre said Sunday .
" He 's certainly given me the players ; he 's not shy about spending money .
You 've seen managers who 've been here before me .
I do n't think any of them have been on easy street .
Whether I think it 's right , wrong , fair or foul is not the point .
I 'll save all that stuff for later on when there 's really nothing left for me to do here and deal with it . "
Torre has never done a better job than this year .
On May 29 in Toronto the Yankees were 21 - 29 after Aaron Hill stole home to beat Pettitte .
Torre refused to let them pack it in .
Instead , with general manager Brian Cashman filling in some key pitching spots from the minor leagues , they were able to push the Boston Red Sox , who at one stage were running away with the East Division title .
The Yankees , at 94 - 68 , ended with the third - best record in the majors .
Only Boston and Cleveland , both 96 - 66 , were better .
But when you wear Yankee pinstripes nothing counts but October .
Torre has taken the Yankees to the postseason every year since he became manager in 1996 , won four of six World Series beginning in 1996 , but the rub is they have n't won since 2000 and have n't been there since 2003 .
Before Sunday 's game Torre said , " We certainly need to find out what we 're made of . "
The answer is obvious .
This team , as it's presently constructed , is not good enough to play the kind of October baseball Steinbrenner and Yankees fans demand .
Time for Torre to walk away
As the trading deadline neared in July , Cashman resisted the temptation for quick fixes , standing firm and refusing to trade away some of the team 's best minor leaguers .
Had it not been for the likes of young reliever Joba Chamberlain , starter Phil Hughes and others , the Yankees might not have righted themselves .
Now , the Yankees need to undergo their biggest reconstruction since Torre 's reign began .
But as great as Torre has been , he should walk away and decline to be a part of this next wave .
He deserves to be out from under the constant scrutiny and pressure .
And a retooling of the team could be unpleasant as we witnessed earlier this season when some of the youngsters were forced to take over .
Torre talked about Hughes and Chamberlain on Monday night as though he wo n't be a part of their future .
He said he was going to go home and decompress .
Here 's hoping he and the Yankees recognize what needs to be done .

Campaign coverage of the 2008 presidential election has been both biased and shallow , according to a study released today by the Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University ’s Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy .
One party dominates , and there ’s way too much partisan fluff .
Numbers reveal all : Democratic candidates were the subject of half of the 1,742 recent print , broadcast and online news stories analyzed in the research .
Republicans garnered 31 percent .
“ Overall , Democrats received more positive coverage than Republicans ( 35 percent of stories versus 26 percent ) , while Republicans received more negative coverage than Democrats ( 35 percent versus 26 percent ) , ” the study said .
The public pines for substance .
A separate survey found that 77 percent of the respondents said they wanted more solid information on candidate policies and ideas .
The press did not deliver .
Instead , almost two - thirds of the coverage focused on the “ game ” of the political horse race and candidate “ performance . ”
Accounts of their marriages , health and religion followed in importance in 17 percent of the stories — with just 15 percent examining domestic and foreign policies .
A mere 1 percent shed light on candidates ’ public records .
“ The press and the public are not on the same page when it comes to priorities in campaign coverage , ” the study said .
“ This disparity indicates there is room for the press to calibrate its coverage differently to make it more useful and possibly more interesting to citizens . ”
Indeed .
More than half the public wants more insight into candidate debates , sources of campaign money and the lesser - known White House hopefuls .
Of 18 candidates running , 52 percent of the coverage went to just five of them : Democratic Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois fixated press interest , garnering 17 percent and 14 percent of the total coverage , respectively .
Three Republicans followed : Rudolph W. Giuliani with 9 percent , Sen. John McCain of Arizona ( 7 percent ) and Mitt Romney ( 5 percent ) .
Contenders , such as Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee , were featured in only a dozen stories ; Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich , Ohio Democrat , scored just one .
Even John Edward ’s wife , Elizabeth , got more coverage than 10 of the candidates , the study found .
Mr. Obama was the media darling : 47 percent of the stories about him were positive , compared with 27 percent for Mrs. Clinton .
Mr. McCain got the most press abuse .
Just 12 percent of the stories about him were positive in tone .
The public , meanwhile , has only tepid reviews for it all , with a majority — 53 percent — rating the news coverage only fair to poor .
The fault could lie in journalism ’s focus on insider politics .
“ Just 12 percent of stories impact ordinary citizens , ” the study said .
“ By contrast , 86 percent of the stories were produced in a way that largely focused on how the politician ’s chances of election would be affected . ”
The stories were analyzed between January and May ; the survey of 1,000 adults was conducted Sept. 28 to Oct. 1 , with a margin of error of three percentage points .

Experts from Jim Henson 's Muppet Show are touring post - war Afghanistan to teach children about landmines .
Twenty years of conflict has left a deadly legacy , with children the most common victims .
Mike Donkin reports from Kabul .
Analyses conducted by researchers from Université Laval 's Center for Northern Studies reveal that the continent 's northernmost lake is affected by climate change .
In an article to be published in the September 28 edition of Geophysical Research Letters , the international research team led by Université Laval scientists Warwick Vincent and Reinhard Pienitz reports that aquatic life in Ward Hunt Lake , a body of water located on a small island north of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic , has undergone major transformations within the last two centuries .
The speed and range of these transformations -- unprecedented in the lake 's last 8,000 years -- suggest that climate change related to human activity could be at the source of this phenomenon .
The researchers ' conclusions are based on the analysis of a sediment core extracted in the center of Ward Hunt Lake in August 2003 .
This 18 centimeter long sediment core containing algae pigments and diatom remnants was used by the researchers as a biological archive in order to determine the diversity and abundance of aquatic life - forms in the lake over the last 8,450 years .
Analysis of the deepest layers of sediment revealed a very small number of algae as well as only minor variations in concentration .
However , the top two centimeters of the core , which correspond to the last 200 years , showed abrupt changes in the lake 's algae population : during that period , chlorophyll a concentration , a pigment found in every species in the lake , increased by a factor of 500 .
A type of diatom typical of very cold environments also made its first appearance during the same period .
" The absence of diatoms and the low pigment concentration below the top 2.5 centimeters of the core suggest that the lake was permanently frozen in the past , " explains lead author and Center for Northern Studies researcher Dermot Antoniades .
Located on the 83rd parallel in the Quttinirpaaq ( meaning " top of the world " in Inuktitut ) National Park , Ward Hunt Island is completely surrounded by ice .
The lake itself is permanently covered by a 4 - meter layer of ice , except for a small peripheral zone that thaws out during a few weeks every summer .
" This is of course an extreme environment for living organisms , but our data indicate that current conditions make the lake a more favorable location for algae growth than it was in the past , " points out Antoniades .
" We cannot claim with certainty that these changes were brought on by human activity , but natural variations observed over the last millennia were never so abrupt and extensive , " concludes the researcher .
In addition to Antoniades , Vincent , and Pienitz , the article is co-authored by Catherine Crawley from the University of Toronto , Marianne Douglas from the University of Alberta , Dale Andersen from the Center for the Study of Life in the Universe ( USA ) , Peter Doran at the University of Illinois in Chicago ( USA ) , Ian Hawes from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research ( New Zealand ) , and Wayne Pollard from McGill University .
This study was conducted as part of the ArcticNet program , which brings together scientists and managers in the natural , human health and social sciences with their partners in Inuit organizations , northern communities , federal and provincial agencies and the private sector to study the impacts of climate change in the coastal Canadian Arctic .
Our entitlements are catching up to us :
Sen . Judd Gregg released ( pdf ) a Congressional Budget Office study ( pdf ) yesterday that attempts to quantify the tax rates needed to pay for the spending increases projected in Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security .
Average taxpayers would typically pay marginal federal income tax rates in the 30s , much higher than the 15 % seen today .
And that ’s before payroll taxes of 15.3 % and state and local income taxes that would boost many into tax rate brackets of over 50 % .
CBO also notes that “ the highest bracket would have to be raised from 35 percent to 92 percent .
The top corporate income tax rate would also increase from 35 percent to 92 percent . ”
If this is something that worries you then it might be worthwhile taking a look here for help on your income tax and if there is anything that can be done .
Sometimes just getting that little bit of extra guidance can make all the difference .
The agency concludes “ Such tax rates would significantly reduce economic activity and would create serious problems with tax avoidance and tax evasion .
Revenues could fall significantly short of the amount needed to finance the growth of spending , and thus tax rates at this level may not be economically feasible . ”
Thanks to raganwald and his syndicated deliciousness , I found Sunday ’s Fake Steve Jobs post about the problems at One Laptop per Child .
I ’m a big fan of satire , and especially web - delivered timely articulate satire .
But I was a bit confused by this one , and quite dismayed by the vitriol of the comments .
Why are y’all player hating on Nick Negroponte ?
Confusing vectors of irony
So , a confession .
I do n’t quite get Fake Steve Jobs .
I mean , I guess he ’s supposed to be a way to a ) make fun of Steve Jobs , b ) make fun of the rest of the industry in the voice of said lampooned Steve Jobs , and c ) allow the true author to voice some of his own opinions under this cover .
But when the lampooned Jobs lampoons another industry figure … we have the problem of the unreliable narrator .
Is the rant the true author ’s opinion , or is he imagining how the real Jobs would react ?
If it ’s not the true author ’s opinion , are we supposed to see Fake Steve ’s rant as credible , or as proof that Fake Steve is an idiot ?
Or has Fake Steve become a force in his own right , and the actual author has lost control over the vectors of irony ?
Anyway , with an unreliable narrator you , the reader , have to come to your own conclusion , and mine in this case is that Fake Steve Jobs is full of crap .
Fake Steve ’s rant begins — in my opinion reasonably — by pointing out that the technical and political challenges of the OCPL projects are so significant that delays and snags should be expected .
He writes , “ I mean , a brand new hardware design , a new screen technology , a customized Linux operating system , a one - off user interface , and the customers are the poorest nations in the world …. ”
Quite true .
In fact , this would seem to be a good argument to cut OLPC some slack .
The challenges they ’ve undertaken are significantly greater than those involved in creating an expensive cell phone without buttons .
But sympathy is not Fake Steve ’s aim .
Instead , he intends to use the size of the undertaking to prove that Negroponte is an idiot .
( His being a professor and occasionally appearing on television are also reasons he ’s an idiot . )
What could academics possibly hope to accomplish , he ’s arguing .
Only business people have a hope to make big advances in technology .
( BTW , I do n’t use the word “ innovation ” , which is just watered - down BS that has taken the place of stronger words — and things — like ingenuity , genius , and — remember this one ? — invention .
The word “ innovation ” always makes me think of Microsoft . )
So here ’s the problem in Fake Steve ’s argument .
When have the MBAs ever changed the world ?
Did the bold suits at Xerox save the day by ignoring all that crap those woolly - headed academics invented in Palo Alto ?
No , not exactly .
And did IBM crush Apple in the personal computer market ?
No , again .
Jeff Bezos had real business experience , yes , but Netscape , Yahoo , and Google — were n’t they all started and built up by grad students ?
Fake Steve ’s rant sounds like sour grapes .
And his happiness at OLPC ’s problems can only be described as schadenfreude .
So , just jealousy ?
Of what , exactly ?
The second half of the rant criticizes the media for paying so much positive attention to OLPC and Nick Negroponte .
Ah ha .
So , are supposed to agree with Fake Steve , or are we supposed to see through it ?
Or some measure of both ?
I do n’t know , but an awful lot of the readers who ’ve posted comments on Fake Steve ’s blog seem to have reached the same conclusion , and they are lining up to ditto him .
And this is where the post gets a bit troubling .
More evidence that Dave Winer was right about blog post comments
Nick Negroponte can take care of himself .
As one poster felicitously wrote , “ You keep harping on this guy and he ’s gonna focus on you with those big lenses of his and take you out … or at least give you a severe sunburn . ”
But I wish they ’d lay off the kids .
Calling them “ the poor bastards in Africa and the Middle East who have n’t been blessed with the ability to look up passages of their favorite religious text online ( did somebody say pron ? ) ” is not only a little mean , it ’s also fabulously ignorant in my favorite way — ignorance that shows the writer does n’t realize he ’s actually completely wrong .
Religion and porn — why do you think Western Europe became literate in the first place ?
The first mass - printed book ?
The Bible .
And the people who were reading it were n’t sitting at home by the bed at night feeling good about being saved .
They were getting fired up to go fight the Thirty Years War .
As for porn , care to take a guess about how dissent was packaged in pre-revolutionary France ?
And what did the French Revolution get us ?
Oh , just republican government , the spread of the Enlightenment , and the modern western world as we know it .
It was bloody , yes , like the rest of history .
But here ’s my point .
Even if the laptops are used to find and share religious ideas and pornography ( the laptops will ship with anti-porn filtering , but you know the kids will figure out how to get around that ) , the spread of those things is actually probably of vital importance to shaping the future of our world .
And as for the notion expressed by some commenters that kids could never figure this thing out , and would never be able to figure out how to code software … um ?
What world do you live in ?
The one where young people are the last to figure out a new technology ?
The one in which grandpa has to show little Bobby how to program the VCR ?
The one in which only grownups are texting each other on their cell phones and building Facebook apps ?
Children love computers , in no small part because they love learning .
A commenter to Fake Steve ’s blog suggests there is no pedagogical support for the project : “ I ’ve never seen any evidence that the pedagogical outcomes of this project have been given careful consideration .
You might forgive academics for not understanding business fundamentals , but it ’s not so easy to excuse them for overlooking educational ones . ”
I guess it is supposed to be easy to excuse the poster for missing that one of the leaders of the OLPC project is Seymour Papert , who has devoted his life to a theory of pedagogy , Constructionism , that is based on the work of Piaget and Dewey .
Of course , Papert is another PhD , and he ’s connected to ( gasp ) MIT , so I guess his ideas would n’t win over many blog commenters .
A shocking admission
OK , so I ’m biased .
I like OLPC .
A lot .
It may not happen for years , and it may not be as big as its boosters claim it will be .
But it may still change everything .
Really .
Can you predict what those millions of kids will do with networked open - source laptops ?
People once thought personal computers would be used for keeping cooking recipes organized .
A privileged sliver of the world showed they can do orders of magnitude more .
What happens if an order of magnitude more people get their hands on programmable computing power ?
As for the financial difficulties … one of the corporate backers of the project is Google , and you never know when the big G is going to drop a bomb of money on some long - term , loss - leader opportunity .
If things get really bad , they might just drop that money bomb on OLPC .
That ’s almost too boring to write about .
Here ’s something more interesting .
Crouching Laptop , Hidden Smalltalk
I ’m sometimes given to flights of near - utopian “ what if ” imaginative fancy , along the lines of “ what if the people who wrote The Wire produced a series set in Iraq , right now ? ”
Or “ what if so - called tapas restaurants started serving authentic Spanish tapas at the bar , for free ? ”
I am also a computer language enthusiast , and with the OLPC laptop , I sense just a whiff of a wild possibility .
Never mind the inclusion on the laptop of Forth , Python , and Logo , which is based on Lisp , the once and future uberlanguage .
Go over to the wikipedia page for OLPC .
Check out the photo under “ History ” .
Who ’s sitting there with Negroponte ?
Why , it ’s our old friend Alan Kay .
And read down the page .
What ’s included on the laptop , along with other programming languages ?
The “ eToys version of squeak . ”
Pop over to Kay ’s wikipedia page , and you learn that he has been influenced by Papert and Constructionism for decades , and that he himself is focusing on the laptop ’s squeak applications .
Tired of the primacy of C and Java ?
How about unleashing a few million young Smalltalk programmers on the world ?
Sept. 10 , 2007  --
An area of Arctic sea ice the size of Florida has melted away in just the last six days as melting at the top of the planet continues at a record rate .
2007 has already broken the record for the lowest amount of sea ice ever recorded , say scientists , smashing the old record set in 2005 .
Currently , there are about 1.63 million square miles of Arctic ice , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo .
That is well below the record of 2.05 million square miles set two summers ago and could drop even lower before the final numbers are in .
North Pole 's Ice Disappears
From September 3 to September 9 , researchers say 69,000 square miles of Arctic ice disappeared , roughly the size of the Sunshine State .
Scientists say the rate of melting in 2007 has been unprecedented , and veteran ice researchers worry the Arctic is on track to be completely ice - free much earlier than previous research and climate models have suggested .
" If you had asked me a few years ago about how fast the Arctic would be ice free in summer , I would have said somewhere between about 2070 and the turn of the century , " said scientist Mark Serreze , polar ice expert at the NSIDC .
" My view has changed .
I think that an ice - free Arctic as early as 2030 is not unreasonable . "
Sea ice melt will likely reach the absolute minimum in the next few days as temperatures at the North Pole cool and refreezing begins .
Worldwide Climate Implications
Melting sea ice , unlike land - based glaciers like the ones in Greenland and elsewhere , does not raise sea level .
But it does play a major role in regulating the planet 's climate by affecting air and ocean currents .
" It will shift some of the weather patterns in ways that we are just beginning to understand , " said Robert Correll , a scientist who chairs the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment and is also the climate change director at the Heinz Center for Science , Economics and the Environment in Washington , D.C .
Correll said that white sea ice also acts as a mirror at the top of the planet , reflecting much of the sun 's energy back into space .
As it melts , it reveals darker water that absorbs more energy from the sun -- further warming the ocean in a process scientists call a " feedback . "
" If there is no ice , the ocean is going to continue to heat , and that is going to accelerate the global warming process , " said Correll .
In coastal villages throughout the Arctic , less sea ice also means less protection from wind and waves that erode the shoreline .
It also means less habitat for animals like polar bears and other marine animals .
Last week , the United States Geological Survey issued a report that found if the ice continued to decline at the current rate , two - thirds of the world 's polar bear population will disappear by 2050 .
" Our results do give me some concern , " said Steve Armstrup , a Polar Bear Project Leader with the USGS .
" In Northern Alaska , where I 've been working for these years , there may not be polar bears .
So as Polar bears go , that probably reflects to a great extent a lot of things that are happening to other organisms in the Arctic system . "
Northwest Passage Opening
The melting ice continues to open up the fabled Northwest Passage , long - sought by explorers and shipping companies as a short cut between Europe and East Asia .
Historically , that debate has been largely theoretical because the passage has been frozen and impassable .
But in August , satellite images showed the passage has now become more navigable than ever , fueling a hot debate between the United States and Canada over who should control it .
At a summit last month in Montebello , Canada , the leaders of the two nations expressed their disagreement .
" Canada 's position is that we intend to strengthen our sovereignty in the Arctic area , not only military , but economic , social , environmental and others , " said Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
" We believe it's an international passageway , " President Bush countered a moment later .
The latest satellite image shows a clear , wide path running through the Arctic that has major implications for global commerce .
For example , ships that must currently go around South America 's Cape Horn because they are too big to traverse the Panama Canal could save about 10,000 miles out of their shipping route .
The passage also saves about 5,000 miles when shipping between Europe and Asia .
Canada , the United States and Denmark are also competing for resources as melting Arctic ice reveals potential deposits of oil and gas .
A mini-submarine placed a Russian flag at the North Pole last month in a symbolic claim to that country 's share of Arctic resources .
Environmental groups worry that increased traffic through the Arctic could put the natural resources in jeopardy if there is an oil spill or other disaster in the remote region .

THE STUDY
“ Inhibition of p21 - Activated Kinase Rescues Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome in Mice . ” By Mansuo L. Hayashi et al. , published in the July 3 , 2007 , issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
THE MOTIVE
If a gene mutation hinders brain development , the resulting mental retardation is usually considered irreversible .
Symptoms can be treated , but the broken wiring can not be fixed .
Or can it ?
A startling new study of fragile X syndrome — the most common cause of inherited mental retardation as well as a leading genetic cause of autism — indicates that not only can malformed nerves be repaired but that behavior can be restored to normal , or nearly so .
The research was done with two strains of mutant mice , but the neuroscientists involved say the results point to a target for drugs that could potentially repair analogous damage in humans .
THE METHODS Nobel Prize winner Susumu Tonegawa and postdoc Mansuo Hayashi did not set out to fix fragile X .
As researchers at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT , they were simply interested in learning how mice acquire memories .
But then Hayashi created a mouse with a mutation in a gene called PAK , which codes for an enzyme called p21 - activated kinase that helps build nerve connections in the brain .
When Hayashi injected a mutant gene for PAK into mouse embryos and later killed the adult mice and dissected and examined their brains , she discovered that the animals ’ dendritic spines — branched stalks that receive input from neighboring neurons — were short , fat , and sparse .
When she attached two electrodes to the neurons — one to stimulate the nerve , the other to record the response — she discovered that the neurons ’ firing rate was abnormally high .
These traits are diametrically opposite to the traits that show up in fragile X , a condition in which a mutation silences the gene called FMR1 , or fragile X mental retardation 1 .
Both mice and humans with a silenced FMR1 gene have malformed neurons :
Spines on their dendrites are longer , thinner , and more numerous than normal , and they also transmit weaker electric signals .
Behavior is also affected .
Up to 33 percent of people with fragile X are autistic , most are mentally retarded , and they may be overanxious , hyperactive , or engage in repetitive behaviors like hand flapping .
Mice with the same mutation are also hyperactive and have repetitive habits , like rearing upright on their hind legs over and over .
The researchers wondered what would happen if the two strains of mice were bred .
Would the two mutations counterbalance one another ?
To their great surprise , that is exactly what happened .
The shape and number of dendritic spines turned out to be normal , as was the transmission of nerve signals .
So was the animals ’ behavior .
“ Just by making two bad mouse mutants together , you make almost like a normal mouse , ” Tonegawa says .
THE MEANING
Using a drug to replicate the mutation - induced change in the PAK enzyme could potentially treat fragile X in humans .
“ Now we know the very unique target for producing a drug which may help to ameliorate the fragile X syndrome — a chemical compound which will inhibit PAK activity , ” Tonegawa says .
“ But I want to emphasize that at this point we do n’t have this drug . ”
But the overall implications are even more profound , says New York University neuroscientist Eric Klann , because the researchers engineered the altered PAK gene to become active about three weeks after the mice were born .
This hints that the course of fragile X in humans could be reversed after birth .
“ The thing that ’s impressive is that morphological changes in the neurons that many labs have seen , both in fragile X patients as well as in mice that model fragile X , were reversed by changing the expression of this PAK gene .
That ’s very exciting . ”
One of the neater things about Mowser is that the content adaption process leaves all Class and ID names intact , and passes through any handheld stylesheets that may be on a publisher 's server .
This allows publishers a level of control over the look and feel of their adapted pages since they can still modify the style of those Classes / IDs .
The problem , of course , is that not many sites bother with handheld stylesheets , so this is only a benefit in a sort of academic way .
I was just looking to add in a handheld stylesheet and header into the Mowser WordPress plugin I just posted about , and happened to run across a post about Opera Mini 4 published over at Unintentionally Blank about this very topic , published * just today * .
Wow ...
In the post , Phil points out that Opera Mini 4 has gotten rid of defaulting to the handheld stylesheet , unless you 've explicitly chosen to turn on Small Screen Rendering ( " Mobile view " ) in the settings .
Interesting !
Opera has been one of the leading promoters of Handheld styleseheets , and their Opera Community site is still the best example of how to use it on the web today .
By choosing to default to non-handheld views , I have to agree with Phil that Opera seems to have given up the fight on this particular battle , and is instead banking on more sites using CSS3 instead .
Like the iPhone 's mobile Safari browser , Opera Mini supports CSS3 media queries which lets you modify the style based on " media features " , which include among other attributes , height , width and color .
In other words , instead of requiring that the device know that it's a handheld ( or in Internet Explorer 's case , that it 's * not* a handheld ) in a boolean yes / no manner , CSS3 allows the publishers to design based on a device 's specific capabilities .
I have to say , this is a much better way to specify formatting - I 'm just amazed at how quickly it 's being adopted ( though there are others who called it back in July ) ...
Opera Mini is the most popular mobile application on the planet , so it 's non trivial that it 's going to be ignoring handheld stylesheets by default .
And since handheld stylesheet support is sketchy at best in phones already , I have to think this is the end of the line .
Soo !
It looks like I have some work ahead of me .
I 've been meaning to add in specific CSS processing to Mowser - for example , cutting out anything marked display : none at the server , cutting down on transfer time to the handsets - but this gives me even more reason to .
Mowser is essentially a standard browser on the server , which lets publishers know their content is being seen by any handset with the same sort of quality as someone with an iPhone or using Opera Mini , so if these guys are supporting these things , I better get to it myself !

In a recent office action , the USPTO has rejected the claims of the Amazon.com one - click patent following the re-examination request that I filed on 16 February 2006 .
My review resulted in the broadest claims of the patent being ruled invalid .
In its Office Action released 9 October 2007 , the Patent Office found that the prior art I found and submitted completely anticipated the broadest claims of the patent , U.S. Patent No. 5,960,411.
I had only requested the USPTO look at claims 11 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 21 and 22 but the Office Action rejects claims 11 - 26 and claims 1 - 5 as well !
Amazon has the opportunity to respond to the Patent Office 's rejection , but third party requests for reexamination , like the one I filed , result in having the subject patent either modified or completely revoked about 2/3 of the time .
To read the original document , go to USPTO PAIR access site , choose the " Control Number " radio button , enter 90/007,946 and press the " Submit " button .
Huge thanks to everyone who helped out with the re-examination fee .
You know who you are .
BTW we won the movie - making competition below too :-)
Update : Some people are sending me money - however I do n't have any expenses right now so thank you very much but I can't accept it .
If you want me to do some work for you though ...
From Git SCM
Wiki
Git for Windows
There is a proper Git for Windows , based on a minimal MSys distribution ( since Git requires a shell which is not available on Windows by default ) .
See the msysGit project page for details and download .
Cygwin
Installation
Git is now a cygwin binary package , directly installable without needing to compile it .
See CygwinBinaryInstall .
Otherwise , to be able to build git directly from source , you will need to install cygwin and the following packages :
tcltk ( for gitk and git - gui )
perl
openssh
openssl ( and - dev )
libiconv
zip ( and - dev )
curl ( and - dev ) , optional if compiled with NO_CURL=1
expat ( and - dev ) , optional if compiled with NO_CURL=1
make
gcc
binutils ( sorta necessary to compile ! )
patchutils ( at least for the t4109 - apply - multifrag.sh tests )
cpio ( at least for the t5400 - send - pack.sh tests )
xmlto to build the man pages
util - linux : just to have getopt ( required by xmlto )
asciidoc to build documents ( http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/INSTALL.html)
python to build documents
subversion - perl ( if you want to use git-svn )
With these packages installed download the git source package from the git homepage and then unpack it with :
tar xvzf git-x.y.z.tar.gz ( or tar xvjf git-x.y.z.tar.bz2 )
Then , build git and install it in your ~ / bin directory by doing :
make install
If want to be extra careful , you can always run the regression tests :
make test
You are now ready to use GIT .
Check that your path includes ~ / bin and you are off !
Extra notes
Use git on local NTFS disks --
Network drives disks do n't support the filesystem semantics GIT needs ; for interoperability purposes you can store bare repositories on FAT32 disks .
Be careful with the case in filenames .
Similarly , avoid special chars in filenames .
Run git gc early and often .
There are slowdowns with many unpacked objects .
Be careful to not create very big packfiles ( bigger than 2 Gb ) .
Avoid using Active State Perl if possible .
Ask in the MailingLists if you must .
State Perl if possible .
Ask in the MailingLists if you must .
Try to avoid interrupting ( Ctrl - C ) processes - it breaks cygwin .
Consider setting core.fileMode to false ( git repo-config core.fileMode false ) if file modes are frequently the only differences detected by Git.
Many Windows applications make the execute bit be set in Cygwin when they save a file .
Besides Cygwin detects file mode by stupid combination of content analysis , file name extension and moon phase .
Insert " set CYGWIN=binmode " after the first line of C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat , so you can use Ctrl-z in cygwin's bash to suspend a program .
Make sure not to put ' tty ' into your CYGWIN environment variable , this breaks gitk / git - gui .
Windows usually writes end - of - line as CRLF , while Unix / POSIX writes LF .
This can cause a variety of problems .
There are current efforts to address this .
Setup binary mode for cygwin ( there is an option in cygwin 's setup program ) , otherwise Cygwin mangles everything read and written ( Git repos have binary files in control structures ) .
Avoid big repos .
Avoid big blobs ( very big files .
Basically anything larger than 10 Mb is too big ) .
Avoid big trees ( directories with many files in them ) .
Avoid deep hierarchies .
Reboot regularly ( memory fragmentation )
Defragment often ( filesystems fragmentation )

Bomb Iran ?
U.S. Requests Bunker - Buster Bombs White House bomber request has some wondering if U.S. preparing to attack Iran .
Oct. 24 , 2007  --
Tucked inside the White House 's $ 196 billion emergency funding request for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is an item that has some people wondering whether the administration is preparing for military action against Iran .
The item : $ 88 million to modify B - 2 stealth bombers so they can carry a newly developed 30,000 - pound bomb called the massive ordnance penetrator , or , in military - speak , the MOP .
The MOP is the the military 's largest conventional bomb , a super " bunker - buster " capable of destroying hardened targets deep underground .
The one - line explanation for the request said it is in response to " an urgent operational need from theater commanders . "
What urgent need ?
The Pentagon referred questions on this to Central Command .
ABC News called CENTCOM to ask what the " urgent operational need " is .
CENTCOM spokesman Maj .
Todd
White said he would look into it , but , so far , no answer .
There does n't appear to be any potential targets for a bomb like that in Iraq .
It could potentially be used on Taliban or al Qaeda hideouts in the caves along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan , but there would be no need to use a stealth bomber there .
So where would the military use a stealth bomber armed with a 30,000 - pound bomb like this ?
Defense analysts say the most likely target for this bomb would be Iran 's flagship nuclear facility in Natanz , which is both heavily fortified and deeply buried .
" You 'd use it on Natanz , " said John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org .
" And you 'd use it on a stealth bomber because you want it to be a surprise .
And you put in an emergency funding request because you want to bomb quickly . "
" It 's kind of strange , " Pike said .
" It sends a signal that you are preparing to bomb Iran , and if you were actually going to bomb Iran I would n't think you would want to announce it like that . "
The MOP is a massive bomb -- 20 feet long and encased in 3.5 inch thick high - performance steel .
It is designed to penetrate up to 200 feet underground before exploding .
The bomb was developed by Northrop Grumman and Boeing for the Pentagon 's Defense Threat Reduction Agency .
In an interview earlier this year with Air Force Times , Bob Hastie , the manager of the MOP program explained its purpose : " We have a mission to defeat ... hard and deeply buried targets where our adversary would have the support structure for WMD - type systems . "
Ko se na splet odpravi Zares
Spletne strani slovenskih politični strank sodijo med manj koristne in zanimive destinacije , ki jih lahko izberete med vsakodnevnim brskanjem .
Kategorija : Kolumna | Datum objave : Wednesday , 19 . 09 . 2007 | Avtor : Jure Mesarič
Medijsko že davno premleta sporočila za javnost , ocvetličeni programi in manifesti , duhamorne predstavitve strankarskih veljakov , višek interaktivnosti so običajno forumi z gostilniškimi debatami .
Tistimi po deseti rundi .
V pogledu navadnega državljana tako vegetirajo na stopnji zdaj že legendarnih spletnih strani raznih d.o.o.- jev in s-p.jev iz prvega vala navdušenja nad internetom , ko je bilo potrebno iti na internet , ker so pač že “ vsi tam ” , ker se je to spodobilo kot Armanijeva obleka , mobitel in audi pred garažo .
In je nekdo sklepal tisto spletno stran , ki ni bila nič drugega kot vizitka 2.0 , v samem poslovanju pa se ni spremenilo nič .
Tudi slovenske politične stranke se z internetom ne dajo dosti motiti .
Če bi ga kdo jutri izklopil , se pri njihovem delovanju in komunikaciji z državljani ne bi spremenilo nič .
Vključitev interneta kot bistvenega dela “ poslovanja ” slovenske politične stranke torej še čaka .
In potem pride društvo Zares ( www.zares.si).
Niso še pri stranki , so pa kljub temu ( ali ravno zaradi tega ? ) po mojem skromnem mnenju v tej državi doslej prikazali največjo mero razumevanja potenciala interneta .
Seveda tudi tukaj ne gre brez obvezne opreme vsake spletne strani politične organizacije – statuta , ustanovne izjave in podobnega , bistvo se skriva drugje – v interaktivnosti , v komunikaciji politiki – državljani , ki je , enkrat za spremembo , tudi dvosmerna .
Imajo bloge , ki jih pišejo nekateri vidnejši člani .
Napisano precej očitno ni proizvod piarovskega oddelka , avtorji pa celo odgovarjajo na komentarje obiskovalcev .
Nič posebnega a za slovenske razmere je to čisti presežek .
Blogi so vpisani v vse omembe vredne slovenske agregatorje .
Spremljajo druge slovenske bloge ( pa tudi ostale spletne medije ) in objavljajo povezave na zanimive prispevke .
Imajo “ Spodnji dom ” , namenjen časovno omejenim razpravam o različnih aktualnih temah in opremljen s koristnimi povezavami .
Da je internet lahko zelo učinkovito ( tudi stroškovno , predvidevam ) orodje politične aktivacije državljanov , so dokazali s peticijo za brezplačno prostovoljno cepljenje proti HPV , ki jo je preko spleta podpisalo skoraj 46.000 ljudi .
Nič revolucionarnega , nobenega odkrivanja neznanega , nobenega premikanja tehnoloških meja , toda razlika je očitna .
Seveda je še vedno prostor za izboljšave in upanje , da jih ne bo minilo , toda že v današnji obliki napovedujejo smer , v katero se bodo morale slej kot prej usmeriti tudi druge politične organizacije , če bodo hotele ujeti korak z državljani , ki bodo vse bolj ugašali televizijske in prižigali računalniške zaslone .
Takšen pristop zahteva čas , ljudi , ki znajo pisati ( bog ve , da je to verjetno eden večjih problemov slovenskih strank ) , predvsem pa slutnjo , da bo jutri mogoče že ( pre ) pozno .
A few miles out of Washington , on Route 1 to Baltimore , lies an inconspicuous military installation called Fort Meade .
You would not notice it unless you knew what to look for .
In fact , on most road maps , Fort Meade does not exist .
And yet it contains the largest mass of secrets in the world .
It is home to the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the least visible but most powerful spy agency in America 's armoury .
38,000 people work at the agency every day , more than the CIA and FBI put together - every one of them sworn to a lifetime of secrecy
In the enormous post - mortem exercise over what went wrong in the run-up to 11 September , all the criticism has been directed at the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which is how the US Government wants it .
The less attention the NSA gets the better - the joke is that its initials stand for No Such Agency - and yet somewhere hidden in its massive computers there are almost certainly enough vital clues to have prevented the 11 September attacks , had anyone known where to look .
Listening in
The NSA 's job is to eavesdrop on the world 's phone calls and emails , but do not try to phone them .
The NSA website does not list a phone number .
You do not contact them .
They listen to you .
You are not allowed to take any pictures of the base .
Your only option is to order a video which they shot themselves .
Having finally found a phone number , I rang to ask for it and offered to send a courier to pick it up .
The lady on the end of the phone who called herself a press officer - what a curious job that must be since no NSA official has ever given an interview - said that it would not be possible to pick it up because the courier would not be allowed near the camp .
Instead they send it to you .
I even tracked down the Phoenix Society , the association for former NSA employees .
I phoned the number listed but an answer - phone simply clicked on without a message .
It is as if an entire city has got a highly contagious disease and is sealed off from the outside world .
Secret world
Though invisible on the map , 38,000 people work at the agency every day , more than the CIA and FBI put together - every one of them sworn to a lifetime of secrecy .
They have their own police force , shopping malls and sports complexes - and their own television network , complete with newsreaders .
On one channel you can watch live video from unmanned planes flying over Afghanistan or surf through real - time satellite photos of Pakistan troop movements on the Kashmir border .
One of the most bizarre ironies of all this is that five of the hijackers lived in a motel right outside the gates of the NSA
On their secure internet , which they share with the CIA and FBI , you can read transcripts of intercepted conversations between soldiers on exercise in China , or European diplomats .
When Osama bin Laden first moved to Afghanistan , the NSA listened in to every phone call he made on his satellite phone .
Over the course of two years it is believed they logged more than 2,000 minutes of conversation .
Who knows what gems of information the NSA learnt from that which have not been made public .
It all ended when President Clinton ordered the cruise missile strike on his training camp in 1998 .
Bin Laden narrowly escaped with his life .
He realised that the NSA was listening in and ditched his satellite phone , and ordered his aides never to talk on the phone again about operations .
Terrorist neighbours
This shows the limitations of the NSA 's incredible technology .
In my experience , journalists cannot resist endowing spy agencies with supernatural capabilities and power .
In fact their failings are all too human .
September 11 is a perfect example of this .
Nineteen men armed only with box -cutters and their fanaticism successfully hatched a plot totally unnoticed by America 's $ 40 bn a year intelligence - gathering machine .
They succeeded because they lived and worked , not in the shadows where spies operate , but in full view .
In fact , one of the most bizarre ironies of all this is that five of the hijackers lived in a motel right outside the gates of the NSA .
Early on the morning of 11 September , when Hani Hanjour and his four accomplices left the Valencia Motel on US route 1 on their way to Washington 's Dulles airport , they joined the stream of NSA employees heading to work .
Three hours later , they had turned flight 77 around and slammed it into the Pentagon .
The NSA was created after World War II to stop another surprise attack like Pearl Harbor by providing early warning .
But in the hour when the need was greatest , it failed the country .
And it failed not because it did not have enough information , but because it had too much .
According to author James Bamford , who has studied the NSA for years , each one of their dozen largest listening posts around the world picks up more than two million communications an hour - cell phones , diplomatic traffic , emails , faxes .
That works out at 500 million hours every day .
When you think that this has to be translated from a myriad of languages and then analysed , you realise that the NSA looks less like an omniscient being than a man wading through a warehouse of words in search of a few tiny diamonds .
Redstate has made a mistake in dealing with the Ron Paul Internet phenomenon .
Instead of dealing quietly with trolls , the excellent conservative blog has announced a blanket policy banning supporting diaries and comments for Ron Paul from the site .
Leon Wolf , who had worked for Sam Brownback for a while , announced it on the site today :
Effective immediately , new users may * not * shill for Ron Paul in any way shape , form or fashion .
Not in comments , not in diaries , nada .
If your account is less than 6 months old , you can talk about something else , you can participate in the other threads and be your zany libertarian self all you want , but you cannot pimp Ron Paul .
Those with accounts more than six months old may proceed as normal .
Now , I could offer a long - winded explanation for * why * this new policy is being instituted , but I 'm guessing that most of you can probably guess .
Unless you lack the self - awareness to understand just how annoying , time - consuming , and bandwidth - wasting responding to the same idiotic arguments from a bunch of liberals pretending to be Republicans can be .
Which , judging by your comment history , you really do n't understand , so allow me to offer an alternate explanation : we are a bunch of fascists and we 're upset that you 've discovered where we keep the black helicopters , so we 're silencing you in an attempt to keep you from warning the rest of your brethren so we can round you all up and send you to re-education camps all at once .
It 's their community , of course , and they set the rules .
However , this does n't hurt Paul 's credibility as much as it does Redstate's .
While Paul 's supporters tend towards the annoying and repetitive , they have less impact because we can easily engage them and counter their arguments .
Banning them simply for their support for a candidate seems more like an admission that Redstate lacks that ability .
I 'm no Paul supporter by any means .
However , Paul 's statements can be addressed and rebutted fairly easily , at least those with which I strongly disagree .
I do n't fear the commenters nor the debate , even if it does grow tiresome at times .
It certainly can't be any more tiresome than the S - CHIP debate , or the Iraq War debate , or the FISA debate -- and I 'd have less sympathy for opponents on those issues than the people who support Ron Paul .
Having been to the CLC , I disagree with Leon 's assumption that these Paul supporters are all or mostly cryptoliberals .
Plenty of libertarian - leaning Republicans exist in the party , along with the former Buchananites and isolationists of the GOP .
Instead of cutting these people off , it might be better for Redstate to keep engaging them .
After all , Paul will not be in the race all that much longer , and we need those voters to stay in the GOP when Paul disappears .
There are worse impulses than libertarianism .
Heck , I 'd even interview Ron Paul , just to get a chance to challenge him ( respectfully ) on some of his positions and see how he responds .
I put in a request yesterday to do just that , and if we can make it work , we 'll have Rep .
Paul on the Heading Right Radio show , where listeners can ask their own questions and continue engaging the Paulites .
Engagement can be understandably frustrating , but in the end , it forces us to sharpen our own arguments and challenge our own assumptions -- and both are good processes .
UPDATE : Michael van der Galien understands the impulse to ban the Paulites , but wo n't do it :
We have written about Ron Paul on several occasions , and although there certainly are / were some Paul supporters who added a lot to the comment sections at this blog , there were sadly also quite some who spammed our comment sections with “ go ron go ” and that was it .
Such commenters add nothing , and I mean nothing , to the debate , which is why I understand Red State ’s decision to ban all of them .
Having said that , we wo n’t change this into a ‘ no Paul - zone . ’
Paul is a phenomenon and to ignore this phenomenon is silly .
Furthermore , as said , quite some of the commenters do add something and do have something to interesting to say .
It 's better to stay engaged than willfully disengage .
UPDATE : Redstate responds , and in the same friendly manner in which I intended this post .
I count Moe , Leon , and Eric among my friends in the blogosphere , and I hope they feel the same way .
And they spelled my name correctly , too , which I appreciate ...
DESPITE an increase in entertainment choices , watching television remains as popular as ever , according to the OECD 's “ Communications Outlook 2007 ” .
In 15 of the 18 countries for which data were collected , broadcast - TV viewing increased from 1997 to 2005 .
Only in Spain , New Zealand and South Korea did people watch less .
America takes the couch - potato crown , with households goggling at the box for an eye - straining average of 8 hours and 11 minutes every day .
The nearest rival , Turkey , only manages an average of five hours a day .

The problem is that Snow said this ten years ago , about Bill Clinton .
The Chicago Trib 's blog has Snow 's entire article he wrote about Clinto , here are some excerpts :
Mr. Clinton can't blame his lawyers for this latest feint .
He alone can assert the privilege .
The maneuver places him at the heart of his administration 's ongoing effort to use executive privilege as a way of concealing the truth about whether the president exposed himself
he White House never would assert privilege in the face of a criminal investigation .
He merely was reiterating long - standing executive - branch policy along those lines .
President Ronald Reagan did n't invoke privilege in Iran - contra , and neither did President George Bush
Taken to its logical extreme , that position would make it impossible for citizens to hold a chief executive accountable for anything .
He would have a constitutional right to cover up
Most of us want no part of a president who is cynical enough to use the majesty of his office to evade the one thing he is sworn to uphold the rule of law

" My body felt like it was a palette of paint thrown on a canvas and slowly moving down it . "
This description of the effects of digesting the plant salvia divinorum - a relative of common sage - sounds like a parody of 1960s mind - expanding hippies .
But it is not untypical of a curious YouTube - centred subculture .
SALVIA FACTS
Related to common sage Legal in UK Used by Mazatec shamans in Mexico Active ingredient salvinorum A Acts on kappa - opioid receptors in brain Chewed or smoked
Mexican shamans have been using the plant as part of religious rite for thousands of years , but it is now one of a range of " legal highs " sold on both sides of the Atlantic .
Smoked , the effect can be intense but lasts as little as 10 minutes , while chewing it creates a longer period under the influence .
Its defenders say it is neither toxic or addictive , but legislators have been concerned enough for it to be banned in Australia , a number of European nations and a handful of US states .
Users can experience uncontrolled laughter , a temporary inability to speak , dramatic visual and auditory hallucinations , uncoordinated movement , a feeling of being out of the body and a wide range of other unsettling phenomena .
In the US , following the suicide of a teenager last year who had at some point smoked the plant , there were calls for a federal ban .
Here , Labour MP for Bassetlaw , John Mann , recently tabled an early - day motion demanding the government urgently rectify its " oversight " .
" Some claims made about salvia are very bad .
People will be shocked by this , " he said .
One person while he was immersed in this intense visionary state when he regained his senses found some of the furniture in the room was smashed up and he had a broken shoulder
Daniel Siebert
Botanist
Botanist Daniel Siebert is regarded by some as the guru of salvia , and since 1991 he has been examining the chemistry and history of the substance , as well as using it and selling it .
He fears that its widespread availability and irresponsible use by teenagers may lead the US authorities to ban it .
" A lot of people would say even if you do n't have any evidence of psychological harm , just the fact it causes intense hallucinations is dangerous in itself .
That can be a dangerous thing to do .
You could jump out of a window .
In that sense you could make an argument that there is a legitimate concern . "
Mr Siebert says salvia should be used in a safe environment , supervised by someone sober , and in low doses .
The consequences of ignoring this advice can be unfortunate .
Hobbit houses
" One person put his arm through a window because he did n't see a window .
Another person while he was immersed in this intense visionary state when he regained his senses found some of the furniture in the room was smashed up and he had a broken shoulder .
He was running around not knowing what he was doing . "
Mr Siebert says his first experience , chewing raw leaf , was pleasant .
" I noticed some shifts in visual perception , objects had a glow or coloured aura .
I looked up at the hills .
There were Hobbit - like houses nestled into the hillside .
There was light coming from the windows .
There was something fairytale - like about the scene , there was something very comforting about the whole thing . "
Use of the plant originated in Mexico ( Pic : Garry Nixon )
Others , particularly those that smoke a stronger extract , often have a bad time of it , experience a much more dramatic " visionary " effect that leaves many unnerved .
" They find it frightening or disorientating , not a good substance for a social situation .
Most people find it uncomfortable , " Mr Siebert suggests .
And this perhaps goes to the root of the fear of salvia .
While studies have suggested depressive effects in rats , there is yet to be a major scientific study completed into its effects on humans .
But there is perhaps understandable fear over the legality of such a powerful hallucinogen .
Tim Kendall , deputy director of the research unit of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a consultant psychiatrist , says there are grounds for concern and that " all hallucinogens should be treated with caution " , but usage is clearly rare in the UK .
He has never seen a patient with problems where salvia has been mentioned .
Clinical pharmacologist and addiction expert Professor Fabrizio Schifano , of the University of Hertfordshire , agrees the hallucinogenic nature of salvia is enough for it to be of concern .
" Do I have a reason to be concerned ?
Yes .
Do we need further studies ?
Yes . "
One thing that concerns him is the theory that interaction with the receptors in the brain that salvia acts on may be linked to schizophrenia .
Salvia 's role in brain chemistry therefore needs more research , Mr Schifano says .
But even if one cannot conclusively establish that a substance like salvia is toxic or harmful to mental health , can't one take the view that powerful hallucinogens are necessarily something bad for society and ban them anyway ?
Access to pleasure
Bioethicist Professor Julian Savulescu , a former doctor and director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics , says one should be able to argue at least for " direct pharmacological effects or disturbance in social function " before considering restricting individual freedoms .
" There has been a long history of attempt to control access to pleasure .
" I can't see a good reason to interfere in individual liberties when people are n't harming themselves or other people .
If they were inducing altered states through meditation or chanting , people would n't think of asking for a ban . "
It is a view that the UK government is yet to contradict .
The Home Office says : " We are not aware of any evidence of significant misuse of this plant and we have no plans to review its legal status . "
In practice though , it may be the strange qualities of the plant that stop it spreading beyond the current YouTube minicraze .
Steve Henderson , whose firm sells herbal products advertised as " not for human consumption " , has been stocking salvia for five years .
He has taken it .
Once .
" Personally , I think it 's awful .
It was very intense , quite hard to understand what exactly was going on .
It 's something that I 've never repeated .
People will try it and not go back . "
An investigation into salvia divinorum was broadcast on the BBC's Inside Out on Wednesday 31 October at 1930 GMT .
More prohibition ?
Why are we , the people of this country , forever being treated as if we are children , or too stupid to decide how we want to live our lives ?
What makes some minister more of a judge of my life and the effects of my actions on myself and those around me than me ?
This arrogant , patronising attitude is but one of the pebbles on the road to a true police state .
Jai Gomer , UK
Hm , a quick glance into any book on the use of mind altering plants in traditional cultures should quickly disabuse us of any ideas of being able to legislate .
There are thousands of them , taken correctly even parts of the corn plant can have an effect .
Should n't we instead be looking to teaching our children to make informed decisions when it comes to taking drugs and how to do so safely if they really have to ?
Someone who wants to get high , will get high .
After all , surely we cannot ban everything that could have an effect right down to glue ?
Michael , Glasgow
I have tried and test Salvia Divinorum many many times in the past and the present including the 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 60X strengths .
I work a normal everyday 9 to 5 job , have a mortgage and am an upstanding citizen .
But I like to indulge in this legal high .
Phillip N , Warrington
So some teenagers misuse a substance and a ban on its use is called for - how absurd !
Did we ban glue which killed many people who abused it ?
Deodorants and other sprays which have been abused ?
Nutmeg - a notorious hallucinogenic ?
Marker pens ?
There are few substances that are not open to abuse by those seeking some kind of thrill .
As always , the key is education and not a blanket ban .
Clare Donaldson , Scotland
Well done the BBC for publicising a drug which probably very little people were aware of .
How irresponsible can the media be ?
They are now introducing the youth of today in to new ways to get out of there skulls .
Coli Kennedy , Aberdeen
I 've tried this stuff and it is pretty intense but once is quite enough !
I think that 's the nub of the argument - I 've no desire to do it again ( and neither does anyone else I know who 's had the experience ! ) .
I 've tried bungee jumping once as well and similarly have no desire to do that again either - abuse potential limited !
Karl , Leeds
Yes - make it illegal , and watch its popularity soar .
J Boyle , Belfast
It should not be banned , although its legality does seem to be a bit confusing considering the illegality of many other drugs with less potential for harm but thats not the issue here .
More consideration and regulation should perhaps come into play to stop this herb being advertised as something it's not and to educate its users and potential users as to the particular dangers associated with it .
Drug use is not necessarily drug abuse , the difference is all in education .
Fraser Wade , Aberdeen , United Kingdom
Is it more or less dangerous to the user and others around than alcohol ?
AD , Edinburgh
Oh no !
God has made yet another mistake and created a mild hallucinogenic leaf .
How careless .
Thank goodness he had the foresight to create conservatives ...!
Robert , Cardiff , UK
Yet again we have the knee - jerk reactionaries , notably Labour politicians , calling for a ban on something that brings pleasure .
It should not be the job of governments to protect people from themselves , only to protect people from any adverse effects of others ' actions .
If people want to enjoy this plant and do not harm others in the process they should be allowed to in a free society , as they should be allowed to enjoy any other substance .
Stop the nanny state before it removes all our freedoms !
Alan Forbes , London , UK
In the end - who pays for those ( especially young teenagers and those not working ) who DO end up in hospitals because of drug use ?
Usually someone else ...
Anything designated as a ' non - food ' and which with deliberate and unnecessary use may lead to hospitalisation or any kind of subsequent treatment being required , should be banned .
I say - let the ' user ' pay for all the associated consequential costs of their drug use - and that goes for any drug - including tobacco .
A W , Northants
Drugs like Salvia have been taken out of their indigenous culture and mass marketed in the overconsumptive West .
In a culture like ours where excess appears to be the rule it is n't any wonder that incidents occur - most often than not with teenagers .
Unfortunately the whole idea of moderation , appropriate use , set and setting etc are anathema in our culture .
This is encouraged by some retailers of Salvia who 's lurid websites glorify ' getting off your head ' .
Salvia looks like going the way of Magic Mushrooms - with the ' one size fits all ' drug laws labelling even responsible takers as criminals .
The key should be strict regulation and control , however blanket restriction is more likely as it is cheaper and simpler to implement .

Columnist : ' When did we become like Syria ? '
Jason Rhyne

The secretive US policy of transferring suspected terrorists abroad for severe interrogations is akin to something the Syrian government would do , according to a Syrian - American columnist and lawyer .
" When visiting my grandmother 's house in Damascus a few years ago , I never could have imagined sitting one day in a U.S. court , listening to the U.S. government defend its covert transfer of a Canadian citizen to Syria to be tortured , " writes Salon columnist Alia Malek .
" Yet , that 's precisely what happened ... "
Malek 's column is entitled " When did we become like Syria ? "
The columnist was present in court last week for the appeal of Maher Arar ( above right , with daughter ) , a Canadian born in Syria who was arrested by US officials in 2002 , purportedly for his suspected links to Al Qaeda .
" He was denied access to counsel and access to a court .
Twelve days later he was sent in chains and shackles to Syria , " writes Malek .
" There he was tortured for nearly a year and coerced into making a false confession , before being released after the tireless campaigning of his wife . "
Arar 's case against the US government , originally thrown out by a lower court , is the first legal challenge to the policy of rendition , the transfer of American - held detainees to foreign countries known to employ torture measures .
" The interrogation lasted about seven or eight hours , and then they came , and shackled me and chained me , " Arar told 60 Minutes II in 2004 about his experience in US custody .
" I said , ' What 's happening here ? '
And they would not tell me .
They said ,  You are gonna know tomorrow .'... What they accused me of being is very serious .
Being a member of al Qaeda . "
Two weeks later , Arar was deported to Syria , according to CBS .
" They read me the document .
They say , ' The INS director decided to deport you to Syria , '" Arar said in the interview .
" And of course , the first thing I did was I started crying , because everyone knows that Syria practices torture . "
Arar was later released -- a year and a half after his arrest -- following a protracted campaign from his wife , Monia , who lobbied the Canadian government to look into the matter .
Early this year , the innocent Arar was awarded $ 9 million and an apology from Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper .
" The story is already disturbing , surreal , Kafkaesque , " continues Malek .
" It also left me with this realization :
The sharp line I had drawn as a child -- between what could happen to a person under a dictatorship like Syria 's and what could never happen to a person under a constitutional democracy like that of the U.S. -- seemed to be disappearing . "
Excerpts from the column : # " It was this contrast that had defined me as a Syrian - American .
Not merely because it meant I had a passport my relatives in Syria could only covet , but also because I was confident that I had rights .
I believed that meant I would never disappear off the street into oblivion -- with no access to a lawyer or judge , and without anyone even being able to know my whereabouts , let alone help me ...
So as I sat in the New York courtroom on Friday , a room with a rich mahogany interior , I was perplexed and saddened .
Being Syrian - American , I had always borne the stigma and burden of the strained relationship between the U.S. and Syria , of having grandparents and roots ( very proud roots ) from an " evil " country .
Now , Syria and the U.S. were in cahoots , finally getting along -- at least when it came to torture .
Arar 's counsel argued that although the torture may have happened in Syria , the conspiracy by U.S. officials that allowed it to happen occurred here .
Their actions , counsel argued , violated U.S. laws and the Constitution . "

GREEK workers see the longest job tenure in Europe .
In 2005 they had spent an average of nearly 13 years with the same employer , according to the OECD 's Economic Survey of the European Union .
Within Europe workers changed jobs quickest in Britain and Ireland , where flexible labour laws make it easier to hire and fire and where growing economies mean workers are tempted by new opportunities .
Employees are most mobile in America ( or perhaps most - easily fired ) , putting in an average of just four years for one boss .

Amid worries of new blazes adding to the firestorm already afflicting the region , a man in Hesperia has been arrested on suspicion of arson , and police reported shooting and killing another arson suspect after chasing him out of scrub behind Cal State San Bernardino .
Law enforcement officials said today that they did n’t know whether either of the men had started any of the more than a dozen large fires that have devastated Southern California in recent days , including the nearby Lake Arrowhead blaze .
The brush fire in Hesperia was quickly extinguished by residents .
Investigators have said that at least two of the huge wildfires , one in Orange County and the other in Temecula , were the work of arsonists .
The confrontation that ended in the shooting death started about 6 p.m. Tuesday when San Bernardino university police spotted a man in a rural area of flood channels and scrub near the campus .
University police tried to detain the man , but he got into his car and fled , authorities said .
When he began to ram officers ’ vehicle , they shot him .

The suspect is described as a 27 - year - old man with a home address in Arizona .
Sheriff ’s investigators will search his impounded pickup truck pending a search warrant , Lt. Scott Patterson of the San Bernardino Police Department said this afternoon .
No additional information , including his identity will be released until Thursday .
“ We do n’t know whether he was an arsonist , ” Patterson said .
“ What was related by the Cal State police was that they tried to contact him as a suspicious person in a brush area .
Things being how they are , there was a suspicion that he could be an arsonist . ”
The area near the campus had been affected by the massive Old Fire of 2003 , Patterson said , adding that “ it ’s very fire - prone .
It ’s an area that would be very devastated if a fire were to start there . ”

San Bernardino police joined campus authorities in pursuit of the suspect .
He drove north on Waterman Avenue and up a dirt fire road into the foothills .
When officers tried to take him into custody , he began to batter officers ’ vehicles with car , Patterson said .
Officers shot and killed him .
“ Both agencies ’ officers fired , ” said University Police Chief Jimmie Brown , who added that it was not known who fired the fatal shot .
“ But right now , we do n’t know too much more . ”
The shooting is being investigated by the San Bernardino County Sheriff ’s Department , which is routine for officer - involved shootings .
About three hours later in Hesperia , a man was seen by a female motorist squatting along the side of Highway 173 just south of Arrowhead Lake Road .
Sheriff ’s officials say John Alfred Rund , 48 , of Hesperia had just started a fire along the flat , isolated , scrubby road .

The woman called police , and Highway Patrol and sheriff ’s deputies were soon looking for the suspect , who witnesses said took off on a Honda motorcycle , wearing a red - and - white - striped helmet .
Four residents grabbed shovels and put out the fire with clods of dirt , said sheriff ’s spokesperson Jodi Miller .
A CHP helicopter , using infrared equipment , caught sight of Rund on his motorcycle , Miller said .
Along with CHP officers , sheriff ’s deputies found and arrested him at a home along Highway 173 near Highway 138 , she said .
He was being held on $ 750,000 bail on suspicion of arson and is to appear in court tomorrow in Victorville .

“ He has not been connected in any way so far with any fire up on the hill , ” Miller said .
“ We do n’t know at this point what started that fire . ”
Why Ocaml ?
In Fall 2002 , I started a project which involved a good mix of string processing , simple statistics and some simple data structures like hash tables and trees .
A preliminary prototype in matlab was very slow , so I wanted to look for a more suitable language to implement it in .
My desiderata are listed below .
The language should
Have an intepreter for rapid prototyping , ease of debugging , and maximum fun .
Have a native code ( not just byte code ) compiler that produces fast code that can be run stand - alone or called from the interactive environment .
Have good support for vectors , multi- dimensional arrays , strings , hash tables , etc. in the standard library .
Have a free implementation .
Work under linux and windows .
( so I can transfer code easily between my desktop and my laptop . )
ML vs Lisp Popularity / familiarity .
Lisp is more widely known / used than ML ( especially in AI ) .
There is a lot of code already written in Lisp .

Type checking .
ML is statically type checked ( unlike lisp ) , which reduces errors and improves efficiency .
Although Lisp allows one to declare types to improve efficiency , it is a bit ugly and not as powerful as ML .
In addition , ML has type inference , which means it is not necessary to explicitly declare types .
( The CMU CL compiler also does some type inference . )

Compilers .
For ML , there are two free compilers : The Standard ML of New Jersey and Ocaml .
The Ocaml compiler is somewhat more efficient than the SML / NJ compiler ( see " Do you blow SML / NJ 's socks off ? " ) .
In addition , Ocaml comes with some excellent libraries , and support for objects , making it preferable to SML in my opinion .
For Lisp , there are several compilers .
Allegro lisp compiler is expensive .
GNU Clisp compiler is free and portable , but has poor floating point performance .
CMU common lisp is free and has good floating point performance , but only has a unix port .

Speed .
According to The great computer language shootout , ( see also the newer Computer language shootout benchmarks )
Ocaml is the second fastest language - slower than C , but faster than C ++.
No matter how I changed the weights reflecting relative importance of speed , memory usage , lines of code , mathematical vs string processing , etc. , it always came out in the top 3 .
I was skeptical , but the same results hold true in the Win32 version of the shootout , implemented independently .

Syntax .
I have not yet gotten used to lisp syntax ( it is said that lisp stands for " lost in superfluous parentheses " ) .
On the other hand , Ocaml also has a few quirks , e.g. , one must remember to write +. for real addition and + for integer addition .
However , this seems quite natural .
More importantly , people claim Lisp 's macros can be used to define fancy syntactic sugar .
Ocaml also has a preprocessor , but I have n't learned how to use it yet .
Speed of OCaml
The benchmarks above suggests the Ocaml compiler generates the second fastest code of any of the currently available compilers ( gcc and the Intel C compilers being first ) .
Given that Ocaml is also a beautiful language to program in , this is pretty compelling .
But maybe the benchmarks are unreliable ?
See eg Ocaml is only fast if used imperatively , Slashdot 14 March 2005 .
This is possible .
However , I found several other favorable reports on Ocaml 's performance .
e.g. , this example , which implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes for computing primes in Ocaml and C .
The Ocaml code is faster , even though the C code is well - written .
In addition , I found this quote from Doug McClain , on a detailed comparative study of C++ , IDL , Fortran , SML , Ocaml , Dylan , Erlang , Clean , Haskell , Lisp , Mathematica for scientific computing : " And most importantly , the CAML version works , and it works properly every time .
I am assured , having monitored its runtime behavior that there are no memory leaks .
Furthermore , the quality of code generated by the CAML compiler has been analyzed by the Intel VTune system and it show no pipeline stalls , maximum parallelism between integer and floating point units , and machine assembly code that is as good or better than can be achieved by hand coding . "
So I did my own experiment .
It involved a lot of simple floating point arithmetic , plus some string matching .
I found the following speedups relative to intrepreted matlab 6.1 : Ocaml native code compiler : 10 times faster , Ocaml bytecode compiler : 2 times faster , Matlab mcc compiler : 1.4 times faster .
( The matlab code has 670 lines of code , the equivalent Ocaml code has 989 lines . )

The little desktop Linux that came out of the blue Nov. 13 , 2007
When a desktop Linux distribution suddenly becomes popular before even DistroWatch starts tracking it , you know you 've got something special .
One new Ubuntu - based distribution , gOS , has managed to capture users ' attention purely by word of mouth over the Internet .
gOS was introduced by Everex , a midtier PC vendor , in its inexpensive Green gPC TC2502 computer in late October .
This cheap computer is sold for $ 198 at Wal - Mart stores and online at walmart.com .
The operating system is based , like so many desktop Linuxes such as Mint , on Ubuntu .
In gOS ' case , it 's built on top of the newly released Ubuntu 7.10 Linux .
It includes the usual array of open - source software that users have learned to expect from a Linux desktop such as popular applications from Firefox , Skype and OpenOffice.org .
The one difference that Linux users will notice immediately about it is that it uses the Enlightenment E17 desktop interface with a Google - centric theme instead of the far more common KDE or GNOME desktops .
Google - centric ?
Yes , exactly so .
According to the developers , " We recommend Google for just about everything ... Gmail , Gtalk , Calendar , Maps , Docs and Spreadsheets and more .
We 'd like to welcome you to the idea that Google already is your ' operating system . ' "
Paul Kim , Everex 's director of marketing , went even further , " Our dream is to combine Linux with Google and put it into the mass market . "
While Google does not have a formal partnership with either Everex or gOS , the search giant did see gOS before it was shipped .
Google then approved Everex to bundle its Google toolbar with gOS ' browser .
With this in mind , the gOS applications are set to work with Google from the get - go .
For example , clicking on the e-mail icon takes you to Gmail , the news icon sends you off to Google News , and the calendar " application " is Google Calendar .
Even when there 's a choice of programs , such as OpenOffice for word processing and spreadsheets , gOS defaults to using Google Docs and Spreadsheets .
Most of the commonly used applications are made available to users via a Mac OS - like dock at the bottom of the screen .
This is a Linux that 's designed with several specific purposes in mind .
First , it 's not just built around Google ; it 's built on Web 2.0 applications and the Internet .
Next , it works with low - end hardware .
This may be the first PC where a high - speed Internet connection is more important to its performance than a high - speed processor .
It 's also designed to be extremely easy to use .
As a reviewer at LifeHacker concisely put it , " Imagine setting up a Google account for someone who 's not terribly keen on computers and then handing them over to a PC with gOS .
Getting started from there could n't be easier . "
While all of Ubuntu 's goodies are there for those who look for them , this system could be used by someone who'd never used any computer before .
In an interview with a Linux blog , gOS founder David Liu makes it clear that ease of use was at the top of his mind when he helped create gOS .
" Basically it has to do with the Ubuntu community and vision .
I like their mantra ' Linux for human beings . '
I wanted to take it further , more like ' Linux for human beings who shop at Wal - Mart ' (… ' and who probably have never heard of Linux ' ) . "
At this point , however , gOS ' developers are really looking more for other developers than for users .
To that end , Everex has also made the TC20502's motherboard available for hardware hackers and Linux programmers as the gOS Dev Board .
This is a micro-ATX form - factor Via " PC - 1 " motherboard based on a 1.5GHz Via C7 processor .
gOS is available as a CD ISO image from several BitTorrent sites .
Good places to start your download include The Green Company and LinuxTracker .

O.K. , the new like is hot and it ’s useful , but is it legit ?
Are n’t some rules of grammar or usage being broken here ?
Linguists and lexicographers say no .
It ’s natural , they say , for words to take on new roles .
In this case , a “ content word ” ( one that means something ) has become a “ function word ” ( one that has a grammatical function but little actual meaning ) .
Academics call the process “ grammaticalization . ”
It ’s one of the ways language changes .
So is the new like proper English ?
Well , the latest editions of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language and Merriam - Webster ’s Collegiate Dictionary now include it as a usage heard in informal speech .
That ’s not a ringing endorsement , but it ’s not a condemnation either .
As for me , I ’m convinced that this is a useful , even ingenious , addition to informal spoken English .
But let ’s be honest .
For now , at least , it smacks of incorrectness to a great many people .
In writing my grammar book for kids , I wrestled with this problem .
In the end , I suggested that the usage is O.K. in informal conversation but not for situations requiring your best English .
Contrary to popular opinion , like is not exclusively a kid thing .
Grown - ups use it too , men and women about equally , according to Dailey - O’Cain .
“ Part of what inspired my study was the fact that my mother ( who was in her 50s at the time ) used to complain about other people using like , ” she says .
“ But once I started pointing it out to her every single time she used it herself , she stopped making those kinds of criticisms ! ”
The linguist Geoffrey Pullum , an author of The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language , finds the usage “ quite logical and reasonable . ”
And he agrees that it ’s not confined to youngsters .
“ My former student Jessica Maki caught her 65 - year - old aunt , who grew up in North Carolina , saying , ‘ I ’m like , do n’t answer the telephone ! ’ ”
Marie Osmond Ambushed by Larry King ( Video )
was shocked when Larry King asked her about her 16 year old son Michael 's admission to a rehab facility .
She gave him a blank look and then asked him how he knew that .
Not cool Larry .
The singer and her brother Donny Osmond sat down with Larry King yesterday afternoon to tape his evening show .
They expected the conversation to cover the loss of their father , their 50th Anniversary Show and Marie 's Dancing with the Stars experience .
The pair were said to be livid that King would ambush Marie .
Today 's New York Post had the banner headline " King of Ambush Blindsides Marie on Rehab " .
Donny was reportedly ready to have King pull the interview when Entertainment Tonight went on air with the leaked story .
The video clip soon raced across the internet .
According to sources , King was getting back at the Osmond 's for giving Oprah their 50th Anniversary Show .
King has been in negotiations with the Osmond family and had hoped to air the show on CNN .
The program gave Oprah her best ratings of the year .
Apparently Marie has softened her stance and acknowledges that the information was bound to get out .
She is not yet ready to talk about the specifics but hopes that their story might help others going through similar issues .

This is part 2 of a 2 part series .
Part 1 was Misconceptions about Gold .
Imagine that you live on a small island mining the local salt mine , together with Pete the fisherman and Tom the apple grower .
You 'd exchange your salt for Pete 's fishes and Tom 's apples , while they would exchange fishes and apples between them .
One day Pete says : " Instead of fish , from now on I will give you pieces of papyrus with numbers marked on them .
( Papyrus grows in near unlimited quantities nearby , to the obvious benefit of Pete ) . "
Pete continues " One papyrus mark will represent 1 fish or 5 apples or 2 bags of salt ( equivalent to current barter exchange rates ) .
This will make it easier for us to trade among ourselves .
We wo n't have to lug fishes , apples and salt around all the time .
Instead , we simply present the papyrus for exchange on demand . "
In short , Pete wants to modernize your little island economy by introducing money - and he already has one of those $ 1 papyrus notes with him , which he 's eager to exchange for salt .
You 'd laugh him out of the room , since you would realize that the papyrus per se is not of any value .
If you were all to agree on using the papyrus , its value would rest on a promise alone - Pete 's promise that papyrus he issues is actually backed by fish .
Since the stuff grows everywhere , he could easily issue it by the bucket load .
In fact , it 's unlikely that any of the islanders would ever come up with such an absurd idea .
More likely they would use another good for which there is an actual demand ( for instance , a rare type of sea - shell that is prized as an ornament and only seldom found on the island ) as their medium of exchange .
In short , a free market medium of exchange / store of value can only be something with an already established demand .
No worthless object would ever emerge to function as money in a free market .
So how did it happen ?
How did essentially worthless objects come into widespread acceptance as money ?
To answer that question , we need to take a brief look at history .
Flashback : Rome 27 BC
Rome ’s history of inflation and money debasement actually began with Cesar ’s successor Augustus , whereby his method was at least not a prima facie fraud .
He simply ordered the mines to overproduce silver in an attempt to finance the empire that had grown greatly under Cesar and himself .
When this overproduction began to have inflationary effects , Augustus wisely decided to cut back on the issuance of coins .
This was the last time that a Roman emperor attempted to honestly correct a monetary policy blunder , aside from a brief flashing up of monetary rectitude under Aurelius some 280 years later .
Under Augustus ’ successors , things began to deteriorate fast .
Claudius , Caligula and Nero embarked on enormous spending sprees that depleted Rome ’s treasury .
It was Nero who first came up with the idea to actually debase coins by reducing their silver content in AD 64 , and it all went downhill from there .
It should be mentioned that Mark Anthony of Hollywood fame financed the army he used in his fight against Octavian – then later Augustus – also with debased coinage .
These coins remained in circulation for a long time , obeying Gresham ’s Law – " bad money drives good money from circulation " .
Left : An AD 275 specimen of Aurelian ’s Antonianus , 1 part silver to 20 parts copper .
In AD 274 Aurelius entered the scene with a well - intentioned monetary reform , which fixed the silver - copper content of the then most widely used coin ( the Antonianus ) at 1:20 – however , just as soon as this reform was instituted , the silver content resumed its inexorable decline .
Left : Emperor Diocletian the price fixer
In AD 301 Emperor Diocletian tried his hand at reform , this time by instituting price controls , an idiocy repeated numerous times thereafter , in spite of the incontrovertible evidence that it never works ( Richard Nixon ’s ill - fated experiment being the most recent example ) .
Naturally , those price controls accelerated Rome ’s downfall as goods simply began to disappear from the market place .
Merchants began to hide their goods rather than accept the edict to sell them at a loss .
This is of course why price controls are always doomed to failure .
One recurring feature of Rome ’s long history of debasing its money was a perennial trade deficit due to overconsumption .
Does this sound vaguely familiar ?
The leap from clipping coins to outright fiat money
How was the leap from debasing coinage to outright fiat money accomplished ?
There are two distinct intertwined historical developments that led ultimately to the present system .
Goldsmiths become bankers
The idea of fractional reserve banking was first introduced by the forerunners of our modern day banking system , the goldsmiths .
Goldsmiths were used as depositories for gold and silver , and the receipts they issued for such deposits soon began to circulate as the first bank notes – especially once they hit upon the idea to make them out to the ‘ bearer ’ instead of tying them to a specific deposit .
Above :
An early goldsmith bank receipt
The convenience of carrying these bank notes instead bags of gold and silver soon caught on , and it did n’t take long for the goldsmiths to realize that deposits were rarely claimed in great quantities .
It followed that one could temporarily lend deposits out and collect interest on such loans .
So far so good – this is the legitimate business of banks .
But the goldsmiths decided to go one step further , issuing additional receipts for gold , even if they were not actually backed by a deposit .
This is what came to be known as ‘ fractional reserves banking ’ - lending out far more ‘ money ’ than one actually has in the form of deposits .
Obviously this is fraud .
Nonetheless , it ’s perfectly legal today , but in essence it remains the same fraud it has always been , with the main difference being that today it 's a more sophisticated as well as officially sanctioned fraud .
When bank notes were backed ( at least partially ) by gold and silver on deposit , fraud of this nature was frequently held in check by bank runs ( or from a banker 's perspective , fear of bank runs ) .
Nowadays , no such fear exists .
The ‘ lender of last resort ’ – the central bank – can ( at least in theory ) prevent such bank runs by conjuring new ‘ money ’ out of thin air .
In essence , a de facto insolvent banking system is supported by this trick .
Tally sticks and Charles II
The other historical development that can be seen as an ancestor of the modern day fiat money system is England ’s application of the medieval ‘ tally stick ’ method of recording debt payments .
Taxes in the largely agricultural economy of the Middle Ages were usually paid in the form of goods , and these payments were recorded with notches on wooden sticks that were then split length - wise ( one half remained with the tax payer serf , as proof of payment ) .
This was an ingenious method of avoiding counterfeiting .
In AD 1100 , King Henry the First ascended the English throne , and adopted the tally stick method of recording tax payments .
By the time of Henry II , taxes were paid twice a year , and the tally sticks recording the partial tax payment made at Easter soon began to circulate in a secondary discount market – i.e. , they began to be accepted as payment for goods and services at a discount , since they could be later presented to the treasury as proof of taxes paid .
It did n’t take long for the King and his treasurer to realize that they could actually issue tally sticks in advance , in order to finance ‘ emergency spending ’ ( not surprisingly , such emergencies often involved war – after the extortion of tax money the second big hobby of governments ) .
The selling of these claims to future tax revenue created the market for government debt – an essential part of today ’s fiat money system as well .
A wooden stick , masquerading as ‘ money ’ .
By 1660 , the English monarchy , after a brief hiatus of experimentation with a pseudo - republican government under Cromwell , was reinstated and Charles II began his reign but with vastly reduced powers , especially in the realm of taxation .
Since Charles had to beg for tax money from the parliament , he struggled mightily with paying his vast pile of bills .
Whenever Charles wrangled permission to raise taxes from parliament , he immediately went to cash in the future tax receipts by selling tally sticks to the goldsmiths at a discount .
This necessitated the introduction of previously referred to method of making such debt payable to the bearer , which allowed the goldsmiths to sell it in the secondary market to raise funds for more lending to the King .
They also began to pay interest to depositors , in order to attract still more funds .
At that stage of the game , the goldsmiths had a good thing going for them , since the King was the equivalent of a triple A rated sovereign borrower , who could always be relied upon to cover his debt with future tax receipts .
No one thought it problematic that the vaults soon contained more wooden sticks than gold .
There was an active market in this government debt , and the goldsmiths profited handsomely .
The King meanwhile decided to circumvent parliament and began to issue tally sticks as he pleased ( as an aside , one half of such a stick , which originally remained with the treasury had a handle and was called the ‘ stock ’ - the term that has evolved to describe shares in publicly listed corporations today ) .
Naturally , Charles was more than happy to exchange wooden sticks for gold , and not surprisingly , soon kicked off a veritable credit boom by upping his wooden sticks production .
Left : Charles II , the " Merry Monarch " , in all his splendor , eyes focused on the loot .
Why was he nicknamed the " Merry Monarch " ?
Well , you would be merry too if you could kick off an enormous credit boom by exchanging sticks for gold .
So what does a king do with all that gold he received for sticks ?
During his 25 year reign , he waged 3 losing wars ( 2 against the Dutch , one against France ) ; he survived 4 different parliaments ( only the first of which was n’t hostile to him ) ; he helped to establish the East India Company , made shady deals with Louis XIV of France ( his cousin ) , sired a horde of illegitimate children of which he acknowledged 14 , and was renown for his hedonistic court .
That 's a lot of " merry " .
Of course , there was a natural limit to this debt expansion .
Once all the money attracted from depositors had been transferred to the King , additional deposits could only be acquired by means of offering higher interest rates than previously .
By 1671 the annual discount on the King ’s debt had reached 10 % and due to redemptions nearly overwhelming funds raised by new debt issues , things clearly had ceased to work for him .
Charles suddenly and conveniently remembered that there was a law against usury on the books , and lo and behold , interest rates in excess of 6 % were not permissible .
With all his recent loans carrying a far bigger discount , he simply declared the debt illegal , and stopped payments on it ( with a few judiciously selected exceptions ) .
Overnight , the King ’s tally sticks reverted back to what they had really always been – worthless sticks of wood .
The King ’s creditors , chiefly the goldsmiths and their customers , had , quite literally , " drawn the short end of the stick " ( if you ever wondered where this expression came from , this is it ) .
Left : Charles II as he is apparently remembered today – a knight in shining armor , not the tyrannical thief that he really was .
Although tally sticks were still used until the early 19th century , and even formed part of the capital of the Bank of England when it was founded in 1694 , the secondary market never truly recovered from this blow .
Charles had , with the stroke of a pen , killed the better part of London ’s budding banking system , and transformed countless of his creditors into destitute involuntary tax payers .
To add insult to injury , he even gained a propaganda victory , as the public tended to blame the goldsmiths for the mess ( they were of course not entirely innocent , and above all had been quite gullible ) .
What the tally stick system and its application by Charles II however did achieve , was to plant the idea of how a fiat money system might actually be made to ‘ work ’ .
John Law ’s fiat money experiment in France
It was a Scotsman – John Law – ironically born in the very year ( 1671 ) when Charles defaulted on his debt , who tried the first great fiat money experiment inspired by these ideas .
Living in exile in France , he found a willing partner in Philppe II Duke of Orleans ' near bankrupt state for putting his ideas into practice .
Left : Philippe II , Duc d’Orelans , the Regent of France .
When Louis XIV of France died in 1715 , Philippe d'Orleans became Regent to the five - year - old King .
Together with John Law , they combined to economically wreck France .
John Law 's basic idea was that the more money in circulation the greater the prosperity of a country .
His ideas can be found in a treatise he published in 1705 entitled Money and Trade Considered .
Right : John Law - World 's first Keynesian economist
In his words , " Domestic trade depends upon money .
A greater quantity [ of money ] employs more people than a lesser quantity .
An addition to the money adds to the value of the country . "
With the above logic , John Law arguably became the world 's first Keynesian economist .
John Law became the comptroller general of finances and set up the Banque Generale Privee ( later the ‘ Banque Royale ’ ) , which used French government debt as the bulk of its reserves and began to emit paper money ‘ backed ’ by this debt – with a promise attached that the notes could be converted to gold coin on demand .
In an effort to make the new paper money more palatable to a distrustful public , it was decided to make it acceptable for payment of taxes ( this idea is key and we will get back to it ) .
A credit and asset boom of vast proportions ensued , especially after Law decided to float the shares of the Mississippi company , which enjoyed a trade monopoly with the New World and the West Indies .
Between 1719 and 1720 shares in the company rose from 500 to 18,000 livres .
Then , predictably , the bubble burst , and it lost 97 % of its market capitalization in the subsequent bust .
Enraged and nervous financiers tried to reconvert their bank notes into specie in the ensuing massive economic crisis , but naturally , the central bank ’s promise of convertibility could not be put into practice – it had inflated the supply of bank notes too much ( the notes traded at discounts of up to 99 % in the end ) .
The government at first tried to stem the tide with edicts forbidding the private ownership of gold , but in the end , the enraged mob drove Law into exile , and the fiat money experiment ended with the Banque Royale closing its doors forever .
Above : 1720 : Investors in Law’s Mississippi Company scam want their money back
The crisis following the collapse of Law’s Mississippi enterprise gripped all of Europe – the eloquent master of fiat disaster had seduced investors from all over the continent , many of whom were suddenly penniless .
Confidence in other European corporations eroded as well , and a great many bankruptcies took place .
Failures Everywhere
The history of the world is filled with examples like the above .
Unfortunately time and space considerations will not let us detail the backdoor coup that enabled the establishment of the Federal Reserve , FDR ’s sinister gold confiscation , Nixon ’s dropping of the last remnant of the dollar ’s gold convertibility , or China ’s earlier experiment with paper money which ended in a disastrous hyper-inflation .
The brief monetary history of Rome is intended to establish the fact that the State has sought to engage in theft from the citizenry via monetary debasement from the very dawn of Western civilization .
The focus on the 17th century application of the tally stick system in the UK as well as the focus of the transformation of London ’s goldsmiths to bankers is meant to establish from whence the idea of putting together a workable fiat money system stems .
This is an extremely important part of monetary history but is generally a less well known one .
The above historical recap was written to fill in some additional as well as essential information if one wants to understand how we arrived where we are today .
With that history lesson out of the way , let 's now address the question we asked at the top .
How did worthless objects come into widespread acceptance as money ?
Public Demand for Fiat Money
For a long time , States were forced to accept gold 's role as money .
The absurdity of introducing unbacked paper money was n't considered a viable avenue of robbing the citizenry .
Rather , heads of State resorted to ' clipping ' their coins or diluting their precious metals content if they wished to inflate .
These early instances of inflation via reduction of the precious metals content of coins were intimately connected to the downfall of entire empires – most famously , the Roman empire .
But along came Charles II , followed by John Law who had a brilliant idea for gaining public demand for fiat currency .
Demand for fiat money was created by its acceptance for payment of taxes .
What we have here , is really no less than the explanation for why pieces of paper with some ink slapped on them are not a priori laughed out of the room , as we proposed would happen with Pete ’s papyrus promises in paragraph one .
The demand for this paper is established by its acceptance for the payment of taxes .
The two major pillars of the system are based on coercion : directly via the legal tender laws ( which decree that fiat currency must be used / accepted for all payments of debt , public or private ) and indirectly via the value imputed to government debt which rests on the faith in the government ’s ability to extort enough future tax revenue to be able to repay its debt .
This latter point is extremely important for the system to function .
Government bonds are the tally sticks of our age , and serve as the main ‘ backing ’ of bank notes and their digital counterparts in circulation .
They are what is tying the government and the banking system together , via the central bank .
The central bank has the power to ‘ monetize ’ such debt by creating money out of thin air , however , this roundabout way of going about it is an essential part of the confidence game , the creation of the illusion of value .
Theft of Purchasing Power

( click on image for a better view )
Since the central bank ’s balance sheet is largely composed of government debt , it has an incentive to manage the public ’s ‘ inflation expectations ’ and inflate the currency as inconspicuously as possible .
This does of course not mean that the inflation racket is inhibited per se .
The theft has merely been organized in such a way that the people do n’t complain too much .
If the government had to actually raise taxes instead of borrowing the staggering sums of money it uses to keep its welfare / warfare programs running ( and keeping the vote buying mechanisms well oiled ) it would have to raise taxes by so much that it would face a rebellion .
Instead government resorts to inflation .
Inflation is nothing but a cleverly disguised tax and that is the real meaning of that last chart .

Those were princely sums in the 1940 ’s , but have become what he now calls ‘ chump change ’ .
Obviously this has n’t happened overnight although it can , as witnessed by Zimbabwe .
Rather the public has become used to and injured by the ‘ inflation tax ’ proceeding at what appears to be a snail ’s pace ( at least according to the government ’s official ‘ inflation data ’ , which is like the fox guarding the hen house ) .
It is of course not possible to measure an ‘ average price ’ of disparate goods , so this is just another part of an elaborate scam .
With the legal tender legislation in place , fiat money has also successfully put gold out of circulation .
After all , no one is going to use ‘ good money ’ for transactions when he has the choice of using ‘ bad money ’ instead .
Indeed , what has happened is that gold has increasingly shifted from the world ’s monetary bureaucracies into private hands , as a store of value .
On a global basis , only about 2.5 % of all official central bank reserves are in gold nowadays ( obviously , some countries have far larger percentages of their reserves in gold , most notably the US and many European countries – even so , these reserves pale in comparison to the amount of fiat money and credit they have issued ) .
Everyone is Happy
It is also important to note that although they are being subjected to a hidden tax , most citizens actually are quite happy with things as they are .
As Gary North has observed in a recent essay , everybody involved appears to be happy , the robbers as well as the robbed .
The banks are happy to be part of a cartel led by the central bank , which gives them immense latitude in indulging in consistent and flagrant over trading of their capital – spurred on by the moral hazard created by having a ‘ lender of last resort ’ at their disposal , with no restrictions on how much ‘ money ’ it can conjure up out of thin air ;
The politicians and the bureaucrats are happy because there is no restriction on their spending and there is nothing stopping them from buying votes or indulging in whatever ‘ pet projects ’ they happen to dream up .
And lastly , among the people who should actually rise in protest , there are large sub - groups that are either wards of the State and dependent on its largesse ( the shameful secret of the welfare state is that it makes irresponsible slaves out of previously free and responsible people ) , or have been seduced by the banking cartel ’s propaganda and amassed so much debt in the pursuit of consumption that they are quite happy to see money being devalued at a steady pace .
Wealth Producers Have No Say
In a nation of debtors , inflation is the politically most palatable form of monetary policy – after all , everybody is focused on the short term ( politicians and bureaucrats on their terms of office , consumers on their debt and their desire to buy more things they do n’t need with money they do n’t have , and so forth ) .
No one considers for a moment , that in the long run , this policy means ruin .
Over time , the middle and lower classes will see their real incomes and living standards shrink ever more , while the true beneficiaries of inflation – those who get first dibs on every dollop of newly created fiat money – amass more and more of the wealth that is stolen from its producers by inflation .
Not surprisingly , the small elite that actually profits from the fiat money system is quite content to take the long term view for itself .
The actual producers of wealth are a very small group , too small to have a decisive voice in how things should be run .
They would have to pull a John Galt type stunt and all go on strike if they wanted to exercise some pressure .
Unfortunately , big business is usually in bed with the State and also happy with the status quo .
One must always keep in mind that big corporations are generally not in favor of truly free , competitive markets .
They give lip service to the idea , but concurrently lobby for anti-competitive regulations all the time .
Decades of successful propaganda
The propagandistic effort in support of the fiat money system has been enormous over the decades , and has been extremely successful .
Left : Greenspan unlocks the secret of making fiat money " as good as gold " .
When Alan Greenspan told Ron Paul on occasion of his semi-annual testimony in Congress that he believed " we have had extraordinary success in replicating the features of a gold standard " he knew quite well that this was a bald - faced lie .
And yet , no one outside of Ron Paul would have even thought of questioning this absurd assertion .
As to why it is obviously a lie , consult the chart above .
The dollar has lost 96 % of its purchasing power since the Fed has been in business .
Let us also not forget that there still is a remnant of a market economy operating alongside the huge swathes of economic activity that have been appropriated by parasitic entities such as the State and its dependents .
It is this remnant that produces all of our wealth , in spite of the fiat money system .
It involuntarily supports the system ’s continued viability by doing what it does best – enhancing productivity , and thereby exerting downward pressure on the prices of goods and services ( which works against the upside pressure on prices created by monetary inflation ) .
This in a nutshell shows why the system ‘ seems ’ to work – and actually does work on a short term basis .
Economic Interventionism vs. the Free Market
Apologists of the current system tend to laud its " flexibility " .
In reality this argument is nothing more than an argument for economic interventionism which history proves time and time again can't work in the long haul .
Another commonly heard argument is : " If the economy is to grow , so must the supply of money " , as if that were immediately obvious .
In fact , most people who hear this sentence do believe it to be a truism .
In reality , increasing the supply of money confers no benefit whatsoever on society at large .
It is not important how much money one has in terms of number entries in one ’s bank account , it is important what this money can buy .
Did n't John Law 's experiment prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt ?
It is not 100 % certain that a modern free market economy would settle on gold as its money .
In fact , it is not important what would emerge as money .
What is important is that the decision on what should be used as money would be arrived at voluntarily by the collective actions of market participants .
That said , it seems highly likely that the previous historical period of trial and error that has led to the establishment of precious metals as money would still be accepted as having produced a satisfactory outcome by a modern free market economy .
After all , we know that gold trades in the marketplace as if it were money .
See Trotsky on Gold - Misconceptions about Gold for proof .
In a free market with a relatively stable supply of money , the supply and demand for money would still be subject to fluctuations similar to that for other goods , depending on time preferences .
The free market interest rate would at all times correctly signal to entrepreneurs what the state of time preferences was at a given point in time , allowing them to allocate capital in the most efficient manner .
A fiat money system with interest rates administered by a bureaucratic central economic planning agency meanwhile constantly sends wrong signals to entrepreneurs about expected future demand and the true cost of capital and thereby encourages malinvestment .
The phases during which credit expands and malinvestments proliferate are known as " economic booms " , and everybody loves them .
When the liquidation phase occurs , otherwise known as " busts " few people are aware that it is the preceding booms that are at fault .
And so the cry for more monetary and fiscal intervention arises , which lengthens and deepens the malaise by putting malinvested capital on artificial life support .
On the other hand , the free market tends to consistently lower the prices of goods and services over time .
That is the logical result of increasing productivity .
This is why the widely accepted tenet that we " need some inflation of the money supply to enable the economy to grow " is a complete lie .
Government mandated fiat currency simply does not work in the long run .
We have empirical evidence galore – every fiat currency in history has failed , except the present one , which has not failed yet .
Nonetheless , the current fiat system is more ingeniously designed than its predecessors and has a far greater amount of accumulated real wealth to draw sustenance from , so it will likely be relatively long lived at least as far as fiat money systems go .
How long can this one last ?
Bernanke shows us ...
" It will work this long . "
as good as gold
In a truly free market , fiat money would never come into existence .
And that is why Greenspan is wrong .
Governments can not create something " " .
History clearly shows that that only the real thing will do .

VALDOSTA , Ga. , October 24 , 2007 — Valdosta State University ( VSU ) has expelled student T. Hayden Barnes for publicly protesting the school ’s decision to construct two new parking decks on campus .
After VSU President Ronald M. Zaccari labeled Barnes a “ clear and present danger ” and mandated that Barnes submit certifications of his mental health and on - going therapy as conditions of his readmission to VSU , Barnes contacted the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) for help .
“ A kind of madness seems to be gripping our colleges , one in which merely claiming a student poses a ‘ threat ’— no matter how absurd or attenuated the allegation may be — is enough to punish even the most clearly protected speech , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ This case represents the extreme of this troubling trend .
Hayden Barnes did nothing wrong ; the claim that his speech was threatening is specious , and the university ’s decision to expel him is truly chilling . ”
VSU ’s student newspaper ran an article on March 22 , 2007 , outlining VSU ’s plans to spend $ 30 million of mandatory student fee money to build two new parking decks on campus .
Barnes — concerned with the environmental repercussions of the construction — posted flyers detailing potential alternatives and included contact information for Zaccari and the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia .
Barnes also emailed Zaccari , student and faculty governing bodies , and the Board of Regents detailing his concerns about the parking structures and proposing environmentally friendly options .
On March 26 , Barnes was informed by members of VSU ’s Students Against Violating the Environment ( SAVE ) that Zaccari was upset by his flyers .
In response , Barnes apologized to Zaccari and took the flyers down .
On April 13 , Barnes posted a collage of pictures on his Facebook.com page , including pictures of Zaccari , a parking deck , a bulldozer excavating trees , a flattened globe marked by a tire tread , automobile exhaust , a gas mask , an asthma inhaler , a public bus underneath the “ not allowed ” symbol , United States currency , and a photocopy of the Climate Change Statement of the American College & University Presidents ’ Climate Commitment .
The collage was also marked with a variety of captions , including “ No Blood for Oil , ” “ More Smog , ” “ Bus system that might have been , ” “ Climate change statement from President Zaccari , ” and “ S.A.V.E. — Zaccari Memorial Parking Garage , ” a sarcastic reference to concerns he says Zaccari had expressed in a meeting about his “ legacy ” as president of VSU .
Barnes also penned a letter to the editor of the VSU student paper about the proposed parking deck plans on April 19 and wrote to Zaccari on April 26 to ask for an exemption from the mandatory student fee designated for funding the parking garage construction .
According to VSU , Barnes also “ posted a link on his website page to an article discussing the massacre at Virginia Tech ” ; linked to an advertisement for a film competition sponsored by commercial photography site Webshots.com , which featured the tagline “ Shoot it .
Upload it .
Get famous .
Project Spotlight is looking for the next big thing .
Are you it ? ” ; and commented on his website that he was “ cleaning out and rearranging his room and thus , his mind , or so he hopes . ”
On May 7 , Barnes found a notice of administrative withdrawal from Zaccari underneath his dormitory door .
The notice informed Barnes that “ as a result of recent activities directed towards me by you , included [ sic ] but not limited to the attached threatening document [ the Facebook collage ] , you are considered to present a clear and present danger to this campus . ”
Barnes appealed Zaccari ’s decision on May 21 , including a letter of support from a faculty member and a clean bill of mental health from a psychiatrist .
After reviewing the appeal , the Board of Regents referred the case to an Administrative Law Judge for further hearing .
The Office of State Administrative Hearings ( OSAH ) now has jurisdiction over Barnes ’ appeal , and a hearing date has been set for November 26 .
Zaccari amazingly claims that Barnes ’ actions constituted “ a specific threat to his [ Zaccari ’s ] safety and a general threat to the safety of the campus . ”
According to VSU , on the basis of this perceived “ threat , ” Zaccari went so far as to spend taxpayer money to be “ accompanied to high - profile events by plain - clothed police officers , ” in addition to placing uniformed police officers on “ high alert . ”
Despite his alleged perception of Barnes as a “ clear and present danger , ” at no time did Zaccari see fit to notify the campus of the danger supposedly presented by Barnes .
FIRE wrote a letter to the Chancellor of the University System of Georgia , Erroll B. Davis , Jr. , explaining that Barnes has effectively been expelled for engaging in protected speech and has been denied due process rights .
“ VSU has punished a vocal student for peacefully protesting a university parking garage , ” Lukianoff said .
“ FIRE urges readers to look at the documentation of this case and ask whether a web ad , a blog link , and a barb about a ‘ memorial garage ’ really equaled a terror risk necessitating a student ’s immediate expulsion .
In its attempt to eliminate a student activist , the school has eliminated basic fairness , free speech , and due process . ”
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders , scholars , journalists , and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights , due process , freedom of expression , academic freedom , and rights of conscience at our nation ’s colleges and universities .

Japan 's tuna shortage spawns sushi panic
2007-06-25 04:00:00 PDT
Tokyo --
Sushi made with deer meat , anyone ?
How about a slice of raw horse on that rice ?
These are some of the most extreme alternatives being considered by chefs as shortages of tuna threaten to remove it from Japan 's sushi menus -- something as unthinkable as baseball without hot dogs in the United States .
In this seafood - crazed country , tuna is king .
From maguro to otoro , the Japanese seem to have almost as many words for tuna and its edible parts as the French have names for cheese .
So when global fishing bodies recently began lowering the limits on catches in the world 's rapidly depleting tuna fisheries , Japan fell into a national panic .
News shows ran reports of how higher prices were driving top - grade tuna off supermarket shelves and the revolving conveyer belts at sushi chain stores .
At nicer restaurants , sushi chefs began experimenting with substitutes , from cheaper varieties of fish to terrestrial alternatives and even , heaven forbid , U.S. sushi variations like avocado rolls .
" It 's like America running out of steak , " said Tadashi Yamagata , vice chairman of Japan 's national union of sushi chefs .
" Sushi without tuna just would not be sushi . "
The problem is the growing appetite for sushi and sashimi outside Japan , not only in the United States but also in newly wealthy countries like Russia , South Korea and China .
And the problem will not go away .
Fishing experts say the shortages and rising prices will only become more severe as the population of bluefin tuna -- the big , slow - maturing type most favored in sushi -- fails to keep up with demand .
Last year , dozens of nations responded by agreeing to reduce annual tuna catches in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea by 20 percent to stabilize populations .
But the decision only seemed to crystallize fears in Japan about tuna shortages , helping to push up prices of the three species of bluefin that are the best tuna to eat raw .
Since the start of last year , the average price of imported frozen northern and Pacific bluefin has risen more than a third , to $ 13 a pound , according to Japan 's Fisheries Agency .
Wholesalers say that competition from foreign fishing fleets and buyers has made the top-quality tuna increasingly hard to come by .
Tadashi Oono , who sells big red slabs of tuna from a Tokyo fish market , said that three years ago , he routinely sold two or three top - grade bluefin every day .
This year , he said , he sometimes finds only two or three tuna of that quality to sell in a month .
The tuna shortage is also having a more concrete effect on menus at Japanese sushi bars .
Fukuzushi in Tokyo is having a tougher time finding high - quality fish at reasonable prices .
The restaurant 's owner , Shigekazu Ozoe , 56 , said the current situation reminds him of the last time he had no tuna to sell -- in 1973 , during a scare over mercury poisoning in oceans .
At that time , he tried to find other red-colored substitutes like smoked deer meat and raw horse , a local delicacy in some parts of Japan .
" We tasted it , and horse sushi was pretty good , " he recalled .
" It was soft , easy to bite off , had no smell . "
Group hopes to ' flood the Oval Office ' with 25,000 copies of the Constitution Katie Baker

Print This Email This Even though a human rights group believes the Commander in Chief has been naughty , they plan to play Santa Claus this year and make a political statement at the same time .
The Center for Constitutional Rights plans to " flood the Oval Office with copies of the Constitution this holiday season ... as a seasonal reminder that the Constitution needs to be upheld ; not destroyed . "
Those interested can also sign an accompanying letter addressed to President Bush , which poses a multitude of questions reminding the president " that he swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States . "
" I would have hoped that you'd be pretty familiar with [ the Constitution ] already , " writes the anonymous author , " because you have at least three times in your life taken a solemn oath to uphold , protect and defend it , but all the signs indicate that you either do n't know what 's in it , or you do n't care . "
The diatribe covers controversial topics such as habeas corpus and torture , and beseeches the President to " uphold , protect and defend [ the Constitution ] , like you swore you would . "
Interested parties can donate money to help cover costs if they wish , but the offer itself is completely free .
The CCR hopes to send the President more than 25,000 copies of the Constitution by January 2008 .

HE HAS been in the Senate for less than two years , a junior senator from Illinois who has virtually no national political record and whose seven years in the Illinois state legislature were unremarkable .
Yet when Barack Obama admitted on a Sunday talk show that he was considering a run for president in 2008 , the news led virtually every television news bulletin , and in Washington there was talk of little else .
He did not announce he would run , but only that he no longer ruled out running .
" Given the responses I 've been getting over the last several months , I have thought about the possibility , but I have not thought about it with the seriousness and depth that I think is required , " he said .
A cockroach community recently had its collective mind changed — by a group of tiny robots .
Certain animals engage in what ’s known as self - organization .
Picture a school of fish or a flock of birds .
Scientists have been researching autonomous robot systems based on this concept .
What about mixed groups of , say , bots and bugs ?
A paper detailing this new animal - robot cooperation was published in the November 16 issue of Science .
First , cockroaches were left alone in an area with two choices of shelter .
After scurrying around , the group chose the darker shelter .
Then came the robots .
They look nothing like cockroaches .
In fact , they more closely resemble tiny trucks .
But apparently they smelled enough like roaches to trick the insects .
The robo-roaches were trained to prefer the lighter shelter .
They behaved like roaches , and eventually convinced the group to choose the lighter shelter in more than half the trials .
But the robots sometimes were convinced by the roaches , too .
In 40 percent of the trials , they joined the real - live roaches , and the group chose the darker shelter .
The work signals a new app - “ roach ” for future research in animal - machine collaboration .

Via Newsweek :
The nation ’s biggest telecommunications companies , working closely with the White House , have mounted a secretive lobbying campaign to get Congress to quickly approve a measure wiping out all private lawsuits against them for assisting the U.S. intelligence community ’s warrantless surveillance programs .
The campaign — which involves some of Washington 's most prominent lobbying and law firms — has taken on new urgency in recent weeks because of fears that a U.S. appellate court in San Francisco is poised to rule that the lawsuits should be allowed to proceed .
If that happens , the telecom companies say , they may be forced to terminate their cooperation with the U.S. intelligence community — or risk potentially crippling damage awards for allegedly turning over personal information about their customers to the government without a judicial warrant .

First , a word about which time frame to use when describing this expansion .
According to the National Bureau of Economic Analysis , the trough of the last recession occurred in November 2001 .
However , the Bush administration has repeatedly used the spring of 2003 as the starting point of the expansion for the simple reason this is when their second wave of tax cuts was implemented .
The Republicans slavish devotion to the mantra of " tax cuts pay for themselves " requires them to move goalposts whenever it suits their political ends .
However , there are several reasons why using the Republican ’s measure is wrong .
First , the Republicans completely forget they passed tax cuts in 2001 which failed to provide the panacea they promised .
The bill started cutting tax rates in 2002 – not 2003 as many commenters have claimed .
In fact , tax revenues decreased after the passage of this bill from $ 994.3 billion in 2001 to $ 793.7 billion in 2003 .
In addition , the Republican argument that their tax cuts are completely responsible for post 2003 growth completely ignores the impact of interest rate policy in the national economy .
As this chart shows :
The Fed started cutting the Fed Funds rate in 2001 , lowering it near 0 % by the end of 2001 .
Standard economic analysis gives interest rate cuts a lag time of 12 - 18 months .
That means these cuts had their maximum impact in the Spring of 2003 when the economy started to really take - off .
But finally , let ’s look at the " explosion in tax revenue " the Republicans claim their tax cuts generate .
Here is a chart from the St. Louis Federal Reserve which shows the year - over - year percent change in tax receipts .
Notice that in the 1980s and 2000s there is no meaningful difference in the percentage change in tax receipts when compared to non – supply – side policy years .
In other words , supply - side tax cuts do n’t provide a meaningful difference in tax receipts when compared to non-supply side years .
Now that I ’ve spent far too much time debunking the latest Republican lies about the economy ( one of the joys of living in a talk radio fact free world ) , let ’s move on to the reason this is the worst economy of a generation .
At the center of this issue is the incredibly weak job growth of this expansion .
Here is a chart that breaks down job growth of the last 5 expansions into a per month figure .
Notice that this expansion has the worst record by far .
Here are two other charts from the Big Picture which show the weakness of job growth .
This chart shows the percent growth of jobs for months 29 - 78 of the last four business expansions .
This is the range of months where we are currently in the latest cycle .
This chart shows job growth in the last business cycles that lasted at least as long as the one we are in now .
The bottom line is clear – this expansion ranks last in job creation by a wide margin .
And weak job growth has lead to weak wage growth .
Here is a chart from the Census Bureau that shows real median wage growth for the last 25 years .
Notice that median income is down for this expansion .
Let ’s stop right here because at this point we have a lot of information that explains public concern about the economy .
First , the economy just is n’t creating that many jobs when compared to other expansions .
That leads to factor number two – declining median family income .
When you put those two factors together you get unhappy people .
Jobs are n’t as plentiful as they were in previous expansions and people are n’t getting raises .
That alone is enough to cause widespread discontent .
This is why this " greatest story never told " ( according to Larry Kudlow ) polls so poorly with people .
The Republicans are convinced they need better PR .
But their PR does n’t stack up to what people are seeing on the ground around them and in their bank accounts .
And no amount of PR is going to turn that situation around .

Twenty years ago , the term " micromanagement " was a term used to demean Jimmy Carter for being too involved in the minutiae of White House operations .
My how that term has grown .
These days , Bush and the Roadblock Republicans are pulling out the term for any attempt by Congress to influence actions in Iraq , even those that involve the movement of more than a hundred thousand troops over the space of months .
Micro has gone Macro .
But whatever prefix you put in front of it , the American people have a different idea about who should manage the war .
As the president and Congress move toward a possible constitutional confrontation over the war , both receive negative marks from the public for their handling of the situation in Iraq .
But by a large margin , Americans trust the Democrats rather than the president to find a solution to a conflict that remains enormously unpopular .
And more than six in 10 in the new poll said Congress should have the final say on when to bring the troops home .
And by 2 - 1 , Americans said Congress rather than the president should have the final decision about deciding when to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq .
Even nearly three in 10 Republicans side with Congress over the president on this question .
There 's another source that 's interesting in its take on who can " micromanage " the troops .

A French television presenter has sued Microsoft for " violation of intellectual property " .
Philippe Gildas accused the software publisher of illegally using the trademark " Vista " .
Gildas registered the Vista in October 2003 .
This was two years before Microsoft registered its Windows Vista trademark with the INPI ( French National Institute for Intellectual Property ) .
Windows Vista - the definitive review
Philippe Gildas had registered the Vista trademark for a television channel aimed at senior citizens , Télé Vista , which was to have launched in 2003 .
The Télé Vista project was delayed , but is now coming to fruition , with plans to launch the channel later this year .
Gildas sees Microsoft 's hogging of the limelight with its new Vista operating system as an obstacle to that launch , and so he decided to sue , arguing that he registered the Vista trademark " in all entertainment and media categories : press , television , web and so on . "
Mac , Windows or Linux - what will you next operating system be ?
As in other jurisdictions , French trademark law recognises rights to the use of trademark only in certain categories of activity , allowing , say , a baker of baguettes , an onion - selling cyclist and a maker of berets to use the same trademark in their respective domains .
Gildas has indeed registered the Vista trademark in categories 35 , 38 and 41 , which covers the entertainment and media categories he cited .
However , he did not register it in categories 9 and 42 , covering software and the design and development of computers and software , the areas relevant to Microsoft 's operating system .
Given that the trademarks registered by Gildas and Microsoft are in different categories , it may be difficult for him to argue his case .
Extremely drug resistant TB , or XDR - TB , is a serious problem in India , according to a study presented at the American Thoracic Society 2007 International Conference , on Monday , May 21 .
The study , the first in India to look at the prevalence of XDR - TB , found this type of TB accounts for 8 % of multi- drug - resistant cases , compared with about 4 % in the United States .
MDR - TB ( multi - drug resistant TB ) describes strains of tuberculosis that are resistant to at least the two first - line TB drugs , isoniazid and rifampicin .
XDR - TB is MDR - TB that is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second - line drugs .
XDR - TB leaves patients ( including many people living with HIV ) virtually untreatable using currently available anti-TB drugs .
Recent findings from a survey conducted by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that XDR - TB has been identified in all regions of the world but occurs most frequently in the countries of the former Soviet Union and in Asia .
Sushil Jain of the Hinduja National Hospital in Mumbai , India , and colleagues examined 3,904 lab samples at their hospital , and found that 1,274 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis .
Of these , 32 % were found to be MDR - TB , out of which 8 % were XDR - TB .
Tuberculosis can infect many sites in the body but most commonly affects the lungs .
All XDR - TB cases were in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis , or TB found in the lungs , which can be spread by coughing , sneezing , laughing or singing .
Repeated exposure to someone with TB disease is generally necessary for infection to take place .
The death rate of XDR - TB patients in the study was 42 % , which Dr. Jain calls " alarmingly high . "
" An important finding was that the majority of patients with XDR - TB were of younger age group ( their average age was 30 years ) , thus posing a major threat to our economically productive population , " Dr. Jain notes .
" Serious efforts are needed to tackle this deadly disease which may become a global emergency . "
Dr. Jain says that XDR - TB has long existed in India but has been under - recognized and under - treated .
" Most labs in India are not equipped to perform drug susceptibility tests so exact prevalence is difficult to ascertain , and treatment in the absence of reliable sensitivity reports is difficult .
Compounding the problem is the huge costs of treating these most difficult TB patients , " he said .

Contrary to how it may feel in the morning , recent research suggests smoking may reduce the effects of alcohol - nicotine may prevent the passage of alcohol into the intestine where it 's easily absorbed .
In the long run , the scientists say this will harm drinkers , who will have to consume more to get the desired effect .
But it provides a scientific basis for a belief long - cherished by some smokers - that their vice was ameliorating their other vice .
How about other pieces of conventional wisdom about drinking ?
DRINK ON A FULL STOMACH
It 's the classic piece of advice meted out in a nation where binge - drinking is next in the charts after Godliness and cleanliness - get something down you before you go out .
Dr Guy Ratcliffe , medical director of the Medical Council on Alcoholism , says the evidence suggests that drinking on an empty stomach appears to make you more drunk .
A fine drop will still get you drunk
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians , says the effects of drinking on an empty stomach are dramatically different , adding that health is best served by slow drinking .
Eating rich or fatty food before drinking delays the rate of " gastric emptying " .
Some alcohol is absorbed through the stomach , but the key place is the small intestine .
If the booze is n't getting there as quickly , your body has a much better time processing it .
SOME DRINKS MAKE YOU MORE HUNGOVER
Not all alcoholic drinks are the same .
There 's different strengths , different types of alcohol and , importantly for a hangover 's magnitude , what manufacturers call congeners - the chemicals that add flavour , smell and colour .
Many are toxic , as alcohol is .
Intersperse hard drinks with soft
And the long - standing belief that a bottle of Petrus or Margaux is less likely than , say , Bulgarian plonk , to leave an angry armadillo nesting in your head , may have some validity as fine wines are thought to contain fewer of these chemicals .
" The so - called congeners almost certainly do contribute to the hangover , " Prof Gilmore adds .
DRINK WATER BEFORE GOING TO BED
We all know this one .
After a heavy night , there 's nothing less appetising than a couple of pints of water .
But those who force these down swear their hangover is lessened the next morning .
Both Dr Ratcliffe and Prof Gilmore agree that the science backs up your mother .
Hangovers are in great part dehydration .
The body is using water as it processes the alcohol .
By the time you wake up you may have used too much .
Thinking ahead the night before will help .
Interspersing drinks with glasses of water is recommended .
FIZZY DRINKS MAKE YOU MORE DRUNK
" Champagne goes straight to my head , " goes the refrain , and the explanation for many a story of bad behaviour at weddings .
It 's a piece of wisdom that makes it onto a government website on drinking , although the scientific reasoning behind it is not obvious .
Prof Gilmore says : " I do n't know of any evidence but it 's a common observation .
It may be that champagne is usually drunk on an empty stomach . "
Dr Ratcliffe is a bit more confident .
" It does seem that bubbles do increase the rate of alcohol absorption , " he says .
" You may inhale some bubbles in the air you breathe . "
HAIR OF THE DOG THAT BIT YOU
It does n't take a scientist to warn that a couple of pints at 8 am the morning after the night before is not a realistic long - term plan at hangover avoidance .
" It is very much a slippery slope and a very strong indicator of alcohol dependence to drink as an eye - opener , " says Prof Gilmore .
" Drinking on a hangover will dull the pain but it is an extremely dangerous manoeuvre . "
Per the " fizzy drinks " entry : carbonation of any sort stimulates the pyloric sphincter ( stomach to gut connection ) to open , which leads to more rapid absorption via the small intestine whether it 's beer , champs , or even soda .
Shots of undiluted hard liquor ( especially if it 's iced ) will actually make the stomach seize up and will be absorbed more slowly .

You forgot the one about not mixing your drinks .
I only drink red wine
White wine has different chemicals and for me the two do not mix .
I think we should avoid having different drinks in the same evening .
We dont know just how bad it is for our health creating these chemical cocktails .

Three satsumas before going to bed = no hangover !!

I disagree with Prof Gilmore , drinking on a hangover is not a slippery slope at all ; it 's more of a dizzy helter skelter of fun .

Flat Cola ( stir it with a spoon ) and Extra Strong Mints make for a great hangover cure .
It replenishes liquids without making you feel sick and the mints settle the stomach as well as freshening your breath .

Take milk thistle tablets before you start drinking .
I swear this really works .
being a hardened drinker from the Highlands , I should know !!!

My father always told me to " never mix the grape and the grain " - and he 's quite right !
As for curing a hangover , it is mainly down to rehydrating and replacing last sugars in the body .
Although a fruit salad will be the last thing most people want ( I usually hanker after a bacon sandwich ) , it really does the trick .
Think oranges , kiwis , melon - nice juicy fruits .

Drinking alcohol through a straw makes you drunk quicker - true , alcohol has a lower boiling point than water .
In a vacuum even water " boils " at room temperature .
By using a straw you create a vacuum in the mouth - the alcohol boils and vaporises within the vacuum and is thus quickly and easily absorbed through the well blood supplied membranes of the mouth and hence straight to the brain .

Champagne almost certainly does make you drunk quicker - and it is all down to the bubbles !
There was a scietific study contacted by the human psychopharmacology unit at the University of Surrey in Guildford in 2001 .
The study was as follows : champagne was given to 12 volunteers - half drank fizzy champagne and the other half had flat champagne , purged of its bubbles beforehand with a whisk .
The following week , she repeated the experiment but gave each volunteer the opposite kind of champagne to the previous time .
That way , everyone tried both types of wine .
Each person drank two glasses of champagne per session .
With the exact intake adjusted o that everyone drank the same amount of alcohol per kilogram of body mass .
The results ?
Well , alcohol levels rose much faster among the bubbly drinkers .
After just five minutes , they had an average of 0.54 milligrams of alcohol per millilitre of blood .
Those drinking flat champagne averaged just 0.39 milligrams of alcohol .
At the end of the experiment , the bubbly drinkers were visibly worse for wear .
Some could hardly write apparently !!

N - acetyl - cysteine ( NAC ) works well , and is available at vitamin stores in the USA ( not sure about the UK ) .
It is a biochemical pre-cursor for a molecule in liver cells called glutathione , which you use a lot of when detoxifying alcohol and other harmful chemicals .
Two x 500 mg caplets of NAC before going out or even before going to bed , seems to work wonders for a hangover .

I swear by a banana and honey milkshake .
Banana for the potassium to help the headache , honey for the sugar to aid the shakes , and milk for the alkali to settle the stomach acid .
Stick it all in a blender and it's like a gift from the gods .

Pint of water and a Berocca before bed .
Pint of water , Paracetamol and Berocca when you get up .
Bacon sandwich on the way in to work .
Genius - works every time .

I find Neurofen works wonders , but it must be taken before drinking .
It 's for preventing a hangover rather than curing it .
