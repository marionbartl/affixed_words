Economist , blogger , haiku writer and Belgium 's PM for less than a year The EU 's first permanent president , Belgian Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy , is a camera - shy man who has been catapulted from relative obscurity .
After his selection at a Brussels summit , he stressed his credentials as a consensus politician and made it clear he would fulfil the role of a chairman rather than a globe - trotting statesman .
His tasks include liaising with EU leaders and arranging the bloc 's annual summits .
He says tackling climate change and lowering EU unemployment rates are among his priorities .
The centre - right leader has a reputation as a good negotiator with a self - deprecating sense of humour , which helped him to hold together a fractious coalition government at home .
Shortly after his presidential appointment was announced , the 62 - year - old drily remarked on previous US complaints about the EU lacking a central go - to figure .
" I 'm anxiously awaiting the first phone call , " he said .
But his appointment may be bad news for Belgium 's troubled coalition of Dutch - and French - speaking parties , which could fall apart without his careful stewardship .
In linguistically divided Belgium , he is seen as a unifying force , taking an even - handed approach to resolving conflicts - a skill that is expected to serve him well in Europe 's top job .
Focus on federalism Mr Van Rompuy has pledged to be discreet in his new role .
He is little known outside Belgium and has attended only two European summits .
Turkey is not a part of Europe and will never be part of Europe
Herman Van Rompuy
Speaking as an opposition politician
With such a limited international reputation , critics say he will struggle to command attention when he travels on behalf of Europe .
But his modest demeanour belies outspoken political beliefs .
An avowed federalist , he has called for national symbols within the EU to be replaced by European symbols .
He has also called for a tax on financial transactions within the bloc to fund the EU .
A veteran politician from Belgium 's Flemish Christian Democrat party , he has been outspoken in the past in opposition to Turkey joining the EU .
He warned it could dilute Europe 's Christian heritage .
" Turkey is not a part of Europe and will never be part of Europe , " he said as an opposition politician five years ago .
" The universal values which are in force in Europe , and which are fundamental values of Christianity , will lose vigour with the entry of a large Islamic country such as Turkey . "
Haiku writer Mr Van Rompuy was originally reluctant to take on the post of Belgian prime minister at the end of 2008 .
He replaced Yves Leterme , who resigned amid a financial scandal last December after just nine months in the job .
Riven by post-election squabbling , Belgium had already been through two prime ministers in 12 months and seemed in danger of splitting apart , due to the arguments over devolution plans between the Dutch - and French - speaking parties .
Three waves roll
Along the harbour
The trio's home
EU Trio-presidency
Herman Van Rompuy haiku
Something of a moderate in Belgium 's increasingly polarised politics , Mr Van Rompuy was eventually persuaded to take on the job by Belgian King Albert II .
He was appointed prime minister , having held the position of president of the lower house of parliament since July 2007 .
The trained economist inherited a fragile government coalition and a nation facing a global economic crisis that had crippled Belgian banking giant Fortis .
He had previously served as budget minister in the Christian Democrat - led government from 1993 to 1999 , during which time he took a tough stance on balancing the books , drastically reducing the country 's public debt .
Before that , Mr Van Rompuy was leader of the Flemish Christian Democrats between 1988 and 1993 .
He has penned several books - mainly on social and political issues - and is also an avid blogger and haiku writer .
He is said to sometimes compose the 17 - syllable Japanese - style poems during political meetings and has been known to read out his compositions at such gatherings .
One offering on Mr Van Rompuy 's website is called EU Trio - presidency , but any message therein about his political ambitions is well concealed : " Three waves roll Along the harbour The trio 's home . "
National pride Before his appointment , people on the streets of Brussels voiced mixed emotions about the prospect of their prime minister becoming Europe 's figurehead .
A sense of national pride was countered by one of foreboding about how Belgium 's government would cope without him .
A poll by Euronews found respondents in the capital reluctant to lose a peace - maker " indispensable in keeping the peace between the different communities " .
" It would be a pity , " said one resident .
" It would mean political instability in Belgium .
A good thing for Europe a bad thing for Belgium ! "
Before entering politics , Mr Van Rompuy worked at the Belgian central bank from 1972 to 1975 .
One of a family of politicians , his younger brother , Eric Van Rompuy , is also a politician for the CD&V , while his sister , Christine Van Rompuy , is a member of the Workers Party of Belgium .
Herman Van Rompuy is married with four children .

" I hated level 40 , " she said with a sigh .
It was the first time we 'd spoken in eight years , and she had never forgotten the night I spurned her advances in favor of gaining a level in EverQuest .

During the course of my tenure at Kotaku I 've referenced my days in EverQuest on many occasions , but I 've never elaborated on what went down back then .
Recent events in my life have brought that period to the fore , and I 've decided to share my experience with our readers .
In November of 2000 , my life was going well .
I had a lovely girlfriend , a serviceable vehicle , and a job that paid more than enough for me to survive while catering to my increasingly expensive video game habit .
Within four months , it would all be gone .

Good Intentions
At the time I was sharing an apartment with a friend of mine named Dustin .
Dustin was a great guy , but he spent his entire downtime sitting in front of his computer , playing a video game called EverQuest .
I had encountered the game before , having participated in the beta for Sony Online Entertainment 's massively popular multiplayer game , but once the game went live I lost interest .
I just could n't see myself paying a monthly fee just to play a computer game .
Oh , how things have changed .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Having nothing much else to do at the time , I 'd sit and watch Dustin play .
He 'd explain what his Monk character was doing in the game .
I was a spectator as he progressed , learning to feign death , earning new weapons , and taking on greater challenges as he got closer and closer to the level cap .
So when I was n't spending time with my girlfriend , Emily , I would watch Dustin play .
Or I would tool around on various text - based MUSHes and MOOs online , role - playing with people all over the world .
I 'd been into science fiction , fantasy , and comic books since I was very young , so slipping into an imaginary world came easy to me .
Perhaps a little too easy .
Advertisement
Towards the end of 2000 , Emily and I broke up .
The reasoning behind this is far too stupid to delve into …let 's just say we were both young and a bit foolish .
I became depressed , and Dustin had just the thing to cheer me up .
The Scars of Velious expansion for EverQuest came out in December of 2000 .
My roommate , perhaps tired of my moping over my lost love , picked up a copy of the game for me as a Christmas present .
I installed it , created a half - elven Bard , and soon our apartment had two guys in the living room at all hours of the day , faces bathed in the glow of monitors .
Advertisement
Within a week , the game that had n't affected me at all nearly two years previously had become an important part of my life .
Soon , it would become my life .
If I was n't asleep or at work , I was playing EverQuest .
The former was becoming a rarity .
I would go into work , and I would still hear the sounds of EverQuest orcs in my head .
All I had to do was close my eyes and I was speeding through the Greater Faydark zone , killing pixies and turning in quest items .

In January of 2001 , a man with a tow truck came to my place of employment and took my car away .
I had fallen behind on payments without realizing it , and Nissan had decided they wanted my Sentra back .
My first thought as I watched the tow truck drive away was how many hours walking to and from work would take from my EverQuest time .
I worked at a company called FranchiseOpportunities.com , maintaining and creating websites , but increasingly my time there was spent either communicating with my EverQuest friends or browsing websites for tips on the best equipment and techniques for grinding experience points and gold .
It was impossible for my co-workers not to notice .
In February of 2001 , Joseph Lunsford , the owner of the company , called me into his office .
Advertisement
" It was n't an easy decision , " Lunsford told me this month when I went to see him and talk to him about the person I used to be .
" You were was amazingly bright .
I was convinced there was n't anything you could n't do .
You showed so much promise , but your interest in work just fell off .
Projects started taking longer to get done , and it was obvious your head was n't in it .
You left me no choice . "
I was in tears back then .
I felt unbelievably pathetic .
I had no car .
I had no job .
Joe had handed me my last paycheck and about $ 120 he had in his wallet , and sent me on my way .
I took a taxi home , broke the news to my roommates ( we had moved into a three - bedroom to split the bills three ways ) , went into my bedroom , started up EverQuest , and forgot about everything .

According to Dr. Hilarie Cash , the executive director of the reSTART internet and gaming addition recovery program and co-author of the book " Video Games & Your Kids : How Parents Stay in Control , " retreating inside a video game to avoid real world problems is a common cause of " video game addiction . "
" I would definitely call it video game addiction , which is a subset of internet addiction .
Many of the things [ you ] described to me are typical of a video game addict , particularly the way that real life shrinks away for the addict , living more and more in the virtual world . "
Advertisement
And that 's exactly what I was doing .
I had been a confident and outgoing young man who enjoyed hanging out with my friends , spending hours chatting about absolutely nothing while smoking cigarettes and drinking countless cups of Waffle House Coffee .
Now my social dealings involved helping online friends camp a rare monster spawn , or discussing class balance on my guild 's chat channel .
Going outside was only necessary when I ran out of smokes or beverages .
I lived off $.30 pot pies from Wal - Mart and cheap bags of rice .
I was taking care of my most essential needs , but only barely .
Often times I would fall asleep in my chair in front of my computer with EverQuest running , waking up hours later to start the cycle all over again .
Advertisement
Even now my memories of the period are a blur of Oasis runs , power leveling , and experience grinding .
My mother remembers those days much more vividly .
" Mike was unavailable for most of that period , " she recalled recently .
" There was no way to contact him , except to do a ' drive by ' preferably with a bag of groceries in the back seat .
I remember trying to talk to him .
Such a fine mind and wild sense of humor ; all covered up and hidden deep inside again .
He listened half - heartedly and was easy to anger .
He was going down fast , even to the point of telling how it really was and not just what you wanted to hear . "
Advertisement
Hearing her talk about it now , I can barely believe it had gotten so bad , but I tend to hold on to positive memories more than the negative ones .
Like the day Emily came back .
Brief Hope
It was three months after I was fired that Emily decided to give us another chance .
I was n't the same man she had been with before .
I was relatively skinny , and my hair had grown ridiculously long .
As we lay curled up in bed one evening she commented on how my belly had disappeared , which tickled me to no end .
It seems perverse to me now .
It was n't as if I had been dieting or exercising ; I was taking pride in my own malnourishment .
Advertisement
My existence slowly started gaining some semblance of a real life again .
Emily went out one afternoon and brought me a stack of job applications , which motivated me to go out , get my hair cut , and go to my first job interview at a Fast Signs down the street .
Looking slightly more human and feeling more alive than I had in months , I got the job on the spot .
It was amazing how fast things had turned around .
Unfortunately , it would n't last .
In an odd twist , my EverQuest friends were now worried about me .
I had n't been around , and they missed my sense of humor and my enthusiasm .
My ability to twist four Bard songs at a time did n't hurt either .
These people needed me .
I was important to them , and I could n't let them down .
Looking back , I can't believe I missed the irony there .
Advertisement
So I started playing EverQuest again .
At first it was only on the nights that Emily could n't make it over , but soon I was back to my regular play schedule – every waking hour .
I was regularly late to work , and called in sick at least once every two weeks so I could stay home and play .
Then came that fateful night .
The woman I had once told was the love of my life was sitting undressed in my bed not a foot away from my computer desk , begging me to join her , and I kept putting it off .
I was so close to level 40 I could taste it .
I was in the Dreadlands , kiting large enemies back and forth , killing them slowly with my Bard songs .
I still remember the urgency I felt , along with the annoyance that this woman was trying to keep me from reaching my goal .
Could n't she understand how important this was to me ?
Advertisement
She had certainly tried .
" Back then I just figured I was dating a gamer , and that 's how it was going to be , " she said to me recently .
" I had n't dated many guys at that point , and my older brother was the same way .
He worked , came home , and played video games . "
Advertisement
Eight years later it became obvious that my lack of attention toward her weighed far more heavily than either of us had suspected .
One morning in late September of 2001 , I called my job and quit .
Whatever justification I had for this at the time does n't matter .
The reason I quit was because I was tired of making excuses for being late , and I just wanted to play EverQuest .
Advertisement
Emily and I had grown further apart .
During my time at Fast Signs I purchased an old car from my sister , only to discover I could n't get insurance for it due to my driver 's license being suspended over a previous ticket , ironically issued for driving without insurance .
Rather than actively working to fix the problem , I slipped deeper into depression .
I would let Emily take the car , driving it with a " TAG APPLIED FOR " plate on the back , but would n't go anywhere with her for fear of being pulled over and sent to jail .
Instead , I would stay home and play EverQuest .
The last time I would see her — until 2009 — was two days after her birthday in early October .
I had let her take the car to her party , but refused to go with her .
She reacted by keeping my car for two days without contacting me .
I responded by telling her to return the car and the keys and get out of my life .
She did just that .
Advertisement
And I kept playing .
A New Beginning
December rolled around again , one year after I had taken my first steps into EverQuest 's world of Norrath , and I had completely changed .
I went from being a strong independent person to a gaunt , unshaven , unshowered recluse , completely withdrawn from the outside world .
Advertisement
My roommate , once one of my greatest friends , was threatening to throw me out of the apartment if I did n't find a job .
But I had absolutely no motivation .
The only time I left my dwelling was to scavenge for food at my parents ' house , or to grab a quick shower , as our apartment 's hot water had been turned off .
I remember feeling like a ghost , drifting through the waking world unnoticed .
Luckily for me , my mother was looking out for me as best she could .
Advertisement
" He did n't look like Mike anymore , " she remembers now .
" He was scary and pitiful .
I was afraid he was suicidal or dying of some mysterious disease .
It broke my heart and I knew that coming home and taking the pressure off would be the best medicine for him . "
And so on January 1st , 2002 , at the age of 28 , I moved back in with my parents .
It was n't an instant cure for my addiction – as soon as I convinced them to let me order DSL I was back online again – but something had changed .
I started spending more time hanging out with my parents and less time sitting in my computer chair staring at little computer people doing little computer things .
I had responsibilities .
I had a support system .
I had a stable platform to launch myself from instead of the quicksand I felt I had been standing in before .
Advertisement
Within two months I had found myself a job at a local gas station .
Later that year I started speaking with Joe Lunsford again , proving myself through contract work until he decided to hire me on again in 2003 .
So I once again had a job , a girlfriend , and eventually my own apartment , sans roommates .
That 's where I was in 2006 , when Brian Crecente contacted me and asked me if I wanted to write for Kotaku .
That 's where I am now .
It would be easy for me to pin my problems on EverQuest , and society in general would accept it without question .
I could say I fell prey to an addictive video game that nearly ruined my life , but I would know that was n't the case .
Advertisement
I hid .
I ran from my problems , hiding away in a virtual fantasy world instead of confronting the issues that might have been easily resolved if I had addressed them directly .
As far as I am concerned , the only thing Sony Online Entertainment is guilty of is creating a damn good hiding place .
It was my responsibility to control how much I played , and the SOE spokesperson I contacted regarding my story agrees .
" EverQuest is a game , " the Sony Online rep told me .
" The majority of the hundreds of thousands of subscribers play the game in moderation enjoying the gameplay as well as the community interaction the game provides .
As with any form of entertainment , it is the responsibility of each individual player to monitor his or her own playing habits and prioritize his or her time as necessary .
It is not our place to monitor or limit how individuals spend their free time . "
Advertisement
Dr. Hilarie Cash agrees as well , though she suspects that game developers are actively engaged in trying to make their games more addictive .
" Some blame can be laid at the feet of developers , making a conscious effort to make their games more addictive .
It 's analogous to the tobacco industry , trying to make tobacco more addictive .
It works to their benefit .
That having been said , it 's up to the individual to take responsibility for how they play . "
Advertisement
During our conversation , Dr. Cash also likened gaming to gambling .
Some people can walk into a casino , lose $ 5 , and call it quits .
You have to know your own limits , and be conscious enough of them to know when you are in danger of going too far .
My own solution to my potential for MMO addiction is rather simple .
I 've managed to turn a habit that once interrupted my work into something I actively have to do for work .
It 's no longer escapism if I am doing my job .
Perhaps I am fooling myself , but if I am going to be that gullible I might as well take advantage .

As for Emily , she 's sitting behind me as I type this , playing Peggle .
I 'd ask her to come to bed , but I know how important getting to that next level can be .

In a stinging setback for the national gay - rights movement , Maine voters narrowly decided to repeal the state ’s new law allowing same - sex marriage .
With 87 percent of precincts reporting early Wednesday morning , 53 percent of voters had approved the repeal , ending an expensive and emotional fight that was closely watched around the country as a referendum on the gay - marriage movement .
Polls had suggested a much closer race .
Maine voters also decided to expand the state ’s 10 - year - old medical marijuana law , approving a ballot question to allow state - regulated dispensaries to grow the drug and sell it to patients .
The vote came weeks after the Obama administration announced it would not prosecute patients and distributors who are in “ clear and unambiguous ” compliance with state laws .
Maine will be the third state , after New Mexico and Rhode Island , to allow tightly regulated , nonprofit marijuana dispensaries .
With the repeal of the same - sex marriage law , Maine became the 31st state to reject same - sex marriage at the ballot box .
Five other states  Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , New Hampshire and Vermont  have legalized same - sex marriage , but only through court rulings and legislative action .
Oxfam says communities need long - term help to withstand the crisis The Ethiopian government has asked the international community for emergency food aid for 6.2 million people .
The request came at a meeting of donors to discuss the impact of a prolonged drought affecting parts of East Africa .
The UN's World Food Programme says $ 285 m ( £ 173 m ) will be needed in the next six months .
Some aid officials say the numbers of hungry could rise .
Aid agency Oxfam has called for a new approach to tackling the risk of disaster in the country .
Drought costs $ 1.1 bn a year 70 % of humanitarian aid from US 6.2 m need emergency food aid 7.5 m others chronically food insecure Sources : WFP / Oxfam
1985 : Live Aid makes millions Famine stalks Ethiopia once again
In a report marking 25 years since the famine that killed around one million Ethiopians , Oxfam said that imported food aid saves lives in the short term but did little to help communities withstand the next shock .
The report , named Band Aids and Beyond , called on international donors to adopt a new approach focused on preparing communities to prevent and deal with disasters before they strike .
" Drought does not need to mean hunger and destitution , " said Penny Lawrence , Oxfam 's international director , who has just returned from Ethiopia .
" If communities have irrigation for crops , grain stores , and wells to harvest rains then they can survive despite what the elements throw at them . "
' Total wipe - out ' Ethiopia has been hit by the food crisis affecting a large part of East Africa and the Horn .
ANALYSIS Martin Plaut , Africa analyst
There is no doubt poor and erratic rains have hit the Ethiopian harvest .
But large parts of the country have not been hit by drought .
So why the current crisis ?
It is in part the result of policies designed to keep farmers on the land , which belongs to the state and cannot be sold .
So farms are passed down the generations , divided and sub - divided .
Many are so small and the land so overworked that it could not provide for the families that work it even with normal rainfall .
At present only 17 % of Ethiopia 's 80 million people live in urban areas .
Keeping people in the countryside is a way of preventing large - scale unemployment and the unrest that this might cause .
Last month Oxfam launched a $ 15 m ( £ 9.5 m ) emergency appeal for the whole East African region , where it is suggested that 23 million people in seven countries are under threat .
The WFP , which is also calling for aid to the region , says cuts in its funding have made it more difficult to feed people .
It says it is particularly concerned about Eritrea , where it is unable to collect data because of restrictions on movement .
The drought , brought on by four years of bad harvests , has been made worse by conflict , climate change and population growth .
BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut says Ethiopian government policy banning land sales to keep people out of urban areas has also contributed .
All these other factors combined are at least as important as lack of rainfall , he says .
Fields of maize , burnt and withered by the sun , are the evidence of an emerging crisis , says the BBC's Mike Wooldridge in the Ethiopian town of Mekele .

In both the hardest - hit south of Ethiopia and in places in the north , farmers have told the BBC they face a total wipe - out of their harvests .
Some said they planned to sell their livestock , so damaging their livelihoods further .
Many aid officials say the figure of 6.2 million affected could rise further when the government makes its next assessment in mid-November .
On its website the WFP gives a figure of more than 10 million people in total affected by drought in Ethiopia .
The problem is compounded by high food costs , the WFP adds , with cereal prices doubling on many markets .
But the UN body 's greatest concern is that there is currently no funding at all for a feeding programme to prevent moderately malnourished children from slipping into severe malnutrition and the risk of death .

Facebook 's audience has doubled since the start of the year
Facebook , the world 's largest social networking site , has created a dual - class share structure to give its owners full control over the company .
A number of privately - owned firms , including Google , have introduced a similar structure before becoming publicly listed companies .
But Facebook said it had no plans to go public " at this time " .
The site has more than 300 million monthly users and is now making money , well ahead of schedule .
" We did introduce a dual class stock structure because existing shareholders wanted to maintain control over voting on certain issues , to help ensure the company can continue to focus on the long term to build a great business , " said Facebook spokesman Larry Yu .
Analysts said that without the new structure , new shareholders could force through business decisions based on short - term gain rather than long - term interests .

Transistor Radio Plans Builds in an hour !

Some interesting commentary out this morning from the IEA , in its latest survey of the oil market , pertaining to the situation in Alaska :
---
This summer saw crude volumes through the TransAlaska Pipeline System ( TAPS ) fall to a record low below 600 kb/d , leading to worries about its economic and technical sustainability .
The pipeline , which takes output from the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field on Alaska ’s North Slope to the Valdez export terminal in the south of the state , used to pump as much as 2 mb/d at its peak 20 years ago .
Besides economics , the fear is that even lower volumes could lead to more frequent and damaging outages – a major issue for oil companies lacking alternative export routes .
Alaskan authorities are mulling technical solutions – fewer pumping stations is one suggestion .
But another answer would lie in increasing Alaskan output .
September data put North Slope crude production at 650 kb/d and falling – output was over 1 mb/d in 1999 and at around 2 mb/d ten years earlier .
But long ‐standing hopes to produce more crude in northern Alaska depend on changes to legislation .
Three large areas in Alaska lie unexplored and undeveloped – the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska ( NPR‐A ) , reserved for the US Navy ’s use since 1923 , the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) and federal waters offshore the north coast .
All have been surveyed to some extent , generating estimates of billions of barrels of recoverable crude .
Another boost for the pipeline could be natural gas liquids ( NGL ) from new gas fields being developed – e.g. Exxon ’s Point Thompson , though this will likely only start producing in 2014 , and overall NGL volumes are unlikely to compensate for declining crude output .
The previous federal administration chose to loosen restrictions on the development of Alaskan Arctic
waters , as well as the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) – both long out of bounds for oil producers due to
environmental concerns .
In principle the Obama administration favours opening up these areas – the US
Department of the Interior estimates that around 85 billion barrels of oil and 12 trillion cubic metres of gas
are yet to be discovered there – but the debate on this issue is highly polarised .
For instance , a US court
recently cancelled , on environmental grounds , some licences for blocks offshore Alaska which had been
awarded under the Bush administration .
Lower Alaskan crude output has implications beyond state boundaries .
Californian refiners , which have long relied on Alaskan crude to top up declining local output , are having to search further afield .
Crude from Latin American producers used to flow north to the Golden State .
But competition from East Asia , notably China , is drawing some of this output across the Pacific .
One change in oil flows to result from this is the reversal of the Panama Canal pipeline .
Originally built to accommodate Alaskan crude heading to the US Gulf of Mexico refining cluster , it was recently converted to bring Atlantic Basin or even more remote crude to the Pacific , including California .
First shipments of Colombian crude were pumped in August .
A likely option in the face of declining Alaskan production will be to hike crude imports from Canada .
This
northern neighbour has overtaken competitors Saudi Arabia and Mexico in recent years to become the US ’s largest source of crude oil , benefiting on proximity and energy security grounds as production has increased .
US Midwestern refineries have long taken heavy sour Canadian crude , and pipelines to bring the crude all the way to the US Gulf are under construction .
From 2010 , Enbridge ’s Alberta Clipper pipeline , which will run 1,600 km from Hardisty , Alberta to Superior , Wisconsin , will add 450 kb/d of Canadian crude , later to be expanded to 800 kb/d .
With some other changes to the US pipeline network , these barrels will eventually be able to flow south to the US Gulf Coast .
Freight and refining economics permitting , some of these may even make it to California .
There 's a rumor circulating in the San Francisco press and real estate community : Tom Cruise just bought an $ 18 million mansion in town .
An overgrown pied - à - terre would n't be too terrifying — except for that local Scientology expansion drive .
Socketside heard Cruise was the buyer of an $ 18 million mansion in the ritzy Sea Cliff neighborhood .
NBC Bay Area soon pointed out that , if that 's true , Cruise 's neighbors would be Robin Williams , Cheech Marin and the guitarist from Metallica .
It 's like the Bay Area 's very own stunted little fog - swept Beverly Hills .
But many locals will remember that the Church of Scientology was on the hunt for " apparent expansion " space starting in 2006 , nosing around the once countercultural North Beach neighborhood .
So is Cruise , the alleged inspirer of Scientology beat - downs , spearheading a renewed expansion campaign by the cult to which he belongs ?
Maybe , or maybe said SF mansion is just being bought by another local tech exec like Oracle CEO Larry Ellison , per a SocketSite update :
Another reader quickly notes the mailing address for the purchasing LLC ( " Tawaraya " ) is that of " a high - end accounting firm in Walnut Creek " which happens to advise Larry Ellison ( amongst others ) .
And The Real Estalker adds , " Tawaraya is a super posh and searingly expensive , 300 - year old ryokan–which is essentially a Japanese bed and breakfast sort of place–located in Kyoto " which is rather Ellison - esque .
Oh great , more Larry Ellison dick waving .
Do n't we at least deserve some fresh megalomaniac mansion owners , out here ?
Now , Darwin censored in America by Ritwik on September 15 , 2009
The Telegraph ( UK ) reports that Jon Amiel ’s film Creation , a British project about Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution has not found a distributor in America .
The film , which has secured positive early reviews , has had no problem in securing distributors in other territories all over the world .
It may be recalled that America has witnessed an acrimonious debate on Darwin ’s theory of evolution , which is widely accepted as the best explanation for the origin of life and evolution of various life - forms .
Creationists in America refuse to accept Darwin ’s theory as it clashes with ideas propagated by Christianity .
However , US distributors have resolutely passed on a film which will prove hugely divisive in a country where , according to a Gallup poll conducted in February , only 39 per cent of Americans believe in the theory of evolution .
Movieguide.org , an influential site which reviews films from a Christian perspective , described Darwin as the father of eugenics and denounced him as “ a racist , a bigot and an 1800s naturalist whose legacy is mass murder ” .
His “ half - baked theory ” directly influenced Adolf Hitler and led to “ atrocities , crimes against humanity , cloning and genetic engineering ” , the site stated .
It is difficult to see this incident in isolation , given the increasing intolerance and jingoism shown by vast sections of the American media over the past few years , while covering matters as diverse as Iraq , health care and outsourcing .
It is also interesting that despite the election of Barack Obama , right - wing opinions seem to hold a great amount of sway over the country .
This seems to rule out any hope of genuine “ change ” , at least for now .
For a society that prides itself on being free , America has touched a new low .
One can only hope that sense will prevail and at least one distributor will show the guts to stand up for freedom of speech , in the land that is gave us Operation Enduring Freedom

Today I ’m releasing my first attempt at creating a “ selector engine ” ; it ’s called mini !
I ’m not sure if this really qualifies as a “ selector engine ” though ; it does not entirely support any particular CSS specification ; instead , I ’ve built it to work with only the most commonly used selectors .
While the work done on engines such as Peppy , Sizzle and Sly ( and others … ) is commendable the CSS3 - support aspect is totally lost on some users .
Resig ’s post on “ Selectors that People Actually Use ” attests to this .
mini has been built to support only the most frequently used CSS selectors .
If you prefer CSS3 - selector wizardry then you wo n’t like this , at all !
mini supports the following selectors ( and variations ) :
div
. example
body div
div , p
div , p , .example
div p
div > p
div.example
ul .example
#title
h1#title
div #title
ul.foo > * span
Do n’t try and do anything fancy with it !
It does n’t support pseudo - selectors , type selectors or any combinators ( other than > ) .
The entire script weighs in at about 1.5 kb ( minified ) and only 850 bytes ( minified and gzipped ) .
It ’s quite fast too :
Note : ( This is just for comparison ; I realise it ’s quite unfair to be comparing mini to fully - featured CSS3 engines )
Speeds were measured using SlickSpeed across browsers ( IE6 , IE7 , FF3 , Opera 9 ) and then averaged .
Yes , yes , I know , I could have tested more browsers , but I think those four give a pretty good picture .
In all honesty the task of creating an entirely CSS3 - compliant selector engine is beyond daunting ; I opted for the easy way out , creating something that is not “ the best ” but certainly has it ’s place among the crowd .
mini is the size of a tiny image ; this makes it unique !
The speed benefits were n’t intended but are certainly welcome !
To download mini please visit mini on Github !
Thanks for reading !
Please share your thoughts with me on Twitter .
Have a great day !

SITTING behind the wheel of a 2011 Chevrolet Volt prototype on Wednesday , I found myself confronting what may be the greatest fear that future owners of electric vehicles will face : a battery - charge indicator showing just a few miles of remaining range .
If I were out on a desolate Interstate in a vehicle powered solely by batteries , I ’d be praying to the god of electrons for a place to pull off and plug in a charging cord .
But my drive is at General Motors ’ proving grounds here , and I ’m about to experience what the Volt ’s vehicle line director ( and my passenger ) , Tony Posawatz , says is the car ’s trump card : a gasoline - powered generator under the hood .
Like other reporters , I had already driven Volt prototypes in the battery - powered mode , and they were predictably smooth and silent .
But for eventual Volt owners , a crucial  and so far unanswered  question is how the car will perform when the battery ’s charge is depleted and all electricity is provided by an onboard generator , driven by a gasoline engine , that has no mechanical connection to the wheels .
Will it be a slug ?
How annoying will the noise of the generator ’s engine be in an otherwise mute car ?

A Snapshot of Prison Gangs and Youth Gangs in Canada : Well - known Gangs , Membership , Offences , Risk , and Reconviction
Like their American counterparts , prison gangs in Canada are numerous and diverse , and at many times dispositionally related to the region in which they operate .
In the Prairie provinces , one of the largest focus areas of Aboriginal criminal justice research today , Native Canadian gangs ( largely youth - composed ) are rapidly increasing both within prison and without .
An estimated 250 Aboriginal incarcerated youths are involved in prison gangs and up to 1,000 in Aboriginal youth street gangs ( Correctional Service Canada 2005 ) .
5 % of Canada 's 14,000 federal inmates is part of a prison gang , with Aboriginal inmates contributing a sizable portion .
Furthermore , 80 % of all young male offenders aged 25 and younger are affiliated with a gang ( Correctional Service Canada 2002 ) .
According to the Calgary Herald , 450 Aboriginal gang members serve time in prisons throughout Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba , with 113 of those on conditional release , and 58 of those at a single institution , Drumheller .
One may argue that the rise of prison gangs in Canadian correctional facilities has simply been the direct recoil of recent anti-gang initiatives by law enforcement .
As Correctional Services Canada admit , the " increase in the admission of members and associates of gangs and criminal organizations ... can be attributed to the government 's introduction of legislation to combat organized crime and to the success of the integrated approach of law adopted by law enforcement . "

American influence on Canadian street and prison gangs results in some gangs adopting American styles of dress , identification , and organization .
Death Do Us Part , a Prairie prison gang that began in Edmonton Young Offender Centre ( E.Y.O.C ) in 1994 , changed their color from purple to blue a year after their inception , to mark their supposed affiliation with the Crips in Arizona and California .
After changing their name to the DDP Crips , they thereafter became known only as the Crips in Alberta , a reputation that lasted until 1998 .
Some of the reasons for many forms of Western Canadian gang deviance surrounds the current state of many of Canada 's Native Canadians .
Many of those who are young , poor , unemployed , discriminated against , out of school , and suffering from addiction statistically become natural candidates for membership in solidarity - focused , " cultural advocacy " groups .
The actual activities of many Aboriginal youth gangs , however , like their American equivalents protesting similar cultural - and age - oppressive environments , involve very little of these supposed cultural goals .
Instead , vandalism , auto thefts , robberies and muggings remain the crimes of choice for many youth gangs , who either prefer ( or must accept ) both less prestigious and less inconspicuous operations than their organized - crime counterparts , the Manitoba Warriors and the Hells Angels , who prefer gun-smuggling , drug - trafficking , drug - dealing , and prostitution .
The gangs listed below are by no means an exhaustive list of the possible organizations operating in prison and on the streets in the Vancouver , the Prairies , the Greater Toronto Area , Ottawa , and Montreal , but they are by far the majority , with the largest being the Manitoba Warriors , the Native Syndicate , the Indian Posse , Redd Alert , the Hells Angels , the Crips , the Bandidos , Shower Posse , White Aryan Resistance , ( aka Aggravated Resistance ) , and the Bloods .
In all cases , these gangs produce institutional instability , an increase in transfers , and a spread of membership .

C18 hosted the band No Remorse , which strived to be a " proper " terrorist organization at one point , according to Ryan , ( 2004:121 ) .
C18 leader William Browning fully intended the record label ISD Records to be ' created to fund terrorist organizations ' ( 122 ) .
His plan was to keep the money from ISD earnings and funnel it into terrorist activities , using Denmark as a base of operations .
There , bomb - maker Marcel Schift was to be handed responsibility of managing IDS Records ' Scandinavian branch , with the ultimate goal of deploying a series of bombings across several European cities .
The organization has been reported in cities across Canada .

A recent sentencing hearing opened new wounds for the victims , while offering a chance for the convicted to plead their case for parole eligibility in 12 years , highlighting that one of the two convicted of the murder has since removed the CDP 's familiar machine - gun - tattoo as a sign that he has distanced himself from the gang world .
It is unclear whether CDP members still exist in Ottawa .

The term " Westies " may have originated from the custom of referring to South Boston 's Irish - Americans as " Southies . "
Montreal was the reported place of refuge for Stephen " The Rifleman " Flemmi , an informer in the Boston Irish Mob during the 1970s .
Former Boston Irish Mob kingpin Whitey Bulger built a strong underground network with the West End Gang since Bulger went into hiding .

Geographical Distribution
Geographic Distribution of Canadian Prison Gangs , by City
According to the Winnipeg Free Press , the Manitoba Warriors and the Indian Posse are the largest gangs in the city of Winnipeg , and probably account for the city 's 7 % ownership of the country 's entire gang population .
The Deuces , West End Boyz ( WEB ) , North End Brotherhood ( NEB ) and the Nine - Os are the city 's other significant gangs , but exist in much fewer numbers .
The Indian Posse , known as the Warriors ' " farm team , " was formed in 1990 and has not yet matched the degree of organization the Manitoba Warriors have achieved , but both gangs have successfully spread across rural Manitoba , Saskatchewan and Northwestern Ontario .
Recent efforts from an anti-gang task force in Winnipeg in 2001 , however , won a national law enforcement award for its work in Operation Snow , a criminal intelligence operation that sentenced 35 Warriors to prison on various drug and weapons charges , and allegedly reduced the Warriors to a gang " in name only " ( Winnipeg Free Press , 24 November 2001 ) .
A highlight from these take - downs included the conviction of former Vice - President Roger Kyle Sanderson in 2000 , a Warrior kingpin who helped torture and execute Russell Krowetz , Stefan Zurstegge and Jason Gross on Winnipeg 's 319 Semple ave .
At the time , the murders were believed to be precipitated by a turf war between the Warriors and the Hells Angels over Winnipeg 's prostitution trade ( Broadcast News , 12 October 2000 ) .
In Edmonton , Aboriginal gangs such as the Indian Posse and Redd Alert are growing so fast that competition over resources is pushing other gangs into outlying areas across rural Alberta .
In the 12,000 person jurisdiction of Hobbema , the hub of the four Native reserves Samson , Montana , Ermineskin and Louis Bull , drug - networks are being set up by the Indian Posse and Redd Alert .
Fort McMurray , with a population of about 60,000 , is now dealing with a new organized drug - trade , while Camrose is becoming a convenient " commuter destination " for gangs from Edmonton .
Redd Alert is quickly winning the battle for the control of street crime in Edmonton , Fort McMurray , Hobbema , Regina , and North Battleford , Saskatchewan .
The city of Brooks , just east of Calgary , is experiencing " skyrocketing " gang activity , while Lethbridge , just 100 km north of the American border , is becoming a rendezvous point for marijuana and cocaine dealers importing and exporting to the US .
Along with Lethbridge and Medicine Hat , Brooks is also becoming known for its up - and - coming youth gang the Kids , consisting of about twelve street kids who sell crack cocaine .
In addition to these Aboriginal and street - youth gangs , Hells Angels - affiliates the Devil 's Henchmen , Iron Steed and Red Demons are also growing ( CISA 2005 ) .
Saskatchewan reported the highest per capita Aboriginal youth gang membership in Canada , at 1.34 per 1,000 people .
After Alberta began transferring Manitoba Aboriginal prison gang leaders into secure custody units in Saskatchewan , gang involvement spread to prisons in Saskatchewan ( CISS 2005 ) .
Prisons in Atlantic Canada have seen a conglomeration of drug smugglers from past Medellin drug cartel members , while prisons in British Columbia have seen the growing domination of Asian gangs .
In Quebec , prisons house 272 of the nation 's 278 incarcerated outlaw biker gang members ( Calgary Herald , 5 May 2006 ) .
Both the outlaw motorcycle gangs the Hells Angels and Rock Machine have been vying for control of Quebec 's prison drug trade since 1996 .
Donnaconna Penitentiary near Quebec City houses several top- ranking members of the Hells Angels , including Hells Angels kingpin Maurice " Mom " Boucher , who was accused of killing two prison guards , Diane Lavigne and Pierre Rondeau , in 1997 .
In October of 1998 , a prison guard was convicted of smuggling cocaine and heroin from Bordeaux jail in Montreal to the Hells Angels " wing " of Donnacona penitentiary ( Ottawa Citizen 11 July 2002 ) .
Jean - Paul Ramsay , a member of the Hells Angels Montreal chapter since 1987 , was recently denied parole from a Quebec penitentiary for allegedly running drug operations from inside prison .
Offences of Prison Gang Members
Current Offences of Canadian Prison Gang Members , by Offence
Risk - Level
In prison , gang members deal mostly in drugs and extortion , although prostitution , murder , and retaliatory violence are becoming more common .
Criminal Intelligence Service Canada's Annual 2005
Report states that " Incarcerated gang members and associates use assaults , intimidation , and to a much lesser extent , homicide , to discipline members / associates , to retaliate against rivals and to establish or maintain involvement in criminal activities , like drug trafficking , within correctional institutions . "
In 2004 , Drumheller Institution inmate Todd Jefferey Irving murdered Alberta Warriors inmate Roy Eyre , allegedly in self - defence , immediately after he heard Jefferey had marked Irving for assassination .
In all cases , in the Prairies , fights and drug trafficking are " stock - in - trade " for native prison gangs ( 26 April 2004 ) .
Not surprisingly , risk levels for gang members in prison are comparably very high .
The largest cause of this risk involves the already high risk level of existing street gang members entering prison , but a small part also involves the requirements attached to prison gang membership , including threat gestures , defiance to authority , misconduct , and even homicide as a way to protect one 's turf or to preserve one 's prestige and respect .
One of the most common requirements for prison gang membership is drug trafficking , conspiracy , and criminal abetting .
See the Risk Assessment article for more information on individual factors that increase one 's risk of reoffending .
Risk Level of Canadian Prison Gang Members at Intake , by Selected Measures
Institutional Misconducts of Canadian Prison Gang Members
Institutional Misconducts
As stated above , certain requirements of being a gang member may contribute to an increased incidence of staff assaults and rule violations .
In California , for example , known gang members recently admitted to prison are asked to disclose all information about their rank , position , duties , allegiances , fellow members , and criminal operations to correctional staff , called by correctional officials as " debriefing . "
If they deny this information , which is frequently the case , they will temporarily be placed in a disciplinary segregation unit before being returned to the general population .
Reconviction Rates of Canadian Prison Gang Members , by Offence
Reconviction Rates
Aboriginal programs have recently been implemented in Prairie prisons by the Correctional Service of Canada , in an effort to curb gang involvement in prison and to reduce recidivism rates following release .
Surprisingly , when controlling for risk , prison gang members were only more likely to reoffend than the general prison population when inmate were members of Asian gangs and street gangs .
Specific types of offences , such as armed robbery , weapon offences and drug possession , were more likely in recently released prison gang members compared to non-prison gang members , consistent with unique patterns of offending of each type of gang member at intake .

The bra converts into a mask for the wearer and one for a needy bystander

Here is an email from Eugene Holloway , a Maryland Attorney , on the rising cost of college education .
Eugene writes :
When I attended law school at George Washington U in 1969 , the tuition was $ 1,900 a semester .
I worked my way through and had no debts when I began to practice law .
Later , student loans became the norm .
The loans were subsidized , encouraging students to become indebted rather than build sweat equity in themselves .
Student loans also took parents off the hook for saving to pay for their childrens ’ education .
The result was still more government dependency .
Screwing up the marketplace with subsidies , drove up the price of education , encouraged institutions to grow based on government support , and placed undue emphasis ( economically ) on higher and frequently useless education .
We should expect the higher education market to suffer a similar fate to the real estate market , where subsidies , encouraging people to buy what they could not afford ( and did not need ) led them to a result that , when compared to their investment in time and treasure , was uneconomical .

ISTANBUL  For Ahmet Yildiz , a stocky and affable 26 - year - old , the choice to live openly as a gay man proved deadly .
Prosecutors say his own father hunted him down , traveling more than 600 miles from his hometown to shoot his son in an old neighborhood of Istanbul .
Mr. Yildiz was killed 16 months ago , the victim of what sociologists say is the first gay honor killing in Turkey to surface publicly .
He was shot five times as he left his apartment to buy ice cream .
A witness said dozens of neighbors watched the killing from their windows , but refused to come forward .
His body remained unclaimed by his family , a grievous fate under Muslim custom .
His father , Yahya Yildiz , whose trial in absentia began in September , is on the run and believed to be hiding in northern Iraq .
The case , which has caused a bout of national soul - searching , has underlined the tensions between the secular modern Turkey of cross - dressing pop stars and a more traditionalist Turkey , in which conservative Islam increasingly holds sway .
In Gold And The Watched Pot Theory I versed the following opinions on currency fluctuations :
Might the US dollar blow up ?
Yes it might .
But so could the RMB if China floated it , and so could the British pound .
No one seems to see the crisis brewing in Japan with a huge demographic problem , a shrinking population , falling exports , and no way to pay back its national debt .
There is seldom a mention of the problems in European banks who foolishly lent money to the Baltic States in Euros or Swiss Francs and now those Baltic country currencies have collapsed and the loans cannot be paid back .
European banks also lent to Latin America and those loans are also suspect .
Arguably , European banks are in worse shape than US banks , but no one talks about it , at least in the US .
A watched pot may boil , but it's not likely to explode , especially when everyone watching the pot expects an explosion any second .
Somewhere , something is going to blow sky high , but from where I sit , it 's as likely to be in the Yen , the Swiss Franc , the British Pound , or something no one is watching at all as opposed to the US dollar specifically .
Watch Eastern Europe For Possible Fireworks
I am having flashbacks to the late months of 2006 when I was watching the ABX index for signs that the subprime loan crisis was beginning .
I remember the lowest rated tranches of the ABX being worth 100 and checking everyday to see if / when they would crack .
Why am I having flashbacks ?
Because the Eastern European currencies ( Ex. Hungarian Forint , Czech Krona , and Polish Zloty ) remind me of the subprime loans of 2006 .
A crisis here likely will start a flu that will spread ultimately to the major countries .
Why do I draw the analogy between Eastern Europe and subprime loans ?
Because subprime borrowers were the weakest type of borrowers and the least able to deal with adverse consequences ( They defaulted first as a result ) .
This is similar to the Eastern European countries who are the most fragile countries in terms of staying power on the fiscal front right now ( Witness the massive budget deficits in those countries ) .
I bring this up today , because the Eastern Europe currencies are under a lot of pressure today ( Approx . 2 % ) .
Keep a close eye here Minyans as this is likely the candidate that could start the crisis fire anew IMO .

British prosecutors failed to disclose crucial evidence to the courts in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks in a case that resulted in an innocent pilot being jailed for five months , previously unseen documents reveal .
Lotfi Raissi , an Algerian living in the UK , was the first person in the world to be arrested after the 2001 attacks in New York and Washington DC .
Accused of being the " lead " instructor of the 9/11 hijackers , Raissi , 27 , was held in Belmarsh high security prison awaiting extradition to the United States .
In a landmark announcement , Jack Straw , the justice secretary , is shortly expected to reveal whether the UK government will accept responsibility for the miscarriage of justice and pay Raissi compensation .
The Guardian has obtained classified documents produced by the FBI and anti-terrorist officials in the UK after the 9/11 attacks which shed new light on how the courts were misled .
They include :
• A report by the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) into the way its staff handled the case , revealing prosecutors made unfounded allegations about Raissi 's involvement in 9/11 on the basis of an oral briefing from two FBI agents outside court .
• A confidential letter from Scotland Yard 's anti-terrorist branch to the CPS two months before Raissi was released , back - tracking on the key allegation that was being used in court to link Raissi to a senior al - Qaida suspect linked to Osama bin Laden .
• Memorandums from the FBI to anti-terrorist officials in the UK , revealing 9/11 investigators never wanted Raissi to be arrested and were informed about the unreliability of the evidence against him months before the courts were told .
Ministers were forced to consider Raissi's claim for damages after a ruling by the court of appeal last year that found there was evidence that Scotland Yard and the CPS had circumvented " the rule of English law " in what judges believed would amount to a serious abuse of process .
Now 35 , Raissi still lives in the UK but says he has been unable to rebuild his life .
He has been forced to abandon his promising career as a commercial pilot .
The FBI became interested in Raissi days after the attacks because he trained at the same Arizona flight school as Hani Hanjour , the hijacker who piloted the plane that crashed into the Pentagon .
Despite a specific plea from the FBI not to arrest Raissi but to gather information about him discreetly , anti-terrorist officers from the Metropolitan police stormed his house in Berkshire on September 21 on suspicion of the terrorist attacks 10 days earlier .
Rather than release Raissi when it emerged there was insufficient evidence to charge him , law enforcement officials in the UK colluded with the FBI to obtain a warrant for his extradition .
There was no evidence to justify a warrant for terrorism , so Raissi was requested on charges relating to an allegation that he failed to disclose his knee surgery in a pilot application .
In court , the CPS said the pilot application allegations were mere " holding charges " , and said he was in fact wanted for his alleged role in a conspiracy to commit mass murder during the 9/11 attacks .
However , as their case for keeping Raissi in Belmarsh began to unravel , prosecutors introduced a new piece of evidence .
They relied in successive hearings on an address book which they claimed belonged to Abu Doha , an Algerian terror suspect said to have had personal contact with Bin Laden in Afghanistan .
The address book contained a number linked to an apartment used by Raissi in Arizona , and supposedly connected him to a global terrorist conspiracy .
However , two months into his incarceration at Belmarsh , anti-terrorist officers informed the CPS that they no longer believed the address book belonged to Doha , and said it was more likely to be the property of a man called Adam Kermani , who lived in Islington , north London .
Kermani , an ex-boxer , was of so little concern to police that he had never been arrested or interviewed .
Kermani's name and Home Office number were written on the front of the address book , which was found in a locked briefcase at his house .
Judges were not informed of this development until February 2002 , after which Raissi was released .
The FBI however had been fully briefed months earlier , writing to Scotland Yard to confirm the owner of the address book was " not Abu Doha as originally thought " .
His lawyer , Jules Carey , said Raissi 's ordeal was one of the most significant miscarriages of justice during so - called war on terror .
" The court of appeal pulled no punches in asserting that there was a considerable body of evidence to suggest that the Met and CPS were responsible for serious defaults that resulted in Raissi 's detention at Belmarsh , " he said .
" These documents demonstrate , unequivocally , that the blame lies with the British authorities .
He has waited seven years for an apology and watched four home secretaries come and go without receiving it .
He is hopeful that his wait is finally up . "
Skype ( the famous Voice - Over - IP communication program ) will be released under an open source license .
The story started when Olivier FAURAX sent an email requesting Mandriva version of Skype .
After a little chat with customer support , he got this reply .
Customer support said that Skype understood that many users complain that there is no Mandriva version at present .
Skype was happy to be able to inform you that Skype will from now on be part of the open source community .
Skype mentioned that therefore Linux developers will be enabled to influence the development of the Skype client for Linux – which will most certainly result in specific versions for the different distributions . ”
This step will boost adopting Skype as the best communication program in GNU / Linux distributions .
Skype answered in an email that the appreciate the user community ’s enthusiasm and realizeed this is something they have been wanting for a while .
They realized the potential of the open source community and believed that making Skype for Linux an open source application will help to speed up its development and enhance its compatibility with different versions of Linux .
RALEIGH , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - The Carolina Hurricanes ended a 14 - game winless streak when they beat the Minnesota Wild 5 - 4 in a shootout on Sunday .
Jussi Jokinen delivered the game winner as Carolina won for the first time since October 9 .
Jokinen also scored in regulation time along with Joe Corvo , Ray Whitney and Brandon Sutter for the Hurricanes ( 3 - 12 - 4 ) , who led 3 - 0 in the second period .
Robbie Earl had two goals for Minnesota ( 7 - 11 - 2 ) .
This week has already seen full - power tests of the engines
The prototype of a solar - powered plane destined for a record round - the - world journey has made its first trip across a runway .
On Thursday , the plane covered at least 2 km at speeds of up to five knots on the landing strip in Switzerland .
This week saw the Solar Impulse plane outside its hangar for the first time , with tests of its motors and computer .
As wide as a jumbo jet but weighing just 1,500 kg , it will be piloted by Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard .
The plane 's maiden flight is scheduled for February , and a final version will attempt to cross the Atlantic in 2012 .
Thursday's " taxiing " test was carried out with a security trolley device under the cockpit to protect the craft in case the landing gears broke .
But Friday 's test will be carried out without this device .
The team will also try to double the speed to 10 knots .
A spokesperson for Solar Impulse said the first runway test went just as planned .
" It was just fantastic today .
We are very excited about it , " she told BBC News .
Today 's activities are designed to give the test pilot a feel for how the plane moves on the ground .
If the tests are successful , the next step will be a short flight , or " flea hop " in about two weeks ' time .
Solar Impulse chief executive Andre Borschberg told BBC News : " We 'll take off at the beginning of the runway , fly a few metres above it - a little bit like the Wright brothers did in 1903 - and then land again , to see how it behaves at the beginning of the flight .
" If this is satisfactory , we will dismantle it and transport it [ to Payerne air force base in western Switzerland ] where we will do the real first flight of about two hours , in February . "
But each step will be a careful one , Mr Borschberg stressed .
" This is truly a new design - an airplane the size of an Airbus and the weight of a mid-sized car - so we 're not taking risks by not understanding something . "

Dear Colleagues :
There are some advocates who claim to be abolitionists but who support welfare reform or who support violence .
In this Commentary , I explain why welfare reform and violence cannot fit into the abolitionist approach .

As an American , I am embarrassed that the U.S. House of Representatives has 220 members who actually believe the government can successfully centrally plan the medical and insurance industries .
I 'm embarrassed that my representatives think that government can subsidize the consumption of medical care without increasing the budget deficit or interfering with free choice .
It 's a triumph of mindless wishful thinking over logic and experience .
The 1,990 - page bill is breathtaking in its bone - headed audacity .
The notion that a small group of politicians can know enough to design something so complex and so personal is astounding .
That they were advised by " experts " means nothing since no one is expert enough to do that .
There are too many tradeoffs faced by unique individuals with infinitely varying needs .
Government cannot do simple things efficiently .
The bureaucrats struggle to count votes correctly .
They give subsidized loans to " homeowners " who turn out to be 4 - year - olds .
Yet congressmen want government to manage our medicine and insurance .
Competition is a " discovery procedure , " Nobel - prize - winning economist F. A . Hayek taught .
Through the competitive market process , we producers and consumers constantly learn things that force us to adjust our behavior if we are to succeed .
Central planners fail for two reasons :
First , knowledge about supply , demand , individual preferences and resource availability is scattered — much of it never articulated — throughout society .
It is not concentrated in a database where a group of planners can access it .
Second , this " data " is dynamic :
It changes without notice .
No matter how honorable the central planners ' intentions , they will fail because they cannot know the needs and wishes of 300 million different people .
And if they somehow did know their needs , they would n't know them tomorrow .
Proponents of so - called reform — it's not really reform unless it makes things better — have shamefully avoided criticism of their proposals .
Often they just dismiss their opponents as greedy corporate apologists or paranoid right - wing loonies .
That 's easier than answering questions like these :
1 ) How can the government subsidize the purchase of medical services without driving up prices ?
Econ 101 teaches — without controversy — that when demand goes up , if other things remain equal , price goes up .
The politicians want to have their cake and eat it , too .
2 ) How can the government promise lower medical costs without restricting choices ?
Medicare already does that .
Once the planners ' mandatory insurance pushes prices to new heights , they must put even tougher limits on what we may buy — or their budget will be even deeper in the red than it already is .
As economist Thomas Sowell points out , government cannot really reduce costs .
All it can do is disguise and shift costs ( through taxation ) and refuse to pay for some services ( rationing ) .
3 ) How does government " create choice " by imposing uniformity on insurers ?
Uniformity limits choice .
Under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's bill and the Senate versions , government would dictate to all insurers what their " minimum " coverage policy must include .
Truly basic high - deductible , low - cost catastrophic policies tailored to individual needs would be forbidden .
4 ) How does it " create choice " by making insurance companies compete against a privileged government - sponsored program ?
The so - called government option , let 's call it Fannie Med , would have implicit government backing and therefore little market discipline .
The resulting environment of conformity and government power is not what I mean by choice and competition .
Rep. Barney Frank is at least honest enough to say that the public option will bring us a government monopoly .
Advocates of government control want you to believe that the serious shortcomings of our medical and insurance system are failures of the free market .
But that 's impossible because our market is not free .
Each state operates a cozy medical and insurance cartel that restricts competition through licensing and keeps prices higher than they would be in a genuine free market .
But the planners wo n't talk about that .
After all , if government is the problem in the first place , how can they justify a government takeover ?
Many people are priced out of the medical and insurance markets for one reason : the politicians ' refusal to give up power .
Allowing them to seize another 16 percent of the economy wo n't solve our problems .
Freedom will .

For about the last eight months , several suspects operated a sophisticated marijuana operation in a warehouse just 25 feet from the Los Angeles Police Department 's Topanga Station in Canoga Park , police said tonight .
Three men were taken into custody earlier today after officers served a search warrant on the warehouse in the 8400 block of Canoga Avenue .
Growers had built three rooms in the building -- one for seedlings , another for medium - sized plants and one where harvesting was apparently conducted , police said .
The lights were controlled so they would n't overheat , watering systems were automated and oxygen levels were supplemented by carbon dioxide tanks , according to police .
" It was very sophisticated , " said LAPD Officer Karen Raynor .
She said the growers used insulation material to seal cracks in the building .
But about a week ago , officers in the station 's parking lot noticed something out of the ordinary .
" They happened to catch a whiff of it , " Raynor said .
A surveillance operation was launched , and officers obtained the warrant .
The names of the three men , who appeared to be in their 30s , were not released because they had not been booked .

We truly are not a serious country :
Too much Leonard Nimoy […..]
But his intellectuality has contributed to a growing critique that decisions are detached from rock - bottom principles .
Both Maureen Dowd in The New York Times and Joel Achenbach of The Washington Post have likened him to Star Trek ’s Mr. Spock .
The Spock imagery has been especially strong during the extended review Obama has undertaken of Afghanistan policy .
He ’ll announce the results on Tuesday .
The speech ’s success will be judged not only on the logic of the presentation but on whether Obama communicates in a more visceral way what progress looks like and why it is worth achieving .
No soldier wants to take a bullet in the name of nuance .
Yes , serious people are engaging in serious discussions about how bad it is for Obama to be intelligent , circumspect and deliberative . …
After eight disastrous years that should have proved to anyone with a pulse who was n’t on a respirator how galactically retarded it is to elect a dim- witted , ivy - league C - student frat guy to run the country .
Fucking hell …
Stuff like this , along with reading Idiot America , is pretty depressing to take in .
John Cole perks me up , as always , with his insight :
Love it or hate it , Tag Heuer ’s Monaco V4 , listed at $ 100,000 Swiss Francs ( $ 97.5 K usd ) , bucks all conventional wisdom ; replacing the traditional time - honoured gears approach first pioneered in the 18th century for belt - driven technology most common in car engines .
The Sifter explores this disruptive watch design :
HISTORY
– The original Tag Heuer Monaco featured an audacious , squared - off case that signalled a complete break with conventional watch making aesthetics .
It was first seen on Steve McQueen ’s wrist in the 1970 classic race film Le Mans
– The original Monaco was the world ’s first automatic chronograph with a micro-rotor ( launched in 1969 by Jack Heuer , today TAG Heuer ’s Honorary Chairman ) .
The powerful new movement housed in the Monaco V4 is a tribute to the high - tech , high - performance world of motor racing
– In 2004 , TAG Heuer unveiled the Monaco V4 Concept Watch , the world ’s first watch with belt drives , linear mass and ball bearings .
It hass taken 5 long years , but on the eve of its 150th anniversary , TAG Heuer has unveiled to the world the double - patented Monaco V4
REVOLUTIONARY DESIGN
– The watch movement uses a series of transmission belts instead of pinions .
The belts are the smallest in the world and still have a thin steel wire in them for strength
– Instead of smaller gears connecting some of the larger gears , there are the belts that do it .
The V4 uses a linear weight that moves up and down to power the watch ’s movement , resembling a piston in an engine
– Power is stored in four barrels that are seen in the rear of the watch ( hence the V4 name ) .
The power reserve is 52 hours and the watch is very accurate at about plus or minus 4 seconds a day , well within the chronometer range .
– The watch also uses mini ball bearings instead of ‘ rubies ’ that are commonly used in watches for low friction between gears and palettes .
Tag Heuer says that the ball bearings provide even less friction than the commonly used synthetic rubies
– The watch does not have much for functions though .
Just the time with a subsidiary seconds dial
– The Monaco V4 is the world ’s first wristwatch with a linear mass , which is mounted on the world ’s smallest ball bearings ( 2.2 to 4 mm diameter and a thickness of 0.6 to 1 mm )
LABOUR OF LOVE
– According to Tag Heuer , the Monaco V4 watch took them 14,200 [ combined ] days of research and development to make .
TAG
Heuer ’s best engineers and watchmakers worked with inventor Jean - François Ruchonnet to craft this revolutionary design
– The techniques used in the design , prototyping and production of the V4 are the same as those used to develop complex aerospace systems .
Tools , techniques and expertise were drawn from an eclectic fusion of disciplines , such as the automobile and IT industries , applied mathematics , chemistry , climatology , computer engineering and micro-mechanical sciences ( so they used computers ? )
– New TAG
Heuer - designed machines and methods were specially created , including proprietary software ( TAG Heuer is a pioneer in 3D modeling and digital synthesis ) , automated micro-couplers and rheologically controlled high - pressure injectors
– Today , the Monaco V4 are hand - assembled at TAG Heuer by ‘ Meilleur Ouvrier de France ’ watch master Denis Badin , thus bringing the timepiece full circle : from the most cutting - edge techniques of the present era to the most time - honoured traditions of artisanal craftsmanship
– Each watch movement takes 165 hours of labor to hand assemble , and represents something very special amongst the Tag Heuer line

The makers of the eerily lifelike robotic mule have a new creation : a machine that walks around like a real human being .
Boston Dynamics is building the " Petman " prototype for the U.S. Army , to test out protective clothing .
“ Petman will balance itself and move freely ; walking , crawling and doing a variety of suit - stressing calisthenics during exposure to chemical warfare agents , ” the company promises .
“ Petman will also simulate human physiology within the protective suit by controlling temperature , humidity and sweating when necessary , all to provide realistic test conditions . ”
Like Boston Dynamics ' BigDog robo-mule , Petman stays upright , even when it 's shoved .
And the thing walks heel - to - toe at 3.2 miles per hour , just like a flesh - and - blood person .
Petman may be just one of a number of attempts by robot - makers to build a simulated set of biped legs .
But I have n't seen one that gets closer to the real deal .
This was not the Lincoln - Douglas debates .
It was more like mud-wrestling !

Less than two weeks after announcing that it would be the sole sponsor of Fox 's November 8 " Family Guy Presents : Seth & Alex 's Almost Live Comedy Show , " Microsoft has pulled out .
According to Variety 's Mike Schneider , who broke the story , everything was humming along just fine until the folks at Microsoft went to the taping of the special last week and were shocked , shocked to find racy humor and tasteless jokes about deaf people , the Holocaust , feminine hygiene and incest .
All this is par for the course for " Family Guy , " a show which knows no taboos .
Even the assassination of a president is fair game for " Family Guy " ( anyone remember the JFK Pez dispenser joke ? ) .
" Seth & Alex 's Almost Live Comedy Show " is a throwback to the old variety specials of TV 's past .
It features MacFarlane , who is the creator and a voice on the show , and Alex Borstein , who is also a voice on the show .
In between skits and bits would be lots of plugs for Windows 7 .
We found it a little hard to believe that Microsoft was n't aware of what it was getting into when it agreed to sponsor the special .
So we called to check if that was really possible .
We got e-mailed this canned statement in response :
We initially chose to participate in the Seth and Alex variety show based on the audience composition and creative humor of “ Family Guy , ” but after reviewing an early version of the variety show it became clear that the content was not a fit with the Windows brand .
We continue to have a good partnership with FOX , Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein and are working with them in other areas .
We continue to believe in the value of brand integrations and partnerships between brands , media companies and talent .
-- Attributed to Microsoft Spokesperson
We followed up with an e-mail question about whether the company really had no idea just how raunchy the content gets on " Family Guy " and got this response :
I am not in the office on 10 / 26 .
Try my mobile phone at 425 - XXX - XXXX if you need to reach me urgently .
Fear not , " Family Guy " fans .
The special is still a go and Fox hopes to line up some new sponsors who actually know what they 're getting into with MacFarlane .
What 's really scary about all this is we 're pretty sure we did n't leave our e-mail with Microsoft when we called seeking comment .

Writing a FUSE Filesystem : a Tutorial
Joseph J. Pfeiffer , Jr. , Ph.D .
Emeritus Professor
Department of Computer Science

pfeiffer@cs.nmsu.edu
Version of 2018-02-04
One of the real contributions of Unix has been the view that " everything is a file " .
A tremendous number of radically different sorts of objects , from data storage to file format conversions to internal operating system data structures , have been mapped to the file abstraction .
One of the more recent directions this view has taken has been Filesystems in User Space , or FUSE ( no , the acronym really does n't work .
Oh well ) .
The idea here is that if you can envision your interaction with an object in terms of a directory structure and filesystem operations , you can write a FUSE file system to provide that interaction .
You just write code that implements file operations like open ( ) , read ( ) , and write ( ) ; when your filesystem is mounted , programs are able to access the data using the standard file operation system calls , which call your code .
FUSE filesystems have been written to do everything from providing remote access to files on a different host without using NFS or CIFS ( see SSHFS at https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) to implementing a filesystem to talk to devices using the Media Transfer protocol ( see jmtpfs at https://github.com/kiorky/jmtpfs) to organizing a music collection with directories based on MP3 tags ( see id3fs at http://erislabs.net/ianb/projects/id3fs/id3fsd.html) to , really , almost anything .
The possibilities are only limited by your imagination !
There are many documents on the web describing how FUSE works and how to install and use a FUSE filesystem , but I have n't come across any that try to describe how to go about actually writing one .
The goal of this tutorial is to meet what I see as a need for such a document .
This tutorial introduces FUSE using a filesystem I call the " Big Brother File System " ( the reason for the name is that " Big Brother is watching " ) .
The filesystem simply passes every operation down to an underlying directory , but logs the operation .
This tutorial , together with its associated example filesystem , is available as a tarball at http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~pfeiffer/fuse-tutorial.tgz .
Audience :
This tutorial is aimed at developers who have some familiarity with general programming in Linux ( and Unix - like operating systems in general ) , so you know how to untar a tarball , how Makefiles work , and so forth .
I wo n't be going through the details of how to perform those tasks ; I 'll be focussing on what you need to know that 's specific to using FUSE filesystems .
I am not affiliated with the FUSE project in any way , except as a user .
My descriptions of the interface to fuse , and of techniques to work with it , are a distillation of my reading of the existing documentation , and my experience working with it .
Consequently , any errors are mine ( and corrections are welcome ! ) .

Writing a FUSE Filesystem : a Tutorial
Brotto did a bit of experimenting on herself .
Not that she suffered from any disorder , but she talks of herself sometimes in a researcher ’s terms as “ an n of one , ” a single subject on whom she likes to test her ideas .
Along with mindfulness , the treatment Brotto ’s supervisor devised for borderline personality uses cognitive therapy , which stresses altering patterns of thought to transform self - image and experience .
One day at yoga class , Brotto tried the combination .
She went through her usual yoga poses , but with “ a cognitive reframe , ” she said .
She told herself , “ over and over like a mantra , ” that she was an especially sexual woman , “ capable of a high level of desire , a high level of response . ”
And , she recalled , “ there was a deliberate intent not only to listen to my body even more than I normally would in yoga but also to interpret the signs from my body as signs of my sexual identity .
So my breathing was not just breathing through the pose ; it was breathing because I was highly sexual . ”
Sensation and self - image became linked .
She was in a particularly awkward and taxing position , bent over and balanced on one foot and one inverted hand , when she had a profound moment .
It was n’t that anything she was trying mentally was itself so stunningly new .
The power of positive thought is a cliché .
And the acute concentration on the sensory echoes the sex therapy practiced by Masters and Johnson in the 1960s .
Yet through melding the two something revelatory occurred .
Suddenly her straining muscles and racing heart were affirmations “ of my sexual vigor , my sexual arousability . ”
She finished class with a thrilling sense of her own body , her own erotic potency .
Brotto took what she learned in treating borderline personality , including the use of raisin exercises to foster mindfulness , and what happened in yoga class , and applied it first with her gynecological cancer patients , then with a wide range of women with weak desire .
Her results , published in the leading journals of sexual research , have been promising , with her subjects reporting stronger libidos and better relationships , though there are caveats : that desire is n’t easy to measure ; that patients are prone to report improvement on questionnaires given by those who treat them ; that almost any method that gets people to think about sex may increase their interest in having it .
Brotto is now studying the effects of her group sessions on a sample of 70 women who have or will soon gather in the stark conference room around the pair of beige tables to be led through her program of mindfulness and cognitive therapy .
They are sent home with assignments — to observe their bodies in the shower and describe themselves physically in precise and neutral language , in phrases that hold no judgment ; and , after another session , to repeat over and over , “ My body is alive and sexual , ” no matter if they believe it .
They are taught about research that shows that belief does n’t matter , that the feeling will follow the declaration .
And they are instructed , in their sessions , to place the raisins in their mouths , to “ notice where the tongue is , notice the saliva building up in your mouth . . . notice the trajectory of the flavor as it bursts forth , the flood of saliva , how the flavor changes from your body ’s chemistry . ”
This exercise is among Brotto ’s ways of training patients to immerse themselves in physical sensation .
One hope is that such feelings will whisper to the women of their own erotic vitality .
Another is that her patients will learn to be aware of the changes in their bodies — automatic reactions similar to salivating — before or during sex .
An underlying theory is that while her patients ’ genitals commonly pulse with blood in response to erotic images­ or their partners ’ sexual touch , their minds are so detached — distracted by work or children or worries about the way they look unclothed , or fixated on fears that their libidos are dead — as to be oblivious to their bodies ’ excitement , their bodies ’ messages .
The skill of fully attending to sensation is essential within Brotto ’s vision of women ’s desire — a vision that she imparts to her groups partly by introducing a diagram called “ the Basson Sexual Response Cycle , ” whose circles and arrows have lately been imprinting themselves on the field of sex therapy and helping to guide Brotto ’s formulations for the next D.S.M .
he minimalism of the manual ’s present criteria for H.S.D.D. — “ persistently or recurrently deficient ( or absent ) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity ” — seems to presume that the workings of desire are straightforward , that healthy sexual beings are regularly sparked by lust , that they are busy imagining , and wishing for , erotic encounters .
Meanwhile the flow chart of women ’s sexual experience created by Rosemary Basson , who is Brotto ’s colleague at the Center for Sexual Medicine and at the University of British Columbia , with which the center is affiliated , is complex and a bit difficult to describe .
Basson , a British medical doctor who has been at the center for more than two decades , was first drawn to the field of sexuality as an internist in England .
Assigned to a ward for victims of spinal - cord injuries , a floor , as she remembers it , with a steady supply of men paralyzed in motorcycle accidents , she sometimes found herself with a patient who worked up the courage to ask about how or whether he could ever have sex .
She sought out a supervisor for advice and was told , she recounted , imitating the clipped , almost panicked reply , “ Change the subject , change the subject . ”
She has dealt directly with the subject of sex ever since .
“ All through the ’90s I was scribbling my circles , ” she told me in her wispy voice , as she penned out a diagram for me the way she long has for her female patients .
She had on a pale flowing skirt with a pattern of leaves and wore her feathery brown hair cropped above her ears .
There was something ethereal about her .
Yet she drew with swift authority .
A box with the phrase “ reasons for sex ” went at the top of the page .
The beginnings of a large circle ran from one side of the box .
And the diagram made clear that desire — at least the way many tend to think of it , as a lust or craving that spurs someone toward having sex — might or might not play a role in making a woman want sex and , in any case , is n’t at all necessary for the sex to be satisfying .
Image Credit ... Pomme Chan
A different manifestation of desire — not initial hunger — – appears about two - thirds of the way around Basson ’s circle .
There , in the diagrams she began publishing in obstetrics and sexuality journals 10 years ago , come the words “ responsive / triggered desire . ”
For Basson , this is necessary to satisfaction .
But it comes after arousal starts .
So a typical successful experience might proceed something like this : first a decision , rather than a drive , to have sex ; next , as Basson puts it , a “ willingness to be receptive ” ; then , say , the sensations of a partner ’s touch ; next , the awareness of being aroused ; then the “ responsive desire ” along with increasingly intense arousal ; and at last the range of physical and emotional payoffs that sex can provide and that offer positive reinforcement leading back to the top of the diagram , to the reasons for setting off on the circle to begin with .
Whipped for wearing a ' deceptive ' bra : Hardline Islamists in Somalia publicly flog women in Sharia crackdown
A hardline Islamist group in Somalia has begun publicly whipping women for wearing bras that they claim violate Islam as they are ' deceptive ' .
The insurgent group Al Shabaab has sent gunmen into the streets of Mogadishu to round up any women who appear to have a firm bust , residents claimed yesterday .
The women are then inspected to see if the firmness is natural , or if it is the result of wearing a bra .
If they are found wearing a bra , they are ordered to remove it and shake their breasts , residents said .
Desperation : A woman feeds her child at a newly formed camp for refugees affected by drought in Somalia yesterday .
Somalis are also contending with hardline Islamists seeking to impose a strict form of Sharia law on the country
Al Shabaab , which seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Sharia law over all Somalia , also amputated a foot and a hand each from two young men accused of robbery earlier this month .
They have also banned movies , musical ringtones , dancing at wedding ceremonies and playing or watching soccer .
' Al Shabaab forced us to wear their type of full veil and now they order us to shake our breasts , ' a resident , Halima , told Reuters , adding that her daughters had been whipped on Thursday .
' They are now saying that breasts should be firm naturally , or just flat . '
Officials of Al Shabaab , which Washington says is Al Qaeda 's proxy in the failed Horn of Africa state , declined to comment .
The group 's hardline interpretation of Islamic law has shocked many Somalis , who are traditionally moderate Muslims .
Some residents , however , give the insurgents credit for restoring order to the regions under their control .
Al Shabaab , which means ' youth ' in Arabic , control large swathes of south and central Somalia .
Abdullahi Hussein , a student in north Mogadishu , said his elder brother was thrown behind bars when he fought back a man who humiliated their sister by asking her to remove her bra .
' My brother was jailed after he wrestled with a man that had beaten my sister and forced her to remove her bra .
He could not stand it , ' Hussein said .
Men were not spared the ' moral cleansing ' .
Any man caught without a beard was been publicly whipped .
' I was beaten and my hair was cut off with a pair of scissors in the street , ' Hussein said .
' My trouser was also cut up to the knee .
They accused me of shaving my beard but I am only 18 .
' They have arrested dozens of men and women .
You just find yourself being whipped by a masked man as soon as leave your house . '
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Daily tracking results show 49 % of Americans approving of the job Barack Obama is doing as president , putting him below the majority approval level for the first time in his presidency .
Although the current decline below 50 % has symbolic significance , most of the recent decline in support for Obama occurred in July and August .
He began July at 60 % approval .
The ongoing , contentious debate over national healthcare reform has likely served as a drag on his public support , as have continuing economic problems .
Americans are also concerned about the Obama administration 's reliance on government spending to solve the nation 's problems and the growing federal budget deficit .
Since September , Obama 's approval rating had been holding in the low 50s and , although it has reached 50 % numerous times , it had never dropped below 50 % until now .
Of the post - World War II presidents , Obama now is the fourth fastest to drop below the majority approval level , doing so in his 10th month on the job .
Gerald Ford dropped below 50 % approval during his third month in office , and Bill Clinton did so in his fourth month .
Ronald Reagan , like Obama , also dropped below 50 % in his 10th month in office , though Reagan 's drop occurred a few days sooner in that month ( Nov. 13 - 16 , 1981 ) than did Obama 's ( Nov. 17- 19 , 2009 ) .
But all presidents except John Kennedy dropped below the majority approval level at some point in their presidencies , and all recovered after the first time below this mark to go back above 50 % approval .
Half recovered quickly -- Harry Truman , Dwight Eisenhower , Ronald Reagan , and George W. Bush were back above 50 % approval the same month they dipped below that mark , and Lyndon Johnson returned to majority approval in his second month after his initial sub - 50 % rating .
The remainder continued to sink further below 50 % and remained there for many months , but eventually recovered , with Ford 's effort boosted by the Mayaguez incident .
George H.W. Bush took the longest time to recover , going more than a year before his approval rating was restored to the majority level .
Unfortunately for him , the 1992 election at which voters denied him a second term in office occurred during this time , and his rating did not go back above 50 % until just before he left office in January 1993 .
Notably , most of the presidents who fell below 50 % during their first term recovered in plenty of time to be re-elected .
This list includes Truman , Nixon , Reagan , Clinton , and George W. Bush .
Ford and Jimmy Carter recovered in the short term but could not sustain improvement long enough to convince voters they deserved a second term , and , as noted , the elder Bush recovered after he was voted out of office .
Johnson may well have joined that list had he decided to seek a second term .
And Eisenhower did not go below majority approval until after he had been re-elected .
Thus , Obama 's descent below 50 % is an important symbolic milestone in his presidency , but history suggests the odds of his regaining majority approval are high , and he could do so relatively soon , particularly since the individual nightly numbers for him in recent days have been right around the 50 % mark .
History would suggest his current loss of majority approval bears little relation to his chances of being elected to a second term in 2012 .
Editor 's Note : Gallup 's official presidential job approval ratings are based on the Gallup Daily tracking three - day averages as reported each day at Gallup.com .
Gallup from time to time includes presidential approval ratings on other surveys in order to preserve survey context for questions that follow , including the Oct.
1 - 4 , 2009 , Gallup Crime poll , in which presidential approval was 49 % .
Gallup considers the Nov. 17-19
Daily results as its official record of the first time Obama dropped below 50 % .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,533 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Nov. 17 - 19 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones and cellular phones .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Eric Weiss was stopped at a busy Long Beach intersection last month when he said his 2008 Toyota Tacoma pickup unexpectedly started accelerating , forcing him to stand on the brakes to keep the bucking truck from plowing into oncoming cars .
Toyota Motor Corp. says the gas pedal design in Weiss ’ truck and more than 4 million other Toyota and Lexus vehicles makes them vulnerable to being trapped open by floor mats , and on Wednesday , it announced a costly recall to fix the problem .
But Weiss is convinced his incident was n’t caused by a floor mat .
He said he removed the mats in his truck months earlier on the advice of his Toyota dealer after his truck suddenly accelerated and rear - ended a BMW .
“ The brakes squealed and the engine roared , ” the 52 - year - old cabinet maker said of the most recent episode .
“ I do n’t want to drive the truck anymore , but I do n’t want anyone else to , either . ”
Amid widening concern over unintended acceleration events , including an Aug. 28 crash near San Diego that killed a California Highway Patrol officer and his family , Toyota has repeatedly pointed to “ floor mat entrapment ” as the problem .
But accounts from motorists such as Weiss , interviews with auto safety experts and a Times review of thousands of federal traffic safety incident reports all point to another potential cause : the electronic throttles that have replaced mechanical systems in recent years .
The Times found that complaints of sudden acceleration in many Toyota and Lexus vehicles shot up almost immediately after the automaker adopted the so - called drive - by - wire system over the last decade .
That system uses sensors , microprocessors and electric motors -- rather than a traditional link such as a steel cable -- to connect the driver ’s foot to the engine .
For some Toyota models , reports of unintended acceleration increased more than fivefold after drive - by - wire systems were adopted , according to the review of thousands of consumer complaints filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Toyota first installed electronic throttles in 2002 model year Lexus ES and Camry sedans .
Total complaints of sudden acceleration for the Lexus and Camry in the 2002 - 04 model years averaged 132 a year .
That ’s up from an average of 26 annually for the 1999 - 2001 models , the Times review found .
The average number of sudden - acceleration complaints involving the Tacoma jumped more than 20 times , on average , in the three years after Toyota ’s introduction of drive - by - wire in these trucks in 2005 .
Increases were also found on the hybrid Prius , among other models .
Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said the automaker could not explain the trend .
But Toyota has consistently held that electronic control systems , including drive - by - wire , are not to blame .
“ Six times in the past six years NHTSA has undertaken an exhaustive review of allegations of unintended acceleration on Toyota and Lexus vehicles , ” Toyota said in a statement this month .
“ Six times the agency closed the investigation without finding any electronic engine control system malfunction to be the cause of unintended acceleration . ”
NHTSA officials have consistently said they have not found any electronic defects .
“ In the high - speed incidents , which are the type of crashes in which death or serious injury is most likely , the only pattern NHTSA has found to explain at least some of them are pedal entrapment by floor mats , ” a spokeswoman said in a written statement .
Toyota has been under a spotlight since the San Diego crash , in which the driver ’s desperate efforts to stop the car were recorded on a 911 emergency call made by a passenger .
After that incident , The Times reported that sudden - acceleration events involving Toyota vehicles have resulted in at least 19 deaths since the introduction of the 2002 model year .
By comparison , NHTSA says all other automakers combined had 11 fatalities related to sudden acceleration in the same period .
Independent electronics and engineering experts say that the drive - by - wire systems differ from automaker to automaker and that the potential for electronic throttle control systems to malfunction may have been dismissed too quickly by both Toyota and federal safety officials .
Unlike mechanical systems , electronic throttles -- which have the look and feel of traditional gas pedals -- are vulnerable to software glitches , manufacturing defects and electronic interference that could cause sudden acceleration , they say .
Ask the computer
“ With the electronic throttle , the driver is not really in control of the engine , ” said Antony Anderson , a Britain - based electrical engineering consultant who investigates electrical failures and has testified in sudden - acceleration lawsuits .
“ You are telling the computer , will you please move the throttle to a certain level , and the computer decides if it will obey you . ”
Although Toyota says it knows of no electronic defects that would cause a vehicle to surge out of control , it has issued at least three technical service bulletins to its dealers warning of problems with the new electronic throttles in the 2002 and 2003 Camry .
The throttle systems on six - cylinder engines can cause the vehicle to “ exhibit a surging during light throttle input at speeds between 38 mph and 42 mph , ” according to one of the bulletins that was published by Alldata , a vehicle information company .
The solution provided to dealers was to reprogram the engine control module .
NHTSA , the nation ’s primary agency for auto safety , has conducted a total of eight investigations of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles since 2003 , prompted by defect petitions from motorists and its own examination of complaints .
But the agency has tested electronic throttle systems only twice in those probes , its records show .
Three years ago , the agency asked Toyota to test an electronic throttle component from a 2006 Camry , a task the company delegated to the Japanese supplier that manufactured the part .
The supplier exonerated the throttle , and then NHTSA allowed Toyota to keep virtually the entire 74 - page report almost completely confidential .
The report , posted on the agency ’s website , has dozens of redacted pages .
The other test , conducted at a NHTSA laboratory in Massachusetts , found that a Toyota throttle exhibited unusual behavior when researchers applied a magnetic field to the device ’s sensitive electronics .
Engine speed surged by 1,000 revolutions per minute , according to a 2008 report by the agency ’s Vehicle Research and Test Center .
Nonetheless , the lab concluded that the system “ showed no vulnerabilities to electric signal activities . ”
The details of the experiment were not explained in the lab report , and the agency never explained the apparent contradiction .
Advanced systems
The electronic throttle was first introduced by BMW in 1988 .
Like a conventional throttle system , it controls the flow of air into the engine .
Today , every new Toyota vehicle sold in the U.S. uses drive - by - wire .
The systems cost less to install on the assembly line and increase the efficiency of the vehicle .
To run these advanced throttle systems , each automaker develops its own electronic control modules and proprietary software that has unique control logic .
The operations of the systems are opaque to consumers , as are potential failures .
In a worst - case scenario , consultant Anderson says , stray electrical voltages , electromagnetic signals or bad sensor readings could cause an undetectable error within the car ’s network of up to 70 microprocessors , setting off an unpredictable chain of reactions .
One of those , he said , could be a command to completely open the throttle .
The auto industry has battled allegations of electronic defects in sudden - acceleration lawsuits for more than two decades , arguing that they are not caused by any vehicle defect .
Richard Schmidt , a former UCLA psychology professor and now an auto industry consultant specializing in human motor skills , said the problem almost always lies with drivers who step on the wrong pedal .
“ When the driver says they have their foot on the brake , they are just plain wrong , ” Schmidt said .
“ The human motor system is not perfect , and it does n’t always do what it is told . ”
To be sure , the complaints by Toyota and Lexus owners about sudden acceleration involve a tiny share of the company ’s vehicles on the road .
But runaway acceleration represents a high proportion of the complaints filed by consumers about Toyota in federal databases .
For the 2007 Lexus ES sedan , for example , 74 of 132 complaints filed with NHTSA alleged sudden acceleration .
And independent experts say the number of complaints actually filed is only a tiny fraction of all potential problems , because most people do n’t bother filing a report .
Critics say NHTSA has n’t kept pace with technological changes .
The auto industry has undergone a technological revolution in the last decade , and today about 25 % of a vehicle ’s price reflects its electronics content .
Nonetheless , NHTSA has adopted few , if any , standards for designing or testing vehicle electronics , according to industry officials .
Indeed , the agency ’s two - page safety standard for accelerators was adopted in 1973 .
Dale Kardos , who runs a consulting firm that helps automakers with regulatory issues , said manufacturers had repeatedly tried to get that standard updated because they feared they could no longer comply .
“ The industry would like to see standards written to reflect modern technology , ” Kardos said .
Instead , independent organizations and the industry itself are setting standards and developing safety policies .
The International Organization for Standardization , a nongovernment group that sets industrial standards , recently introduced a new standard for automakers to protect vehicle electronics .
Supplier TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. , which makes computerized controls for brakes and air bags , said its systems have multiple layers of redundancy to make sure electronic faults are detected and isolated .
“ Manufacturers ’ standards are far above the regulatory standards , ” said Ian Harvey , TRW ’s executive lead for electromechanical compatibility .
“ You would n’t want somebody to make a cellphone call and the air bag goes off .
That potentially could happen if you did n’t take the proper precautions . ”
Test drives
Despite the huge increase in complexity , when NHTSA investigators conduct field tests of alleged malfunctions of Toyota throttle systems , they rarely do more than drive suspect vehicles for a few miles , test the brakes and plug a diagnostic tool into their onboard computers to look for error codes , investigation records show .
Michael Pecht , a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland who has studied sudden acceleration for 10 years , said it ’s nearly impossible to replicate an electronic control system fault simply by driving a short distance .
“ These are not things that occur every day .
If it occurred a lot , you could track it down .
If it occurs once in 10,000 trips , then it is difficult to find , ” he said .
What ’s more , said Huei Peng , a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Michigan and a specialist in vehicle control systems , many of the kinds of electronic errors that a modern car is susceptible to are not detectable by the car ’s fault detection system .
“ When there ’s no error code , it does n’t mean there ’s no error , ” Peng said .
Despite the potential risks associated with electronic systems , NHTSA ’s own reports indicate it often does not test them while investigating unintended acceleration .
In a 2005 probe of Lexus ES vehicles , NHTSA reported that its investigator reviewed two vehicles that had allegedly surged out of control , but that “ no interrogation or communication with the electronic systems was performed ” before giving them a clean bill of health .
Texas resident Thomas Ritter , who has a mechanical engineering degree and spent 15 years as an engineer at General Motors , Chrysler and other auto and truck makers as well as 25 years designing oil exploration equipment , believes Toyota ’s acceleration problem lies in the electronics .
Last July , his wife was driving her 2006 Lexus ES 330 with four grandchildren near Houston when it accelerated out of control .
To avoid a wreck , she crossed four lanes of traffic before smashing into a masonry sign , totaling the car and deploying the air bags .
No one was seriously injured .
“ When you think about a machine operated by computers , almost anything can go wrong , ” Ritter said .
A ‘ smart pedal ’
Toyota announced Wednesday that it had developed a series of fixes to prevent floor mats from causing sudden acceleration .
In 4.26 million vehicles in the U.S. and Canada , Toyota said it would cut off a segment of the accelerator pedal and then later install a newly designed pedal .
It also will add a so - called smart pedal , software that cuts engine power any time both the accelerator pedal and brake pedal are depressed at the same time .
Such software has already been adopted as a safety feature by a number of automakers , including Volkswagen , Audi , Porsche , BMW , Nissan and Chrysler , the companies said .
Independent auto safety experts said that though all of Toyota ’s fixes would help reduce the problem , it has not gotten to the root cause .
“ These incidents are coming in left and right where you ca n’t blame the floor mats , ” said Sean Kane , president of the consulting firm Safety Research and Strategies .
“ So they are chipping away at a problem that is widespread and complicated without having to unravel a root cause that could be very expensive . ”

President Washington never owned a set of wooden teeth .
He did however own a set of hippopotamus ivory teeth , a set of horse teeth , donkey teeth , and human teeth ( from various sources ) , a set of 18kt gold teeth ( he tried 24 kt but they were too malleable ) , and a set of lead teeth , which were not particularly good for him .
These four sets of dentures ( the human and animal teeth were mixed ) are in the National Museum of Dentistry .
No other dentures of Washington have been discovered .
9 The Ruler of Hell
Amazingly , many Christians believe that Satan is sitting on a throne in Hell , laughing at all the agony of the poor damned souls , while his imps and demons run around with pitchforks .
None of this is Biblical .
Satan is quite frequently described as living on Earth , and doing what he does best , corrupting mankind .
The tradition of a ruler in Hell comes from the Greek god Hades , at least , and perhaps even earlier with the Egyptians .
Hades sits on the throne of the Underworld , just as Zeus , his brother , sits on the throne of Olympus .
The Biblical description of Hell is clearly anarchic .
No one is in charge .
Everyone is screaming and writhing , etc. , in a lake of fire .
Satan has never been there , and will not go until the end when he loses his fight against God .
The Christian tradition of Satan ruling Hell comes largely from John Milton ’s “ Paradise Lost . ”
“ Better to reign in Hell , than serve in Heav’n , ” Satan says , in Book I .
8 Express Your Anger
There is a very common myth about psychology in which people believe they will alleviate their anger by “ letting it out ” .
This is such a popular concept that many therapies have grown up around it – things like punchbags , squeeze balls , etc .
In fact , the opposite is found to be true .
When a person expresses their anger regularly , it becomes habit forming .
While there may appear to be a temporary relief from the anger when you smash a plate against the wall , ultimately your fits of anger will become an addiction and you will begin to seek out more reasons to become angry – in order to achieve that nice feeling .
So ultimate , the best thing to do : bottle it up !
7 Don Knotts the D. I .
Don Knotts , who played the lovable Barney Fife on the Andy Griffith Show , is said to have been a Marine Corps drill instructor during WWI , on Parris Island , SC , of the savage caliber of R. Lee Ermey .

Knotts enlisted in the Army , not the marines , and served as a traveling comedian , entertaining troops overseas , during WWII , but never trained anyone , and never fired a rifle at anyone .
6 Caffeine Stunts Growth
Caffeine will do a lot of negative things to you , but it will not stunt your growth .
It has nothing to do with growth .
Experiments have shown that children who consume caffeine do not grow any slower or less than children who are not allowed caffeine , over a period of years .
The myth was probably dreamed up by some clever parent who did n’t want his or her child drinking so much Pepsi .
5 Absinthe the Acid
Absinthe was never any more poisonous than whiskey .
The myth goes back at least to the 1800s , and claims that it causes hallucinations , as potently as LSD , and fries the brain .
Not true .
Absinthe is manufactured from Artemisia absinthium , a plant which has no poisons in it .
It is very bitter , like the Greek Ouzo , and the distillation process routinely results in absinthe proofs of 100 to 180 ( 50 % to 90 % alcohol by volume ) .
This is significantly stronger than the average whiskey , but will not affect the drinker in any way other than drunkenness .
The truth , though , is that during the Moulin Rouge days of Toulouse - Lautrec and van Gogh , starving artists liked getting drunk , and could n’t afford the good stuff .
So they bought absinthe from cheap street vendors , who did not care to sell uncontaminated products .
Cyanide and strychnine were found in this absinthe , and caused hallucinations .
Today , it is legal in the U. S. , and perfectly safe to drink if bought commercially .
4 Tornado Myths
Opening windows will not spare your house , or any other building , from a tornado ’s destructive power .
The strongest on record measured 318 mph , which is more than sufficient to blast any building into pieces , except steel - reinforced concrete , and even then , the building must be short , or the wind will blow it over .
Do not hide under overpasses .
The confined eaves in these places only increase the force of the wind , which has been reported as strong enough to drag F - 250 pickup trucks out from under overpasses and throw them through barns 1000 yards away .
Tornadoes can , in fact , form in winter , and cause just as severe damage as during any other season .
They have been seen traveling over snowfield , almost utterly white , and slamming into residential areas .
They can storm through large cities without any problem , as opposed to the belief that they will never damage Oklahoma City .
Fort Worth suffered one in 2000 , which killed 2 people , and destroyed 8 skyscrapers .
17 others were severely damaged .
60 + , in all , had their windows blown out .
3 Shakespeare the Wordwright
The myth has gone on for years now that Shakespeare invented about 1,700 words still common in English .
Not true .
He Anglicized many Latin and Greek words , among other languages , thus coining new English words .
But to be invented , a word must have no etymology before a single person imagines it .
He is said to have invented “ assassination , ” but what he did was derive it from the Medieval Latin “ assassinare , ” which means “ to kill an important person . ”
All of the words he is reputed to have invented can be explained this way .
He did , however , devise first name uses for quite a few words , including Viola , Jessica , and Adrian .
The first is Latin , the second Hebrew , the third Greek .
Sidenote : Sir Isaac Newton Anglicized “ gravitas , ” which is Latin for “ weight , ” into “ gravity . ”
As he was the first to discover the mechanism and its properties , how they work , he had to come up with a word for it .
No one else had ever called gravity anything .
2 Darwin and the Origin of Man
Debaters on both sides are grossly misinformed .
Darwin never states in his book On the Origin of Species that humans evolved from apes .
He states , quite differently , that apes and humans both evolved from a common ancestor .
This seems somewhat less offensive to fundamentalists , and if both sides were to consider it , it might smooth the relationship between fundamentalists and science .
1 Kangaroo
This story of how the kangaroo got its name is unfortunately not true .
It states that Captain James Cook first landed on Australia , near modern day Sydney , and met the Gweagal tribe of Aborigines on the beach .
At this moment , a kangaroo hopped out of the forest with its joey in its pouch and the Europeans , having never seen such a strange animal , asked the Aborigines , “ What in the world is that ? ! ”
The Aborigines turned to each other , then shrugged , and one of them said , “ Kangaroo ! ” which is Gweagal for , “ I do n’t understand what you ’re saying ! ”
Well , the truth is much more banal .
“ Kangaroo ” is derived from the Guugu Yimidhirr ( another Aborigine tribe ) word “ gangurru , ” which means … ” kangaroo . ”
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Hip - hop artist Lil Wayne pleaded guilty Thursday to attempted criminal possession of a weapon , the Manhattan district attorney 's office said .
Lil Wayne is expected to receive a one - year jail sentence for his guilty plea .
He is expected to receive a one - year jail sentence , the office said .
The Grammy Award - winning artist , whose real name is Dwayne Carter , is due for sentencing in February .
His trial had been scheduled to begin in January .
When he was indicted in February 2008 , Carter pleaded not guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a weapon , the district attorney 's office said .
His guilty plea Thursday was to a reduced charge .
He was arrested in July 2007 .
Police officers said Carter and another man were smoking marijuana on a street , and the officers found a .40 - caliber pistol in Carter 's possession .
Born and raised in New Orleans , Carter launched his solo career at age 16 with the release of " Tha Block is Hot " in 1999 .
He won two BET Awards in 2007 and four Grammy Awards in 2009 .

Registered cases of flu - like sickness and acute respiratory illnesses ( ARI ) since October are nearing 1 million , according to the country ’s Heath Ministry , which on Nov. 7 reported 936 , 804 cases and 144 deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic in October .
That ’s 65 , 767 more ARI cases and nine more deaths than the Health Ministry reported on Nov. 6 .
The Heath Ministry recorded increases of 237 , 160 and 40 , respectively , a day earlier on Nov. 5 .
The number of flu-related and ARI cases registered daily since mid-October presently exceeds the epidemic threshold in 16 of 27 of the country ’s oblasts , according to the latest statistics .
Milan , Italy , 16 November 2009 - Most of the linguistic functions in humans are controlled by the left cerebral hemisphere .
A study of captive chimpanzees at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center ( Atlanta , Georgia ) , reported in the January 2010 issue of Elsevier 's Cortex ( http://www . elsevier .
com/ locate / cortex ) , suggests that this " hemispheric lateralization " for language may have its evolutionary roots in the gestural communication of our common ancestors .
A large majority of the chimpanzees in the study showed a significant bias towards right - handed gestures when communicating , which may reflect a similar dominance of the left hemisphere for communication in chimpanzees as that seen for language functions in humans .
A team of researchers , supervised by Prof. William D. Hopkins of Agnes Scott College ( Decatur , Georgia ) , studied hand - use in 70 captive chimpanzees over a period of 10 months , recording a variety of communicative gestures specific to chimpanzees .
These included ' arm threat ' , ' extend arm ' or ' hand - slap ' gestures produced in different social contexts , such as attention - getting interactions , shared excitation , threat , aggression , greeting , reconciliation or invitations for grooming or for play .
The gestures were directed at the human observers , as well as toward other chimpanzees .
" The degree of predominance of the right hand for gestures is one of the most pronounced we have ever found in chimpanzees in comparison to other non-communicative manual actions .
We already found such manual biases in this species for pointing gestures exclusively directed to humans .
These additional data clearly showed that right - handedness for gestures is not specifically associated to interactions with humans , but generalizes to intraspecific communication " , notes Prof.
Hopkins .
The French co-authors , Dr. Adrien Meguerditchian and Prof. Jacques Vauclair , from the Aix - Marseille University ( Aix - en - Provence , France ) , also point out that " this finding provides additional support to the idea that speech evolved initially from a gestural communicative system in our ancestors .
Moreover , gestural communication in apes shares some key features with human language , such as intentionality , referential properties and flexibility of learning and use " .

Things were going along just fine for the last few years .
She and I had occasion to meet regularly , sometimes every evening in a week , if only for a few minutes at a time .
We had one of those relationships where everything just seemed to click .
It was like she was made for me .
But then my wife found out .
You could say she was n't very happy with how I was spending my time .
You could also say the Grand Canyon is a good - sized hole in the ground .
So now I 'm left with the unpleasant task of having to find a new companion for my mistress .
Normally I 'd just walk away , no strings , no fuss .
But I just can't bring myself to do that to her .
It 's a curious thing , but once you meet her I 'm sure you 'll understand .
Let me tell you a little bit about her .
She 's blonde , but not one of those blondes you see on the street every day .
No bottled , bleached , fakey blonde here .
Just beautiful , natural , rich blonde of the most enticing hues .
In sunlight it 's almost mesmerizing .
I 've never been anywhere with her that people did n't comment on how beautiful she is -- women as well as men .
It 's just how she is -- it 's like people can't help but say something when they see her .
I know how they feel .
I 've felt that way ever since I first saw her .
How did we meet ?
Well , that 's a story all in itself .
Funny thing is , she comes from a family of beauties .
Before I met her , I saw one of her sisters out with a friend of mine .
Being the witty guy I imagine myself to be , I asked that ever - original question , " Does she have a sister ? "
My friend , enjoying a good laugh at my expense , asked what I would like if I could have anything I wanted .
I told him , but it was n't until over a year later that I found out I had described her to a T .
I was stunned the first time I saw her -- even more stunned when he told me she was willing to go home with me .
Well , I could n't take her home , of course , and so started our clandestine relationship .
We would never be seen in public by anyone who knew me .
I much preferred to stay in with her anyway -- who needs a smoky night club when you have companionship like her ?
And what companionship !
Words can hardly describe her .
Slender , with curves in all the right places -- if you know what I mean .
Her favorite outfit is nothing but a little gold above the neck and around her waist .
Seductive does n't even begin to describe the nature of that look !
Speaking of looks , here are a few pictures so you can have a look at her .
If you 're interested in taking her home with you , please contact me .
I wo n't let her go with just anyone , but if the terms are right , I 'm sure we can come to an agreement .
Just do youself a favor : if you 're married , do n't let your wife find out .
On the other hand , I 'm told there are women who would love to have her in their house , too .
I do n't know about any of that , but as long as it's a good home , I 'll be happy for her .
Now that I have your attention , here are the details .
This is a custom - ordered 2002 Paul Reed Smith McCarty Hollowbody II .
I really did wait 13 months for delivery .
Why am I selling ?
I 'm shifting away from instruments ( of course I have too many ! ) and into my recording studio gear .

It 's in beautiful condition .
Here are some features :- Carved flame maple top and back .
I did n't order a 10 top , but I 've never seen closer to perfect with better flame - - front or back .

Our discussion of strategy after the setback for marriage equality in Maine needs to be guided by a vision of what it will take to win full equality , says Ann Coleman .
I WAS part of a group of more than 100 lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) activists who rallied in Boston November 4 in response to the vote on Question 1 that overturned marriage equality in the neighboring New England state of Maine .
At the rally , sponsored by Join the Impact Massachusetts ( JTIMA ) , the activists there asked a series of questions :
Why did we lose ?
What can we learn from a comparison with Washington state , where our side won ?
What kind of movement is needed to win full LGBT equality across the U.S. ?
Certainly the passage of Referendum 71 in Washington state -- which confirms a law that gives domestic partners most of the same rights as married couples , though not marriage itself -- is welcome after the defeat of marriage equality with California 's Proposition 8 last year .
But the passage of Question 1 in Maine - - which overturned the state 's gay marriage law - - is a disappointment and a setback for LGBT rights activists .
Do these election results show us that the people of Maine are less committed to equality than those in Washington state ?
Does it tell us that society is n't ready for marriage equality ?
The answer to both of questions is no .
Mainers rally against the Question 1 same - sex marriage ban in Portland ( Bryan Bruchman )
Unfortunately , the No on 1 campaign in Maine was coordinated by the same forces that won marriage equality in the state legislature , with a very narrow , lobbying - oriented approach .
The key strategists saw supporters of marriage equality merely as voters and volunteers , rather than potential activists for a grassroots movement that could link up with struggles beyond the LGBT community .
The No on 1 campaign appeared to be the only viable option for activists who wanted to get involved .
Thus , JTIMA mobilized about 40 volunteers over the past several months to assist with the campaign effort .
Many of the participants in the get - out - the - vote drive were still relatively new LGBT activists .
They 've gained a certain level of confidence and experience over the last year by organizing rallies , demonstrations and panels around transgender rights and marriage equality , and by mobilizing for the National Equality March last month .
Many of these activists poured their energy and time in the final weeks canvassing and phone banking in Maine - - and they were saddened and demoralized when the election results were announced .
At the November 4 rally , there was plenty of anger and frustration , too .
Many new activists wanted to step up the fight for equality , but few understood where to place the blame .
Some anger was directed at the entire state of Maine , with calls for boycotts of tourism and lobsters .
Others simply concluded that homophobia had won .
Most , however , wanted to dissect the No on 1 campaign to find flaws in its strategy , or blame other activists for failing to make Maine their top priority .
But the fact is that our side had more money and more people on the ground in the final weeks .
That money was used to run TV and radio ads more often and provide transportation for volunteers and voters .
And unlike the campaign against Prop 8 in California last year , pro-LGBT equality groups held rallies and demonstrations .
The effort to build a grassroots campaign came too late .
And campaign strategists attempted to keep the issue of marriage equality separate from transgender rights issues , as well as other issues facing the working people of Maine .
BUT BEYOND the methods used in the Maine campaign , there 's an even bigger problem -- the notion that our basic civil rights should be up for a vote .
Either our federal government grants us all rights under the 14th Amendment , or some of us will be treated like second - class citizens .
There 's no middle ground .
By limiting our movement to a state - by - state strategy , we play into the hands of our enemies .
In Washington state and Maine , the ballot initiatives exposed the depth of deception and bigotry of organized right - wing forces determined to overturn any legislative gains made for LGBT people .
Referendum 71 was launched by the Washington Values Alliance in an attempt to overturn Senate Bill 5688 -- signed into law in May , the legislation expanded domestic partnership rights in Washington state to the same state rights granted to heterosexual married couples .
In Maine , Question 1 was launched by the group Stand for Marriage Maine to overturn a law granting same - sex marriage that was passed by the state legislature and signed by Gov. John Baldacci in May .
Many people find the state voter initiative process invigorating , especially compared to the corporate - dominated politics of Washington , D.C.
In reality , the referendum process can be used to confuse voters and shape public debate in a way that 's far too limiting to achieve the fundamental changes needed to win full LGBT equality .
And the same money and big players who dominate Washington politics have found a way to hijack the state referendum process , utilizing it as a way to illustrate that " the people " are not ready for progress .
While watching the returns on Referendum 71 and Question 1 on election night , I was reminded of the lessons of the civil rights movement .
Civil rights activists started organizing as early as 1945 , when African American soldiers came back from fighting for " freedom " in the Second World War , only to find that they still lived under segregation and were denied voting rights .
The initial gains were modest and often met by violent repression .
But at every step of the way , activists were organizing an independent movement that aimed to pressure those in power to come down on the right side of history .
Whether it was the fight to desegregate schools or the struggle for social and economic justice , the mass civil rights movement that developed through the 1950s and ' 60s did more to change the public debate on the issues and gain protections under the law than any single campaign tied to electoral politics .
By contrast , the effort to win LGBT rights over the last 20 years has been relegated to a piecemeal , " time is on our side " approach .
Calls to wait , be patient and let others work through the legislative process has not only demobilized our side , but cut us off from potential allies .
If we wage a clear and uncompromising fight for equality , we have a better chance to win allies among those who see the connections to their own struggles for justice and equality .
What 's more , the state - by - state strategy diverts us from taking on the federal laws that give cover to the anti-gay bigots .
As long as the federal Defense of Marriage Act and the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy remain intact , the struggle for LGBT equality will be shaped by the right wing and leave the door open to further discrimination .
WE NEED to look critically at the mainstream press and publicly debate the issues before us .
We need to talk to our neighbors , coworkers and classmates to find out how the struggle for equality fits into a struggle against corporate - dominated politics -- and organize ourselves to create the change we desire .
If there was ever any doubt about whether ordinary people would stand up for equality , the grassroots push in the final weeks around Question 1 showed us the way forward , even if it came up short .
Moreover , the Gallup organization has collected data showing a dramatic increase in support for lesbian and gay rights in the workplace - - from 56 percent support for equal rights in the workplace in 1978 to topping 80 percent in 1993 .
If in 2008 , 89 percent of the public thinks that homosexuals should n't be discriminated against in the workplace , the challenge for us is how to turn that sentiment into an organized force that 's willing to stand up and push for LGBT equality in all matters of civil law - - no matter who 's in office .
The defeat for marriage equality in Maine must be seen from that perspective .
Our discussion of strategy and tactics must be guided by a vision of what it is going to take to win full equality -- and nothing less .
( a Jul 30 , 2003 blog of mine on Ecademy … not much has changed .
Or has it ? )
In a few words here by John Houghton , former chief executive of the British Meteorological Office
Human induced global climate change is a weapon of mass destruction at least as dangerous as nuclear , chemical or biological arms , a leading British climate scientist said Monday
Well , I refuse to join Mr Houghton and his fellow scaremongers and agitators .
Human - caused Climate Change is something big enough to be extra-ordinary enough to warrant extra-ordinary proof .
For heaven ’s sake , somebody is claiming that humans can have effects over a planet - wide phenomenon .
Those same humans that ca n’t predict earthquakes , ca n’t switch off a volcano , ca n’t change the course of ocean currents , ca n’t stop hurricanes , ca n’t make sustainable quantities of rain , ca n’t even generate nor control wind ( of the non-intestinal variety ) .
We have no idea of entire major waterflows in the North Atlantic , and yet somebody thinks to be able to cause ( and to tell ) a few degrees difference in the Earth ’s climate over 50 or 100 years ?
Vague threats and doom - and - gloom scenarios make little sense .
Give me a break .
Or give me evidence that the climate is really changing because of humans .
For example by showing what is the difference between the current temperature changes and those that happened over 3 or 4 years at the end of the “ little ice age ” in the mid-1800s ( surely those were not man-made ) ?
Or by showing how the amount of emissions by humans can compare to the natural ones ?
Or by comparing the energy used and release by humans to that involved in the Earth ’s working on a daily basis ?
To understand the situation , I did some quick computations last year to find out that all energy ever generated by humans would rise the ocean temperature by hundredths if not thousandth ( 0.01 to 0.001 ) of a degree…ours is still a big planet indeed , tampering with it requires enormous quantities of energy and I am aware of little work done in planetary engineering .
My mind is open to explanations , and I can definitely talk to people saying “ Beware the climate beast “ .
But I wo n’t listen to those that panic to claim that the world is ending tomorrow ( or this century , or this millennium ) .
The history of medicine is a noble one , with an ultimate goal of extending human life and easing human suffering .
Unfortunately , medicine also has its share of charlatans , con-men , and incompetents whose greatest evil is to cast doubt on the benefits of any medicine in the minds of laymen .
Merriam - Webster defines a “ quack ” as “ a pretender to medical skill ” .
Presented here are some self - proclaimed , as well as licensed , “ pretenders ” who may have had the best of intentions , but certainly achieved the worst of results .
10 Paul Chamberlen 1635 - 1717
The purported inventor of the “ Anodyne Necklace ” , Chamberlen claimed that the necklace would help “ children ’s teethe as well as woman ’s labour ” .
It is no shock that children during the eighteenth century often died as infants , and as many times during infancy the baby is teething , it may have seemed natural that the teething itself was the source of illness and death .
The Anodyne Necklace was invented to simply place around a baby ’s neck to prevent infant death during teething .
Chamberlen deserves the last place on this list for preying and capitalizing on the grief and terror of parents who were more often than not during this period resigned to the fact that their children would be more likely to die in infancy than to make it to adulthood .
Unbelievably , such necklaces are still being sold today , despite an utter lack of evidence of their efficacy .
See for yourself .
9 Albert Abrams 1863 – 1924
Invented the Dynamizer , which he claimed could diagnose any ailment simply by feeding into it a slip of paper upon which had been blotted a drop of the patient ’s blood .
If a drop of blood was unavailable or the patient did n’t want to give it , a handwriting sample would suffice !
One made the Dynamizer work by connecting it with an electrode to the forehead of an assistant , who was stripped bare to the waist .
Then the assistant was turned to face
West under dim light and his abdomen struck repeatedly with a mallet .
The vibrations coming off the assistant ’s abdomen would indicate to the doctor the nature of the disease .
The medical community , ever the distrustful skeptics , sent an Abrams practitioner a drop of rooster blood to be analyzed with the Dynamizer .
The “ patient ” was diagnosed with malaria , syphilis , diabetes , and cancer .
8 Bernard Jensen 1908 – 2001
Famous American chiropractor and iridologist who asserts that all of the body ’s underlying dysfunctions and toxins can be identified through the iris ( colored part ) of the eye , despite the fact that the iris does not undergo major changes during a person ’s life .
Nevertheless , Jensen insisted that darker areas of the iris , or areas that changed from lighter to darker , would be read as indications that there were problems or diseases in the corresponding part of the body .
Different areas of the iris would represent different limbs and organs , and the left and right eye would be read differently .
For instance , if the bottom of your right eye ’s iris had a dark fleck , your right kidney would be in grave danger .
You can view one of Jensen ’s iridology charts here .
7 Dinshah Ghadiali 1873 – 1966
Invented the Spectro - Chrome , which he claimed could cure ailments by changing the color of the light to which the patient was exposed .
His theory was that different colors corresponded to different elements ( blue = oxygen , red = hydrogen , etc. ) , and the lack of those elements in the body was what caused disease .
Hence , if the body was exposed to that color for a prolonged period , the deficiency would be remedied , and the disease cured .
Any disease except broken bones could be cured in this manner ; furthermore , the patient did not necessarily have to be exposed directly to the colored lights : he or she could also drink liquids out of an appropriately colored bottle in order to achieve the same effects .
6 D.D. Palmer 1845 – 1913
Father of modern chiropractic , Palmer ’s scientific method , leading to his theory that misalignment of the spine is the most common cause of all illness in the human body , boiled down to two incidents : 1 ) he whacked a deaf janitor with a book during some witty banter , and a few days later the man claimed he could hear better , and 2 ) he manipulated an undisclosed patient ’s spine and “ cured ” her vague “ heart trouble ” .
On these two incidents alone , Palmer postulated that there was a fluid called “ Innate Intelligence ” flowing through the body that could heal any ailment and that could be made to flow more easily by unblocking pathways through the manipulation of the spine .
As chiropractic is a very common practice today , this will most likely be the most controversial of the entries on this list .
5 William J.A. Bailey 1884 – 1949
President of “ Radium Company ” of New York and a self - proclaimed doctor who never received his medical degree , he prescribed to his patients “ Radithor ” , essentially a solution of radium in regular water , which he asserted would help invigorate tired patients .
His most notable patient was Eben Byers , a wealthy industrialist , who drank 1400 bottles of Radithor before having his jaw fall off and subsequently dying from radiation poisoning .
Upon Byers ’ death , it was discovered that the radium had eaten massive holes in his brain and skull .
Bailey also marketed a radioactive belt - clip ( for portable “ energy ” ) and a radioactive paperweight ( presumably to perk up lethargic businessmen ) .
4 John Harvey Kellogg 1852-1943
Immortalized in T. Coraghessan Boyle ’s book “ The Road to Wellville ” , which was later made into a move starring Anthony Hopkins as Kellogg , and the brother of cereal magnate Will Kellogg , J.H. Kellogg , one of the few licensed medical doctors on this list , is well - known as an eccentric and monomaniacal leader of the “ health movement ” .
His sanitarium in Battle Creek drew large numbers of “ patients ” who apparently volunteered for such masochistic treatments as : complete abstinence from any sexual activity , since it was the source of most illness ; yogurt enemas to cleanse the body ; marching while eating meals to help digestion ; carbolic acid applications to the clitoris to prevent female masturbation ; and immersion in freezing water laced with radium .
Apparently , he , not Will , was the original Frosted Flake .
3 John R. Brinkley 1885 - 1942
The “ goat gland ” doctor , Brinkley performed hundreds of surgeries on men who feared that their most virile days were behind them by opening up their scrotal sacs and nestling goat ’s testicles alongside the men’s .
There was no arterial conjoining , no grafting , no fusion – the goat gland and human testicle merely occupied the same sac , but Brinkley claimed that the extra flow of testosterone would revitalize a male patient ’s sex life .
Legend has it that his hypothesis turned into implementation while working for a meatpacking company , Brinkley was astounded by the sexual voracity of the goats , thus prompting him to half - jokingly suggest to his undersexed patient that he should try goat glands ; to this suggestion his desperate patient responded , “ So doc , put ‘ em in .
Transplant ‘em ! ” Brinkley went on to perform over 16,000 goat gland transplants .
He also arguably established the first radio advice talk show in order to advertise himself and his services to as many potential patients as possible .
The book “ Charlatan : America ’s Most Dangerous Huckster ” , by Pope Brock , is an excellent starting point to learn more about this irrepressible lunatic .
2 Walter Freeman 1895 – 1972
A prominent neurologist and psychiatrist , he popularized the lobotomy by making it easy and convenient : “ perfecting ” the transorbital lobotomy , where a sharp implement ( the first was an icepick from his own kitchen ) was inserted through the inside corner of the eye , tapped with a small hammer until it broke through the skull bone and entered the frontal lobe of the patient ’s brain , then wiggled around like a stir - stick to cut neural connections .
These “ surgeries ” were performed outside of the operating room , without anesthetic , and after the patient was incapacitated by electroshock therapy .
Freeman eventually developed his own instrument for performing the lobotomies called the “ leucotome ” .
He decided to refine his instrument further when one broke off inside a patient ’s orbital socket .
Even after his medical license was revoked for killing a patient with his technique , he would travel the country in his “ Lobotomobile ” to service the needy and the isolated .
He performed 3,439 lobotomies during his career , though the psychological and physical damage caused by his practice of psychiatry is unquantifiable .
For an amazing and heartbreaking first - person account of an 11 - year - old victim ’s lobotomy by Freeman , “ My Lobotomy ” by Howard Dully is a must - read .
1 Josef Mengele 1911 – 1979
No list about quacks would be complete without mentioning this undisputed king of cruel and inhuman “ research experiments ” .
The “ Angel of Death ” at Auschwitz , Mengele ’s crimes against humanity during World War II at the concentration camp are well - documented and well - known .
Some of the more notable and horrendous “ experiments ” he carried out were : injecting dyes into children ’s eyes to see if eye color could be changed ; attempting to measure how much force would be needed to break a human being ’s skull ( while living , of course ) ; putting Jewish prisoners in a gigantic oven and testing how long it would take for human flesh to sustain first - , second - , and third - degree burns ; sewing twins together to see if he could create conjoined twins ; and rubbed ground glass into injuries to see what the effect would be .
The damage Mengele did to an entire race of people , to the human spirit , and to our perception of the depravity the human mind can invent is still unsurpassed .
Recession Reality : People With Good Jobs Need 2nd Jobs
When one otherwise good job wo n't do , white collar workers scramble for cash .
Oct. 27 , 2009  --
Like a lot of Americans hit by the recession , Robert Stokely found himself in a serious cash crunch earlier this year .
After taking a hard look at his check book , 56 - year old Stokely approached the manager at a local Wendy 's and asked for a job working the counter .
He got it -- a $ 7.25 - per - hour position cooking French fries .
But , unlike many of his counter co-workers , Stokely already had a pretty good day job , one that paid him $ 93,000 a year .
In fact , Stokely is the Coweta County , Ga. , solicitor general -- an elected position .
" I make a very good living , I 'm not complaining , but last year my cost of living raise went down the tubes , my car payment doubled and I was living paycheck to paycheck , " said Stokely .
The father of three did n't need much -- he was coming up short by just a few hundred dollars a month .
But he did n't want to go into debt and get behind on his financial obligations so the Wendy 's gig seemed perfect , in part , because it was right on the way home from his day job .
" I needed something that was flexible and after hours and when you 're working for minimum wage you do n't want to spend a lot of money on gas , " Stokely said .
From Elected Official to Wendy's Fry Guy
The reaction to Stokely 's moonlighting was decidedly mixed .
His son thought it was funny but his wife was n't too fond of the idea .
As for the folks ordering a baconator with fries ?
" People judge you .
I 'm an elected official , " Stokely said .
" Some people definitely did a double take they would ask me , ' What are you doing here ? ' and I would say right back , ' I 'm making money like everyone else . ' "
That 's all Alex Metricarti is trying to do , too -- make a little extra money .
Metricarti has a full - time job as a marketing administrator at Eastern University in St. Davids , Pa. , but these days the 40 - year - old mother of two also moonlights as a real estate agent .
" The two - job thing is stressful , but it does offer me peace of mind , " she said .
" I do n't have to worry about every penny now or what would happen if someone gets hurt and we got hit with medical bills .
In this economy I can't imagine what it would be like if I did n't have a second job . "
Moonlighting 101 : When to Get a Second Job
Metricarti and her husband both have stable full - time jobs , but neither one of them received a pay raise this year and her husband 's company cut both his overtime and his 401k match .
In part , Metricarti said , it 's their commitment to providing extra curricular opportunities for their two boys -- Jacob , 12 , and Dominic , 8 -- that drives her to work a second job .
When Being a Parent Starts to Add Up
" We do n't do anything crazy , but my son is playing football and that costs $ 175 , we go to museums ... it starts to add up , " she said .
A typical day in this two - parent , triple - income family has Metricarti getting up early to get the kids off to school .
Then she heads to Eastern University for a full day 's work .
At 5:30 p.m. she rushes home , makes dinner and spends time with her kids before heading out to show a house .
" I did n't expect to be in this position .
I definitely do n't feel desperate .
I feel OK , but I did n't expect to have to be working two jobs at my age , " she said .
Metricarti certainly is n't alone .
A recent study commissioned by CareerBuilder.com found that one in 10 people surveyed are working more than one job .
And many more might be soon .
Because the same study said that 61 percent of the 4,400 workers surveyed are living paycheck to paycheck .
Roy Krause , CEO of Spherion , a national recruitment and staffing company has also noticed an increase in the number of people with full - time jobs looking to do a little moonlighting .
" Traditionally , we would see this kind of thing seasonally , at Christmas but now we 're seeing a lot more people looking for multiple jobs -- an uptick of as much as 15 percent , " said Krause , who added that the numbers are up even more in California .
The workers most affected seem to be in the " light industrial areas , " people who work in warehouses packing orders or call centers , he said .
Jon Osman of Pittsburgh , Pa. , said thought he would spend the rest of his working life doing something he loved -- selling houses .
But the market crashed just as the 45 - year - old had two kids in college and two about to graduate high school .
Moonlighting 101 : When to Get a Second Job
Although Osman and his wife could pay their bills every month , they were facing an onslaught of college tuition bills .
" We decided to be proactive rather than reactive , " he said .
" We did n't want to run up our credit cards . "
When the father of four examined his options , he realized he needed cash flow -- quick .
So Osman began to moonlight as a limo driver .
Killing One Bird With Two Stones
" Their first question was ' What do you want a job for ? '
I guess I did n't seem like their typical applicant , but I just said I could use the extra money , " he said .
He has been driving for the Silver Fox Limo Company for over a year now and said it 's working out pretty well .
" I have been working a lot , driving the limo , and the Silver Fox people have been terrific , but I am still working my real estate job , " Osman said .
" If I do weddings , I bring my laptop with me and I can get a lot of work done sitting outside the church . "
He appreciates the steady paycheck that comes courtesy of his limo job , and he likes meeting " interesting people , " but said he is looking forward to the day when he can walk away from the limo for good .
" I would prefer to sell real estate , to be honest , " he said .
Stokely , on the other hand , still works at Wendy 's every once in a while even though his budget crisis has eased somewhat .
He said the whole episode has taught him an important lesson .
" I think there was this sense among some people that I 'm a lawyer and it's not dignified or something that I would go work at Wendy's , but to me that 's the way the American spirit is , " he said .
" When you need the money , you go work for it . "

U Nemačkoj je na desetine univerziteta od utorka u potpunoj blokadi , a nekoliko desetina hiljada studenata započelo je proteste širom zemlje zahtevajući reformu obrazovnog sistema i veću finansijsku podršku .
Istovremeno , demonstracije su prelile i u još nekoliko evropskih zemalja poput Italije , Austrije i Francuske .
U nemačkoj prestonici , Berlinu , gde policija navodi da se broj demonstranata kreće oko 5 000 , studenti i profesori su nosili transparente sa natpisima '' Besplatno obrazovanje za sve ' ' , '' Obrazovanje , a ne banke ' ' i '' Obrazovanje je preskupo !
Kolika je cena gluposti ?''.
Studenti su u početku zauzeli amfiteatre i slušaonice , a zatim su , zajedno sa nekim profesorima , izašli na ulice .
Nezadovoljstvo se iz glavnog grada
Nemačke proširilo i u ostale gradove , poput Minhena , Hamburga , Hajdelberga i Kelna , a prema rečima organizatora u 50 nemačkih gradova ovih dana protestuje oko 85 000 ljudi .
Akademci traže da visina školarina - koja se trenutno kreće između 100 i 500 evra po semestru - bude smanjena , kao i da visina školarina bude prilagođena siromašnijim studentima , ne na osnovu prosečne ocene , već na osnovu individualne finansijske situacije .
'' Mi nismo ljudski resursi .
Obrazovanje za sve , u suprotnom će izbiti neredi '' , kazao je jedan od govornika na protestu .
Nije mali broj onih koji smatraju da je pristup visoko školskom obrazovanju otežan za one koji su u slabijoj finansijskoj situaciji .
Čini se da se većina onih koji su izašli na ulice Berlina prvenstveno ose ća iznevereno .
Katrin Lilinger , studentkinja prve godine psihologije na Univerzitetu u Berlinu , kaže : '' To je tužno .
Mislim da je ceo kurs interesantan , ali gradivo je toliko sabijeno da mi je drago kada je predavanje otkazano .
Studentima treba pružiti mogućnost da razvijaju kritičko mišljenje , ali za to nema vremena , time se ne stvaraju uslovi za pojavu kreativnih ideja . ''
Italijnski studenti takođe su izašli na ulice 50 gradova širom te zemlje kako bi iskazali svoje neslaganje sa reformama obrazovnog sistema , koje je nedavno najavio premijer Silvio Berluskoni .
Kako piše slovenački Dnevnik , studenti u Rimu su prošetali do zgrade Vlade , dok je na protestima u Milanu došlo do tenzija između protestanata i policije , nakon čega su četiri studenta uhapšena .
Demonstranti su uzvikivali parole u kojima se traži jednako obrazovanje za sve građane i u kojima se Vlada optužuje da će novom reformom osiromašiti italijanski visoko školski sistem .
Reforma , koju je pripremila ministarka obrazovanja Mariastela Đelmini , predviđa značajne mere štednje na italijanskim univerzitetima .
Prema novom paketu reformi , pet penzionisanih profesora biće zamenjeni samo jednim .
Istovremeno , planiraju se radikalne promene prilikom izbora novih profesora , stroži uslovi za upis na visoke škole , kao i smanjenje broja kako profesora , tako i studenata .
Osnovni povod za proteste širom Evrope je takozvana bolonjska reforma , kojom su studentni nezadovoljni .
Ona se već deset godina postepeno uvodi na univeritete širom Evrope , s ciljem da obrazovanje učini istovrednim , čime bi studenti mogli lakše da se obrazuju i usavršavaju svoja znanja u inostranstvu .
Međutim , Bolonjski proces doveo je do sabijanja gradiva , racionalizacije studijskih grupa , sve viših školarina i istovremeno nižih kriterijuma prilikom ocenjivanja , čime se univerzitetsko obrazovanje spušta na nivo običnog privatnog preduzeća , čiji je jedini cilj ubiranje što većeg profita .
Akademci u Nemačkoj nezadovoljni su uvođenjem obaveznog prisustva na predavanjima ( koje im , prema rečima nekih od njih , uskraćuje mogućnost zaposlenja tokom studiranja ) , konstantnim testovima tokom cele godine , kao i činjenicom da mnogi nakon osnovnih studija ne mogu da pređu na viši stepen obrazovanja , pošto mogućnost za sticanje zvanja mastera imaju samo najbolji .
'' Iluzija je da se čovek može zaposliti ako ima samo osnovni nivo obrazovanja .
Master studije su preduslov za bolji posao '' , smatra Lilingerova .
Nemačka minitarka prosvete , Aneta Šavan , priznala je da u novom sistemu postoje izvesni problemi , dodavši da je za novoizabranu koalicionu vladu Angele Merkel jedan od prioriteta izdvajanje sredstava za studente iz nemačkog sistema finansijske pomoći .
Inače , pre samo dve nedelje , Šavanova je odbacila predlog za povećanje finansijske pomoći studentima .
Studentskoj buni u Evropi pridružili su se i akademci iz Švajcarske .
U Bernu i Bazelu su zauzeli amfiteatre na univerzitetu protestvjući protiv " ekonomizacije " obrazovanja a slični vid protesta se najavljuje u Cirihu i Ženevi .
U Bazelu je rektor univerziteata pretio da ukoliko demonstranti ne izađu iz amfiteatra da će im uprava fakulteta isključiti struju i grejanje .
Last week the Digital Economy Bill was released and included tough measures to deal with illicit file - sharing .
It was preceded by a consultation period where individuals , consumer groups and ISPs voiced serious concerns over the proposals .
The government seems to have completely ignored them - not so the rights holders .
Last week , details finally emerged concerning the Digital Economy Bill .
In a nutshell , the bill aims to turn elements of Lord Carter ’s Digital Britain report into law .
Internet users will face being monitored by the music and movie industries , and their ISPs forced to pass on infringement notices based on rights holder supplied evidence alone .
ISPs will also have to keep records of who gets warnings and share this information with the rights holders .
If reduction targets are n’t met , file - sharers could have action taken against them by their own ISP , including the ultimate sanction of disconnection , all this without setting foot in a court .
Also on the cards is allowing changes to UK copyright law without Parliamentary oversight , which means whatever the government decides to do , it can , with no threat of being blocked .
Under the influence of the music and movie industries as it is , this can only go one way .
One of the benefits of living in a democracy is that entities like the Digital Economy Bill are preceded by everyone having their say .
Rights holders , Internet service providers , consumer groups and , of course , the lowly individual , were allowed to participate via the BERR consultation .
While rights holders achieved almost everything they asked for and will undoubtedly be very happy with the outcome , the government insisted last week that ISPs were also widely supporting the Digital Economy Bill .
But that claim turned out to be false , with the Internet Service Providers Association saying that it was “ extremely disappointed ” with aspects of the proposals aimed at illicit file - sharing .
Consumer groups also submitted to the consultation , including those from Which ? and BeingThreatened , a portal created to provide help and support to ISP account holders who have been wrongfully accused of infringement by copyright holders .
“ We are extremely disappointed , though not at all surprised with the nature of the response the government have given .
Despite the 13 page response consisting of 11 pages of summary , much of which relates to the concern over the evidential collection , due process and appropriate appeal , the government makes absolutely no mention of this in the response , ” they told TorrentFreak .
Indeed , as they quite rightly point out , the only items that remain in focus are those relating to protecting the entertainment industries by the introduction of technological solutions and a 3 strikes - style regime .
“ The government response fails completely to put any provisions in place to deal with mistaken allegations .
Whilst there is a right for appeal , there is no consequence to a rights holder for making vexatious and false claims , ” they added .
Also of concern is that the new system being put forward by the government does not trump the old system , indeed they will remain in operation together .
If rights holders and lawyers such as ACS : Law wish to continue with their campaigns of sending letters and demanding huge sums of money instead , they will be perfectly entitled to do so , perhaps with the added assistance of the new information ISPs will be compelled to store .
However , what BeingThreatened find most disappointing is that despite a large opposition to the plans to deal with file - sharing , many of the dissenting voices have simply been ignored , with the government giving submissions from rights holders and their umbrella groups absolute priority .
“ This does not give the majority of respondents from our community a feeling that democracy has been observed .
It is clear that the consultation , at least from the government ’s point of view , was nothing more than a box - ticking exercise .
It looks suspiciously like there was never any intent to engage in a transparent democratic process .
I am certain that our group will not be alone in these views , ” they added .
The full statement BeingThreatened can be found here and all the ( corporate and individual ) responses to the consultation are available on the BERR website .

McLaren - Mercedes is as strong as it has ever been and there are no plans to end the relationship in the near future , according to Mercedes motorsport boss Norbert Haug .
Although there has been reports that Mercedes - Benz is considering buying a majority stake in the Brawn GP team , Haug made it clear that the German car maker is fully committed to its partnership with McLaren .
Daimler , owner of Mercedes , has a 40 per cent stake in the British squad .
Haug says he sees no reason why Mercedes would look for a way out of its partnership , as he reckons that , after turning its 2009 season around , McLaren - Mercedes is at it best .
" There is a very firm decision that we have a long - term commitment with our partner McLaren , " said Haug .
" Rather than going into speculation , I have to point out that this team works better together than ever before .
" The guys did a remarkable job , we were really quite lost at the beginning of the season and internally we discussed , we need to be there at the home GP at the Nurburgring .
We saw what happened .
" It is not like turning a switch and we are there , there was a lot of work and I think what was remarkable for McLaren and the chassis guys , a completely new style was adapted .
" This team was about testing , learning , evaluating , and you saw that when the truck comes to the races and brings the parts on Friday morning and you check and double check and make back - to - back tests there was a lot of work in the garage .
" The way these guys learned to anticipate what will happen , what will be the next tenth of a second and so on , I think this five / six months period was probably the best learning history in the history of McLaren , in the history of our team definitely , and it shows this team is stronger than ever .
" If you compare it to half a year ago , and you do an overlay of all team 's performance , then we scored more points in the last seven races .
We also lost some , like Monza and Nurburgring .
This is a real important statement , this team is probably better than ever . "
He added : " I think the relationship inside the team , inside the working , people here at the race track , is absolutely great and fantastic .
We have had lots of difficulties , Australia and Malaysia , but coming out of that , and being there at the end of the season is just fantastic .
This will continue .
" To discuss other issues and other options that are in the background that are internally discussed is not the right thing to do .
No decisions are taken , the only decision that is taken is that we are firm here , partners , and our connected for a long period of time . "
McLaren boss Martin Whitmarsh agreed that the working relationship between the two companies was in a great state .
" The only thing I would add is Daimler is a 40 percent shareholder , a very important shareholder and they have been a fantastic partner for 15 years and we are going to be together for a long time to come , " Whitmarsh said .
McLaren finished in third position in this year 's standings after winning two races , having endured a dismal start to the season .

The web is a complex beast .
There are many moving parts involved in delivering a complete web application today .
For a significant portion of my career , I have focused primarily on the architecture and implementation of the parts that an end - user never sees .
Racks , servers , databases , switches , routers and load - balancers ; the list goes on , but you get the point .
The goal of such an architecture , of course , is to receive a user ’s HTTP request and construct and return a complete result as quickly as possible .
To say that there are “ a lot of moving parts ” in today ’s web architectures is an understatement — they are beasts .
What makes this even more complicated is that once you spew forth the result to the end - user you have a daunting set of user - perceptible performance issues remaining to be addressed .
This performance challenge happens in a hostile environment : one we do not control ( the user ’s computer ) over a long - haul network we do not control driven via a browser we did not select — a daunting challenge indeed .
We are very fortunate to have excellent tools at our disposal with which to tackle this challenge .
Two of my favorites are Yahoo ’s YSlow ! and Google ’s Page Speed tools .
Both are extensions to the most excellent FireBug add - on for Mozilla ’s FireFox web browser .
Both tools will help you dissect the various aspects of the content you deliver to end -users and understand how each bit will contribute to perceived slowness .
In the web ( and most other things in life ) perception is king .
A user ’s perception drives their response .
Irony : the not - so - delicious kind .
I recently attended the Velocity conference and the first workshop I attended was Steve Souders ’ excellent presentation on Website Performance Analysis .
Steve Souders is the original author of YSlow !
which I use on a daily basis .
Steve used YSlow ! to show how to analyze website performance ( as one might have assumed from his workshop title ) .
I popped open YSlow ! on our corporate website and ... horror !
While OmniTI has enormous breadth in the Internet space , we are primarily known as an Internet performance and scalability company .
This made the fact that we received an F on YSlow ! all the more embarrassing .
This was a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing — something we evangelize against .
I decided that I would fix that and aim to do it by the end of Steve 's presentation .
A play - by - play follows .
No Expires Headers .
It turns out that our images , javascript , and CSS did n’t have expires headers .
Our CSS is in a directory / c / , our javascript is located in / js / , and all our images are in /i /.
I could do this by content type , but a location - based approach gives me the flexibility of serving dynamic / uncacheable content with those content types if I choose to later :
< Directory " /www/sites/omniti.com/www/i " >
ExpiresActive On ExpiresDefault " access plus 1 month " </ Directory > < Directory " /www/sites/omniti.com/www/c " >
ExpiresActive On ExpiresDefault " access plus 1 month " </ Directory > < Directory " /www/sites/omniti.com/www/js " >
ExpiresActive On ExpiresDefault " access plus 1 month " </ Directory >
Using Etags .
Etags are on .
This is n’t really a problem in and of itself , but since some of our static content can be served by multiple machines and the Etag in Apache is based off inode , it will be different from machine to machine and cause issues :
< FilesMatch " \.( js|css|gif|png|jpe?g ) $ " >
FileETag None </ FilesMatch >
Uncompressed content .
This is even easier .
We run Apache 2.2 , so :
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE \ text / html text / plain text / xml \ application / javascript text / css
No CDN .
We have a fast CDN - like caching layer residing at s.omniti .
net that we can leverage ... so I flipped all the images over to that .
Technically , this is cheating because you have to add s.omniti. net to the YSlow !
configuration to be recognized as a CDN .
I was pleased to learn that even without formally moving the images to a known CDN , we still moved to an A rating in YSlow !
Assets served from a domain with cookies .
The move of all static assets to s.omniti. net resolved this issue .
This goes to show that even if you do n’t have a CDN , simply putting your static assets in a different domain ( that has no cookies ) can considerably speed performance in two ways : ( 1 ) it allows for more concurrency on the network layer and ( 2 ) it reduces the upstream payload for quicker requests .
The result ?
A noticeably faster web site in under 45 minutes .
Before I fixed things up , it took 486 ms to render ( over the conference Internet connection ) .
After , a bit of work , I was able to drop the time - to - render to 315 ms over the same link .
That 's a 35 % reduction and it almost drops the page load time down into the “ so fast it does n’t matter ” arena .
There are several things I ’d like to do that would further improve page load / render times .
The javascript used could be consolidated into a single js file ( aside from the web analytics parts ) .
The CSS could also be consolidated from two files to one .
On our about page we have thumbnail photos of all our staff , they are all the same size and we could easily turn this into a single image and use CSS sprites ; that would dramatically improve the perceived performance of that page .
Some things we did right ?
Our search is wicked fast as we pull the results in AJAX and make a single DOM manipulation to visualize them .
Next steps .
Go fix your site .
Make it faster .
Make the web a better place .
It took me 45 minutes to make significant positive impact .
Granted , if I did n’t know your web application or it was more complicated than our corporate site ( which I believe all are ) , it will take a bit longer .
It ’s worth it .
Do it .
Or hire us to do it .
How should humanity share the cost of action on climate change ?
Without an answer to this question , the world will not secure a strong and binding deal on the climate at Copenhagen next month , and we will continue on a path towards an increasingly inhospitable world .
As many key players have warned , there is a real chance of failure .
The Swedish prime minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt , warns that negotiations are faltering because the west is unwilling to offer financing to emerging economies , and the developing world wo n't budge without the promise of cash .
US Senators on both sides of the aisle are doing all they can to block action with talk of danger to jobs and the US economy .
Countries in eastern Europe say that contributing too much will wreck their fragile economies , and wealthier westerners are unwilling to fix numbers , hoping to translate silence into a stronger bargaining position with the US and Japan .
No one wants to pay too much , and everyone wants someone else to pay more .
This is only rational , is n't it , just part of getting a fair deal for all ?
It depends on how one counts the cost of climate change .
Some insist that the options on the table are simply too expensive .
No deal is better than a deal which costs us too much .
Money is the determining factor – not warnings about a grim future or something as wishy - washy as concern for the poor .
As idiotic as this sounds , it nevertheless gets you where you live , right in the wallet , and many people actually fall for it .
Recall Bush 's excuse for pulling the US out of Kyoto , the world 's first failed opportunity for a climate deal : " complying with those mandates would have a negative economic impact , with layoffs of workers and price increases for consumers . "
He does at least speak plainly .
Relieved of some of the fanfare , the climate talks are in danger of stalling because of thoughts not too distant from plain words like these .
Serious action on climate change will damage our current wealth , so we wo n't do it .
There is something fundamentally vicious about putting money at the heart of the negotiations .
No doubt matters are excruciatingly complex , and reasonable people can argue about how best to spend money on climate change and the world 's other ills , but that 's not what 's happening .
We are in danger of failing to act simply because some maintain that the cost of action is too high .
Think about the relevant causes and effects of climate change : our easy lives of high - energy consumption and the damage we are doing to the planet .
Consider the human beings who will suffer because of our easy lives .
Avoiding meaningful action on climate change just because it might be too expensive is on a moral par with harming other people for money .
Call it what it is : keeping money in exchange for the suffering of others .
Ethics sometimes has to trump economics .
If you have a moral obligation to take action , you do n't get out of it with talk of expense .
Would you forgive someone for avoiding a moral duty because he thought it might cost him too much ?
He 'd rather not abandon plans for a festive weekend in Spain , so those child care payments will have to wait .
No judge would let a father get away with that .
Sometimes we have to tighten our belts and do the right thing , even if it costs us more than we 'd like .
The west has a long history of industrialisation , and it has done the most damage to our world .
Therefore the west has the largest moral obligation to take action .
No doubt all countries , even those industrialising much later , have moral responsibilities too , but the point is that our obligations click in no matter what the rest of the world does , no matter what other countries pay .
We have to pay for our fair share of the damage , not fight hard for the cheapest way out .
Some think that talking about moral obligations just makes us feel guilty , and we 've had enough of that .
Others collapse in the face of complexity , groaning that we can't do enough in the short time that we have .
Do n't believe a word of it .
Human beings can move mountains in an instant when they see that something is wrong – the obvious examples are the right ones to think about .
If our representatives have forgotten the moral demand for action on climate change , it 's up to the rest of us to do something – maybe remind them that they 've mistaken money for the things which really matter .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama said on Saturday this week ’s positive job and economic growth figures proved that his big spending efforts to stimulate the economy were working .

But he cautioned in his weekly radio address to Americans that “ we have a long way to go before we return to prosperity ” and more job losses were likely in coming days .
Democrats and Republicans agree the economy will be the top issue for the 2010 congressional elections , although the White House has disputed suggestions that they will be a judgment on Obama and his policies .
Voting in next week ’s Virginia and New Jersey governors ’ races will render a first judgment on Obama , who was sworn into office just over nine months ago in the midst of the worst recession since World War Two .
The U.S. unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.8 percent , despite a $ 787 billion economic stimulus that Obama and his fellow Democrats , who control Congress , pushed through in February .
New unemployment numbers due out next Friday are expected to show U.S. employers cut 175,000 jobs in October , according to economists polled by Reuters .
The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 9.9 percent for October .
But new data this week showing the U.S. economy growing in the third quarter for the first time in more than a year , signaling the end of the worst recession in 70 years , was good news for the Obama administration .
“ Now , economic growth is no substitute for job growth , ” Obama stressed in his radio address .
“ But we will not create the jobs we need unless the economy is growing . ”
REPUBLICANS QUESTION FIGURES
Obama said steps taken by his administration to jump - start the economy , including the stimulus package of spending and tax cuts , had helped “ blunt the worst of this recession . ”
The White House said on Friday the stimulus had directly saved or created more than 640,000 jobs so far , based on data about who had received loans or grants through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
Obama said overall the stimulus had created or saved more than one million jobs .
“ It took years to dig our way into the crisis we ’ve faced .
It will take more than a few months to dig our way out , ” said Obama , who blames Republicans for the economic crisis he inherited .
Republicans , who favor tax cuts , say the stimulus has failed to halt rising joblessness and they also questioned the White House ’s figures on jobs saved or created .
“ It ’s bewildering to see the same administration that sold its trillion - dollar spending plan this spring as a guarantee against 8 percent unemployment -- today it ’s nearly 10 percent
-- claiming it created 1 million jobs , especially since it is a sad fact 3 million jobs have been lost since the stimulus was signed into law , ” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement .
Apple 's latest high - end iMac gets a stunning , huge , cinematic 16:9 27 " screen , fast Core i5 and i7 CPU options , a standard wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse , a staggering 16GB RAM capacity , a new video input feature , and an environmentally friendly design at all a new lower price .
Position in the Mac family
The latest iMacs advance Apple 's consumer flagship offering into high performance territory , offering Intel " Nehalem " Core i5 and Core i7 quad - core processors as options to the standard dual - core Core 2 Duo CPUs also used in the Mac mini and MacBook lines .
Previously , Apple only offered quad - core Nehalem family chips in its Xeon - based Mac Pro and Xserve models , both of which were introduced this spring .
While these new chips run at a slower clock speed ( Apple offers the 27 " iMac with a Core i5 at 2.66GHz or the Core i7 at 2.8 GHz , while its Core 2 Duo offerings are clocked at 3.06 or 3.33GHz ) , they achieve higher performance from the use of more cores ( four , rather than two on the Core 2 Duo ) , more onboard CPU cache RAM built into the chip ( 8MB rather than 3 or 6MB on the Core 2 Duo ) , and the Nehelem 's new QuickPath memory architecture , which includes a direct memory controller on the CPU rather than having the processor talk to RAM via its external chipset .
This change , which applies only to the i5 and i7 CPU options , subverts Apple 's current strategy of using NVIDIA 's 9400 M across the board to provide its
Macs with both standard chipset functions ( such as providing a memory controller , SATA , USB , PCIe , audio , and networking functions ) and graphics features .
The Core 2 Duo version of the 21.5 " and 27 " iMac continues to use the 9400 M design , which is also used in the Mac mini and all MacBook models .
Apple cites SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks showing that the fast CPU and memory architecture of the new high end 2.8GHz Core i7 option delivers 2.4 times the computing power in both floating - point and integer calculations relative to the 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo .
The higher end of the latest iMacs also offer a big boost in graphics performance over the standard 9400 M , which is designed to share 256MB of the system 's main memory .
Both of the new iMac models offer the ATI Radeon HD 4670 dedicated graphics processor with 256MB of its own graphics RAM , which delivers 2 to 4.4 times the performance of the 9400 M architecture .
The 27 " iMac also provides an option for the ATI Radeon HD 4850 , which is yet again rated to deliver 1.5 to 1.8 times the performance of the 4670 , thanks in part to packing twice as much dedicated graphics RAM : 512MB .
Comparable Windows PCs often pack on even more graphics RAM .
For example , Acer 's similarly equipped Gateway One supplies the same ATI Radeon HD 4670 with 1GB of dedicated graphics RAM .
This primarily benefits video games , as it allows the game to load texture maps and other data into graphics RAM for optimal performance .
Apple 's iMacs are designed more to be digital media hubs running iLife and other creative apps , which are n't as hungry for graphics RAM .
The company still touts video game play on its iMac systems , but hardcore gamers are not likely to be shopping for Macs given that most games are tied to Windows .
Even so , the iMac 's option for 512MB of graphics RAM is not a serious limitation even for users who plan to run Windows PC games natively using Boot Camp .
Base models of the iMac ship with 1TB 7200 RPM SATA hard drives and offer an identical 2TB upgrade option ( apart from the entry level 21.5 " model , which ships with a 500 GB hard drive ) .
All models also ship with 4GB of RAM , expandable to 8GB on the 21.5 " model and a whopping , officially supported 16GB on the 27 " iMac .
Prices range from $ 1199 or $ 1499 for the 21.5 " iMac to $ 1699 or $ 1999 for the 27 " model .
CPU upgrades cost a $ 200 premium , the video card bump costs $ 150 , while the 2TB disk is a rather expensive $ 250 option .
Market prices for 2TB drives at retail are currently close to $ 180 ( and you can keep your existing 1TB disk ) .
However , Apple 's RAM upgrades are now , in a very atypical departure for the company , set closer to regular market prices , albeit still astoundingly expensive on the high end because high density , fast 4GB parts are still new on the market .
Maxing out the RAM to 16GB costs $ 1400 from Apple , while the same amount of RAM ( 4x4GB 1066GHz DDR3 , PC3 - 8500 ) currently costs about $ 1480 from third party Mac- oriented RAM dealers on the web and around $ 1000 from generic sources ( OWC contacted us since the review to point out they sell a 16GB RAM upgrade for just under $ 1000 , about 2/3rd of Apple 's price ) .
Since the 27 " iMac provides four RAM slots , users have the option to upgrade incrementally without having to throw away RAM to make room for new parts .
The iMac 's expansion potential positions it clearly ahead of the compact , entry level Mac mini , which can be upgraded by users but is not really designed to be user serviceable .
The Mac Pro delivers still greater upgrade options , with room for 4 hard drives ; dual optical drives ; two quad - core processors ; a double - wide , 16 - lane PCI Express 2.0 graphics slot and two 4 - lane PCI Express 2.0 slots ; up to 32 GB of installed RAM ; and additional Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports .
Of course , the Mac Pro is also significantly more expensive even without a display .
The glossy LED - backlit screen
The biggest new feature of the new iMac is its massive screen , which jumps from the previous high end of 24 " to 27 " and delivers nearly the resolution ( 2560x1440 ) of the 30 " Cinema Display HD ( 2560x1600 ) .
That 's currently the largest display available from any all - in - one PC vendor , and nearly equivalent to four 13.3 " MacBook screens ( 1280x800 ) in a single display .
The new iMac is still priced $ 100 less than Apple 's standalone 30 " big screen display , despite packing in a powerful computer and new LED backlighting .
Compared to Apple 's older 20 " Cinema Display , the new screen delivers higher screen density and a significantly brighter display .
The photo below shows that the same web browser window that consumes the entire 20 " external display appears slightly more compact on the built - in screen , where it only takes up about two thirds of the screen .
The new 27 " iMac , along with its smaller 21.5 " partner , sport higher quality IPS LCD screen technology , resulting in spectacular color , contrast and wide viewing angles .
Like previous models , the glossy screen is covered with a glass panel that extends across the entire top face of the unit .
The new models also sport less of a chin than previous iMac , giving them a more balanced overall appearance .
Last year , Apple was sued over its iMacs for using cheaper , 6 - bit TN ( " twisted nematic " ) screens , which have a narrower viewing angle and less color accuracy and depth , because some users argued the screens were technically incapable of actually producing the " millions of colors " supported by the machines ' graphics cards .
The latest models reverse the trend toward cheap displays and instead provide quality IPS ( " in- plane switching " ) panels that deliver much - improved color and a wide , 178 degree viewing angle both horizontally and vertically .
The new screens are also LED backlit ( unlike the 30 " Cinema Display HD ) , which means they turn on instantly and allow for finer grained control over brightness than conventional cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlighting .
LED backlighting is also environmentally friendly because it uses no toxic mercury .
Overall , the new machines also meet Energy Star 5.0 and EPEAT Gold standards for energy efficiency and environmentally - sound design , manufacturing , and use of recyclable materials .
The new 27 " display is backed by ATI Radeon HD 4670 ( or for $ 150 more , the 4850 ) graphics hardware equipped with 256MB ( or 512MB ) of GDDR3 RAM .
It supports video output up to 2560x1600 , capable of driving a 30 " Cinema Display HD .
It supports VGA , DVI / HDMI and DisplayPort screens via its standard Mini DisplayPort connector .
A new feature of the 27 " iMac is its ability to act as a display for another DisplayPort computer .
It is the first and currently the only Mac to support this new capability .
The 21.5 " iMac does n't support video input and provides simpler NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M graphics on the low end , the same as Apple 's MacBook line and Mac mini .
Because the new 27 " iMac is now priced less than the aging 30 " Cinema Display HD with a similar resolution , it makes sense for users who need a big external screen to buy it instead and gain a free rendering machine capable of running Xgrid or Qmaster distributed processing tasks in the background as a free bonus .
When connected to a DisplayPort output device , the iMac 's screen can be switched between the internal computer and the external video source .
Currently , this only allows the new iMac to serve as a display for late - modeled Macs and other PCs capable of DisplayPort output .
In the future , other devices such as new Blu - Ray players will likely become possible to use as DisplayPort output sources for the iMac 's display .

Wireless Apple Keyboard and Magic Mouse
The new iMacs now come standard with a Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard and multitouch Magic Mouse .
These can be traded for a compact or full sized ( with numeric keypad ) USB keyboard and / or a standard USB Apple Mouse ( the same model that was formerly referred to as Mighty Mouse ) .
Apple 's Bluetooth keyboard is virtually identical to the MacBook 's built - in keyboard , and is slightly modified from Apple 's original 2007 Bluetooth keyboard in that it now only uses two AA batteries and has moved the wireless receiver to the center of the back panel .
Users on a desktop system might want to opt for the full size USB keyboard instead , as Apple 's unframed Bluetooth keyboard almost seems too small ; while the key spacing is no different than Apple 's popular MacBooks , the tiny keyboard feels undersized in relation to the vast screen .
Why not have a numeric keypad and the extra function keys if you have the desk space for it anyway ?
Typing on the super low profile keyboard feels as comfortable as a MacBook ; attempts to try using a conventional keyboard with a deeper physical key movement now feels clumsy .
The actual typing experience between the wireless and USB keyboards should n't be any different ; the only real difference is the availability of additional keys .
Interestingly , Apple now offers a small keyboard without the extra keys in a wired version .
All keyboard and mouse options are priced identically .
The new Magic Mouse was reviewed separately .
All Magic Mouse interactions with the new iMac , which ships with the driver software ready to go , felt natural and worked without issues .
While setup and use of the new Magic Mouse seemed flawless , the Bluetooth keyboard also seemed to lose its connection too often , although this may have been related to our test environment , which has multiple Bluetooth and WiFi devices all contending for use of the same bandwidth .
Apple provides some additional information on environment issues that can impact wireless performance .
It 's nice to have the wireless options provided at no extra cost however , and users who decide they do n't like the Bluetooth keyboard wo n't face much expense in buying their own third party keyboard to fit their own particular preferences .
Users who plan to run Windows XP / Vista / 7 on their iMac natively using Boot Camp must install an update for Windows , which handles the wireless devices differently than Mac OS X does .
An Apple support document explains more about this .
Expansion ports
The iMacs present a familiar array of expansion ports :
Audio out supporting both headphone - style analog output and digital optical mini S / PDIF output .
The headphone jack also supports iPhone - style headphones with an integrated mic input and volume and playback control buttons .
Audio in supporting both line - in analog input and digital optical mini S / PDIF input .
Four USB 2.0 ports , all of which are available when opting for the default Bluetooth keyboard and mouse .
One FireWire 800 port .
Mini DisplayPort with support for VGA , DVI / HDMI , and DisplayPort output as well as DisplayPort input ( for use of the 27 " iMac as an external monitor ) .
Gigabit Ethernet with auto- negotiation when using crossover cables .
The new iMacs apparently still provides no support for audio output over the Mini DisplayPort connector ( which is technically supported in the DisplayPort specification ) , so unlike Apple TV there 's no way to output both audio and video over the same cable in the manner of HDMI .
That necessitates either using a hybrid Mini DisplayPort plus USB cable for driving an HDMI display with audio , or using a separate audio cable from the iMac 's audio output using an analog cable or digital optical toslink cable for audio .

For more information on iPhone - style headphone jacks , see : Using iPod & iPhone Video Out : Background and In - Depth Review
On the right side edge , the iMac presents its optical drive slot and a new SD card slot ( below ) , which also works with MMC memory cards and 2.x SDHC cards up to 32 GB in capacity .
MiniSD and MicroSD cards require an adapter to use in the slot .
As with the new MacBooks released over the last year , inserted SD cards stick out far enough to unplug without any physical ejection mechanism , but must be ejected in software prior to pulling them out , just as with any other Mac - mounted disk volume .
The slot is only an SD card reader , and does not work with SDIO cards , which provide other features such as WiFi or Bluetooth wireless , GPS , or other features designed for devices with SD expansion - oriented slots .
The new iMacs also include an IR receiver for use with an Apple Remote ( not bundled ; the new aluminum remote is a $ 19 option ) , a built - in iSight camera and microphone , pretty decent built - in speakers , Bluetooth and 802.

Performance overview : RAM , HD and CPU
The base model iMac ships with 4GB of 1066MHz PC - 8500 DDR3 RAM and supplies 4 memory slots capable of expanding that up to 16GB .
It also ships with a 1TB 7200 RPM SATA hard drive , which can be upgraded to a 2TB version , and an 8 x dual layer DVD SuperDrive .
Users who want to upgrade their own hard drive will discover that Apple has started using embedded hard drive temperature sensors to monitor disk heat buildup .
This is potentially more accurate and reliable than the previous method of attaching an external sensor on the outside surface of the drive .
However , third party hard drive manufacturers have n't agreed on a standard for building temperature sensors into their drives , so users attempting an upgrade will have to find out what drive their iMac shipped with and buy a replacement drive from the same manufacturer .
According to Other World Computing , Apple currently appears to be using hard drives from only two vendors : Western Digital and Seagate .
System Profiler , which can be launched from the " About this Mac " in the Apple menu , will identify your installed hard drive by serial number , and designates its manufacturer by the first two letters of that number , either WD or ST .
Because each vendor supplies a unique thermal sensor connector , upgrading users of the " Late 2009 " iMacs will need to buy the same type of hard drive in order to use the same included cable installed inside their iMac .
If another drive mechanism is installed , the system will not be able to sense the drive 's temperature and will subsequently send the system 's fans spinning into overdrive .
The iMac we reviewed operated in almost complete silence .
However , when it entered partial sleep mode it began making a very irritating noise that seemed to come from the upper left hand corner .
When completely asleep , the machine again made no noise at all .
This may have been a problem isolated to our review model , as there were no other complaints on this subject we could find on Apple 's support pages .
The 21.5 " iMac and entry level 27 " iMac offer a similar CPU / GPU and RAM specifications as the high end MacBook Pros : a 3.06 GHz Intel E7600 Penryn Core 2 Duo CPU with 3MB of onboard cache RAM or 3.33 GHz Intel E8600 Penryn Core 2 Duo CPU with 6MB of onboard cache RAM , paired with NVIDIA 's MCP79MX controller with integrated GPU , which Apple calls by its marketing name : the 9400M .
That chip also provides chipset controller functions ( such as RAM , PCIe , SATA , and USB interfaces ) .
Apple uses faster DDR3 " PC3 - 8500 " RAM , which runs at 1067MHz along with the FSB for communications between the CPU , RAM , and the integrated GPU .
The 27 " iMac offers options of a 2.66GHz Intel Core i5 ( 750 ) with 8 MB on - chip L3 cache or a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7 ( 860 ) with 8 MB on - chip L3 cache .
These Nehalem models sport Intel 's Direct Media Interface , which replaces the conventional chipset Front Side Bus with a high speed PCI Express x4 derived interconnect that directly connects to RAM and the CPU 's external Southbridge chipset , which supports other peripheral interfaces outside of the memory controller .
This new Intel design also prevents NVIDIA from competing in the CPU - supporting chipset business , as it had just begun to do with the 9400M .
The performance numbers presented by Primate Lab's Geekbench 2.1 show the entry level 3.06 GHz iMac performing incrementally faster than previous iMacs and the iMac mini , but far behind the more expensive Mac Pro .
We did not have i5 or i7 CPU options available to test ( below ) .
Longer bars are better .
On page 3 of 3 : Performance overview : 64 - bit Snow Leopard ; The New 27 " iMac in Review ; Rating ; Pros ; and Cons .
Performance overview : 64 - bit Snow Leopard
Running Geekbench as a 64 - bit app , the benchmark suite ran significantly faster , with a 3 - 5 % improvement in floating point and memory tests and a huge 20 % jump in integer performance , resulting in a 9 % boost to the overall score on the same hardware .
Like all other 64 - bit capable consumer Macs , the latest 27 " iMac boots Snow Leopard by default using the 32 - bit version of the Mac OS X kernel ( which is still capable of running 64 - bit applications ) , which we used to run the 64 - bit Geekbench suite .
After manually activating the 64 - bit kernel on the new iMac , running the 64 - bit benchmarks again did not result in any significant difference ; all scores were either the same or higher or lower within a range of ten points ( less than 0.5 % difference ) .
This indicates that invoking Snow Leopard 's 64 - bit kernel has a minimal impact on performance when using consumer applications within 4GB of installed RAM .
Using 64 - bit applications ( when available ) on the 32 - bit kernel has a major impact on performance , however .
This contributes to Snow Leopard 's overall speed boost on 64 - bit Intel Macs , as nearly all bundled applications on Snow Leopard outside of the Adobe Flash plugin and certain background tasks are all 64 - bit .
For users worried about whether they are running ( or can run ) Snow Leopard using its 64 - bit kernel , this should provide reassuring evidence that the reason Apple only activates the 64 - bit kernel by default on the Xserve is because the bit mode of the kernel currently has little impact on general performance for consumers .
On the other hand , running the 64 - bit kernel requires that all kernel extensions ( including hardware drivers and certain VPN software ) and printer drivers also be 64 - bit .
Snow Leopard 's default behavior opts for compatibility , and this does not appear to have any discernible impact on performance .
Far more important to consumers will be the introduction of additional 64 - bit third party apps , including those still missing from Apple , such as iLife , iWork , and Pro Apps including Final Cut Studio , Logic Studio , Aperture , and FileMaker Pro. Compiling existing apps to run as 64 - bit programs appears to provide an easy ~ 10 % boost in performance , which primarily comes from advantages in avoiding 32 - bit penalties related to the legacy Intel x86 architecture prior to AMD 's x64 enhancements .
The New 27 " iMac in Review
The latest iMacs deliver a significant performance boost , better specs overall and much greater RAM expansion .
Along with its capability to act as a DisplayPort monitor , the new model and its incredible widescreen display delivers a great overall package at a new lower price .
It 's also great to see Apple offering RAM upgrades at prices that are n't simply absurdly unreasonable .
The iMac 's glossy screen will not appeal to some users , but the display looks amazing , and is a significant jump up in quality compared to last year 's iMacs .
If you 're in the market for a new iMac , the new model makes a great , well rounded upgrade .
If you 're considering a new large display , you might even be tempted to get the iMac just for that , and leave it running in the background as a server or distributed processing node .
The only possible downside might be if the noises we heard are typical and not something that can be addressed by AppleCare or a software update .
Users wanting to add their own RAM have four slots to work with , but anyone hoping to add another hard drive must watch out for the new vendor - specific temperature sensors , an issue that we did n't see mentioned anywhere on Apple 's site .
Overall , the new big screen iMac promises to be a popular addition to Apple 's lineup , and deliver a great performance to dollar ratio .
Unlike many similarly configured generic PC offerings , the iMac lacks a TV tuner and Blu - Ray player features .
There are a variety of low cost third party TV tuners for the Mac , but few options for Blu - Ray movie playback .
The best option for Blu - Ray playback is currently Sony 's PlayStation 3 , although it does not allow iMac users to output video to their fancy new screen .
Of course , Apple does n't want to sell users a new HD disc format , it wants people to download its own iTunes videos instead , which do n't offer the same kind of high resolution experience .
Rating 4 out of 5
Pros :
Brighter , very high quality screen with monitor input function
Great overall value and reasonably priced upgrade options
Fast performance options for CPU and GPU
SD card slot is a nice convenience
Wireless keyboard and mouse now included in price
Cons :
Bluetooth keyboard occasionally lost contact with the machine
Sleep whine from fan was annoying but may be a limited issue
No PC - style TV / Blu - Ray convergence features

First , it was the soccer - ball - shaped molecules dubbed buckyballs .
Then it was the cylindrically shaped nanotubes .
Now , the hottest new material in physics and nanotechnology is graphene : a remarkably flat molecule made of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal rings much like molecular chicken wire .
Not only is this the thinnest material possible , but it also is 10 times stronger than steel and it conducts electricity better than any other known material at room temperature .
These and graphene 's other exotic properties have attracted the interest of physicists , who want to study them , and nanotechnologists , who want to exploit them to make novel electrical and mechanical devices .
" There are two features that make graphene exceptional , " says Kirill Bolotin , who has just joined the Vanderbilt Department of Physics and Astronomy as an assistant professor .
" First , its molecular structure is so resistant to defects that researchers have had to hand - make them to study what effects they have .
Second , the electrons that carry electrical charge travel much faster and generally behave as if they have far less mass than they do in ordinary metals or superconductors . "
Bolotin has been directly involved in the efforts to manufacture and characterize this exotic new material as a post - doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Philip Kim at Columbia University .
In a paper published last week in the journal Nature , he and his Columbia colleagues report that they have managed to clean up graphene enough so that it exhibits a bizarre electrical phenomenon called the fractional quantum
Hall effect , where the electrons act together to create new particles with electrical charges that are a fraction that of individual electrons .
Although graphene is the first truly two - dimensional crystalline material that has been discovered , over the years scientists have put considerable thought into how two - dimensional gases and solids should behave .
They have also succeeded in creating a close approximation to a two - dimensional electron gas by bonding two slightly different semiconductors together .
Electrons are confined to the interface between the two and their motions are restrained to two dimensions .
When such a system is cooled down to less than one degree above absolute zero and a strong magnetic field is applied , then the fractional quantum Hall effect appears .
Since scientists figured out how to make graphene five years ago , they have been trying to get it to exhibit this effect with only marginal success .
According to Bolotin , the Columbia group figured out that interference from the surface the graphene was sitting on was the problem .
So they applied semiconductor lithography techniques to suspend ultraclean graphene sheets between microscopic posts above the surface of semiconductor chips .
When they cooled this configuration down within six degrees of absolute zero and applied a magnetic field , the graphene generated a robust quantum Hall effect as predicted by theory .
The best way to understand this counterintuitive effect is to think of the electrons in graphene as a forming a ( very thin ) sea of charge .
When the magnetic field is applied , it generates whirlpools in the electron fluid .
Because electrons carry a negative charge , these vortices have a positive charge .
They form with fractional charges such as one - third , one - half and two - thirds that of an electron .
These positive charge carriers are attracted to and attach to the conduction electrons , creating quasi- particles with fractional charges .
Understanding the electrical properties of graphene is important because , unlike the other materials used by the electronics industry , it remains stable and conductive down to the molecular scale .
As a result , when the current silicon technology reaches it's a fundamental miniaturization limit in coming years , graphene could very well take its place .
Meanwhile , some theoretical physicists are interested in graphene for a totally different reason :
It provides a new way to test their theories .
As electrons move through ordinary metals , they interact with the electrical fields produced by the lattice of metal atoms , which push and pull them in a complex fashion .
The net result is that the electrons act as if they have a mass different from that of ordinary electrons .
So physicists call this an " effective mass " and consider them to be quasiparticles .
When traveling through graphene they also act as quasiparticles , but they behave as if they have a mass of zero .
It turns out that graphene quasiparticles , unlike those in other materials , obey the rules of quantum electrodynamics , the same relativistic equations that physicists use to describe the behavior of particles in black holes and high - energy particle accelerators .
As a result , this new material may allow physicists to conduct tabletop experiments that test their theoretical models of some of the most extreme environments in the universe .
The research was supported by grants from Microsoft Project Q , the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and the Department of Energy .
Nachdem ich über das Chaosradio zur Wikipedia - Debatte letzte Woche eine Runde in Ruhe nachdenken konnte , scheint es mir sinnvoll , mal eine Vision und einen konkreten Vorschlag für die Diskussion bei der Wikimedia am Donnerstag zu formulieren .
So wie sich mir die Lage darstellt , ist insbesondere die deutsche Wikipedia in einem grandiosen Zielkonflikt gefangen , der sich mit den jetzigen Strukturen und Regeln nicht auflösen läßt .
Der postulierte Anspruch , die neue , verläßliche Universal - Enzyklopädie mit hohen Qualitätskriterien zu werden , ist ein ehrenwertes Ziel .
Angesichts des unaufhaltbaren Verröchelns der gedruckten Enzyklopädien gibt es ganz klar eine klaffende Lücke , die gefüllt werden muß .
Nachdem Brockhaus , Meyers & Co. kein Geschäftsmodell mehr haben , fällt diese Aufgabe offensichtlich der Wikipedia zu .
Der Sieger über den alten Herrscher wird der neue .
Damit scheint ein
Teil der derzeit aktiven Wikipedianer auch ganz zufrieden zu sein , mit berechtigtem Stolz auf den eroberten Mantel des alten Lexikon - Kaisers .
Sicher , es gibt gewisse Zweifel darüber , wen oder was man ohne Papiervorbild als Relevanzreferenz nehmen soll , aber das wird sich schon noch klären .
Auch wenn eine Enzyklopädie nie mit wissenschaftlicher Zitierbarkeit geadelt werden kann ( sie sammelt per Definition nur Sekundärwissen und faßt zusammen ) , so wäre es doch schön , gäbe es verläßliche Zusammenfassungen plus beständige , zitierfreundliche Verweise auf die Primärquellen zu Themen von langfristiger Bedeutung .
Dummerweise kollidiert diese Zielsetzung mit zwei nicht ganz unwesentlichen Faktoren .
Zum einen ist das alte Wikipedia - Mantra “ Everyone can edit ! ” dafür vollständig ungeeignet .
Eine solche echte Enzyklopädie läßt sich in der
Tat nicht erstellen und aufrechterhalten , solange ein Großteil der Arbeitskraft der Freiwilligen für Vandalismusbekämpfung draufgeht .
De facto hat sich die deutsche Wikipedia von diesem Grundsatz auch schon verabschiedet .
Nun heißt es subtil : “ Gute Autoren willkommen ! ”
Trotzdem kann noch jeder überall sofort auf “ Bearbeiten ” klicken und wird in der Illusion gelassen , er könne beitragen .
Nur um dann seinen mühsam ziselierten Artikel im Orkus der Löschhölle verschwinden zu sehen und , im Optimalfall , mit einer halben Zeile unverständlicher “ Siehe WP : Whatever ” - Akronyme als Begründung zurückgelassen zu werden .
“ Everyone can edit ! ” ist , genauso wie “ Sei mutig ! ” , mittlerweile nur noch unehrlich , unfair und kaum mehr als ein verlogenes Spendensammel - Argument .
Vermutlich ist die Anzahl von Autoren , die eine realistische Chance haben , einen Artikel dauerhaft in der deutschen Wikipedia zu hinterlassen , inzwischen kaum noch größer als es das Autorenkollektiv des Brockhaus zu Bestzeiten war .
Zum anderen ist der Hochwertenzyklopädie - Plan unvereinbar mit dem sich immer lauter und nachdrücklicher artikulierenden Anspruch der Netzgemeinde , daß die Wikipedia das Lexikon des modernen Lebens sein soll , inklusive aller schnelllebigen , popkulturellen und vielleicht erst später wirklich relevanten oder auch abseitigen Themen .
Die allgemeine Nutzererwartung ist : “ Wenn ich von etwas Unbekanntem höre , will ich als ersten Google - Hit einen Wikipedia - Eintrag sehen , damit ich mich schnell , kompakt und halbwegs verläßlich informieren kann . ”
Die englische Wikipedia ist die einzige Webseite , die auf dem Amazon Kindle international zugänglich ist .
Aus den rauchenden Trümmern des OpenMoko - Projektes ist ein Wikipedia - Gerät entstanden .
Das sind nur die Anfänge eines Trends .
Die Wikipedia wird ihre Rolle als Lexikon des modernen Lebens nicht verdrängen können .
Ja , laßt uns das Kind beim Namen nennen :
Wir wollen eben auch einen Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy , nicht nur eine Encyclopedia Galactica .
Aus meiner Sicht gibt es für den Problemkomplex nur eine Lösung : eine zweigliedrige Wikipedia .
1. Eine Enzyklo - Pedia mit echtem Brockhaus2.0 - Anspruch , begrenzter Autorenschaft und hohen Relevanz - und Qualitätskriterien .
2. Eine Wiki -Pedia mit entspannten Kriterien , echtem “ Everyone can edit ! ” und klar inkludistischem Programm .
Die Wiki-Pedia benötigt ein grundlegend reformiertes technisches und organisatorisches System , mit Software aus dem 21 .
Jahrhundert , die heutigen Ansprüchen an webbasiertes Wissens - und Debattenmanagement genügt .
Eine Software , die neue Autoren an die Hand nimmt und bestmöglich dabei unterstützt , korrekte Artikel zu verfassen und zu verbessern .
Ich würde sogar akzeptieren , wäre eine Minimalregistrierung mit E - Mail - Adresse notwendig , um von vornherein den ganz stumpfen Vandalismus zu minimieren .
Ansonsten sollte in der Wiki -Pedia kein Wissen irrelevant sein , sondern ausschließlich nach Korrektheit , Werbefreiheit und Beachtung von Gesetzen und Persönlichkeitsrechten bewertet werden .
Entscheidungsstrukturen müssen transparent , Vorgänge und Kriterien einfach verständlich sein .
“ Wer soll das denn alles sichten und managen und die Software dafür bauen ? ” , werfen an dieser Stelle verdiente Wikipedianer ein .
Nun , wie wäre es mit all den Leuten , die Ihr in den letzten fünf Jahren verprellt habt ?
Wenn ich höre , daß selbst viele Autoren im Mentoring - Programm nach ein oder zwei Artikeln aufhören , weil sie keine Lust haben , mehr Arbeit in das nicht - gelöscht - Werden zu stecken , als in den Artikel , sehe ich da ein wirklich großes Potential .
Die Frustration all derer , die das “ Everyone can edit ! ” noch ernstnahmen , ist bis dato vernichtete Energie .
Und Autoren , die sich in der Wiki - Pedia bewährt haben , fühlen sich sicher geehrt , wenn sie gefragt werden , ob sie an der Enzyklo - Pedia mitwirken wollen .
Gute Artikel zu schreiben ist auch einfach Übungssache .
Nach welchen Kriterien Artikel und Autoren von der Wiki -Pedia in die Enzyklo - Pedia gelangen , darüber kann man trefflich streiten .
Ich maße mir nicht an , dafür einen umfassenden Vorschlag zu unterbreiten , jedoch ist vollkommen klar , daß es einfacher ist , unter motivierten , aktiven Autoren diejenigen zu finden , die was können , als nur Glückstreffer aus einer im Kern frustrierten Masse zu landen .
Ein weiteres Optimierungspotential ist das – nennen wir es mal beim Namen – byzantinische Prinzip , nach dem derzeit Informationen und Diskussionen in der Wikipedia verwaltet werden .
Die Software ist dringend überholungbedürftig , und sie braucht ein User - Interface aus diesem Jahrtausend .
Auch dafür braucht es Freiwillige , und zwar motivierte Freiwillige .
Auf Dauer ist die Anzahl von Leuten , die bereit ist , Zeit und Herzblut in die Wartung und Expansion der Softwarebasis eines reinen Eliteprojektes ( und so wird die derzeitige deutsche Wikipedia immer mehr empfunden ) zu stecken , gering .
Das zeigt sich auch darin , wie lange es dauert , bis selbst minimale Verbesserungen implementiert werden .
Bis wir bei einer zweigliedrigen Wikipedia ankommen , wird es eine Weile dauern .
Bis dahin müssen jedoch einige schnelle Maßnahmen ergriffen werden .
Als eine erste vertrauensbildende Maßnahme muß der Wikimedia e. V. die Einrichtung und den Betrieb einer Deletopedia für die deutschsprachige Wikipedia bezahlen .
Alle Artikel , die wegen Irrelevanz , umstrittenen unbelegten Fakten , oder mangelndem Enzyklopädismus gelöscht werden , müssen dort zu finden sein – und zwar schnell .
Wikimedia hat genügend Spendengelder auf der hohen Kante , es kann also keine Ausrede geben , die nicht als lahm erscheint .
Falls es bei so einem einfachen Projekt zu “ Problemen ” und “ Verzögerungen ” käme , wäre auch noch der letzte Rest Vertrauen verspielt .
Dann müssen wir wohl die deutsche Wikipedia forken , und zwar gründlich .
Update : Eine Reihe Kommentare waren leider im Spamfilter hängengeblieben und mußten per Hand befreit werden .

The GNOME release team have confirmed that GNOME 3.0 will be released in September 2010 , with a GNOME 2.30 release in March 2010 .
The announcement came from Vincet Untz and the GNOME release team and is a result of feeedback from the GNOME development community .
Untz assures users that GNOME 2.30 will not be " less stable as usual " saying that the release should actually be more stable as it will integrate the changes that are ready for 2.30 , leaving changes that are " still rough on the edges outside of GNOME ... until after 2.30 is out " .
The change in release date had been allowed for in the GNOME Planning Document .
Given the number of radical changes taking place in GNOME 3.0 such as the new GNOME Shell , the GNOME developers gave themselves the flexibility to alter the schedule .
The plan allows for GNOME 2.xx releases to happen every six months , to incorporate bug fixes and incremental improvements , with one of the future GNOME 2.xx releases being selected for promotion to GNOME 3.0 status .
It was originally hoped , last Summer , that GNOME 2.30 , due in March 2010 , would be the promoted release .
The developer community now believe they would not have completed development , testing and documentation by that March deadline .
Following the announcement , Untz reported on module decisions being made for GNOME 2.30 .
For example , currently the adoption of the Clutter animation library is stalled because of issues over copyright waivers and copyright assignments and the couch - db modules have been dropped as " too early for wider adoption " .

* Embarrassing climate e-mails will have limited impact
* Scientists behaving badly wo n't change evidence
* US climate bill to be decided on jobs it provides
WASHINGTON , Nov 23 ( Reuters ) - Revelation of a series of embarrassing e-mails by climate scientists provides fodder for critics , but experts believe the issue will not hurt the U.S. climate bill 's chance for passage or efforts to forge a global climate change deal .
Already dubbed " Climategate , " e-mails stolen from a British university are sparking outrage from climate change skeptics who say they show that the scientists were colluding on suppressing data on how humans affect climate change .
The e-mails , some written as long as 13 years ago , ranged from nasty comments by global warming researchers about climate skeptics to exchanges between researchers on how to present data in charts to make global warming look convincing .
In one e-mail , according to news accounts , Kevin Trenberth , a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , wrote : " The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can 't . "
Climate skeptics seized on the release of the e-mails as a game changer .
The documents will speed the end of " global warming alarmism , " said Myron Ebell , a climate change skeptic at the Competitive Enterprise Institute .
He said research that has been relied upon for official reports " is now very suspect . "
Patrick Michaels , one of the scientists derided in the e-mails for doubting global warming , said he thinks the documents will finally " open up the scientific debate . "
" That 's probably the good news , " said Michaels , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank .
But others say the damage may be limited as the evidence is still overwhelming that a buildup of greenhouse gases is melting snow on mountain tops and shrinking global ice caps .
" The issue of scientists behaving badly does nothing to invalidate the science , " said Kevin Book , an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners , LLC in Washington .
" This does nothing to the U.S. climate bill , which will be decided mostly by economic forces , not environmental ones . "
MEAT TO THE WOLVES
Anthony Leiserowitz , the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change , said the release of the e-mails will be remembered mostly as as embarrassment to the researchers .
" It shows that the process of science is not always pristine , " said Leiserowitz .
" But there 's no smoking gun in the e-mails from what I 've seen . "
Leiserowitz , who is a social scientist , said the e-mails would provide fodder for the 2 to 3 percent of the general public that are hard - core climate change doubters .
" For that small group it is like meat to the wolves . "
At U.N. climate talks set for next month in Copenhagen , the top producers of greenhouse gases are expected to reach political agreements on tackling climate change , but not agree on hard targets for taking action .
The e-mails may serve as good gossip in the halls at the meeting , but will not play a big role otherwise , experts said .
For one thing , the researchers involved were only a handful out of thousands across the world that have contributed to a vast convergence of data that shows the world has warmed .
" Whilst some of the e-mails show scientists to be all too human , nothing I have read makes me doubt the veracity of the peer review process or the general warming trend in the global temperature recorded , " said Piers Forster , an environment professor at the University of Leeds .
Analyst
Book does n't see it changing the debate in the U.S. Congress where with few exceptions lawmakers have moved past the issue of whether mankind was warming the planet .
Lawmakers reached that conclusion even before the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued an assessment by thousands of scientists around the world that concluded in 2007 that warming was real and more than 90 percent certain that it was caused by man-made gases .
Book said " there are many reasons why the climate bill could choke , but it wo n't be about a group of e-mails . "
He said the climate bill supporters are pushing it as a jobs bill that could provide employment in nuclear and other clean energy industries .
The lawmakers will succeed or fail in passing the bill based on how well they sell those benefits to the public , he added .

Beginning in Firefox version 52 released March 7 , 2017 , installed NPAPI plugins are no longer supported in Firefox , except for Adobe Flash Player .
Some of the plugins that no longer load in Firefox , even though they may be installed on your computer , include Java , Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe Acrobat .
See this compatibility document for details .
Note : The : The Widevine CDM and OpenH264 Video Codec plugins are not NPAPI plugins and are still supported .
Over the past few years , Firefox has implemented various Web APIs so that websites can do the same things they ’ve always done without plugins , so you will most likely not notice any change to your browsing experience .
Why did Firefox do this ?
The internet is full of websites that go beyond static pages , such as video , sound and games .
While NPAPI plugins , especially Flash , have helped enable these interactive pages , they also make your browsing slower , less secure and more likely to crash .
Over the past few years , Firefox has worked hard to build replacements for these plugins , these replacements are called Web APIs .
Web APIs are designed to replace the function of the NPAPI plugins without undermining your internet security , stability and performance .
Before , while these Web APIs were n’t quite ready , Firefox started to transition by making plugins load manually ( click to activate ) .

Die Piraten - Partei gibt anlässlich der Demo " Freiheit statt Angst " eine Presse - Konferenz - und wird von den Medien immer noch nicht ernst genommen
Drei Jahre gibt es sie in Deutschland mittlerweile , sie hat es auf über 8000 Mitglieder gebracht und ist damit die größte Partei , die nicht im Bundestag vertreten ist .
Seit der Europawahl treten ihr täglich 70 Menschen bei - die meisten davon sind jünger als 30 , der älteste ist 82 .
Frauen sind allerdings in der Piraten - Partei noch eine Minderheit .
Dies , die Frage , was denn eigentlich " Nerd " bedeute , ob es denn auch schon ein paar Promis gäbe und was man für den Wahlkampf an Geldern locker machen waren dann aber auch schon alles , was die Journalisten auf der Pressekonferenz anlässlich der nachfolgenden Demonstration interessierte .
Vertreten waren im für die Pressekonferenz umgestalteten Arsenal - Kino am Potsdamer Platz der Bundesvorsitzende Jens Seipenbusch , der über die Demonstration sprach und die Ansichten und Programmpunkte der Piraten - Partei zu den Themen Vorratsdatenspeicherung , Überwachungsstaat und anderer auf der nachfolgenden Kundgebung behandelter Themen ansprach .
Als förmlicher Gast - Star wurde Christian Engström von der Schwedischen Piraten - Partei begrüßt , der nach der EU - Wahl seine Arbeit in Brüssel angetreten hat und nun von seiner Arbeit und der Zusammenarbeit mit Liberalen und Grünen berichtete ( siehe unten ) .
Andreas Popp ging dann noch einmal auf den Wahlkampf und die geplanten Aktionen der Partei ein : einen Demo - Truck , ein " gläsernes Mobil " - ein fahrbares Wohnzimmer mit Panoramascheiben , das den Menschen verdeutlichen soll , wie es ist , nichts mehr verbergen zu können - , und die Opt - Out - Aktion , bei der Bürger massenweise beantragen , dass ihre Daten nicht mehr automatisch von den Einwohner - Meldeämtern an Parteien und andere Organisationen weiter gegeben werden .
" Die Partei ist sowieso weiblich "
Nachdem das niederländische Piraten - Partei - Mitglied Samir Allioui das internationale Networking der Partei - insbesondere deren Bestrebungen in den USA - vorgestellt hatte , war die Fragerunde an die Presse eröffnet .
Eine Journalistin von der taz preschte nach vorn und drohte eine Kampagne an : Sie müsse die Partei in ihrem als " männliche Partei " bezeichnen , wenn nicht offengelegt würde , wie hoch der Frauenanteil sei .
Das Geschlechtsmerkmal würde in der Mitglieder - Datenbank nicht erfasst , aber das Bundesvorstandsmitglied Nicole Hornung versicherte ihr , dass es mehr und mehr Frauen bei den Piraten gebe , sich sogar schon eine AG gegründet habe und schon augenzwinkernd auf die Beschreibung als " männlichen Partei " linguistisch nach : " Die Partei ist sowieso weiblich . "
Die beiden Nachfragen nach eventuell vorhandenen Prominenten ( es gibt welche , man macht jedoch keine Werbung mit ihnen ) und den Wahlkampf - Mitteln ( laut Aussage des Bundesschatzmeisters Bernd Schlömer zwischen 150.000 und 200.000 Euro ) , wurden ebenso schnell geklärt .
Schwieriger war da schon die Frage , was denn eigentlich " Nerd " bedeute , wo die Piraten - Partei doch immer wieder als " Nerd - Partei " bezeichnet werde .
Ein wirklich dringliches
Thema angesichts der Demonstration , die sich gerade vor den Türen des Arsenals formierte und in Anbetracht der sich am Horizont andeutenden Bundestagswahl .
Einen Hintergrund habe die Nerd - Frage allerdings , hatte Justizministerin Zypris die Piraten - Partei durch kurz zuvor in einem taz - Interview als " zu konservativ " bezeichnet .
Kann das denn sein ?
Konservativ und Nerd und dann vielleicht sogar noch eine " männliche Partei " ?
" Wenn Frau Zypries mich konservativ nennt " , entgegnet Partei - Pressekoordinator Fabio Reinhardt nüchtern , " dann bedeutet das so ziemlich gar nichts . "
" Schäuble geht gar nicht ! "
Anlässlich der 20.000 Demonstrationsteilnehmer , die zwischen 15 und 18 Uhr durch den Bezirk Mitte wanderten und auf die zunehmende Gefahr der Entdemokratisierung durch Instrumente der Überwachung und Gängelung hinwiesen , muss man sich angesichts der Pressekonferenz schon fragen , warum die anwesenden Medienvertreter nicht eine einzige Frage zum Thema der Demo oder auch nur an den anwesenden EU - Parlamentarier der Piraten gestellt haben .
Man erwartet von der Piraten - Partei wohl so ziemlich alles - nur keine Politik .
Dass sie sich allerdings bemüht , politische Lücken zu schließen , wurde angesichts der Beschreibung neu entstandener Arbeitsgemeinschaften zu sozial - , bildungs - , umwelt - und anderen politischen Themenfeldern deutlich .
Mit ihrem knapp sechs Punkte umfassenden Wahlprogramm - Flyer wird es für die Piraten schwer , das angestrebte Ziel von " mindestens fünf Prozent " bei der Bundestagswahl zu erreichen - da muss schon eine Menge Protestpotenzial mobilisiert werden .
Und dann stehen höchstwahrscheinlich als nächstes interne Debatten ins Haus wie sie aus den Anfangstagen der Grünen bekannt sind .
Der Grünen - Abgeordnete Christian Ströbele auf der Demonstration
Noch orientierungslos zwischen ideologische Polen
Denn mit dem derzeitigen Themenspektrum der Piraten - Partei lassen sich ebenso linke wie liberale , bürgerliche und rechte politische Programme kompatibel machen : Jede der Parteien , die auf der Demonstration vertreten war ( Piraten , Linke , Grüne , die FDP und die Jusos ) spricht sich gegen die derzeitige Angst - Politik der Bundesregierung aus - und sogar in CDU und SPD sind Stimmen dagegen vernehmbar - beide Parteien waren jedoch nur indirekt auf der Demo anwesend : zumeist auf den Transparenten und Verlautbarungen der Demonstranten , die von " Zensursula " über " Stasi 2.0 " bis hin zu dem reichlich sarkastischen Kreide - Bild " Schäuble geht gar nicht ! " reichten .
Dass die Piraten - Partei mit Fahnen , Transparenten und T - Shirts das Bild der Demonstration hauptsächlich prägten , spricht schon eine deutliche Sprache über deren Relevanz in den Diskursen der Betroffenen .
Wie lange sich diese und ihre Probleme noch mit dem Attribut " Nerd " versehen lassen , ist fraglich : " Ihr werdet euch noch wünschen , wir wären Politik - Verdrossen " stand auf einem der Demo - Transparente , das von zwei Piraten - Partei - Anhängern getragen wurde .

A deputy assistant attorney general who said he was on his lunch break when an officer found him with a stripper and sex toys in his sport utility vehicle has been fired , his boss said Wednesday .
Roland Corning , 66 , a former state legislator , was in a secluded part of a downtown cemetery when an officer spotted him Monday , according to a police report obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act .
ADVERTISEMENT
As the officer approached , Corning sped off , then pulled over a few blocks away .
He and the 18 - year - old woman with him , an employee of the Platinum Plus Gentleman ’s Club , gave conflicting stories about what they were doing in the cemetery , Officer Michael Wines wrote in his report , though he did not elaborate .
Corning gave Wines a badge showing he worked for the state Attorney General ’s Office .
Wines , whose wife also works there , called her to make sure Corning was telling the truth .
He then searched the SUV , where he found a Viagra pill and several sex toys , items Corning said he always kept with him , “ just in case , ” according to the report .
Corning and the woman were let go without charges .
Wines ’ wife reported the call to her supervisor , who told Attorney General Henry McMaster .
“ We received credible information about inappropriate behavior Monday afternoon , ” McMaster said Wednesday .
“ And by the close of business , he was no longer working here . ”

Such a trip to the cemetery “ would not be appropriate , at any time , for an assistant attorney general , ” McMaster said .
There was no answer Wednesday at a number listed for Corning , who was a Republican legislator in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
He was hired in 2000 by the attorney general ’s office , where he worked on securities cases .
South Carolina has had its share of scandal lately , most notably Gov. Mark Sanford ’s disappearance in June .
His office told reporters he was hiking the Appalachian Trail , but he was really in Argentina visiting his mistress .

Looking out across the sparking turquoise waters lapping golden palm - fringed lands , all seems well on the beautiful Turks and Caicos islands .
But storm clouds have been gathering ever since the British government dissolved the local parliament and restored direct rule in August , following claims of high level corruption and misrule .
" People feel assaulted about their country being taken from them on the world stage , " says Hayden Boyce , editor of the Turks and Caicos Sun newspaper From the air , Turks and Caicos looks like the quintesential Caribbean island The British government took matters into its own hands following a Foreign Office report which found " clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of a general administrative incompetence " within the island nation 's parliament .
Records of government spending under the former administration of prime minister Michael Missick make for fascinating reading .
Many millions were blown on items like a bullet proof car for the premier , the use of a jet , body guards , lavish summer parties and a fleet of Range Rovers for ministers .
All in a country of little more than 30,000 people .
" We could have been more prudent , " admits former prime minister Galmore Williams , who served as a minister in Michael Misick 's government .
' Military Junta '
But while most islanders were in favour of direct rule to begin with , says Hayden Boyce , 95 % of the population are now " anti- Brit " .
One politician even suspects mutiny may be close at hand .
The mountain of unpaid bills was around $ 70 m and if you add a loan portfolio of about $ 60 m , you come to total indebtedness of $ 130m .
Governor Gordon Wetherall
" We currently have petitions going on about concerns of new taxes that are coming on stream .
I think we 'll see a greater agitation on part of the people , " says Douglas Parnell , the new leader of the Peoples Democratic Movement party ( PMP ) .
" My view is that if he [ the Governor Gordon Wetherall ] does n't correct course very shortly , you 'll see that people will become ungovernable .
" The Gordon Wetherall administration is the only other administration besides from Castro's Cuba that has the type of power that exists in the Turks and Caicos .
One man can decide the fate of an entire country . "
These comparisons with dictatorial regimes continue in the offices of the island 's oldest newspaper , The Turks and Caicos Weekly News .
Editor Blyth Duncanson supported the arrival of direct rule in August , but that changed , he says , when it became almost impossible for his journalists to get information on how government decisions are being made .
" Many times we are just shunted aside .
And we 're not really getting solid information , " he says .
COUNTRY FACTS
Population of approximately 30,000 Status is of UK overseas territory - residents have British citizenship Leading offshore financial centre where thousands of foreign companies are registered Islands became crown colony when Jamaica gained independence in 1962 " The interim administration , which is supposed to be run by the governor with the aid of an advisory council and a consultative forum , is operating like a closed shop .
Its more like a military junta . "
Mountain to climb
Putting these claims to the UK appointed governor is n't as easy as you might think .
The bulk of the country 's population live on Providenciales , but the governor 's residence is many miles away across the waves on the tiny island of Grand Turk .
After crossing what amounts to a massive moat , I asked the man some are calling a dictator if it was really necessary to dissolve the country 's entire elected House of Assembly when only a handful of its politicians were implicated in corruption .
" The terms of reference of the commission of inquiry required them to look into those allegations of corruption and serious dishonesty among members past and present of the House of Assembly , " he says .
UK imposes Turks and Caicos rule " Although relatively small number of people may have actually been mentioned in recommendations , those five actually amount to no less than one third of all elected members of the house . "
Governor Wetherall went on to reject claims that the territory 's press is routinely kept in the dark about how government decisions are reached , or that he ignores views expressed by his two advisory groups .
But his biggest job , he says , is dealing with the financial mess left by previous Turks and Caicos administrations .
" The mountain of unpaid bills was somewhere around $ 70 m and if you add a loan portfolio of about $ 60 m , you come to total indebtedness of $ 130 m , which for a country of this size is actually a lot of money , " he says .
' The only step ' Blyth Duncanson says the governor is acting " like a military Junta "
Those I did find still in favour of the British intervention believe any temporary loss of democracy is a price worth paying for stopping excesses , and helping to restore the territory 's damaged reputation .
Some also claim that free speech was being curtailed under the former Michael Misick regime .
Aubrey Butterfield Junior , Chair of the Providenciales Chamber of Commerce , was one of those who publicly advocated for Britain to introduce direct rule .
" If direct rule had not been introduced one or two things would have happened , " he says .
" Either people would have stood up and you would have had a major revolt in this country for good governance or the country would have ended up another banana republic like some other countries around . "
But going by the conversation that was already in full flow when I entered a bustling island café , some here have no time for direct rule or the man charged with running it .
" The governor he is acting like a dictator .
The Foreign Office need to look into the governor and remove him immediately , " said one of the men .
" I would like to see our people take over this country .
You 've got to take independence , that 's the only step you can do .
independence . "

On May first Bruce Harper was stopped by a Davis County Sheriff 's Deputy .
Harper was pulled over because his front license plate was n't hanging properly .
" Stay in your car , stay in your car .
" This what the sheriff ’s deputy yelled at Harper .
But Harper did n't stay in the car .
The officer then drew his gun and suddenly it was on .
In fact , more than sixty times , the officer told Harper to turn around .
And more than a dozen times , Harper asked the Davis County Sheriff 's Deputy why he was being stopped .
At one point , Harper even asked , " Are you going to shoot me ?
Harper was tasered once with shooting electrodes .
Then , reportedly , according to testimony at his trial , Harper was tasered at least five or six more times with the taser held directly against him .
Mark Flores : " He was certain at that point he was going to die .
That his heart was just going to explode and he was going to die .
" Harper was charged with what his attorney calls “ resisting arrest .
” But at trial a few weeks ago , a jury acquitted him of that charge .
His attorney now says he will file a federal lawsuit against those involved for allegedly violating Harper 's civil rights .
Mark Flores : " I still find it unbelievable that someone can get pulled over for a crooked front license plate ... and somehow ends up getting tasered six times . "

Mervyn King , the governor of the Bank of England , has launched a blistering attack on Britain 's banks , describing the £ 1tn government support given to them as " breathtaking " .
In an outspoken speech last night , in which he made his clearest call yet for the banks to be broken up , King warned that the British people will be paying for the cost of the financial crisis for a generation .
" To paraphrase a great wartime leader , never in the field of financial endeavour has so much money been owed by so few to so many .
And , one might add , so far with little real reform , " he said .
King 's comments came as several banks , which either weathered last year 's maelstrom , or survived only because of big government bailouts , are preparing to pay out billions of pounds in bonuses .
King criticised the industry 's failure to reform and told business leaders in Edinburgh that the current regulatory arrangements were impractical .
It was " hard to see why " support could not be limited to retail , or utility , banking , he said .
" Anyone who proposed giving government guarantees to retail depositors and other creditors , and then suggested that such funding could be used to finance highly risky and speculative activities , would be thought rather unworldly .
But that is where we now are , " he said .
He added : " The case for a serious review of how the banking industry is structured and regulated is strong . "
King said the government would have to put the public finances on a more sustainable footing and warned people that they would have to become savers rather than spenders in the years ahead .
" Although there are no simple answers , it is in our collective interest to reduce the dependence of so many households and businesses on so few institutions that engage in so many risky activities , " the governor said .
He told bankers not to return to the practices of two years ago before the credit crunch began .
" It is important that banks in receipt of public support are not encouraged to try to earn their way out of that support by resuming the very activities that got them into trouble in the first place , " he said .
" The sheer creative imagination of the financial sector to think up new ways of taking risk will in the end , I believe , force us to confront the ' too important to fail ' question . "
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , said : " Mervyn King 's speech is powerful and persuasive .
His analysis of how the government 's system for regulating banks failed and how there has been ' little real reform ' since is one I share . "
The Office for National Statistics yesterday reported a record September deficit of almost £ 15bn and an all - time high of £ 77bn for the first six months of the fiscal year , more than the previous record under John Major 's government for the whole of 1993 / 94 .
It also said total net debt rose to £ 824.8 bn at the end of September , equivalent to 59 % of GDP .
Excluding the cost of bank bailouts , net debt was considerably lower at £ 682.8bn , or 49 % of GDP , not high by international standards but well above the government 's self - imposed limit of 40 % .
King said the figures showed that as part of a wider rebalancing of the economy away from imports and consumption and towards investment and exports , the public finances would need to be brought under control .
" That is consistent with the need , now widely accepted , to eliminate the large structural fiscal deficit and to raise the national saving rate . "
The governor is aware , though , that cutting public spending and raising taxes too early could threaten the nascent economic recovery that is likely to be confirmed by growth data for the third quarter due to be released on Friday .
The Conservatives seized on the borrowing figures , saying they showed the extent of the debt crisis under the present government .
" A responsible government would act immediately to start reducing public spending and bring Britain 's deficit down , " said Philip Hammond , shadow chief secretary to the Treasury .
" Failure to act will risk interest rate rises , causing the recovery to falter and putting jobs at risk . "
But Liam Byrne , the chief secretary to the Treasury , insisted it would be a mistake to cut spending at this point .
" Today 's figures are broadly in line with our forecast and reflect our action to lock in the recovery and get the economy growing again by the turn of the year , " he said .
Alistair Darling will present his pre-budget report to parliament in about a month and may need to revise his budget forecast of a £ 175 bn deficit for the current year , according to economists .
California 's Governor will not use his power to clear the fugitive filmmaker of rape conviction
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger waded into the Roman Polanski case Thursday , saying that while he admires the Oscar - winning director ’s work , he would not treat his “ situation any differently than everyone else . ”
During an interview on CNN ’s Situation Room , the actor - turned - politician excluded the possibility of an advance pardon should the film director , 76 , return to the U.S. Polanski , who made Rosmeary ’s Baby , Chinatown and The Pianist , was arrested Sept. 26 at Zurich airport on a warrant related to a l977 child rape case and his subsequent flight from justice .

“ It does n’t matter if you are a big - time movie actor or a big - time movie director or producer , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ I think that he is a very respected person , and I am a big admirer of his work .
RELATED : Polanski Had No Idea He ’d Be Caught
“ But nevertheless , I think he should be treated like everyone else , ” he added .
As California ’s governor , with one year remaining in office , the Austrian - born actor has the power to grant clemency to the director .
Said Schwarzenegger : “ One should look into all of the allegations , not only his allegations but the allegations about his case .
Was there something done wrong ?
You know , was injustice done in the case ? ”
Polanski ’s lawyer has vowed his client will fight extradition to California .

You know , the healthcare bill that 's entirely paid for -- and will actually reduce the deficit .
Guest Joe Conason made the mistake of pointing this out , stirring Scarborough into one of his little freakouts .
Of course he denied supporting the combination of wars and tax cuts , which , if you watched any cable news during that time , is total horseshit .

A Book on Programming the Google App Engine
Programming Google App Engine is a new book from O’Reilly , written by Google ’s Dan Sanderson .
The App Engine , despite all its downtimes , is an interesting ( Python / Java based ) environment with a focus on being scalable .
And even if you already have a domain and server elsewhere , you could write the front - end on that server and have a JavaScript app on it communicate to a Python JSON API back - end over at the App Engine .

“ Remember , you can not be both young and wise .
Young people who pretend to be wise to the ways of the world are mostly just cynics .
Cynicism masquerades as wisdom , but it is the farthest thing from it .
Because cynics do n’t learn anything .
Because cynicism is a self - imposed blindness , a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us .
Cynics always say no .
But saying “ yes ” begins things .
Saying “ yes ” is how things grow .
Saying “ yes ” leads to knowledge .
“ Yes ” is for young people .
So for as long as you have the strength to , say “ yes ' . ”

U2 played for 10,000 fans in front of the Brandenburg Gate
A U2 show marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall ran into controversy after organisers built a wall around the venue .
A two metre barrier was erected around the Brandenburg gate to keep out people without tickets for the show .
" It 's a shame that a barrier has been set up .
It 's stopping many Berliners from hearing the concert , " local politician Frank Henkel told the BBC .
The U2 show was part of the MTV Europe Music Awards .
Ten thousand tickets were given away free online and snapped up within hours .
U2 were also named best live act at the MTV Europe Awards after their gig Police in the city said they were expecting as many as 100,000 people to descend on the square in front of the Brandenburg Gate to try and catch a glimpse of U2 .
Mr Henkel , Christian Democrat floor leader in the Berlin city - state parliament , said : " It would have been so much better if as many Berliners as possible could have taken part .
" We do n't know who 's responsible for this , whether it 's U2 or MTV .
He continued : " 10,000 people is a lot , but U2 could have had an even bigger audience enjoying their music at this wonderful location . "
U2 manager Paul McGuinness said Berliners thought it was " pretty ironic " that an event to mark the falling of the wall has resulted in another one being constructed .
Fans , too , were displeased .
" It 's completely ridiculous that they are blocking the view , " said Louis - Pierre Boily , a Canadian fan who travelled to Berlin despite failing to secure tickets for the show .
" I thought it 's a free show , but MTV probably wants people to watch it on TV to get their ratings up . "
' Safety and security '
But MTV said it worked with the local promoter , the city and police to install a temporary fence " around the site to ensure the safety and security of the attendees at the event as well as residents and businesses in the area " .
Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit said : " The Pariser Platz was the scene for a joyful celebration of peace , love , freedom and music that Berlin will never forget .
" Congratulations to U2 and MTV for bringing this unique moment of musical history to the city of Berlin . "
U2's representatives declined to comment .

Zombies , zombies , everywhere .
One of the enduring myths of the financial crisis has been the claim that it was the result of ( a ) Fannie and Freddie ( b ) the Community Reinvestment Act , which forced poor , helpless bankers to make loans to you - know - who .
It ’s a myth that wo n’t go away — I get asked about it almost every time I give a public lecture — even though it has been extensively debunked .
( See , e.g. , here . )
But reading this scary piece about commercial real estate , I realized that CRE offers yet another debunking .
After all , there was no federal act driving banks to lend money for office parks and shopping malls ; Fannie and Freddie were n’t in the CRE loan business ; yet 55 percent — 55 percent ! — of commercial mortgages that will come due before 2014 are underwater .
The lenders did n’t need government urging to dive deep into a property bubble , and drown .
In September , a federal judge dismissed a First Amendment lawsuit brought against Sony by a disgruntled gamer who had been banned from the PlayStation Network .
Undeterred , that gamer appealed the decision last month , and this week filed a new suit against Microsoft and Nintendo ; this one bypassing the Bill of Rights and instead citing the Declaration of Independence .
The only pursuit Mario is interested in is the pursuit of big air .
In the suit , the San Jose , California , gamer takes exception to a recent Nintendo Wii system update that disables access to unauthorized third - party programs like the Homebrew Channel .
Specifically , the plaintiff is upset about losing the ability to use a program that would unlock the character Rosalina in Mario Kart Wii .
Ordinarily , a player would need to have a Super Mario Galaxy save file on the system in order to unlock that character .
" In federal terms , the plaintiff who relies heavily on video games for happiness , would like the federal court to decide if Nintendo is interfering with certain player 's pursuit of happiness , which is stated in the United States Declaration of Independence , " the suit states , " where Benjamin Franklin was in agreement with Thomas Jefferson in downplaying the protection of ' property ' as a goal of government , replacing the idea with ' happiness . ' "
The suit then states the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4 , 1776 , and quotes the portion dealing with the unalienable rights to " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . "
As for the Microsoft portion of the suit , the gamer had an Xbox 360 system suffer the " red ring of death " failure , and he claims he can't afford the $ 100 fee Microsoft would charge him to fix it .
The suit claims the plaintiff 's 360 is " only one of two ways in which he relies on to socialize , " as he suffers from depression , obsessive - compulsive disorder , panic disorder , agoraphobia , and Crohn 's disease .
The gamer is asking for $ 75,000 from Microsoft due to " the stress put on the plaintiff having to find a way to acquire a new Xbox 360 system and the sadness he will have in the meantime of finding one he can afford . "
As for Nintendo , the plaintiff wants $ 5,000 for interfering with his pursuit of happiness and an injunction preventing Nintendo from blocking access to the Homebrew Channel or the program he used to unlock Mario Kart Wii characters .

Japan hosts many US troops but is pulling out of the Afghanistan naval mission Japan 's government has pledged $ 5 bn ( £ 3 bn ) in new aid to Afghanistan over the next five years .
The decision comes days before US President Barack Obama visits Tokyo .
Japan 's centre - left government has said it will end a naval refuelling mission in support of US - led efforts in Afghanistan .
Since coming to power in September the government also said it was working on a plan to offer more civilian aid instead .
Japan 's government has been working on a plan to offer more aid to Afghanistan since announcing it would end a mission by the Maritime Self Defence Force to supply fuel to assist US - led operations in the country .
Now there is a figure - $ 5 bn ( £ 3 bn ) over the next five years .

It is likely to be used for job training , helping former Taliban fighters to reintegrate with society , and for agriculture and infrastructure development .
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama is expected to discuss details of the scheme with President Obama when he visits Japan on Friday .
Mr Hatoyama took power in September after winning a landslide in a general election which ended more than half a century of almost unbroken power for the conservative Liberal Democratic Party .
His Democratic Party of Japan wants a more equal relationship with the United States .
The alliance , half a century old next year , is critical to Japan 's security and a cornerstone of American policy in Asia .
One source of tension is the planned relocation of an American military base on the southern island of Okinawa .
The US is resisting Japan 's attempts to reopen negotiations , saying it would undermine a broader agreement to a reorganise the nearly 50,000 strong American force in the country .

I need to know what number comes next in this sequence and why .
9,73,241,561,1081,1849 , _?__
-----------------------------
I matched 1,2,3 , ...,6 up with the numbers .
I tried a linear regression , a quadratic regression ,
and a cubic regression on it .
Best results were
with the cubic :
y = 8x^3 + 4x ^2 - 4 x = 1
-----------------------------
The next term would be f( 7 ) = 2913

Answer by Edwin McCravy ( 18223 ) ( Show Source ) :
Edwin's solution
by a difference table :
Stanbon 's solution is correct but it requires
something you probably have not studied :
We make what is called a " difference table " :
Write the numbers in a row : 9 73 241 561 1081 1849
Under that row , subtract each adjacent pair of numbers , placing the difference between and below them .
( 73 -9=64 , so write 64 between and below the pair 9 73 , 241-73=168 , so write 168 between and below the pair 73 241 , etc. )
Like this : 9 73 241 561 1081 1849 64 168 320 520 768
That row is called the row of 1st differences .
Under that row , again subtract each adjacent pair of numbers , placing the difference between and below them , like this : 9 73 241 561 1081 1849 64 168 320 520 768 104 152 200 248
That row is called the row of 2nd differences .
Under that row , again subtract each adjacent pair of numbers , placing the difference between and below them , like this : 9 73 241 561 1081 1849 64 168 320 520 768 104 152 200 248 48 48 48
That row is called the row of 3rd differences .
Now notice that they are all the same , so we do n't need to make any more rows of differences .
So we assume that the next 3rd difference , if we had the next number after 1849 , would also be a 48 , so we write another 48 on the bottom row .
( I 'll color it red ) : 9 73 241 561 1081 1849 64 168 320 520 768 104 152 200 248 48 48 48 48
Then we work backwards by adding .
Add the 48 to the 248 , getting 296 , Write that to the right of the 248 .
( I 'll color it red too ) .
9 73 241 561 1081 1849 64 168 320 520 768 104 152 200 248 296 48 48 48 48 Still working backward ,
Add the 296 to the 768 , getting 1064 , Write that to the right of the 768 .
( I 'll color it red too ) .
9 73 241 561 1081 1849 64 168 320 520 768 1064 104 152 200 248 296 48 48 48 48
One more step working backwards .
Add 1064 to the 1849 , getting 2913 , write it at the end of the first row , and there is your answer ! : 9 73 241 561 1081 1849 2913 64 168 320 520 768 1064 104 152 200 248 296 48 48 48 48 Answer :
The next term is 2913 Edwin

Answer by terryriegel ( 1 ) ( Show Source ) :
It can be any number you want .
The solution arises from the fact that anything times zero is just zero and also adding zero to something does n't change it .
Now granted the formula will get a bit lengthy but it is a valid solution and it can be any number you want .
Lets start with a simple sequence of three random numbers between ( 1 - 10 ) from random.org I got 6,9,2 , _ whats next , Ok back to random.org its came up with 5 .
So our problem is to come up with a formula f( n ) that produces f( 1 ) =6 , f( 2 ) =9 , f( 3 ) =2 , and f( 4) =5
f ( 1) =6
f( 2)=9
f( 3) =2
f ( 4 ) =5 Lets initially choose f( n ) = 6 f( 1 ) = 6 check
f ( 2 ) = 6 fail so lets refine it f( n ) = 6 + ( n - 1 ) ( 3/1 ) f ( 1 ) = 6 check
f ( 2 ) = 9 check
f ( 3 ) = 12 fail so we refine further f( n ) = 6 + ( n - 1 ) ( 3/1 ) + ( n - 1 ) ( n - 2 ) ( - 10/2 ) f ( 1 ) = 6 check
f ( 2 ) = 9 check
f (3 ) = 2 check
f ( 4 ) = - 15 fail so we refine further f( n ) = 6 + ( n - 1 ) ( 3/1 ) + ( n - 1 ) ( n - 2 ) ( - 10/2 ) + ( n - 1 ) ( n - 2 ) ( n - 3 ) ( 10/3 ) f ( 1 ) = 6 check
f ( 2 ) = 9 check
f (3 ) = 2 check
f (4 ) = 5 check
So to answer the original question using the same methods the formula looks like this ... f( 7 ) = 0 simplified ...

Meteor between the Clouds
Credit & Copyright : Victor van Wulfen
Explanation :
This bright meteor streaked through dark night skies over Sutherland , South Africa on November 15 .
Potentially part of the annual Leonid meteor shower , its sudden , brilliant appearance , likened to a camera 's flash , was captured by chance as it passed between two clouds .
Of course , the two clouds are also visible to the eye in dark southern skies - the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds - satellite galaxies of our own Milky Way .
This year 's Leonid meteor shower peaked on November 17 as the Earth passed through the stream of dust from periodic comet Tempel - Tuttle .
He said : " He was just putting forward explanations of why there is some resistance by people to new things .
He was trying to say it was understandable some people react to some things with a certain amount of resistance . "
A ROW has broken out in Portugal after a Nobel Prize - winning author denounced the Bible as a " handbook of bad morals " .
Speaking at the launch of his new book Cain , Jose Saramago , who won the 1998 Nobel Prize for Literature , said society would probably be better off without the Bible .
Roman Catholic Church leaders accused the 86 - year - old of a publicity stunt .
The book is an ironic retelling of the Bible story of Cain , Adam and Eve 's elder son who kills his brother Abel .
At the launch event in the northern Portuguese town of Penafiel on Sunday , Saramago said he did not think the book would offend Catholics " because they do not read the Bible " .
" The Bible is a manual of bad morals ( which ) has a powerful influence on our culture and even our way of life .
Without the Bible we would be different , and probably better people , " he was quoted as saying by the news agency Lusa .
Saramago attacked " a cruel , jealous and unbearable God ( who ) exists only in our heads " and said he did not think his book would cause problems for the Catholic Church " because Catholics do not read the Bible .
" It might offend Jews , but that does n't really matter to me , " he added .
Father Manuel Marujao , the spokesman for the Portuguese conference of bishops , said he thought the book was a publicity stunt .
" A writer of Jose Saramago 's standing can criticise , ( but ) insults do no one any good , particularly a Nobel Prize winner , " the priest said .
Rabbi Elieze Martino , spokesman for the Jewish community in Lisbon , said the Jewish world would not be shocked by the writings of Saramago or anyone else .
" Saramago does not know the Bible , " the rabbi said , " he has only superficial understanding of it . "
The author caused a scandal in Portugal in 1992 with The Gospel According to Jesus Christ .
The book depicted Jesus losing his virginity to Mary Magdalene and being used by God to control the world .
Saramago quit Portugal at the time and moved to Lanzarote , in the Spanish Canary Islands .
Juande Ramos has been sacked as manager of CSKA Moscow after just six weeks with the Russian club .
Spaniard leaves club after just six weeks
Juande Ramos has been sacked as manager of CSKA Moscow after just six weeks with the Russian club .
The former Real Madrid and Tottenham boss was relieved of his duties on Monday following the 3 - 1 defeat at the hands of Russian Premier League rivals FK Moscow at the weekend , having led the team to just four domestic wins in his nine games in charge .
CSKA were beaten by Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League last week and are now 10 points off top - of - the - table club Rubin Kazan in the Russian league .
A statement on the club ' ssaid : " As of today the contract of Juande Ramos was terminated by mutual consent . "
Ramos had only been in the job a short time after he replaced Brazilian manager Zico , who was fired in September following a string of poor results .
Former FK Moscow and Krylya Sovietov Samara coach Leonid Slutsky has taken over from the 54 - year - old Spaniard until the end of the season .
The Russian outfit travel to Old Trafford next Tuesday as they look to get their European campaign back on track .

© 2004 g o o t a r - Generating 3,919,104 Gootar chords , By James C. Cranwell , 04/20/2004 Major Chords are Primary Colors ...
red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
The spreading into rays was called dispersion by Newton and he called the different coloured rays the spectrum .
He learnt that when the light rays were passed again through a prism the rays turned back into white light .
If only one ray was passed through the prism it would come out the same colour as it went in .
Newton concluded that white light was made up of seven different coloured rays .
They are just one part of the electromagnetic spectrum ... the part ( frequencies ) that are visible / discernable to the human eye .
There are also a plethora of frequencies and colors in between these seven colors and ones we can't see , for instance radio ways , ultra-violet and infra-red .
Notice the first , third and fifth colors are red , yellow and blue .
C D E F G A B Root Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seventh E F# G# A B C# D#
There are also an abundance of other frequencies ( tones / vibrations ) in the sound spectrum , but the notes in the scale will repeat themselves the further higher and lower you go up and down in frequency .
Notes of the same tone but different pitch are called octaves , for instance , " A - 440 " is an abbreviation for the official government standard of musical pitch in the United States .
Related to pianos , it means that the strings for the " A " just above " middle C " should vibrate at 440 cycles per second .
Higher and lower A's will vibrate at 880 and 220 respectively .
( notice the frequencies are equal divisors of each other ... either double or half )
The light waves ( electromagnectic spectrum ) are also doing this , we just can't see the higher and lower frequencies because unlike intermittent sounds , we are constantly being bombarded with light , radio and other waves .
If we could actually see all of them , it would probably appear as just a big soupy mess ... an analogy using sound would be like hitting all of the piano keys at the same time .
I guess our brains just picked out a nice section of the electromagnetic field ( the scale of light ) and made it visible .
So , there are seven color frequencies and seven sound frequencies used by our eyes and ears for sight , hearing , art , music , painting , song writing , etc .
The Color Wheel
A color circle , based on red , yellow and blue , is traditional in the field of art .
Sir Isaac Newton developed the first circular diagram of colors in 1666 .
Since then scientists and artists have studied and designed numerous variations of this concept .
Differences of opinion about the validity of one format over another continue to provoke debate .
In reality , any color circle or color wheel which presents a logically arranged sequence of pure hues has merit .
Primary Colors
Red , yellow and blue Secondary Colors
Green , orange and purple Tertiary Colors
Yellow - orange , red - orange , red- purple , blue - purple , blue - green and yellow - green .
In traditional color theory , these are the 3 pigment colors that can not be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors .
All other colors are derived from these 3 hues
These are the colors formed by mixing the primary colors .
These are the colors formed by mixing one primary and one secondary color
The first , third and fifth colors of the rainbow are Primary colors ... red , yellow and blue .
The first , third and fifth notes of a major scale are Major chords ... root , third and fifth .
Something quite amazing happens when we tie all of this information together ( that 's Physics , Optics , Light , Sight , Sound , Hearing , Art , Music , Neuroscience ) and line up the two groups of seven up together ...
Primary Colors are Major Chords !
Red
Root Orange
Second Yellow
Third Green
Fourth Blue
Fifth Indigo
Sixth Violet
Seventh
If you could actually " hear " the extremely high frequencies the red , yellow and blue ( primary color ) light waves are vibrating at ... you would hear a Major chord .
If you could " see " the sound of notes in a major chord relative to the same " rainbow scale " used by light ... you would see notes and chords in primary color just like way they are used in the chord diagram program above .
If you currently run a few websites , you may have wondered whether or not it 's possible to host those sites from the comfort of your own home .
It is possible , but it might not be the cost - effective solution you 're looking for .
There are some other problems with running a server from your home office too , but we 'll hit those at the end of this article .
For the very determined , here 's how you can actually run your own server from your home office .
1 . Make sure that your current ISP is okay with your new plans .
Often , running a server from home is against the terms of your contract , so double - check this .
2 . Get a dedicated IP address .
You do n't want your IP address to change every time you have to restart your system .
To get a fixed IP address , you will have to upgrade to a business service ( which may cost you more money ) .
Check out broadband options for fixed IPs .
3 . Get a web server .
You can purchase software like Apache and run that from a different system – note : I said ‘ different system . '
4 . Use a different system .
It is not – I repeat , not – a good idea to run a server from your home or office computer .
Why ?
Because you are setting yourself up for safety issues , and you 're going to disappoint your site visitors when your site goes offline due to system crashes or problems .
5 . If you have a Mac , you can simply check out what Apple says about running your own server on the Apple website – the details are pretty clear , though , once again , it 's not necessarily recommended .
Some Definite Drawbacks
Now comes the fun part .
It 's also the part where I try to talk you out of running your own server from home !
Ready ?
1 . Your energy costs will skyrocket .
2 . Your site speeds will not ( and cannot , really ) ask fast as the speeds that hosting companies offer .
3 . Your site will go offline somewhat frequently , and this will cause your clients some aggravation .
4 . You probably wo n't save any money .
I know that you think you will , but compare the costs of the actual setup plus electric ( and time that you may be losing business because your sites are down ) , and you 'll find that option for a slightly more expensive dedicated hosting package from a reliable hosting company is a better idea .
5 . No support .
If things go awry , you 're on your own ( unless you are planning on building out your own support team in your home office ! ) .
Can you host your own websites from home ?
Sure .
Do you want to ?
Probably not .
My advice is this : carefully weigh costs and other factors before you decide to move ahead with this setup .
It may seem simpler just to make some space in your office and set up your Mac , but that 's not necessarily the route that you should be taking .
Not convinced ?
Leave your arguments below .
CTF 2006 Overview
Physical Layout
Each team has a color - coded table .
The tables are set up in a " U " shape , with the open end facing the wall .
The organizers , Kenshoto , are at the center of the room at their circular black table , and had run cables to each of the teams ' tables .
Two cables are RJ45 ( same as last year ) , and one cable is RJ11 ( uh - oh ) .
One of the RJ45s is an uplink to a switch , and the " team LAN " .
The network was 192.168.
TEAM.0/24 .
For example , team 3 is on 192.168.3.0/24 , with a default route of 192.168.3.1 .
Each team is given access to a " team server " ( on the " team LAN " as 192.168.TEAM.2 ) with an " admin " account as well as the " root " password .
Many vulnerable services are running here , and it is the center of the contest .
The second RJ45 is a mirror port , showing all network traffic into and out of the server .
This is to allow network sniffing so that what is happening on the server can be watched at the network level .
Unfortunately , this cable was n't live until late Saturday .
Traffic is all source NAT'd , so it is n't possible to distinguish traffic sources to tell a rival team 's attack apart from a Kenshoto service poll .
The RJ11 is a regular phone line that gives each team access to the Kenshoto phone system .
You can call other teams by their team number , press " 0 " for " The Hotline " , or press " 9 " for voicemail .
All contest points that require interaction with Kenshoto is over " The Hotline " this year .
A big change from last year , which used network clients for scoring the non-overwrite points .
Services
On each server are a large number of services ( web applications , network services of unknown function , console applications , etc ) .
Each server 's services are nearly identical to each other , so if a team can understand what their own server is doing , they have an insight into what the other teams ' servers are doing .
For example , services might be a web application where you can order software , the " finger " daemon , or a console - based " mail " too .
A " public " token is one that is " normally " visible .
It 's not special if you can see it , but if you can compromise the service , it can be overwritten .
A " private " token is one that is not normally visible .
If you can compromise the service in some way , you can read a private token .
Additionally , some private tokens can also be overwritten .
An " overwritten " token is one where a rival team has taken their " team token " and placed it in another team 's vulnerable service .
Within each service is a " token " .
It can be one of three possible kinds of tokens : " public " , " private " , or " overwritten " .
Last year , tokens were a long string of alphanumeric characters ( base64 encoding ) .
This year , tokens were a 32 character string of digits ( base10 encoding ) .
Each team is given a different " team token " to use for overwrites .
To keep the teams from just turning off their server and declaring themselves immune to attack , Kenshoto polls each of the teams ' services , and keeps a running record of each team 's " Service Level " ( SL ) .
This is a percentage of " successful polls " vs " total polls " .
The idea being that as a team tries to work to patch their vulnerable services , if they accidentally make the service non-functional , their SL will drop .
Also , outside attackers may accidentally disrupt a service while trying to gain access to it .
By default , each of the servers pass all Kenshoto service polls , so at the start of the contest , every team has a 100 % SL .
During each Kenshoto scoring phase , Kenshoto also updates all the " private " tokens with new token values .
As the contest goes forward , a team can repeatedly steal tokens from vulnerable services , getting more and more unique tokens .
Scoring
The contest is scored based on " Breakthroughs " , " Steals " , " Pwns " , and " Service Level " .
( " Penalties " can also be levied for breaking rules , etc. )
To earn a " Breakthrough " , a team must write up a description of a vulnerable service , and include detailed information on how to exploit its vulnerability , and submit it to Kenshoto .
Only software vulnerabilities that give access to either private tokens or allow for overwrites to happen are considered " valid " Breakthroughs .
To earn a " Steal " , a team must exploit a vulnerable service and record a private token .
To prove that they saw a private token , the team must submit the token to Kenshoto for scoring .
To earn a " Pwn " , a team must exploit a vulnerable service and overwrite the service 's token with the " team token " .
Kenshoto is monitoring token locations and automatically notices when a service token has been overwritten by a rival team .
If a team does something against the contest rules ( like performing any kind of intentional Denial of Service ) , Kenshoto " fines " them with Penalty points .
Total score is ( SUM ( BT values ) +
Steals + Pwns ) * SL - Penalties .
The tricky issue with scoring is that BT points are not public , and are not reflected on the visible scoreboard .
Each service has an associated BT value , depending on how hard Kenshoto thinks it is to find and exploit a given service .
For example , finding how to exploit a network service that accidentally runs commands following a ' ; ' , is going to have a small BT value .
Finding how to exploit a flaw in a network protocol specifically designed to be obfuscated is going to be worth a great deal more .
[ dial tone ] 0 " Welcome to the Hotline .
Press 1 to check service levels .
Press 2 to submit a token .
Press 3 to submit a breakthrough . "

Press 1 for instructions .
Press 2 to submit a breakthrough .
Press 3 to check on the status of a breakthrough . "
2
" Enter the filename of your breakthrough , followed by the pound sign . " 0003 # " Your breakthrough has been accepted . " [ fast busy ]
To submit a BT , the team has to put a text file with an all - numeric name into their server 's " / bt " directory , and then dial the Kenshoto Hotline to submit the BT .
For example , after putting the write - up in / bt/0003 , a team would pick up the phone :
[ dial tone ] 0 " Welcome to the Hotline ... " 2 " Welcome [ team name ] .
Please enter your token now . "

Press 1 to submit another token . " [ fast busy ]
If the token is n't valid , then it responds with " Access Denied " instead of " Token accepted " .
If you try to submit a token that had already been accepted , it reports " Token previously accepted . "
To submit a stolen token , the team has to dial the Kenshoto Hotline and enter it :
If the token is n't valid , then it responds with " Access Denied " instead of " Token accepted " .
If you try to submit a token that had already been accepted , it reports " Token previously accepted . "
Rules
Abortion is almost as old as childbirth .
There has always been a need for some women to end their pregnancies .
In modern times , the law ’s attitude toward that need has varied .
In the United States , at the time the Constitution was adopted , abortions before “ quickening ” were both legal and commonplace , often performed by midwives .
In the nineteenth century , under the influence of the ascendant medical profession , which opposed abortion ( and wanted to control health care ) , states began to outlaw the procedure , and by the turn of the twentieth century it was all but uniformly illegal .
The rise of the feminist movement led to widespread efforts to decriminalize abortion , and in 1973 the Supreme Court found , in Roe v. Wade , that the Constitution prohibited the states from outlawing it .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Throughout this long legal history , the one constant has been that women have continued to have abortions .
The rate has declined slightly in recent years , but , according to the Guttmacher Institute , thirty - five per cent of all women of reproductive age in America today will have had an abortion by the time they are forty - five .
It might be assumed that such a common procedure would be included in a nation ’s plan to protect the health of its citizens .
In fact , the story of abortion during the past decade has been its separation from other medical services available to women .
Abortion , as the academics like to say , is being marginalized .
The latest evidence comes from the House of Representatives , which two weekends ago narrowly passed its health - care bill , by a vote of 220 to 215 .
One reason that the Democrats won back control of Congress is that the Party adopted a “ big tent ” philosophy on abortion .
The implications of that approach became clear when , during the health - care vote , the House considered a last - minute amendment by Bart Stupak , a Michigan Democrat , which proposed scrubbing the bill of government subsidies for abortion procedures .
It passed 240 to 194 , with sixty - four Democrats voting in favor .
A clear understanding of the structure of the health - care proposals currently under consideration shows why the Stupak amendment is such a threat to abortion rights .
At the heart of the proposals is the idea of an exchange , where consumers will be able to select among competing insurance plans .
Theoretically , the exchange will increase consumer choice , promote competition , and ( somewhat more theoretically ) lower costs for everyone .
If there is a public option , it will be offered through the exchange .
At first , many of the people using the exchange will be those who are unable to pay for health insurance on their own .
For them , the government will offer a sliding scale of subsidies .
It is largely these subsidies which will increase the availability of insurance ; estimates of how many people will gain coverage vary , but it may be close to forty million .
Restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion go back to the Hyde amendment , which became law more than thirty years ago ; for example , there has long been a ban on abortions under Medicaid or in military hospitals .
But the implications of the Stupak amendment are broader , because of the structure of the exchange .
To start with , Stupak states that anyone who buys insurance with a government subsidy cannot choose a plan that covers abortion , even if that person receives only a small subsidy , and even if only a tiny portion of the full premium goes for abortion care .
And the influence of the amendment reaches beyond the recipients of federal subsidies .
Stupak would prohibit the public option from offering any plans that cover abortion .
Further , it is expected that each year more Americans will use the exchange , including people who do n’t need subsidies , but under the Stupak amendment insurance companies would have no incentive to offer those people coverage for abortion services , since doing so might cost them the business of subsidized customers .
Today , most policies cover abortion ; in a post - Stupak world , they probably wo n’t .
With a health - care plan that is supposed to increase access and lower costs , the opposite would be true with respect to abortion .
And that , of course , is what legislators like Stupak want — to make abortions harder , and more expensive , to obtain .
Stupak and his allies were willing to kill the whole bill to get their way ; the liberals in the House were not .
It may be that the endurance of Roe and Democratic control of the federal government have led to a certain complacency among abortion - rights supporters .
Yet it ’s not only with regard to insurance that abortion services are being treated like a second - class form of medicine .
There is , for instance , the proliferation of “ conscience clauses , ” which allow medical professionals to refuse to conduct procedures that they disapprove of .
Shortly after Roe , Congress passed the first major conscience clause , which stated that medical professionals and hospitals that receive certain federal funds did not have to provide abortions or sterilizations if they objected on “ the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions . ”
The Bush Administration sought to dramatically expand the clauses to cover not only doctors and nurses but anyone who works in a hospital , including pharmacists , and to increase the range of practices that might be rejected — a step that could potentially include such services as the dispensing of birth control .
President Obama has said that he will revise or overturn the policy .
The President is pro-choice , and he has signalled some misgivings about the Stupak amendment .
But , like many modern pro-choice Democrats , he has worked so hard to be respectful of his opponents on this issue that he sometimes seems to cede them the moral high ground .
In his book “ The Audacity of Hope , ” he describes the “ undeniably difficult issue of abortion ” and ponders “ the middle - aged feminist who still mourns her abortion . ”
Elsewhere , he announces , “ Abortion vexes . ”
The opponents of abortion are n’t vexed — they are mobilized , focussed , and driven to succeed .
The Catholic bishops took the lead in pushing for the Stupak amendment , and they squeezed legislators in a way that would do any K Street lobbyist proud .
( One never sees that kind of effort on behalf of other aspects of Catholic teaching , like opposition to the death penalty . )
Meanwhile , the pro-choice forces temporized .
But , as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed not long ago , abortion rights “ center on a woman ’s autonomy to determine her life ’s course , and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature . ”
Every diminishment of that right diminishes women .
With stakes of such magnitude , it is wise to weigh carefully the difference between compromise and surrender . ♦
An ally of the chairman told Politico.com that the resolution was " a disaster in the making " .
" Finally Republicans have some momentum , " he said , referring to two state governors ' seats captured recently from the Democrats .
" The last [ thing ] we want to do is change the subject . "
The more the market recovers , the more bearish David Rosenberg gets ( which , of course , is how it should be ) .
Today 's startling prediction , which David made on Bloomberg Radio this morning ?
Unemployment may go to 13 % .
It would be hard to reconcile THAT one with the popular v-shaped recovery theory .
Bloomberg : The U.S. unemployment rate may rise to a post - World War II high of 13 percent in the aftermath of the recession , said David Rosenberg , chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc. in Toronto .
“ This is going to be the mother of all jobless recoveries , ” Rosenberg said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio .
“ At the beginning of the year , who was calling for unemployment to go up to 10 percent ? ”
Rosenberg said the recession , the deepest since the Great Depression , “ is truly secular in nature ” and said the economy is “ in a post - bubble credit collapse . ”
A 13 percent unemployment rate would be the highest since monthly records began in January 1948 , according to Labor Department data .
The previous postwar high was 10.8 percent in December 1982 .
Yearly records , which began in 1929 , show joblessness climbed to almost 25 percent in 1933 during the Great Depression .

The Clockwork Atom Bomb
by Dominic Green
The wind in here was deafening .
The girl had to shout .
“ THERE IS MORE THAN ONE IN HERE .
THEY LIVE IN THE MACHINES .
THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE MACHINES , BUT NOT WITH TECHNICIANS AND ELECTRICIANS .
WITH SORCERY . ”
The machines did not look made by sorcery .
They were entirely silent , looking like rows of gigantic , rusted steel chess pawns twice the height of a man , with no pipes or wires entering or leaving them , apparently sitting here unused for any purpose .
Mativi felt an urgent , entirely rational need to be in an another line of employment .
Board games have become one of the last resorts for entertainment .
In a world full of naked ladies , PlayStations and underground street - fighting circuits , it seems unlikely that anyone old enough to form an opinion that matters would want to bust out some dice and a clunky piece of cardboard .
But someday you ’re going to be at a social gathering when suddenly the power goes out .
From the darkness the host appears like a phantom , holding candlesticks in one hand and Clue Jr. in the other .
If you ever find yourself in such a grim situation then you need to know the enemy .
Which games are playable ?
Which ones lead only to tears ?
Compiling a comprehensive list of terrible board games would take at least three life times to complete .
Instead , I present you with the Final Four of horrible board games .
Each of these comes from the world of entertainment , but yet fail to entertain anyone who dares to play them .
1 ) KISS Dice Drinking Game
For the KISS fan who has everything , including irreversible liver damage .
While drinking games are numerous , few combine the fun of alcohol with the rock n’ roll attitude of a man in cat make - up .
The rules are simple : roll the dice and follow their instructions .
And there ’s the fatal flaw : outside of “ TAKE A DRINK ” and “ TAKE A SWIG ” the instructions are idiotic , if not down right dangerous .
Each die represents a member of the band and has its own instructions , like who drinks and how much .
At least one side of the Gene Simmons die dictates that no one drinks , effectively wasting five seconds that could have been spent drinking with a bit more dignity .
Peter Criss controls the speed of your inebriation but is also content with making you choke should you roll “ WHILE LYING ON THE FLOOR ” or “ WHILE HUMMING A KISS TUNE . ”
Ace Frehley ends the dirty charade by giving you an action based on KISS : will you play air guitar , drum the intro to Love Gun or even “ SHOUT IT OUT LOUD ? ”
Only the dice will tell .
When you ’re done making an ass out of yourself the next player rolls the dice and the fun ensues again , presumably until everyone passes out or grows into their White Snake and Poison phase .
Fact : if you ever feel like you need KISS to tell you where , how fast and to what guitar solo you should drink to , you ’re an alcoholic .
2 ) Full House Board Game
Anyone reading this should feel deeply ashamed for even thinking about Full House .
Through some tragic twist of fate Full House rose to the ranks of pop-culture icon rather than falling off the face of the earth , ultimately bringing us the Full House board game in 1992 .
We must all carry the blame for this .
As a cash grab , board games are a commonly used option .
As a board game , Full House is an abortion .
Players drive around their neighborhood trying to collect all the members of the Tanner family into one car before returning home for a heart warming moment or earnest life lesson .
This would be a perfectly sensible thing to do , ignoring that the person - to - seat belt ratio in that car is going to be , like , two - to - one .
To seal the escape from your own personal Hell , certain squares along the board force you to read a Joey Joke Card .
Armed with the handsome visage of Dave Coulier , these cards capture the essence of what is to be Uncle Joey by being physically painful to read in front of people you care about .
According to popular urban legend , reading a Joey Joke Card backwards summons the Elder God Nodens , so look out for that .
3 ) Vanilla Ice Electronic RAP Game
Someday mankind will be plunged into a global war .
Brother will battle brother as love and peace are cast aside for bloodshed and violence .
Then the bombs will drop and everyone , every single one of us , will be killed .
Then , beings from another galaxy will visit the ruins of the once majestic Earth , find a copy of Ice by Ice and assume that everyone spoke in rhyme and wore obnoxious pants and sunglasses .
Ice ’s career peaked with Ice Ice Baby and I ’m pretty sure his manager knew it .
What else could explain the existence of a Vanilla Ice board game ?
Much like M. C. Hammer , Ice made a terrifying leap into the world of electronic rap games .
Even more like Hammer , Ice ’s career has been flat - lining for the past sixteen or so years , perhaps explaining the lack of electronic rap games on your local K - Mart ’s shelf .
The game is played by players completing rhymes around the board .
After completing a set of rhymes , whoever played them must rap a set of lyrics based on them to the included beat - box microphone thing .
Assuming you make it this far , this game play continues until someone completes the last rhyme on the board and raps the whole damn thing .
If marketed towards adults this could have been an excellent drinking game , with each player downing a shot whenever they felt a creeping sense of regret .
You win if you ’re the last player to die of alcohol poisoning .
4 ) Dukes of Hazzard Board Game
People are drawn to racing by the obvious danger it poses to participants and audiences alike .
On a good day a race will end in a timely fashion .
On a bad day Jeff Gordon is reduced to a pile of ash and parts of his car have taken the lives of several spectators .
When you attend a NASCAR event you ’re taking your life into your hands .
Naturally , game designers have attempted to capture the speed and fiery crashed of racing and make it available in the safety of our homes .
I do n’t know who invented the concept of the racing board game but I can tell you that he or she should be punched right in the mouth .
Racing games play out the same way : you generate a number somehow and move that many spaces .
Then , like all good racers , you stop moving and allow your opponent to do the same .
This continues until one of the players realizes they ’re wasting their lives , choosing to spend their precious time in the world of the living pushing oddly - shaped pieces of plastic around a board while making engine noises .
No one wins .
The Dukes of Hazzard breaks this down even further by providing the player with two tracks , one labeled “ fast ” and the other “ slow . ”
The slower track supposedly provides less danger from road blocks , bear attacks and Boss Hogg , but this only further degenerates from the concept of reckless driving and law breaking that the series tried so hard to establish for years .
If it were n’t for the lovely portrait of Sorrell Booke gracing the box art , the only redeeming factor this game would have is that the box is n’t filled with venomous cobras .
The Pew Research Center has just published an interesting survey on naps and napping .
It found that 34 percent of American adults had taken a nap in the past 24 hours .
Men nap more than women , blacks more than whites and Hispanics , the unhappy more than the happy .
But we ca n’t help seeing a flaw in this survey , and we suspect , therefore , that it was n’t written by a napper .
For instance , instead of asking , “ Have you napped in the past 24 hours ? ”
Why not ask , “ Do you nap often or regularly ? ”
The Pew survey also examines the reasons Americans have trouble sleeping , as if trouble sleeping was the major precondition for a midday snooze .
Regular nappers know that a good night ’s sleep never precludes a good afternoon nap .
Something about the shape of this survey suggests  ever so slightly  that napping is aberrant behavior , a personal rebellion against workplace wakefulness .
But how would the number of adult American nappers change if American businesses encouraged napping ?
If businesses knew , as all good nappers know , that a short nap is the best way to recharge yourself during the day ?
We suspect the numbers would rise dramatically , proving that there is no hard and fast distinction between nappers and non-nappers , only a difference in opportunity .
After all , napping is an entirely normal part of normal human sleep patterns .
And studies have shown that short naps enhance alertness and productivity .
To their credit , the FOX network has been having one of their most successful fall seasons in its history .
One of the problem spots on their current schedule is Friday nights , which offers sitcoms Brothers and ‘ Til Death and Joss Whedon ’s Dollhouse .
Not surprisingly , the programmers have decided to pull the low - rated series from the schedule for November sweeps .
They ’re being replaced by repeats of House and Bones which , sad to say , will no doubt perform much better .
While one of the pulled series is n’t really leaving and the other is already slated to return in December , this certainly does n’t help their chances for the future .
Interrupting a regular schedule typically results in fewer people watching when a show returns from a hiatus .
In truth though , the shows ’ ratings have been killing them long before FOX made this schedule change .
Dollhouse , which stars Eliza Dushku , Harry Lennix , Fran Kranz , Tahmoh Penikett , Enver Gjokaj , Dichen Lachman , and Olivia Williams , is the most high - profile among the three .
Though the show ’s ratings did n’t really justify it , FOX renewed the series for a second season last spring .
The network seems to want to stay in business with Whedon and is doing what they can , within reason , to keep him happy .
Which has the best chances of surviving ?
Dollhouse ' Til Death Brothers View Results Loading ... Loading ...
Based on the ratings , Dollhouse would have been dumped long ago if it was most any other series .
Thankfully for the fans , FOX has committed to airing all of its episodes .
That does n’t mean however that they ’ll be ordering any more or renewing it for a third season .
Dollhouse will return in December when the network will run double episodes on December 4th , 11th and 18th .
People are n’t paying attention to television as much during the holidays and since Dollhouse ’s ratings are already low and heavy on DVR viewing anyway , the network does n’t have much to lose .
This will leave three original episodes and they ’re expected to begin running on January 8th , likely paired with repeats of another hour - long drama .
While there are some rumors that FOX may still order a few more episodes of Dollhouse , the show is likely finished .
Whedon has said that he plans to give closure by the end of the current run .
The outlook is even worse for Brothers , which stars Michael Strahan , Daryl “ Chill ” Mitchell , Carl Weathers , and CCH Pounder .
The sitcom has been performing terribly for the network and is unlikely to be seen in 2010 .
Brothers has been pulled from Fridays but will continue to run on Sunday nights at 7 pm .
The network added the Sunday airings earlier this month as a venue to try to pick up more viewers .
It has n’t happened .
FOX has n’t ordered any additional installments and is expected to burn through the present 13 episode order by the end of the year .
‘ Til Death , the sitcom that continues to survive in part because of a special syndication deal , stars Brad Garrett , Joely Fisher , Timm Sharp , and Lindsey Broad .
It ’s being pulled as well but there ’s no plan for it to return , save for a four episode mini-marathon on Christmas night .
Some episodes may fill time during the NFL games but they ’ll be repeats .
The network reportedly will have 15 original episodes of ‘ Til Death left after Christmas night .
They ’re likely to see the light of day at some point to fill in holes in the schedule .
Since the network typically gets much better ratings from repeats of its dramas , ‘ Til Death is hardly high on the priority list .
What do you think ?
Are Dollhouse and Brothers finished ?
Is ‘ Til Death better or worse than Brothers ?
He said the station 's public address system worked on radio waves and somebody must have been broadcasting on the same wavelength .
He said staff had turned off the loudspeakers as soon as they realised what was going on .
Transformers led to addiction to gasoline
By Chen Jia ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-07-21 07:52
A 14 - year - old boy trying to mimic the popular Transformers characters on TV has developed mental disorders and a dependence on gasoline after drinking the fuel over the past five years .
" He began to drink gasoline ever since he saw an episode of the Transformers cartoon series at a neighbor 's house five years ago , " Chen Dahai , the boy 's father , told China Daily yesterday .
" I really regret allowing him to watch it he used to be a smart and good - tempered boy , " said Chen , who lives in Yibin , Sichuan province .
The Transformers movies and cartoon series involve fictional alien characters that can morph from vehicles and weapons into fighting machines .
" Since my son started to drink gas , his IQ has dropped sharply and he cannot figure out simple math questions , " the father said .
" He was a very smart boy , and could even repair the TV .
Now he does n't know seven plus 17 . "
The boy began by stealing lighters from his mother 's grocery stall in 2004 .
The parents talked to their son and asked him not to do it again .
" But afterwards we found our motorcycle 's gasoline always disappearing , and one day when we found the boy drinking a half bottle of gasoline stolen from the motorcycle , we were too shocked to say anything , " the father said .
After they locked the motorcycle in the living room , the obsessed boy stole gasoline from neighbors .
" He has had an explosive temper and even quit school because he fought with classmates . "
The worried parents finally took their son to the city 's hospital , and were told the boy had mental disorders and a strong " gasoline dependence . "
" Gasoline contains a lot of lead , which can do harm to people 's brains and influence their IQ , " Peng Houquan , a doctor from Yibin No 4 Hosptial , told China Daily yesterday .
" We will invite some experienced experts to help the boy get rid of the gasoline addiction , and provide psychological treatment , " Peng said .
" It might be possible that the boy's ' gasoline dependence ' started from imitating a movie , " he said .
However , he could not explain why tests showed no lead in the boy 's blood and no damage to the boy 's throat or nose .
As of Saturday , the Hollywood blockbuster Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen had earned 400 million yuan ( $ 58 million ) in China , 19 days after its release on June 24 , breaking the record set by Titanic 10 years ago .

In his gloomiest prediction yet , Marc Faber sees big financial bust leading to war .
Marc Faber , the Swiss fund manager and Gloom Boom & Doom editor , said eventually there will be a big bust and then the whole credit expansion will come to an end .
Before that happens , governments will continue printing money which in time will lead to a very high inflation rate , and the economy will not respond to continued stimulus .
Speaking at a conference in Singapore on Wednesday , Faber said : " The crisis has not solved anything .
On the contrary there is less transparency today than there was before .
The government 's balance sheet is expanding , and the abuses that have led to the one cause of the crisis have continued " .
" I think eventually there will be a big bust and then the whole credit expansion will come to an end , " Faber added .
" Before that happens , governments will continue printing money which in time will lead to a very high inflation rate , and the economy will not respond to stimulus " .
In one of his Gloomiest predictions , Faber , referred to as Dr Doom , said " the average family will be hurt by that , and then in order to distract the attention of the people , the governments will go to war " .
" People ask me against whom ?
Well , they will invent an enemy , " Faber said .
" At some stage , somewhere in future , we will have a war - that you have to be prepared for .
And during war times , commodities go up strongly , ” said Faber .
" If you want to hedge against war , you do n't want to own derivatives in UBS and AIG , but you have to own them physically , like farmland and agricultural commodities .
That is something to consider for you as a personal safety and hedge .
You have to own some commodities , " he added .

That final wave of consumer recklessness created the exact conditions required for its own destruction .
The housing bubble orgy was the last hurrah .
It is not coming back and there will be no bigger bubble to replace it .
Consumers and banks have both been burnt , and attitudes have changed .

SOMERVILLE -- A Somerset County man who insists he was growing marijuana to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis rejected the state Attorney General ’s final plea offer today .
Franklin Township resident John Ray Wilson , 37 , who is accused of first - degree maintaining or operating a drug- production facility for the 17 plants police found in August 2008 , appeared before Superior Court Judge Robert Reed and said he understands that he could face a stiffer sentence .
Wilson also is charged with second - degree manufacturing and third - degree drug possession .
The state offered him nine years in prison , with three years and three months mandatory .
He faces up to 35 years , if convicted and sentenced consecutively .
Defense lawyer James Wronko and Deputy Attorney General Daniel Bornstein agreed on a trial date , with jury selection slated to begin Dec. 14 .
Deputy Attorney General Russell Curley will represent the state .
Wilson ’s case has drawn national attention amid the ongoing debate surrounding the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act , which would give patients of debilitating diseases structured access to the drug .
Bing 's instant answers — in which the search engine tries to answer your question right on the search results page — include basic calculations , flight information , local weather , sports scores , ski conditions , translations , and so on .
Now the search engine is adding results that come from Wolfram| Alpha , a service started in May 2009 by noted scientist Stephen Wolfram , that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data .
Not everyone will see the changes just yet .
Instead of trying to mimic what Wolfram| Alpha can do , Microsoft has simply partnered with the website to use tens of thousands of algorithms and trillions of pieces of " expertly curated " data from Wolfram| Alpha within Bing .
Specifically , Bing will show nutrition , health , and advanced mathematics information from Wolfram|Alpha .
When you search for a specific food item on Bing , you 'll get a nutrition quick tab that allows you to learn more about it , plus a nutrition facts label at the bottom of the results page that summarizes all information on that food item .
There 's also a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) tool : enter your height and weight , click Calculate and you 'll get Wolfram| Alpha 's detailed BMI analysis right on Bing 's results page .
In May 2009 , we did a hands - on with Wolfram| Alpha , and we called it a small step from being a glorified graphing calculator .
It might have more use for those who are already using Bing as their default search engine though , as they wo n't have to navigate to a separate website ; we 'll probably use it sporadically .
This is n't a revolutionary addition , but it 's still a welcome evolutionary one and shows how much Microsoft is making an effort to differentiate Bing from Google .
More updates to Bing
Last night , Microsoft updated Bing Videos and folded MSN Videos into the new webpage , where users can find TV shows ( over 900 , Microsoft says ) , videos , and content from top sites such as Hulu , MSN , ABC , and YouTube .
The experience is supposed to be faster than the previous ones , reorganizes the content so that you can browse for the videos you want to see with less clicks , makes sharing easier , and now includes a " dim the lights " optional feature that emphasizes the current video by dimming everything else .
There 's more coming though .
In addition to Bing Travel , which lets you plan and book trips , hundreds of cities will now include enhanced results that include information on local attractions , points of interest , neighborhoods , high - resolution slide shows , and other local data sources like newspaper websites .
The preview feature , which appears if you mouseover your cursor to the right side of search results , will start to include more images and will change from an orange dot to a blue plus sign .
Microsoft also says it will do a better job mining data like contact phone numbers and e-mail addresses from webpages and displaying them clearly under a Contact banner .
There 's also a new event search feature on the way , which provides a quick summary of events for major cities , and can be filtered by categories like performances , civic activities , music , and so on .
To add to that , Bing will also make it easy to see prices from popular ticket vendors across the Web for some of these events and even give you related venue information right in the search results page .
Remember all the hubbub over Bing & Ping ?
The search sharing feature , which lets you share your search results over Facebook , Twitter , or e-mail in two clicks , will be integrated over the coming days as well .
Microsoft says it has also introduced better results for health conditions , medications , and hospitals : each gives you more information and a more organized set of results to make it easy to get your health - related questions answered .
Finally , Bing will also give more detailed information on the weather and has improved Bing Maps .
New features include draggable routes , a zoom bar , command parsing ( to find driving directions , traffic info and so on ) , the ability to embed a map in your site , dynamic compute ( Bing Maps now runs in data centers in seven locations around the world and the closest one to you will be chosen ) , new navigation links ( Welcome , Car , Star , Envelop , Printer , and Traffic light ) , world wrap ( Bing Maps will no longer stop at the international date line ) , and a smaller homepage size ( from 678 kb to 484 kb ) .
In their latest poster campaign , Ariane Sherine and members of the British Humanist Association appear to have decided that it is a Very Bad Thing that parents might try and bring up their children within a religious or philosophical framework of their choosing .
They suggest it is wholly unacceptable that anyone might suggest that their own child might belong to a particular religion .
While I know I risk offending the loyal and noble readers of Cif here , I genuinely can't believe that people actually donated good money to spend on billboard advertising that proposes such a misguided and patronising argument .
It is telling that Sherine resorts to quoting Richard Dawkins when she needs to find someone to explain the rationale for the campaign : " Children are routinely labelled with the religion of their parents " , Dawkins suggests .
By who , exactly ?
And if the answer is by their parents , who are the BHA to tell them to stop ?
It is surely central to the role of a parent , whether committed to a religious faith or not , to want to pass on to their child the things they value most , the beliefs and world view that shape how they live .
It is also consistent with that role to want to have those beliefs and world view acknowledged and affirmed as part of their children 's education .
That is why we have a diverse range of schools within the state sector , from which parents can choose .
And they choose Church of England schools in their tens of thousands because we offer a balanced education within a Christian framework .
We aim to develop in children the ability to make informed choices in life .
We aim to give them a good understanding of Christianity , and other faiths too .
We aim to make them good citizens , hospitable and respectful towards people of all faiths and none .
And , yes , we do hope that they might decide – when the time is right – that Christianity is a faith worth exploring more deeply .
Last year , a poll commissioned by the church suggested that the majority of people agree that parents should be able to choose a state - run school for their child based on their own religious , moral or philosophical considerations .
Two - thirds of parents held this opinion , consistent with the spirit of plurality in education which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights .
Earlier this year , the Guardian commissioned a similar poll , which showed that " 60 % thought children benefited from a faith - based education , while 69 % of those with school - age children supported a religious ethos at school " .
In light of public support for faith - based education , the non-issue of " labelling children " could just be a smokescreen .
But it 's a shame that charitable donations are being used in such a wasteful way .

Battery fires in personal electronic devices can be scary .
But if a battery ignites on a plane , the risks are much greater .
With more people traveling with an assortment of portable electronics  sometimes a plane has more devices than passengers  fires are occurring on airliners with increasing frequency .
More than half of the 22 battery fires in the cabin of passenger planes since 1999 have been in the last three years .
One air safety expert suggested that these devices might be “ the last unrestricted fire hazard ” people can bring on airplanes .
This month , the Federal Aviation Administration along with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued special advisories to airlines about yet another gadget : the credit card readers that many have begun to issue to flight attendants to ring up sales of food , drinks and other amenities .
While airlines have used portable credit card readers for several years , the F.A.A. said earlier this month that they needed approval from the agency ’s hazardous materials division .
Like the majority of hand - held consumer electronic devices , the readers are powered by rechargeable lithium batteries , which the government considers hazardous .

Want to speed up your natural language processing with NLTK ?
Have a lot of files to process , but do n’t know how to distribute NLTK across many cores ?
Well , here ’s how you can use execnet to do distributed part of speech tagging with NLTK .
execnet
execnet is a simple library for creating a network of gateways and channels that you can use for distributed computation in python .
With it , you can start python shells over ssh , send code and / or data , then receive results .
Below are 2 scripts that will test the accuracy of NLTK ’s recommended part of speech tagger against every file in the brown corpus .
The first script ( the runner ) does all the setup and receives the results , while the second script ( the remote module ) runs on every gateway , calculating and sending the accuracy of each file it receives for processing .
Runner
The runner does the following :
Defines the hosts and number of gateways .
I recommend 1 gateway per core per host .
Loads and pickles the default NLTK part of speech tagger .
Opens each gateway and creates a remote execution channel with the tag_files module ( the remote module covered below ) .
Sends the pickled tagger and the name of a corpus ( brown ) thru the channel .
Once all the channels have been created and initialized , it then sends all of the fileids in the corpus to alternating channels to distribute the work .
Finally , it creates a receive queue and prints the accuracy response from each channel .
run_tag_files.py
import execnet import nltk.tag , nltk.data import cPickle as pickle import tag_files HOSTS = { ' localhost ' : 2 } NICE = 20 channels = [ ] tagger = pickle.dumps(nltk.data.load(nltk.tag._POS_TAGGER ) ) for host , count in HOSTS.items ( ) : print ' opening %d gateways at %s ' % ( count , host ) for i in range ( count ) : gw = execnet.makegateway ( 'ssh=%s//nice=%d ' % ( host , NICE ) ) channel = gw.remote_exec(tag_files ) channels.append( channel ) channel.send( tagger ) channel.send ( ' brown ' ) count = 0 chan = 0 for fileid in nltk.corpus.brown.fileids ( ) : print ' sending %s to channel % d ' % ( fileid , chan ) channels [ chan ].send ( fileid ) count += 1 # alternate channels chan += 1 if chan >= len( channels ) : chan = 0 multi = execnet.
MultiChannel ( channels ) queue = multi.make_receive_queue( ) for i in range ( count ) : channel , response = queue.get ( ) print response
Remote Module
The remote module is much simpler .
Receives and unpickles the tagger .
Receives the corpus name and loads it .
For each fileid received , evaluates the accuracy of the tagger on the tagged sentences and sends an accuracy response .
tag_files.py
import nltk.corpus import cPickle as pickle if __name__ == ' __channelexec__ ' : tagger = pickle.loads(channel.receive ( ) ) corpus_name = channel.receive ( ) corpus = getattr ( nltk.corpus , corpus_name ) for fileid in channel : accuracy = tagger.evaluate( corpus.tagged_sents(fileids=[ fileid ] ) ) channel.send ( ' %s : %f ' % ( fileid , accuracy ) )
Putting it all together
Make sure you have NLTK and the corpus data installed on every host .
You must also have passwordless ssh access to each host from the master host ( the machine you run run_tag_files . py on ) .
run_tag_files.py and tag_files .py only need to be on the master host ; execnet will take care of distributing the code .
Assuming run_tag_files.py and tag_files.py are in the same directory , all you need to do is run python run_tag_files .py .
You should get a message about opening gateways followed by a bunch of send messages .
Then , just wait and watch the accuracy responses to see how accurate the built in part of speech tagger is on the brown corpus .
If you ’d like test the accuracy of a different corpus , make sure every host has the corpus data , then send that corpus name instead of brown , and send the fileids from the new corpus .
If you want to test your own tagger , pickle it to a file , then load and send it instead of NLTK ’s tagger .
Or you can train it on the master first , then send it once training is complete .
Distributed File Processing
In practice , it ’s often a PITA to make sure every host has every file you want to process , and you ’ll want to process files outside of NLTK ’s builtin corpora .
My recommendation is to setup a GlusterFS storage cluster so that every host has a common mount point with access to every file that you want to process .
If every host has the same mount point , you can send any file path to any channel for processing .
On the face of it , there 's nothing remarkable about one conservative talk show host ( Chris Wallace ) inviting another conservative talk show host ( Rush Limbaugh ) to appear on his show for an interview .
But in the context of Fox 's continuing claims that they are in fact a news outlet and that Chris Wallace is in fact their top newsman , it 's a pretty damn funny site to behold -- especially given the fact that all Wallace did was lob softball after softball up for Limbaugh to whack out of the park .
Here 's a sampling of the questions , but not Limbaugh 's gasbag answers .
As you 'll see , almost all the questions were designed to provoke criticism of President Obama ( who Wallace calls Mr. Obama ) or the Democratic Party .
Among the few on other topics : a few questions about FNC's Glenn Beck .
In short : ObamaSux , DemsSux , BeckRules .
Watch :
A few more probing questions like these and Wallace will get himself nominated for this year 's Judith Miller awards for journalistic integrity .
Indeed , he might just win -- Miller herself is now a Fox correspondent , underscoring these two words : not news .
As the BBC tries to draw a line under the Strictly Come Dancing racism row , Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has added his thoughts on the television industry 's diversity policies .
In a column for the new issue of Top Gear magazine , the BBC presenter ridicules TV bosses for being obsessed with having " black Muslim lesbians " on shows to balance out the numbers of white heterosexual men .
In response to questions about the lack of female presenters on BBC's Top Gear , Clarkson said : " The problem is that television executives have got it into their heads that if one presenter on a show is a blond - haired , blue - eyed heterosexual boy , the other must be a black Muslim lesbian .
" Chalk and cheese , they reckon , works .
But here we have Top Gear setting new records after six years using cheese and cheese .
It confuses them . "
The comments come just days after it emerged that dancer Anton Du Beke had referred off - screen to his dance partner Laila Rouass as a " Paki " .
Du Beke apologised and the BBC tried to draw a line under the incident .
But the show 's presenter Bruce Forsyth said yesterday the nation should get a " sense of humour " over Du Beke 's " slip up " .
Forsyth was later forced to clarify his views in a statement issued through the BBC , in which he said that " racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable " .
In his column Clarkson went on to defend women drivers and ask why there are not more of them in Formula One .
He said : " Unlike furious thin - lipped feminists , I tend not to draw distinctions between men and women , apart from in bed where you really do need to spot the differences .
" At work , girls are just people .
It 's the same story at parties and it's especially the same on the road .
The worst driver in the world is Top Gear 's studio director ...
He cannot park without kerbing the wheels and he cannot get into his own drive without crashing into his house .
And he has a scrotum . "

US military boffinry chiefs have stated that they will shortly issue a brace of contracts for " refrigerator sized " laser blaster cannons .
One of the deals will see a full - power ground prototype built which will be the final stage prior to America 's first raygun - equipped jet fighter .
The news comes in a pair of notices issued by renowned Pentagon propellerhead bureau DARPA , under the agency 's High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defence System ( HELLADS ) programme .
The notices , required by federal acquisition rules , reveal DARPA 's intention to award two sole - source contracts to Textron Defence Systems and famous tech firm General Atomics .
The idea of HELLADS is to make a battle - strength 150 kilowatt laser light enough to be carried in a " tactical " aircraft , ie a fighter or similar rather than a massive lumbering transport plane .
Current combat rayguns require at the very least a Hercules hauler to lift them , or even a jumbo jet in the case of the biggest .
Such monster systems are of questionable usefulness in normal warfare - they are only seen as having a niche in unusual tasks such as shooting down nuclear missiles or unattributably burning holes in truck bonnets .
But a smaller HELL - beam mounted on a fighter that one could send out above the battlefield could be a lot handier .
At height , allowing the line - of - sight laser beams to dominate a broad horizon , it could sweep the skies of such things as artillery or mortar shells , bombardment rockets etc - hence the " area defence " bit .
If any pitiful fool tried to tackle the HELL - fighter with outmoded trash such as anti-aircraft missiles , these too would be beamed out of existence .
According to DARPA , the maximum feasible size for a tactical jet HELL - ray is " refrigerator sized " , and the maximum weight is 750kg .
The two DARPA deals foreshadowed today will see the HELLADS Demonstrator Laser Weapon System ( DLWS ) assembled .
According to DARPA this is the penultimate stage , a ground unit intended to prove that a fighter blaster - cannon pod can indeed be built :
This unit cell demonstration will validate the ability to produce output power and beam quality required to meet the full scale 150 kW performance within the weight and volume goals through integration of replicated unit cells .
Quite apart from the raygun fighter plan , one should note that the competing HELL - beams offered by GA and Textron are to be assembled from many lesser laser " cells " .
Overall the technology is intended to produce blaster weaponry of " < 5 kg / kW " weight - to - power ratio , scalable up and down in size .
If it scales down far enough , this would seem to put handheld HELL - guns within an order of magnitude of the striking power offered by conventional small - arms .
A 9 mm pistol bullet has about 750 joules muzzle energy : a 5kg portable HELL - ray weapon would put out this much energy in a blast less than a second long .
HELL - beam carbines and possible battlefield - dominating raygun fighters are all very well , of course , but by now our apparently large readership of evil billionaires will be impatiently skipping ahead to find out the consequences in terms of home / lair defence applications .
Specifically , defence against tiresome government agents and / or their scantily - clad feminine assistants , black - clad SWAT - commando frogman allies etc , implemented by execution - pool sharks employing head - mounted energy weapons .
Well , a dolphin can carry a human being weighing up to 100 kg along for a ride .
A thoroughbred shark in good training can surely match this .
Thus , we seem to be looking at practicable head - lazor output in the 20 - kilowatt range , roughly equating to a submachinegun with a cyclic rate well over 1500 rounds per minute .
This is more than double that offered by the Heckler & Koch MP5 favoured by government SWAT operatives worldwide .
Advantage : laser shark . ®

Security updates released
Today the Django project is issuing a set of releases to remedy a security issue .
This issue was disclosed publicly by a third party on a high - traffic mailing list , and attempts have been made to exploit it against live Django installations ; as such , we are bypassing our normal policy for security disclosure and immediately issuing patches and updated releases .
Description of vulnerability
Django's forms library includes field types which perform regular - expression - based validation of email addresses and URLs .
Certain addresses / URLs could trigger a pathological performance case in these regular expression , resulting in the server process / thread becoming unresponsive , and consuming excessive CPU over an extended period of time .
If deliberately triggered , this could result in an effective denial - of - service attack .
Affected versions
Any Django application making use of EmailField or URLField in the following versions is vulnerable :
Django development trunk
Django 1.1
Django 1.0
Resolution
The regular expressions used for email address and URL validation have been modified to eliminate the pathological performance case .
Patches were applied in the following changesets :
Django development trunk : 11603 .
Django 1.1 release series : 11604 .
Django 1.0 release series : 11605 .
The following releases are being issued immediately :
Django 1.1.1 ( download | checksums )
Django 1.0.4 ( download | checksums )
These releases are available on our download page and on PyPI .
As this issue is being actively exploited in the wild , all users of affected versions of Django are strongly encouraged to upgrade or apply the appropriate patch immediately .
Note regarding security reporting
As mentioned above , this issue was initially disclosed publicly on a high - traffic mailing list .
We 'd like to remind our users that the correct channel for security reports is to send them to security@djangoproject.com .
This allows the development team time to develop a solution and coordinate disclosure , both to the Django community as a whole and to the numerous third parties who maintain and distribute packaged versions of Django .
Micro-Build Systems and the Death of a Prominent DSL
Normally I do n't think about how to rebuild an Erlang project .
I just compile a file after editing it -- via the c( Filename ) shell command -- and that 's that .
With hot code loading there no need for a linking step .
Occasionally , such as after upgrading to a new Erlang version , I do this :
erlc *.erl
which compiles all the .erl files in the current directory .
But wait a minute .
What about checking if the corresponding . beam file has a more recent date than the source and skipping the compilation step for that file ?
Surely that 's gong to be a performance win ?
Here 's the result of fully compiling a mid-sized project consisting of fifteen files :
$ time erlc *.erl real 0m1.912s user 0m0.945s sys 0m0.108s
That 's less than two seconds to rebuild everything .
( Immediately rebuilding again takes less than one second , showing that disk I / O is a major factor . )
Performance is clearly not an issue .
Not yet anyway .
Mid -sized projects have a way of growing into large - sized projects , and those 15 files could one day be 50 .
Hmmm ... linearly interpolating based on the current project size still gives a time of under six - and - a half - seconds , so no need to panic .
But projects get more complex in other ways : custom tools written in different languages , dynamically loaded drivers , data files that need to be preprocessed , Erlang modules generated from data , source code in multiple directories .
A good start is to move the basic compilation step into pure Erlang :
erlang_files ( ) -> [ " util.erl " , " http.erl " , " sandwich.erl " , " optimizer.erl " ]. build ( ) -> c:lc(erlang_files ( ) ) .
where c:lc( ) is the Erlang shell function for compiling a list of files .
If you stop and think , this first step is actually a huge step .
We 've now got a symbolic representation of the project in a form that can be manipulated by Erlang code .
erlang_files ( ) could be replaced by searching through the current directory for all files with an .erl extension .
We could even do things like skip all files with _old preceding the extension , such as util_old.erl .
And all of this is trivially , almost mindlessly , easy .
There 's a handful of things that traditional build systems do .
They call shell commands .
They manipulate filenames .
They compare dates .
The fancy ones go through source files and look for included files .
These things are a small subset of what you can do in Perl , Ruby , Python , or Erlang .
So why not do them in Perl , Ruby , Python , or Erlang ?
I 'm pretty sure there 's a standard old build system to do this kind of thing , but in a clunky way where you have to be careful whether you use spaces or tabs , remember arcane bits of syntax , remember what rules and macros are built - in , remember tricks involved in building nested projects , remember the differences between the versions that have gone down their own evolutionary paths .
I use it rarely enough that I forget all of these details .
There are modern variants , too , that trade all of that 1970s - era fiddling for different lists of things to remember .
But there 's no need .
It 's easier and faster to put together custom , micro - build systems in the high - level language of your choice .

There they go again .
Now that the “ death panel ” lie has snookered nearly half the country , the Washington Times is going for the other half in an editorial headlined “ Death Panels By Proxy . ”
Cue the scary music for this one :
The offending provision is on Pages 80 - 81 of the unamended Baucus bill , hidden amid a lot of similar legislative mumbo- jumbo about Medicare payments to doctors .
The key sentence : “ Beginning in 2015 , payment would be reduced by five percent if an aggregation of the physician ’s resource use is at or above the 90th percentile of national utilization . ”
Translated into plain English , it means that in any year in which a particular doctor ’s average per-patient Medicare costs are in the top 10 percent in the nation , the feds will cut the doctor ’s payments by 5 percent .
Forget results .
This provision makes no account for the results of care , its quality or even its efficiency .
It just says that if a doctor authorizes expensive care , no matter how successfully , the government will punish him by scrimping on what already is a low reimbursement rate for treating Medicare patients .
The incentive , therefore , is for the doctor always to provide less care for his patients for fear of having his payments docked .
And because no doctor will know who falls in the top 10 percent until year ’s end , or what total average costs will break the 10 percent threshold , the pressure will be intense to withhold care , and withhold care again , and then withhold it some more .
Or at least to prescribe cheaper care , no matter how much less effective , in order to avoid the penalties .
My question : Has anyone at the Washington Times actually talked to a doctor lately ?
Under the current system , lots and lots of people are showing up at physicians ’ offices with no insurance at all .
And do you know what these medical heroes are doing ?
By and large , they are treating them anyway .
Doctors I have spoken to tell me that it is not at all unusual for them to be writing off 10 % , or 20 % or even more of the care they give , because their patients simply can’t afford to pay their bills .
So now , the Washington Times would like us to believe that these very same doctors will suddenly start cutting their patients off , sending them out to die , simply to earn a little more money .
Yes , this provision is designed to encourage doctors to think a little more about what kind of treatment is most effective , and to cut back on the waste and overtreatment that experts say account for 30 cents out of every dollar that is spent on medical care in this country .
But to call these “ death panels by proxy ” is simply fear - mongering .
What ’s more , the Times is wrong when it suggests the Finance Committee bill puts no focus on quality .
In fact , it gives doctors incentives they do n’t have now , especially in the management of the chronic illnesses that have been such a factor in driving up health costs .
This from former Clinton Administration health adviser Chris Jennings ( via Ezra Klein ) :
… I choose to focus on a couple of other diamonds in the rough .
The first would be the funding for prioritization and development of quality measures linked to aggressive reimbursement incentives to physicians for reporting on these measures .
( These measures , developed by health professionals , are used to promote best practices for some of the most expensive chronic diseases , such as heart disease , cancer and diabetes ) .
I have concluded that we will never really change the way we deliver health care without the buy - in of the medical profession , which can only be secured if they develop and apply measures that can be used to empower practitioners and hold them accountable through comparative outcomes with / by their peers .
A second , and related issue , is a Finance Committee provision which gives CMS the authority to develop pilot programs to test methods of reimbursing providers for chronic disease management , ( including collaborations with the states and the dual eligible program ) .
Today , the easiest course of medical intervention is to prescribe treatment plans that deal with the effects of the disease , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , etc. , rather than spending time with patients to help motivate them to take control of their health and manage their own diseases through lifestyle changes .
Only when patients begin to understand that they must be the focal point of any intervention to constrain or even reverse the course of expensive chronic illness and , ultimately , produce savings , will we have made progress .
The most creative part of this policy is to allow the pilots to be constructed in a fashion that waive strict budget neutrality requirements ( because this has killed ideas in the past ) AND allows them to expand nationally automatically ( without any other legislative action ) IF they can prove budget neutrality or better in the budget window .
We all know that chronic illness is the primary contributor to our nation ’s health - care tab – preventing and managing it is one of the absolute keys in getting the ultimate job done .
Okay , not as sexy as “ death panels by proxy . ”
But it does have the virtue of actually being true .
MONDAY UPDATE :
In this morning ’s Washington Post , Lori Montgomery has an interesting story on the Medicare debate , which includes this bit of historic background :
" Excess of liberty , whether it lies in state or individuals , seems only to pass into excess of slavery .
Plato
" Ignorance , the root and stem of all evil .
" In times like these , political correctness often amounts to treason
Paul says reports of 1,000 U.S. deaths from the H1N1 may be true but ....
Just another government grab for more federal power , as he puts it in a video ( see it just below here ) , newly posted for supporters by his Campaign for Liberty .
Paul calls this year 's vaccine distribution " a total failure " because some 120 million doses were to have been available by mid-October and only about 10 % of that were .
A medical doctor himself , Paul , who at 74 is older even than John McCain , sees the Obama administration 's oft - delayed H1N1 swine flu immunization plan as typical of many government - run programs -- poorly planned , overloaded , inefficient , too expensive , late and quite possibly not even necessary .
Rep. Ron Paul , the 11 - term Republican congressman from Texas who mobilized millions of supporters and about $ 35 million for his unsuccessful presidential run last year , has added the federal government 's faltering flu immunization program to his list of things worthy of denunciation .
... come from the same federal government running the vaccine program and remain unverified .
And anyway , the doctor asks , is that really such a " catastrophe " worthy of declaring a national emergency as President Obama did last weekend ?
The onetime Libertarian says that last winter , 13,000 Americans died from the regular flu , which he says few people mention while approving of a vast new wasteful federal H1N1 program that then fails .
As The Ticket reported here recently , a new poll indicated that 62 % of adult Americans say they have no intention of getting the new vaccine anyway .
Paul says he also believes there is ....
... much to be concerned over natural immune systems " being knocked down " by immunization .
And he has criticized some previous immunization programs for actually endangering those receiving the vaccine .
He does admit , however , that the polio vaccine wiped out that dreaded disease during his lifetime .
Unlike most presidential candidates , Paul 's 2008 campaign not only ran no deficit , it ended up with about a $ 5 - million surplus , which Paul is using to organize and support like - minded libertarian - style candidates around the country and making some bids to seize control of local Republican operations .
As The Ticket reported here the other day , Paul is gearing up for a speaking campaign in coming days , including South Carolina and Iowa ( yes , that Iowa , where Mike Huckabee surprised Mitt Romney in the GOP 2008 caucus . )
And all this has added up to speculation that Paul is planning another hopeless presidential run in 2012 , when he would be 77 , still older than John McCain .
In a new opinion column published by CNN , Paul warns that the expansionist policies of the Federal Reserve , a frequent , favorite target of his , is endangering the entire fiscal position of the United States .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has embarked on an ambitious program of monetary expansion , more than doubling the monetary base to almost $ 1.9 trillion and doubling the size of its balance sheet to over $ 2 trillion , placing the American economy in a precarious position .
If all this excess money begins to be loaned out , the Fed risks creating a hyper - inflationary crisis similar to 1920s Germany .
Warning of " a complete collapse of the dollar , " Paul also calls for " a strict audit " of the Fed and all of its actions , if not outright abolition of the institution , which Paul considers way too powerful , corrupt and unconstitutional .
In fact , not coincidentally , Paul has a new book just out titled " End the Fed , " which makes just that argument .
The book costs $ 21.99 ( or $ 26.99 if you 're a Democrat -- or Canadian ) .

Zimbabwe : A Fresh Start By Alf Field
Nov 11 2009 9:30 AM www.kitco.com
In February 2009 Zimbabwe was the only country in the world without debt .
Nobody owed anyone anything .
Following the abandonment of the Zimbabwe Dollar as the local currency all local debt was wiped out and the country started with a clean slate .
It is now a country without a functioning Central Bank and without a local currency that can be produced at will at the behest of politicians .
Since February 2009 there has been no lender of last resort in Zimbabwe , causing banks to be ultra cautious in their lending policies .
The US Dollar is the de facto currency in use although the Euro , GB Pound and South African Rand are accepted in local transactions .
Price controls and foreign exchange regulations have been abandoned .
Zimbabwe literally joined the real world at the stroke of a pen .
Money now flows in and out of the country without restriction .
Super market shelves , bare in January , are now bursting with products .
I recently visited Zimbabwe in the company of a leading Australian fund manager .
As a student of monetary history , I was interested to see what had happened to a country that had suffered hyperinflation .
How did the people cope ?
How is the country progressing now ?
The current Zimbabwean situation is complicated by the fact that President Robert Mugabe is determined to stay in power whatever the cost .
The first part of this article deals with economics , the hyperinflation and current situation , which is a picture of recovery and potential vigorous growth .
The second part deals with politics , both the historical aspects as well as current developments , which are extremely fluid .
We were fortunate to have private interviews with the Prime Minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , and a wide range of business leaders .
This provided a quick picture of Zimbabwe past and present .
There are common denominators in all hyperinflations .
Generally government finances reach a point where large budget deficits cannot be financed by taxes or borrowings .
The choices come down to austerity ( with the government cutting back its spending ) or by funding the deficit by creating local currency through the printing press , leading to the inflation tax .
This is always a political decision , but the line of least resistance is the printing press .
Cutting government expenditures and laying off bureaucratic staff is anathema to most politicians .
In Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe has made it his mission to remain President for life .
This has caused him to infiltrate his supporters into the army and police force .
He also used Government finances as a way of funding patronage .
His use of the printing press was liberal and nobody was prepared to stand up against him .
This eventually led to inflation gathering momentum to the point where the armed forces were getting rebellious – they wanted more money .
When Mugabe caved in to these demands , the Zimbabwe Dollar plunged .
Shortly after Mugabe was elected President in 1980 , the Zimbabwe Dollar was worth more than the US Dollar .
The ongoing abuse of the financial system eventually produced a runaway inflation .
The largest bank note issued in Zimbabwe was for One Hundred Trillion Dollars and is pictured below .
These notes are now collector ’s items and I had to part with US $ 2 to a street vendor to acquire the note depicted below .
The worst trauma for ordinary people during the hyperinflation was lack of food .
This was due mainly to the imposition of price controls .
If the cost of production of an item was $ 10 and the price controllers instructed that the item could only be sold for $ 5 , the business would soon go bankrupt if they sold at the controlled price .
The result was that production and imports just dried up , hence the empty shelves in the supermarkets .
People survived by shopping in neighboring countries and relied on assistance from South Africa and the aid agencies .
Companies survived the hyperinflation with great difficulty and often by ignoring laws .
Although companies were left without debt post February 2009 , they were also left deficient in working capital and had dilapidated plant and equipment .
Regular repairs and maintenance could not be afforded .
Most companies now require urgent recapitalization .
There has been a major exodus of Zimbabweans over the years , estimated at about 3 million prior to 2008 .
Many of these were qualified people who were subjected to Mugabe ’s campaign of terror .
During the latter stages of the hyperinflation there was a further exodus because people were starving .
Most of these people went south into South Africa .
The current population of Zimbabwe is estimated to be between 10 and 12 million people , so the numbers that have fled the country are significant relative to the total population .
Current economic activity is strongly supported by remittances from Zimbabwean migrants to their families in Zimbabwe .
Once the political situation settles down , it is likely that many of these migrants will wish to return to Zimbabwe .
Some have already done so .
Many activities that perished in the hyperinflation , such as insurance , are now starting to resuscitate .
Credit financing activities are starting to revive .
Visa credit cards are once again operating successfully in Zimbabwe , others will surely follow .
Banks have had both sides of their balance sheets devastated by hyperinflation and now have no lender of last resort to call on .
They are understandably cautious in lending the deposits that are slowly filtering back into the system .
Banks also lost much of their equity capital .
Barclays
Bank survived because it had 40 branches where the bank owned the real estate and had a strong parent .
These properties plus some foreign currency holdings represent the equity capital on which the bank currently operates .
In a country with no debt , only assets , people and companies are under geared .
With the ultra cautious lending policies of the banks , there is a huge opportunity for foreign investors in the credit purveying industry .
There has been a sharp rise in economic activity since February .
Real wages have risen substantially compared to a year ago .
Whatever workers were paid in Zimbabwe Dollars during the hyperinflation bought virtually nothing .
Now even the minimum wage of around $ 100 per month allows for basic purchases .
A 10kg bag of maize meal , a staple in the local diet , costs $ 3.50 and lasts for two weeks .
Demand for products and services is increasing rapidly .
Corporate profits are rising , leading to greater tax revenues for the Government , augmented by rising VAT taxes .
Greater Government revenue allows for greater Government spending .
This self - reinforcing loop will continue .
The improvement in the economy will become dramatic once Mugabe leaves the scene .
At that time aid agencies , NGO ’s , Charities and foreign governments will start injecting large volumes of funds and assistance into the country .
They refuse to commit any meaningful funds while Mugabe is still the President .
With Mugabe out of the way and the economy recovering strongly , one could reasonably anticipate that a large proportion of the Zimbabweans living overseas will return to the country bringing welcome skills and capital .
Indeed foreigners will also be attracted to investing in the country in those circumstances .
It is fascinating to see how rapidly the economy is recovering .
It is a great testament to what can be achieved in a free enterprise environment by the elimination of controls combined with the institution of new money that people trust .
It needs to be money that their Government cannot create via the printing ( or electronic ) press .
The economic future of Zimbabwe is likely to be in mining , agriculture , tourism and service industries , especially those providing infrastructure and maintenance facilities .
There remain many problems , not the least being chronic unemployment , but the future looks bright beyond the Mugabe horizon .
The population is amongst the best educated in Africa and most people can speak English .
With the Zimbabwe ’s natural assets , there is scope for realistic optimism about the economic future , especially once the current political difficulties are overcome .
The population has been brutally traumatized by the hyperinflation and the political situation .
They really deserve a decent change of fortune .
THE POLITICAL SITUATION
To understand what has happened and is happening in Zimbabwe , it is necessary to look at some history .
Modern Zimbabwean history began in 1890 with the arrival of the Pioneer Column of white settlers under Leander Starr Jameson at the behest of Cecil Rhodes .
Initially they were searching for gold but when nothing of importance was found , they turned to pegging land for farms .
The initial settlers were fortune hunters , grabbing land at every opportunity .
Prior to the arrival of the white settlers , the Shona tribe occupied the northern part of the country called Mashonaland , and the Ndebele tribe were ensconced in the south , called Matabeleland .
In 1896 these tribes rebelled against white rule in one of the most violent episodes of resistance in the colonial era .
In Matabeleland a somewhat dubious settlement was negotiated but in Mashonaland the Shona chiefs were hunted down until all resistance ceased .
No Peace Treaty was ever signed with the Shona tribe .
The Shona , in particular , have never forgotten this .
Mugabe , who is from the Shona tribe , has made it his life ’s work to recover for his people the land that was “ stolen� ? by the whites .
He has repeated this statement on many occasions .
A book by Martin Meredith titled “ MUGABE : Power , Plunder and the Struggle for Zimbabwe� ?
published by Jonathan Ball , gives a very readable account of the recent history of Zimbabwe up to 2006 , prior to the worst of the hyperinflation .
It is required reading for anyone wishing to gain a balanced understanding of what has happened in that country with an emphasis on the period since Independence was granted in 1980 .
Returning to the white settlers , there was always an unfair division of land between whites and blacks .
This was accentuated after the Second World War when Rhodesia benefited from an influx of white immigrants .
Farming boomed as a result of better equipment , better farming methods and better seeds .
The number of white farmers increased from 4,700 in 1945 to 8,600 in 1960 , increasing the demand for white occupied land .
The black population was also expanding and African grievances over land eventually swelled to voluble protest .
This is the background to the land invasions on white farms over the last decade .
Mugabe was making good his promise to return the land to his people .
In 1962 Ian Smith ’s Rhodesian Front party swept to power on their policy of maintaining the status quo for the white farmers .
During the 1960 ’s Britain was in the process of granting independence to its various colonies .
Smith attempted to negotiate independence for Rhodesia but Britain would only accede to this if it was on the basis of democratic ( one person , one vote ) elections .
Smith was intent on entrenching white minority rule “ forever� ? , so Britain refused .
On 11 November 1965 the Smith government made a Unilateral Declaration of Independence which they claimed had precedent in the USA Declaration of Independence in 1776 .
This triggered a range of reactions .
Sanctions were imposed by Britain and the United Nations .
The black population was outraged , leading to the formation of black resistance movements aimed at changing the government .
Smith introduced the Law and Order ( Maintenance )
Act which allowed the government to literally do anything without recourse to the Courts or rule of law .
One of his first acts was to imprison four black nationalist leaders without trial or publicity .
Mugabe was one of these 4 and he spent the following 11 years in prison .
He was released in 1974 during a brief cease fire between the Rhodesian forces and the liberation movements .
Mugabe took the opportunity to escape across the border into Mozambique where he became leader of the resistance movement and was instrumental in organizing many terrorist raids on farms in Rhodesia .
The terror war became increasingly vicious on both sides .
Rhodesian forces regularly crossed into neighboring territories , dealing brutally with the local population suspected of harboring terrorists .
The neighboring countries eventually insisted that a peace deal be consummated .
They would no longer tolerate liberation movements on their soil .
Mugabe reluctantly agreed .
The guerrilla war had spread to all corners of Rhodesia , forcing Smith to also come to the negotiating table .
In early 1980 the country became independent and changed its name to Zimbabwe .
Mugabe stunned everyone by gaining 63 % of the popular vote at the first elections .
Despite claims of vote rigging and intimidation of voters , the numbers were so overwhelming that it was conceded that Mugabe had won and he was elected President of Zimbabwe .
People just wanted peace .
Mugabe , despite initial claims of moderation , set about entrenching himself as president , a position he wanted to claim for life .
Surprisingly Mugabe did not repeal the Law and Order ( Maintenance )
Act that the white regime had used to cover its many evil acts .
Mugabe relied on its terms to justify the terrible things that he perpetrated over the ensuing 3 decades .
These atrocities are recorded in Martin Meredith ’s book “ Mugabe� ?
and there is no point detailing them now .
Suffice to say that he was bent on eliminating his opponents and intent on punishing anyone who criticized him .
His Zanu - PF people infiltrated the army and the police force and were at his beck and call to act as thugs when required .
Faithful people were rewarded with a range of patronage that he dispensed .
He found a compliant partner in the Governor of the Reserve bank , which became Mugabe ’s source of funds to pay his people and to dispense his patrimony .
Needless to say , much of the money came from printing new Zimbabwean dollars , which caused inflation to gradually increase .
Finally the army and police forces to got cranky , publicly demanding much higher pay .
The following is extracted from Wikipedia.org :
On 16 February 2006 , the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe , Gideon Gono , announced that the government had printed ZW $ 20.5 trillion in order to buy foreign currency to pay off IMF arrears . [ 51 ]
In early May 2006 , Zimbabwe 's government announced that they would produce another ZW$ 60 trillion . [ 52 ]
The additional currency was required to finance the recent 300 % salary increase for soldiers and policemen and 200 % increase for other civil servants .
The money was not budgeted for the current fiscal year , and the government did not say where it would come from .
On 29 May , Reserve Bank officials told IRIN that plans to print about ZW$ 60 trillion ( about US $ 592.9 million at official rates ) were briefly delayed after the government failed to secure foreign currency to buy ink and special paper for printing money .
On 27 June 2007 , it was announced that central bank governor Gideon Gono had been ordered by President Robert Mugabe to print an additional ZWD $ 1 trillion to cater for civil servants ' and soldiers ' salaries that were hiked by 600 % and 900 % respectively .

Note the logarithmic scale Clearly Mugabe was responsible for the hyperinflation .
The causes were those always present in these events .
A weak economy , large government budget deficits , inability to borrow funds combined with the political decision not to cut Government spending .
Governments are reluctant to lay off government employees , especially those related to the armed forces .
The latter might invite a military coup .
The only source of funding left is the creation of new money .
A very important factor in assessing the current situation is that Mugabe no longer has his own private source of funds to continue with his system of patronage .
The army , police force and civil servants are paid by the Unity Government .
Mugabe ’s power base must be disintegrating rapidly .
He has also become very unpopular .
It seems unlikely that he could win an election again , even if he managed to get his thugs to resort to intimidation .
People identify Tsvangirai and the MDC with the new monetary disposition and the improved economy , while Mugabe is correctly blamed for the trauma of hyperinflation .
There is also the question of sanctions .
In recent speeches Mugabe has said that it was time for sanctions against Zimbabwe to be removed .
This is nonsense .
It is Mugabe and 200 of his associates who are under sanction by the US and other countries under the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act .
This prevents them and their families from travelling overseas and freezes their external bank accounts .
This combination of circumstances , combined with the fact that he is 86 years old , suggests that Mugabe must be under pressure to resign .
It is a logical deduction that behind the scenes Mugabe must be attempting to negotiate a form of amnesty against prosecution .
The next month is important as the SADC , which guaranteed the terms of the recent Unity Government , has given Mugabe until 6 December 2009 to comply with all outstanding issues .

COMMENTS and CONCLUSIONS .
Having seen the impact of hyperinflation at close quarters , my view is that this is the least desirable method for eliminating excessive debt .
The population has been traumatized physically ( starvation ) , mentally and financially .
Most people did not have foreign assets or local tangible assets , so lost virtually everything .
The companies survived using unusual skills , ignoring laws and protecting working capital by holding foreign currency or purchasing equities .
The alternative option for eliminating excessive debt is to take the tough political decision of allowing ‘ too big to fail� ?
companies to fail and accept the unpleasant economic consequences .
Excessive Government spending should be curbed .
A sound currency , elimination of all rules and controls in a completely free market will produce a much better result in the long term .
If this option were adopted , the short term would likely be extremely unpleasant , possibly including an economic depression .
It is doubtful whether any Government today has the courage to take this route .
Sadly this implies that the world is headed down the path of currency destruction that will eventually result in a Zimbabwean situation for the elimination of debt .
Zimbabwe may yet prove to be a role model , demonstrating how rapidly a country can recover from the devastation of hyperinflation and the elimination of debt .
In Zimbabwe the serious problem of the land issue remains to be resolved .
Morgan Tsvangirai indicated that security of land tenure was vital .
One option is the Zambian model where all land was nationalized followed by the issue of 99 year leases to property holders .
The MDC will also look at some form of compensation for farmers who have been dispossessed .
They are anxious to see a land audit set up , but Mugabe is stalling on this for obvious reasons .
On mining , the MDC are examining a bill that will require concessions to be developed in a shorter period , perhaps 2 - 3 years , compared to 100 years currently .
They will aim at a combination of royalties and taxes to provide the State ’s share of mining profits rather than insisting on a percentage of local ownership .
PERSONAL NOTE .
My family was concerned about me going to Zimbabwe .
“ Do n’t you know that it is a dangerous place ?�?
I admit that I was nervous too .
International news on Zimbabwe seems to be preoccupied with violence , particularly the brutal land invasions and physical intimidation in the political sphere .
The fact that foreign media have not been allowed into the country until the past few months has resulted in a false image being projected .
Mugabe ’s thugs have closed down newspapers that were critical of his regime , so news has tended to be pro-Mugabe .
We arrived late on a Saturday evening and due to the massive time change , I woke very early on Sunday morning .
I decided to take a walk around central Harare and found my way to the Harare Catholic Cathedral .
There were Masses in the local language at 7 am , 8 am , and 9 am , followed by an English Mass at 10.00 am .
All four Masses were standing room only , as can be seen in the photograph below .
Standing room only at four consecutive Masses at the Harare Catholic Cathedral .
The people were well dressed and looked well nourished .
They were all friendly and affable .
My view that Zimbabwe was a dangerous place did a dramatic about turn .
These were peaceable people who wanted nothing but a quiet life .
Walking around the streets , I never felt harassed physically .
The curio sellers at Victoria Falls were a pain , but so are street vendors everywhere .
They were certainly all friendly and intelligent .
They could get involved in a serious conversation and all had strong views about economics and politics .
Obviously it is Mugabe ’s thugs that people fear , but that is becoming less of a problem .
All my preconceived ideas about Zimbabwe were smashed .
I now believe it has a bright future , especially once Mugabe leaves the scene .
I was sufficiently encouraged by the prospects for the economy and sufficiently impressed by the high quality of the senior executives of major companies to make some small initial personal investments on the Harare Stock Exchange .
Anyone looking for a safe , interesting , place to visit should consider Zimbabwe .
I think that you will be pleasantly surprised and have an enjoyable trip .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britons are among the ugliest people in the world , according to a dating website that says it only allows “ beautiful people ” to join .

Fewer than one in eight British men and just three in 20 women who have applied to BeautifulPeople.com have been accepted , an emailed statement from the website showed .
Existing members of the “ elite dating site ” rate how attractive potential members are over a 48 hour period , after applicants upload a recent photo and personal profile .
Swedish men have proved the most successful , with 65 percent being accepted , while Norwegian women are considered the most beautiful with 76 percent accepted , the website said .
The way that BeautifulPeople.com accepts new members is simple .
A potential member applies with a photo and a brief profile .
Over 48 hours , existing members of the opposite sex vote whether or not to admit them , the site said .
Options are : “ Yes definitely , ” “ Hmm yes , O.K , ” “ Hmm no , not really ” and “ No definitely not . ”
The site was founded in 2002 in Denmark and went live across the globe last month .
Since then , the site has rejected nearly 1.8 million people from 190 countries , admitting just 360,000 new members .
“ I would say Britain is stumbling because they do n’t spend as much time polishing up their appearance and they are letting themselves down on physical fitness , ” Beautiful People managing director Greg Hodge said .
“ Next to Brazilian and Scandinavian beauties , British people just are n’t as toned or glamorous . ”
Only the male Russian and Polish applicants fared worse than British men , although Russian women had a 44 percent acceptance rate .
Polish women did not appear in the table .
German applicants were slated for offering up unflattering photographs , which may have hindered their acceptance rates at 15 percent for men and 13 percent for women , the lowest rate in their category .
“ German men and women are n’t faring well , but they are submitting stern images , they need to soften up , ” Hodge said .
1 ) The Lie of the Land
On 26th October 2001 ABC news led its main bulletin with an exclusive report claiming a direct link between the then recent Anthrax mailings and the bioweapons program of Saddam Hussain 's Iraq .
Based on " well - placed " sources , the story made several claims regarding the chemical and biological composition of the Anthrax spores recovered from the tainted letters sent to politicians in Washington , claims which pointed a heavy circumstantial finger at Hussain 's regime and which if true would have seemed the ultimate " slam - dunk " justification for war .
That they were in fact totally untrue did not hinder ABC from continuing to tout them for weeks afterwards ; nor did it prevent right - wing journalists in other organisations from recycling the story through 2002 and beyond .
As Glenn Greenwald states in one of his many excellent dissections of ABC 's journalism :
At one of the most critical times in American history -- the weeks following the 9/11 and anthrax attacks -- ABC News and Brian Ross published multiple , highly inflammatory reports , aggressively linking Iraq to the anthrax attacks , which turned out to be completely false .
Accompanying those false anthrax reports , ABC News frequently linked Saddam to the 9/11 attacks as well -- such as when Cokie Roberts , during an interview with Donald Rumsfeld immediately following one of Ross 's Saddam - anthrax stories , referenced " the confirmation that Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence official . "
Glenn produced a whole series of articles on the subject , in particular homing in on ABC 's reluctance to even acknowledge the falsity of the initial reports .
Though he achieved some partial victory with a grudging admission eventually being extracted from ABC that they had been wrong originally , the company never named those " well - placed " sources who sparked the story off beyond a vague reference to " mistaken " scientists involved in the initial forensic analysis .
With this statement it would seem the network giant had closed off any further investigation into who exactly had planted these ideas " at one of the most critical times in American history . "
As Glenn asserted in another of his posts :
... I never realized this before , but I now see that Brian Ross was , far and away , the journalistic leader and the real pioneer in trying to claim a connection between Saddam and the anthrax attacks ( as well as between Saddam and the 9/11 attacks ) .
If this were true , if Brian Ross and the ABC team really were the well - spring from which all the subsequent Anthrax / Iraq stories emerged into the media , then their stonewalling of Glenn Greenwald 's legitimate enquiries would have permanently blocked that avenue from further investigation .
But thankfully this is one instance where Glenn 's analysis is wrong , because there was another journalist making even more serious accusations specifying links between Saddam , Anthrax AND 9/11 at exactly the same time - earlier in fact .
Although never picked up on directly by other media outlets in the manner that the ABC bulletins would be , this report can be seen today as a much more highly concentrated manifestation of Bush Administration propaganda - but one that is far more revealing when examined for clues as to the sources of the disinformation campaign .
And such examination raises difficult questions of the journalist who , more so even than Brian Ross , can be seen as the " real pioneer " in claiming links between Saddam , Anthrax and 9/11 .
But unlike the ABC reporter , this cheerleader was shouting his lines on the other side of the Atlantic ..........
2 ) A Well - Respected Man .
The journalist 's name is Tom Mangold and on the 28th October 2001 ( that 's 2 days after the initial ABC report was aired ) he fronted an edition of the BBC 's flagship current affairs programme Panorama entitled Bin Laden 's biological threat billed as :
An investigation into the realities behind the prospects of a terrorist strike using biological weapons .
As both co-author of Plague Wars , an acclaimed 1999 study on bio-weapons developments across the world and as a highly experienced and respected BBC reporter , Mangold would have appeared the ideal candidate to responsibly analyse the preparedness of Western nations against such an attack .
On an associated webpage for this particular edition of Panorama he wrote the following preview / synopsis of his report :
Anthrax delivered by letter has caused a shut down of Congress and justified panic in the U.S. postal services .
No one knows if Bin Laden did this , but most fear he would if he could .....
The horrors of September 11th tested New York 's emergency management systems to the full and showed how the city could cope with crisis .
The question remains as to how other major cities would cope with the threat of biological attack .
And indeed a significant portion of the actual broadcast would be spent favourably contrasting the preparations made by the authorities in New York with their seemingly amateurish UK equivalents in London .
[ By the way New Yorkers will be cheered to know that , according to Mr Mangold 's reporting later in this episode , these rigorous preparations would include the following : " The city would have to be isolated .
No one could leave , no one could enter .
There would be substantial no go ghost areas .
Governor 's Island , just south of Wall Street , Manhattan would become a mass mortuary , there would be lime pits .
In the ensuing looting and panic , martial law would be quickly and firmly imposed .
Selected police have already been trained for this , as have national guard units . " [ my emphasis ]
So good luck with that one .......!]
Now the subject matter was undeniably pertinent in the light of what had just been happening in New York .
And Mangold does not make any specific claim about Bin Laden being responsible for the Anthrax attack in his highlighted comment above , but is rather posing the obvious " what - if " question of how the British would cope in similar circumstances .
Nor does he suggest any direct links with the 9/11 atrocities except to use them as an example of New York 's emergency management systems in action .
So what is the big deal here , you ask ?
From this description the reporter would appear to be taking a reasoned and measured approach to the subject , after all .
Well that 's what I thought too - until in my researches I stumbled across the BBC transcript of the actual transmission tucked away on an obscure corner of the organisation 's website .
Because that reveals there was effectively a second programme broadcast that night - one that had an entirely different agenda to the one Mangold outlined above , but an agenda that in retrospect will seem disturbingly familiar .
Analysis of this transcript will throw up some startling revelations about just how early after 9/11 the campaign began to associate Iraq with Bin Laden and bio-terror .
It will also raise serious questions over the extent to which Mr Mangold was willing to act as a conduit for official ( or unofficial ) Intelligence Agency " spin " , both in this particular documentary and in his previous work as a news journalist - behaviour that is in marked contrast to the reputation he still possesses in most quarters today as a serious , impartial and trustworthy current affairs reporter .
It will also spark fresh scrutiny of his subsequent testimony to The Hutton Inquiry established to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of weapons expert Dr David Kelly ( Mangold had interviewed Dr Kelly as a primary source for the Plague Wars book and had been in email correspondence with him until shortly before his death ) .
Although a key issue examined at these hearings was whether the British Government had deliberately " sexed - up " intelligence reports to present Iraq 's weapons capabilities as a bigger threat than they actually were ( the infamous " 45 - minutes to attack " claim that was criticised by fellow reporter Andrew Gilligan ) at no point in Mangold 's statements to the Inquiry nor in his subsequent media appearances , did he acknowledge a conflict of interest in the generally pro-establishment line that he was taking .
For as you will soon see , Tom Mangold 's report for Panorama in October 2001 would be about as " sexed - up " about Iraq as you could possibly imagine ........
3 ) Listen , Stop Me If You 've Heard This One , But There Were These Two Terrorists .......

As this is a simple text file with no HTML tags or other markers you may find it easier to keep it open in a separate tab for reference .
Any emphasis of text is mine unless otherwise stated . ]
Mangold 's actual introduction that evening was stark and bleak , even when he was n't quoting Tony Blair :
TOM MANGOLD : The fear is as old as history .
The plague doctor of the middle ages helpless in the continent where disease killed millions .
Today the images have returned and with them the fear that disease may walk the land once more .
TONY BLAIR : [ Speaking in the House of Commons 14 September 2001 ]
We know that they would , if they could , go further and use chemical , biological or even nuclear weapons of mass destruction .
We know also that there are groups or people occasionally states who will trade the technology and capability of such weapons .
MANGOLD : Could there really be a biological attack by Al Qaeda terrorists and are we ready for it if there is ?
Tonight Panorama sorts facts from fears and investigates the reality behind six weeks that have shaken the world .... ..... three people have been murdered by proxy , another ten infected and thirty - two more exposed .
Letters laced with anthrax have closed Congress and sent the US mail service into chaos .
The perpetrators remain free .
No link has been established to Bin Laden but there is growing evidence in the West of his involvement in the new horror of biological terrorism .
It 's a good start , is n't it ?
Mangold compares the Anthrax attacks to almost a Biblical plague , smoothly segues into a speech made by Tony Blair ( only three days after 9/11 ! ) in which he is already talking about Weapons of Mass Destruction , and then floats the possibility Al Qaeda are planning to unleash said plague on the world .
So where do you think he starts investigating " the reality " of the situation and the " growing evidence " of Bin Laden 's involvement in it ?
That 's right , in Florida , with the 9/11 hi-jackers !:
MANGOLD : A crop dusting plane in central Florida .
This unlikely location contains the first real clue that Al Qaeda terrorists were planning something very unusual , even before their September 11th atrocities .
This remote airfield in Florida may have been as close as it gets to becoming the focus for the first biological attack by Islamic Fundamentalist terrorists on a mainland city , possibly Miami .
The evidence , while circumstantial , points inexorably to the conclusion that this , at the very least , may have been in the minds of the men who subsequently died on September 11th .
Last March a group of Middle Eastern men arrived uninvited and unannounced at the airfield .
They carried still and video cameras and took pictures of the planes .
No one objected to the questions they asked ...........
We now know the man asking the questions was Mohamed Atta ..... what was it about crop dusters that so intrigued ( him ) ?
Eight years ago America 's Congressional Office of Technology took the threat of biological terrorism seriously enough to use ( sic ) Washington to show what one crop dusting plane filled with weapons grade anthrax could do .
And said results as described by the chairman of US Public Health Preparedness would n't be pretty :
Donald Henderson :
With something in the order of 100 kilos of anthrax spores , a good proportion of the population could suffer and die from anthrax depending very much on how it 's spread and the efficiency of it .
Now stories of Atta displaying an unhealthy interest in crop dusting planes quickly emerged in the days following 9/11 so it 's hardly surprising they would rate a mention here .
But as far as I 'm aware , nothing definitive was ever proven as to what ( if anything ) the hi-jackers intended to do with them .
Would launching a biological attack have been a more plausible suggestion than say , filling the spray tanks with fuel to use as a flying bomb ?
Mr Mangold seems to think so but he fails to present any firm evidence here beyond the co-incidence of the Congressional report that hypothesised their use in a bio-weapons delivery system .
Still , given all that had happened in the weeks leading up to his broadcast it is hard to begrudge Tom Mangold speculating in this way , even though he proffers no explanation as to why exactly Atta would drop such a plan despite being " inexorably " fascinated by it .
However he will return later to the crop dusters theme from a very surprising and quite probably much less defensible angle .
For now though he continues by posing a question to the audience :
MANGOLD : But who in their right mind would ever dream of murdering the civilian population of an entire capital city ?
One man has admitted he has no moral objections : Osama Bin Laden .
" We do not consider it a crime if we have tried to have nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .
Our Holy Land is occupied by Israeli and American forces .
We have the right to defend ourselves liberate our Holy Land " MANGOLD : Nor is this just idle rhetoric ...... Now western intelligence are joining the dots and looking for patterns .
In 1999 spy satellites revealed that Bin Laden 's terrorists had primitive biochemical research facilities near the towns of Khoust and Abu Khabab north of Jalalabad .
Ahmad Rosan , an Al Qaeda terrorist caught in the United States revealed that Bin Laden was personally interested in using low flying aircraft to dispense biochemical agents .
Important evidence then came from Egypt .
In June 1999 over 100 hard men from various radical Islamic terrorist cells closely allied with Bin Laden were on trial .
One of them , headed the Egyptian Islamic Jihad Military Operations , admitted his group possessed biological weapons for use against numerous American and Israeli targets .
He had tried to buy biological weapons in the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan .
Reading this passage today one wonders exactly how this one AQ terrorist was persuaded into his " admission " - and was he admitting to possessing weapons or attempting to buy them ?
If the former why not tell us where he actually got them from as opposed to where he tried to get them from ?
But never mind , this clumsy construction leads into a discussion of the grim conditions at former weapons research centres in the former Soviet Union , and a chummy little chat between Mangold and none other than soon to be CIA chief Porter Goss on the risks of weapons proliferation from the former Soviet Bloc ( a theme which formed a major section of Mangold 's Plague Wars book , in which he drew on experiences that Dr David Kelly described to him when he had inspected these deteriorating facilities in the early Nineties ) .
However to the casual viewer this sequence would appear a pointless diversion as Mangold concludes it with the following statement :
MANGOLD : There 's no firm evidence that Al Qaeda has purchased either scientist or germs from the former Soviet Union but they can still go shopping .
Okay , shopping where , if not Russia ?
There are always 250 scientific centres in the United States alone which carry stocks of anthrax and over 1000 sites abroad .
Really ?
That does sound like a lot of Anthrax does n't it !
It 's a prospect that haunts Western and Eastern leaders today .
Leaders like who exactly ?
And where exactly would they be going shopping , again ?
Can you guess , boys and girls ?
4 ) Gimme an I ..... Gimme an R....... Gimme an A ....... Gimme an Q....... Waddya Got ......?
GEORGE ROBERTSON ( Secretary General , NATO - 13 September 2001 )
There is the credible possibility that terrorists , or what President Putan ( sic ) called ' rogue states ' , would use ballistic missile technology to take weapons of mass destruction , chemical and biological weapons into the heart of cities .
That 's former Defence Secretary to Tony Blair , George Robertson , beating his ex-boss to the punch by a day in flagging the menace from weapons of mass destruction , running with a precursor to the " 45 minutes - from - attack " line , though he was n't yet to know that you could deliver " biological weapons into the heart of cities " quite literally for the cost of a postage stamp .
But there 's just one thing I do n't quite understand about George 's warning - who does he mean by " Rogue States " ?
Could Tom help explain perhaps ?
MANGOLD : Rogue States , code for Iraq , one country that has an advanced biological warfare programme .
September 11th has renewed the struggle in the West between those who see Iraq 's hand behind all Islamic fundamentalist terrorism , and now want a second front against Iraq to finish Saddam off , and those who say there may be circumstantial evidence but no proof , and until then he should be left along .
Former CIA boss Jim Woolsey takes the hard view .
JIM WOOLSEY Director , CIA , 1994-95
Saddam succeeded in keeping all biological agents and all actual material away from the inspectors , probably so they could n't analyse it and type it , and he said that he destroyed all of his biological weapons and material for it , and if you believe that , as we say over here , I have a bridge in Brooklyn I 'd like to sell you .
MANGOLD : It is undeniable that Saddam Hussein 's biological warfare programme was extensive and highly developed by the end of the Gulf War .
UN inspectors dredged up what they could and destroyed it but much remained carefully hidden from their prying eyes .
To make matters worse , the UN has had no inspectors inside Iraq since 1998 , so allowing the biological programme to restart .
So what would the casual viewer have learnt from this report so far ?
Let 's recap shall we , because there 's a lot to take in :
Terrorists equate to Rogue States ;
Rogue States are prepared to launch WMD attacks against cities to cause mass fatalities ;
Iraq is the Rogue State ;
Iraq controls all Islamic fundamentalist terrorism ;
The only question is whether this can be conclusively proved yet ;
Saddam Hussain hid all his biological weapons from inspection and falsely claimed to have destroyed all such material ;
Iraq currently has an advanced biological warfare programme ;oh , and not forgetting ;
The 9/11 hi-jackers had planned to launch a mass Anthrax attack in Florida but decided against it on a whim .
This sort of makes Brian Ross look like Walter Cronkite , does n't it ?
Still at least now the tipping point has been reached in Mangold 's broadcast we can finally catch a glimpse of one of the prime movers in this disinformation campaign , none other than former CIA chief James " Jim " Woolsey .
As outlined by the History Commons Project , Woolsey was a prominent original member of the notorious neo-conservative group the Project for a New American Century , and pre-9/11 had already made extraordinary efforts to prove an always implausible conspiracy theory that linked Saddam Hussain to the first bombing attack on the World Trade Centre in 1993 .
Now he was doing exactly the same with the 2001 plot , to the extent of travelling to the UK without informing either US or UK officials of his trip in a blatant breach of protocol .
To quote from the History Commons article describing his activities in October 2001 :
Former CIA Director James
Woolsey makes a secret trip to Europe to find evidence that could link the Iraqi government to various terrorist attacks .
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz funds and supports his trip .
He visits Wales in a fruitless search for evidence to link Iraq to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing ...
But he also looks for evidence tying Iraq to 9/11 and the anthrax attacks once they become publicly known in early October .
The Village Voice will later report , " Woolsey was also asked to make contact with Iraqi exiles and others who might be able to beef up the case that hijacker Mohamed Atta was working with Iraqi intelligence to plan the September 11 attacks , as well as the subsequent anthrax mailings . " .....
It is unknown exactly what Woolsey does in Europe , but his trip has an apparent effect on the media .
In addition to numerous articles about Atta ’s alleged Prague visit , some articles appear attempting to tie Atta and the Iraqi government to the anthrax attacks as well ..... But no hard evidence will emerge supporting any of these allegations pushed by Woolsey .
Although several examples of these articles are cited , including on - the - record newspaper interviews with Woolsey , this BBC broadcast is , I believe the first ( and only ? ) time that he is seen making these statements on camera .
Though it is unclear when exactly the interview took place , what seems undeniable is the fact that James Woolsey was an active operator in the propaganda campaign against Iraq from its earliest days - and he had found a willing and uncritical partner to assist him in Tom Mangold .
But while you might think by now this report has already gone the extra mile to " prove " links between Anthrax , Iraq and 9/11 , Tom Mangold is only just getting into his stride .
Join me in Part Two for the next exciting instalment as I discuss the Last of the Red Hand Gang .......
You read that headline correctly .

Valtionkirkon on noudatettava valtion normeja
Tiedote 8.11.2009
" Suomen valtio ei voi uskoa julkisia tehtäviä kirkkokunnalle , jonka oppi on ristiriidassa ihmisoikeusajattelun kanssa " , totesi professori Martin Scheinin kirjassa Synti vai siunaus - homoseksuaalit , kirkko ja yhteiskunta .
Evankelisluterilainen valtionkirkko ei suostu siunaamaan samaa sukupuolta olevien parisuhteita , joten kirkon ihmisoikeuskäsitys on ristiriidassa Suomen valtion ihmisoikeusajattelun kanssa .
Suomen valtio ei voi jatkaa tässä kaksinaismoralistisessa tilanteessa , jossa se toisaalta pyrkii saattamaan kaikki kansalaiset tasa - arvoiseksi ja samalla tukee runsaalla kädellä kirkkokuntaa , joka syrjii yhden vähemmistön oikeuksia .
" Kirkon asenne valtiota kohtaan on yksipuolinen .
Otetaan rahat ja asema , mutta hylätään valtion velvoittama tasavertaisuusperiaate kansalaisten suhteen .

by Ibn Warraq ( November 2009 )
Western art has , in the words of Roger Scruton , " continuously ventured into spiritual territory that has no place on the Christian map , " and has done so with generosity , tolerance , affection , and a noble vision of universal humanity .
Literature and music , as much as painting and architecture , has acknowledged other civilizations and other peoples , and embraced them as equals , and sometimes treated them as superior souls from whom the West could learn .
In her biography of Mozart as a dramatist , Brigid Brophy has a dazzling chapter on the Exotic in Eighteenth century art , reminding us of Western man 's ventures " to unpath 'd waters , undreamed shores : " China , Turkey , Persia , Babylon , Egypt , Abyssinia , South America , India , even outer space . [ 1 ]
Brophy sings the virtues of Mozart 's Die Entführung aus dem Serail [ Il Seraglio ] and Die Zauberflöte , and places them firmly within the Enlightenment 's cosmopolitanism and its educative program .
" To admire and copy foreign countries inside Europe was scarcely less obligatory than to admire , collect and copy the exotic products of other continents . " [ 2 ]
In Il Seraglio , when Pasha Selim is introduced , he is the " raw material of nobility , aristocratic and imposing , but uninstructed , " but " is allowed to develop a good deal more character than a mere exotic touch . "
By the end , the Pasha becomes a new man , who " shews himself a nobler pagan than Belmonte 's father has been a Christian — for , by one of those dénouements of identity which are set off like catherine wheels by rococo plotmaking , Blemonte has turned out to be the son of an ancient enemy who used the Pasha ill .
The moral purpose of the exotic vein is pointed when the ostensibly barbarian Pasha stigmatises Blemonte 's father as ' dieser Barbar . ' " [ 3 ]
Brophy continues , " This bloody and unjust man is , of course , a Christian of the deepest Catholic dye — a Spanish grandee [ As his son , Belmonte , admits , being prepared to die without complaint in recompense of ' das Unrecht ' done by his father to the Pasha ( Act III , dialogue before No.21 ) ] .
Frederick the Great 's opera [ Montezuma ] had indicted the atrocities of the Spaniards against the Mexicans in order to shew that it was Christianity which was the ' barbarie . '
[ In Bernardin de Saint - Pierre 's Paul et Virginie , Paul uses the same verbal paradox when , in the primitive bliss of Mauritius , he speaks of Europe as 'ce pays barbare . ']
Il Seraglio exposes a Spaniard 's vindictive treatment of a Turk , and shews that it is the Turk who is capable of learning the lesson of non-vengeance .
The Pasha does not take the opportunity to avenge himself on the father through the son — because he disdains to follow the Christian barbarian 's example .
' I hold your father in too much detestation , ' he tells Belmonte , ' to be able to tread in his footsteps . '
Pedrillo's narrative ballad has evoked the Crusades to the advantage not of Christian chivalry but of Selim 's historical precursor in nobility , Saladin . "
Thus the Pasha frees Belmonte , for revenge would only damage the revenger 's moral nature , and Constanze , because neither force nor kindness on his part can alter the fact that she does not love him .
The Pasha " reforms his government , to the extent of giving a brisk warning to his corrupt officer , Osmin .... " [ 4 ]
Die Zauberflöte has the same emotional subject matter as Il Seraglio , namely , the testing of love against the fear of death .
But the former also has familar themes of the Enlightenment : the triumph of light over dark , but seen through Masonry 's allegorical symbolism .
As Brophy reminds us , " Mozart , at least when he was young , grieving and writing to his worried and conservative father , disliked Voltaire , but six years after Voltaire 's death , joined the Freemasons — who adulated Voltaire , practised the Enlightenment 's morality ( including toleration ) and were , for that reason , condemned ( twice , during the eighteenth century ) by papal bull .
Catholicism declined to return Masonry 's compliment of toleration because Masonry , as a ' universal ' system of morality , seemed to imply that the church was not necessary to morals and because Masonry insisted ( from 1723 onwards ) on extending the tolerance it offered its Christian members equally to Jews and Deists . " [ 5 ]
Brophy argues that " Masonry 's central allegory , the triumph of light over dark , is shared with the very metaphor of the Enlightenment , with everyday speech ( which says ' I see ' in the sense of ' I understand ' ) and with the cult of Osiris ( the sun ) and Isis ( the moon , which can illuminate even the night ) .
In pursuit of the allegory , a first - degree initiant into Masonry is blindfolded and presented as ' a poor Candidate in a state of darkness '.... The candidates in the opera undergo the Masonic darkness by being at various times , velied , subjected to ordeal - by - darkness and aware of spiritual darkness ( Tamino 's ' everlasting night ' ) ; their spiritual enlightenment at the initiation coincides with Sarastro 's victory , in which ' the sun 's rays expel night . ' " [ 6 ]
Sarastro is clearly an allusion to Zoroaster , and Brophy wonders if the librettists — Mozart himself may have had a hand in writing the libretto — acquired their knowledge of Zoroaster from Lucian , the Voltaire of the ancient world , who took the Cynic Menippos as a hero of his romance .
" Menippos says that when he had made up his mind to visit the Underworld he decided ' to go to Babylon and ask a favour of one of the Magi , the disciples and successors of Zoroaster ( tinoõ twn magwn twn Zwroastrou maqhtwn kai diadocwn ) . ' " [ 7 ]
One modern biographer of Mozart , Maynard Solomon , thinks that " Mozart 's attraction to a Zoroastrian orientalism is in the tradition of the Masonic lodges and reading societies , which were hotbeds of interest in the exotic , the oriental , and the miraculous . " [ 8 ]
Solomon is also convinced that Mozart 's attachment to Freemasonry was deep .
" There was a powerful appeal in Freemasonry 's idealism , its undogmatic approach to religion , its teachings on self - development and spiritual uplift .
It surely exercised a powerful ideological pull upon Mozart that stemmed from its humanitarian and enlightened aspirations , its ideals of equality , liberty , tolerance , and fraternity , and its vision of salvation through love and reason ....
Freemasonry ... touched his religious yearnings through its fusion of contemporary enlightened teachings with ancient traditions , and through its polytheistic eclecticism , which combined Christian , classical , and exotic religions into a heady blend — witness the opening lines of Mozart 's cantata , K.619 , with its undogmatic acceptance of every deity :
You who revere the
Creator of the boundless universe ,
call him Jehova or God ,
call him Fu , or Brahma .
Hark !
Hark to the words
of the Almighty 's trumpet call !
Ringing out through earth , moon , sun ,
its sound is everlasting . " [ 9 ]
Freemasonry clearly answered to many of Mozart 's longings : attraction to mystery and illumination , search for knowledge and quest for beauty , fantasy and brotherhood .
The Masons believed in the possibility of social transformation " and the return of humanity from a state of innocence and grace . "
As Solomon concludes his chapter on Mozart 's deep commitment to Freemasonry : " A young composer 's fascination with The Arabian Nights , with Fénelon 's rationalist utopian novel , Les Aventures de Télémaque , and with every variety of literary and musical orientalism converge in the Masonic Temple , creating in its consecrated premises a miniature simulacrum of a fantastic illuminated city , casting an anticipatory beam of light from a desired future into a shadowed present .
We are left without certainty , but perhaps with some room for mystery and the miraculous . " [ 10 ]
The Arabian Nights , Brahma , Zoroaster , Turkish Pasha : where did Mozart imbibe his Orientalism ?
The European version of The Arabian Nights was a translation into French begun in 1704 by French Orientalist Antoine Galland [ 1646-1715 ] ; i n 1771 Anquetil - Duperron [ 1731 -1805 ] published his Zend Avesta ( 3 vols . ) , containing collections from the sacred writings of the Zoroastrians , a life of Zoroaster , and fragments of works ascribed to Zoroaster ; Barthélemy d'Herbelot 's Bibliothèque Orientale , ou Dictionnaire universal ... des Peuples de l'Orient [ Paris , 1697 ] , completed after d'Herbelot 's death in 1695 , contained an entry on Brahma ; and as for Turkey , any number of travelers reported back on their impressions of the Ottomans , such as Johann ( Hans ) Schiltberger [ 1381 - 1440 ] ; Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq [ died 1592 ] , who was Ferdinand I of Austria 's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire under the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent ; and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu [ 1689 -1762 ] ; while the theme of the generous and compassionate Turk , as we shall see in discussing Gluck , was quite common in the theatre , opera and ballet in mid-eighteenth century Vienna and Paris .
It is far more likely that Mozart made his acquaintance of Zoroaster through the influence of Anquetil - Duperron 's translations than through reading Lucian .
For we know that as soon as the French version of the Avesta appeared , Johann Friedrich Kleuker [ 1749 - 1827 ] , Professor of Theology in the University of Riga , published a German translation of it in Leipzig and Riga between 1776 and 1777 , and also , importantly , of Anquetil 's historical dissertations .
Anquetil had tried to show , in a memoir on Plutarch , that the data of the " Avesta " fully agree with the account of the Magian religion given in the treatise on " Isis and Osiris . "
Kleuker enlarged the circle of comparison to the whole of ancient literature . [ 11 ]
Die Zauberflöte , it seems possible that Anquetil - Duperron and Kleuker remain the major source for both Freemasonry and Mozart 's knowledge of Zoroaster .
Lucian would surely have been too cynical for Mozart , who would have been offended by Lucian 's anti-religious satire in the same way that Mozart disliked Voltaire .
Given the importance of the figure of Isis and Osiris in the symbolism of Freemasonry and , as Brophy argues , for Mozart's , it seems possible that Anquetil - Duperron and Kleuker remain the major source for both Freemasonry and Mozart 's knowledge of Zoroaster .
Lucian would surely have been too cynical for Mozart , who would have been offended by Lucian 's anti-religious satire in the same way that Mozart disliked Voltaire .
The Orientalists and their indefatigable intellectual curiosity , scholarship , and translations had incalculable consequences for the development of art , philosophy and politics in Europe , an influence passionately chronicled by Raymond Schwab in The Oriental Renaissance .
Orientalists changed forever the intellectual and spiritual landscape of Europe , and allowed artists , writers , and composers to enter imaginatively and sympathetically into civilizations hitherto unfamiliar to Westerners , to accord the Orient dignity and respect , and to people European works with Orientals , seen as equals .
It was in this intellectual and spiritual milieu that Mozart created some of his most sublime music .
Perhaps Die Zauberflöte , Il Seraglio , and cantata K.619 can be seen as reflections in art of Orientalist research .
Halloween originated with the Celts some 2,000 years ago as a celebration of their new year on November 1st .
On the night of October 31st , they celebrated Samhain , when it was believed the ghosts of the dead returned to the land of the living .
One of the quintessential symbols of the holiday is the skeleton and this Halloween , we ’ve pulled four skeletons out of the Carlton Hobbs closet :
Two genres in art are specifically devoted to reminding us of our own mortality and the transience of earthly possessions and vices .
“ Memento Mori , ” from the Latin “ Remember you will die , ” is a genre found in painting and sculpture , particularly funeral art and architecture .
The most popular symbols found in these works are skeletons or skulls .
Extinguished candles , urns of flowers and timepieces such as clocks and hourglasses are also present as reminders of our fleeting existence in this world .
A gouache depicted in figure 1 shows an artist in his studio .
On the canvas before him is painted an urn of flowers and fruits , characteristic symbols of memento mori painting .
A further symbol of death , the owl , is perched on the easel .
An actual urn with flowers sits on the table above a second canvas of the same subject .
Behind the easel stands a skeleton donning a laurel wreath , suggesting to the viewer that our victories in life are transient as we will all someday die .
A second closely related type of symbolic still life painting is the “ Vanitas , ” Latin for “ vanity . ”
Vanitas paintings contain the same symbols of mortality , but may also include symbols of vanity ( such as mirrors and musical instruments ) , expressing the emptiness and worthless nature of worldly goods .
Belgian painter Antoine Wiertz features the themes of death and mortality prominently in his painting and sculpture , including one of his most famous works , the painting “ Two Young Girls ” or “ The Beautiful Rosine ” ( 1847 ) , seen in figure 2 .
In this work , a beautiful young nude stands face to face with a hanging skeleton .
Its skull is labeled “ La Belle Rosine . ”
Although there is no physical mirror present , the young woman is essentially staring at her future self and eventual passing ; it is a confrontation between beauty and death .
While the original completed work hangs in the Wiertz Museum in Brussels , the present painting is almost certainly the artist ’s prototype .
In figure 3 we see an oil painting of a very interesting figure where the contrast between death and life could not be more explicit .
The woman depicted is , in fact , split in half .
On the right she is painted in the flesh , while on the left she is transformed into a rotting corpse , with worms and snakes wriggling about her bones .
Behind the skeleton on the wall hangs a painting of wilting flowers in a vase , while on the right a billowing curtain and pilaster provide the backdrop for the sentient half of the woman .
Lastly , we have an engraving entitled “ Life and Death Contrasted , or , An Essay on Woman ” ( figure 4 ) .
Once again , this picture is shows a woman halved : on the left , she is painted in elaborate aristocratic costume surrounded by her earthly pleasures , such as books and playing cards .
On the right we see only her skeleton , with a skull and bones at the foot of an obelisk .
The obelisk is covered in proverbs , bible verses and sermon excerpts decrying worldly pursuits and reminding us , and women in particular , that they should be wary of their mortal pursuits and striving toward heavenly salvation .
Check back for a future blog on this painting , when we explore more of the symbolism in depth !
From the Carlton Hobbs Team have a Happy Halloween !
There ’s a certain kind of person - you may even be this kind of person - whose good will after receiving a favor and replying with “ thank you ” is completely wiped out when the response is not the traditional “ you ’re welcome , ” but instead the breezier “ no problem . ”
As “ no problem ” has caught on and spread , replacing “ you ’re welcome ” in situations ranging from casual personal encounters to business deals , the number , vigor , and shrillness of the complaints in etiquette columns and Internet forums has spread along with it .
The reasons given - or unstated - are varied .
Many especially dislike hearing “ no problem ” in commercial transactions and from folks in customer service jobs , since , as the customer is always right , nothing a customer could ask for could ever be “ a problem . ”
“ I assume my business is not a problem , ” huffed one complainer on the message boards at the Visual Thesaurus .
Others on the Internet have taken the same tack : “ Why would it be a problem ?
It ’s her job , is n’t it ? ” and “ It better damn well NOT be a problem , because I just gave you my money . ”
Some dwell on the counterfactual : “ I always wonder if the person would have helped me if they had known it would be a problem . ”
And from Twitter : “ I know it ’s no problem .
You rang up my orange juice .
How could that be a ... problem ? ”
Others think the problem of “ no problem ” is one of self - centeredness .
In a comment on the blog for the public radio station WAMC in Albany , N.Y. , one person with a no - problem problem wrote : “ When you say [ no problem ] , you are describing or assessing how you feel about the favor or task that you are being thanked for instead of acknowledging the social nicety of a ‘ thank you ’ with a statement that in turn acknowledges what was just said to you in a relational context . ”
( Whew ! )
In other , fewer words :
If you say “ no problem , ” you ’re talking about yourself .
If you say “ you ’re welcome , ” the focus is still on the favoree , where it evidently belongs .
Others just think “ no problem ” is unnecessarily negative , dwelling as it does on the problem , and not the just - proffered solution .
“ You ’re welcome , ” has two generally positive words , compared with the doubly negative “ no problem . ”
“ No problem ” has , of course , been joined by other unwelcome responses to “ thank you . ”
There are the variants “ no prob ” and “ no problemo / a , ” as well as “ anytime , ” “ no biggie , ” “ no worries , ” and “ do n’t worry about it . ”
( Although most folks seem to have no trouble with the courtly “ think nothing of it ” or “ it ’s my pleasure . ” )
If you are not a person for whom a cheery “ no problem ” or “ anytime ” is an affront , you may think that those who are affronted are overthinking this - or are overly touchy , or , at the very least , are blessed with an abundance of free time .
You might even sense that responses like “ sure , ” “ anytime , ” or “ no problem ” - as well as “ you ’re welcome ” itself - are what linguists call phatic communications , words that do n’t really convey information so much as they perform a social role .
In other words , “ you ’re welcome ” does n’t mean “ you are welcome ( to ask me to do this again ) ” and “ no problem ” does n’t mean that there would have been a problem if you were n’t so darn nice .
They only mean that the speaker has acknowledged your thanks .
Then again , those who do take offense may be picking up on subtle nuances of the thanker - thankee relationship .
Dr. Albert Katz , a professor of psychology at the University of Western Ontario , has studied this question and has found that these replies can convey more than mere politeness - they may also be used to show or assert social dominance .
In his study , he found that open - ended responses like “ anytime ” were used less often when the favor performed was difficult - reducing the risk that the hearer would take that “ anytime ” literally , and come back again .
But men , especially , were more likely to use responses like “ anytime , ” even for high - difficulty favors , when the person receiving the favor was also male .
( Women were somewhat less likely to use responses like “ anytime ” for high - difficulty favors . )
Katz speculated that men were displaying dominance behavior - proving that they had the resources to perform costly favors - as a way to assert their alpha - male status .
Perhaps the “ no problem ” of service workers is a way to reclaim some measure of power - “ no problem , ” after all , does remind the customer that her request is technically within the power of the employee to grant or refuse .
It ’s subtle reminder of the control workers often do have over a customer ’s experience - especially in the face of the customer who is always , or perhaps simply needs to be , right .

iTunes To Feature Live Concerts Downloads
Last Tuesday , November 24 , iTunes began the feature of allowing users to download live concerts from about 20 artists promoted by Live Nation .
Live Nation is expecting to increase the number of live concerts to offer in the coming months .
It promotes about 20,000 concerts each year .
Currently , videos from concerts of Jesse McCartney , OK Go , Hillary Duff , Plain White T’s , Duffy and Ziggy Marley are available , but not limited to them .
Live Nation already reached licensing agreements for live performances to various major label owners and artists to make sure that the new feature will have smooth sailing .
Prices will begin at $ 7.99 .
It was stated that some exclusive contents will be included from the video downloads .
This new feature is considered as a new breakthrough in live digital music , which is hampered by complicated rights issues .
Selling of live music requires sign - off from the artist , the label , the publishers , the managers , the songwriters , the venue where it was recorded and the promoters .
Yes i think that is the problem , I mean , math is so loud , its deafening , made me deaf .
algebra is a killer , not as bad as times tables though , they are very loud .

There ’s nothing geeks love more than to argue mobile phone platforms .
Here ’s Matt Blaisdell saying that apps were n’t key to iPhone ’s success .
That ’s true , but now that Apple has apps the world has changed and challengers to the iPhone will find it very tough .
Here ’s why : everyone is using a different set of 20 apps .
Trillions of combinations .
You can see this on Appsfire ’s VIP list ( my iPhone apps are listed there , along with a number of others ) .
None of us have the same set of apps .
So , to get me off of the iPhone you are going to have to duplicate all my apps ( and I ’ve gotten several more since doing this list a couple of weeks ago ) .
Here , let ’s play a game .
Let ’s say that a Chinese manufacturer ships an Android phone that makes me hot and bothered .
Something , say , that ’s half the thickness of the iPhone , has a screen that ’s sharper , and the battery lasts twice as long , oh , and let ’s just say it costs $ 50 less than buying an iPhone .
Would it get me to switch away from my iPhone ?
Probably not , truth be told .
( I do have a second SIM , though , waiting , just in case that I use to test phones ) .
Why not ?
Because I ’ve grown addicted to Tweetie .
So , now you ’ll have to build an app , or get a third - party developer to build an app that works better .
Let ’s say you do that .
But do you have my favorite game ?
Tap Tap Revenge ?
Do you have Facebook ?
Do you have Photoshop ?
Just today NASDAQ came out with a cool new app .
Do you have that ?
And so on and so forth .
Every app is lockin .
I ’m not going to be switching anytime soon , and neither are you .
So , what the other manufacturers are hoping is that enough users remain ignorant of all the uses of the apps and that they get enough of them built either by themselves ( not gonna happen ) or by developers outside the company before Apple just locks in everyone .
Joe Wilcox , on Twitter , says that iPhone users are “ beyond reason . ”
No , Joe , I just want my Kindle app on Android before I ’ll switch .
I have lots of books that I ’ve invested in that I can read on my iPHone .
Or , I want my TripIt app on Android or Nokia before I ’ll switch .
My entire flight information is stuck inside there .
Or , I want to watch Leo Laporte ’s show this afternoon ( or more accurately , listen to it on my Prius thanks to UStream ’s app ) .
Or I want to use Yelp ’s app to find a great restaurant .
Etc. Etc. Etc .
If you get me all those , and all the other 85,000 apps , but on a device that is sexier and more fun to use ( and more productive ) then I ’ll definitely be reasonable and switch .
Until then I have 85,000 reasons to be unreasonable .
Oh , did you see this app called “ RedLaser ? ”
You point your phone at barcodes , and it gives you information about the products you are looking at , including what the price is on Amazon.com .
Very cool .
Now I ’m sure you ’ll say you have an app like RedLaser on your device , right ?
( I ’ve seen similar on Nokia devices , for instance )
But do you have all the others I use ?
Yes , I ’m unreasonable .
Let me know when I can stop being unreasonable ! 🙂
Oh , and I met the guy who runs the iPhone app team ( he asked to remain anonymous ) and he told me his team approves hundreds of new apps every day .
So , that ’s HUNDREDS of new reasons every day that I will remain unreasonable .
Sorry to Nokia , Palm , Microsoft , RIM , and all the other players .
Former inmates claim they were beaten and raped in the jails China is running a number of unlawful detention centres in which its citizens can be kept for months , according to campaign group Human Rights Watch .
It says these centres - known as black jails - are often in state - run hotels , nursing homes or psychiatric hospitals .
Among those detained are ordinary people who have travelled to Beijing to report local injustices .
Officials have denied such jails exist , despite earlier reports on them in international and Chinese state media .
' Punched and kicked '
The human rights group report , entitled An Alleyway in Hell , says ordinary people are often abducted off the streets and taken to illegal detention centres .
They are sometimes stripped of their possessions , beaten and given no information about why they have been detained .
The existence of black jails in the heart of Beijing makes a mockery of the Chinese government 's rhetoric on improving human rights and respecting the rule of law
Sophie Richardson
Human Rights Watch Human Rights
Watch said it collected information for the report by interviewing 38 detainees earlier this year .
" I asked why they were detaining me , and as a group [ the guards ] came in and punched and kicked me and said they wanted to kill me , " one former detainee told the group .
" I loudly cried for help and they stopped but from then on I did n't dare [ risk another beating ] . "
Many of those held are petitioners , people who travel to Beijing to present their complaints to the State Bureau for Letters and Calls .
This national government department is supposed to help ordinary people across the country redress their grievances .
But some petitioners are detained by plain clothes security officers when they arrive in Beijing .
This Beijing room was allegedly part of a black jail The Human Rights Watch report cites unpublished local government documents to provide details on the economic structure underpinning the jails .
It says penalties are levied against local officials " who fail to take decisive action when petitioners from their geographical area seek legal redress in provincial capitals and Beijing " .
The operators of the black jails receive cash payments of 150 yuan ( $ 22 ; £ 13 ) to 200 yuan per person , " creating another incentive to employ forms of illegal detention " , the report says .
" The existence of black jails in the heart of Beijing makes a mockery of the Chinese government 's rhetoric on improving human rights and respecting the rule of law , " said Sophie Richardson , Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch .
Outcry over deaths
The jails sprang into existence after a network of official police detention centres used to house people who did not have proper residence permits was closed in 2003 .
Civilian authorities took over responsibility for running detention centres after China loosened its tight residency requirements that year to allow migrant workers to move more freely about the country to seek work .
Legal detention centres have also come in for criticism
The existence of the black jails has already been well documented by international media and rights groups and Chinese state - run media outlets have also reported on their existence .
The China Daily last week carried a report about the trial of a guard at a black jail accused of raping a 20 - year - old woman who had been detained .
Despite that , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang on Thursday denied that China had illegal detention centres .
" I can assure you that there are no so - called black jails in China , " he said at a regular news briefing .
But when pressed on the issue he added that there were " existing problems " that were being dealt with .
Black jails are just one aspect of China 's detention system that have come in for criticism over recent months .
There has been a public outcry over the numbers of deaths in prisons and detention centres , a situation the government has promised to stamp out .

If there 's one thing wireless networking developers have been clamoring for , it 's the ability to take their reference platform mobile .
mobile .
TI 's apparently heard this cry , as it's just introduced the eZ430 - Chronos , a fully - capable wireless dev platform contained entirely within a sports watch .
Yeah , it 's just about the geekiest thing we 've ever seen , and at $ 49 it 's even kind of a steal -- especially since it doubles as a heart monitor out of the box .
Looks like we 've got a new super - nerd stocking - stuffer of choice .
A Maricopa County Superior Court judge on Friday ordered that the Sheriff 's Office divulge the password it forcefully installed on a county computer system linked to sensitive state and federal criminal - justice data .
But Chief Deputy David Hendershott later said he will refuse to share the password - even if it means he goes to jail .
During the Friday hearing , Judge Joseph Heilman said that if the Sheriff 's Office does n't divulge the password by Wednesday , he will " hold someone in contempt of court . "
" I assume it 's going to be someone seated at this table , " he added , referring to Hendershott .
Hendershott said he could not reveal the password under federal law .
And if he goes to jail : " I bet I get a pretty decent place .
Something with a view of the dump . "
Heilman would not comment on the remark .
Since April , Heilman has presided over a lawsuit between the sheriff and the Board of Supervisors over operation of the Integrated Criminal Justice Information System , an electronic hub that allows the county 's criminal - justice agencies to share information .
Taking control
On Wednesday , the Sheriff 's Office took control of the system from county employees and changed a password to prevent civilians from having access to the sensitive data .
The system links the criminal - justice agencies to state and national databases that hold criminal records , court dates , probation and personal information , and other records .
The supervisors and county administrators tried to get a temporary restraining order against the Sheriff 's Office and get the system back under their control .
The judge did not grant the restraining order .
The judge also ordered the Sheriff 's Office to call a meeting in his courtroom on Tuesday with " stakeholders " who are supposed to control the system .
Those stakeholders include the Sheriff 's and County Attorney 's offices , indigent - defense agencies , adult probation and the Superior Court .
Wade Swanson , director of the county 's civil - litigation department , called the judge 's ruling a win for the Board of Supervisors : " He reversed what the sheriff did on Wednesday . "
County Manager David Smith , meanwhile , said the ruling took the county " back to a civilized way of doing business . "
However , county attorney spokesman Barnett Lotstein said the sheriff 's witnesses were not given much time .
During the two - day hearing , county witnesses gave testimony on Thursday and Friday , while Lotstein said the sheriff 's witnesses were n't given time to present their case .
Lotstein said the sheriff " may very well have been deprived of due process . "
" The sheriff was denied his day in court this afternoon , " he added .
State , federal law
Under state and federal law , a criminal - justice agency must manage the system or county agencies could lose access to the National Criminal Information Center and the Arizona Criminal Justice Information System .
However , the integrated system now is under county control .
The county has been trying to figure out a new management system , but because of the tension among the county , the Sheriff 's Office and County Attorney 's Office , they have been deadlocked .
Kerry Martin , an attorney for the Sheriff 's Office , told the court that the office changed the password because county managers were trying to force the office to agree to a management system they disagree with .
Heilman repeatedly asked Martin why he did not come to the court before the takeover .
Martin answered that the Sheriff 's Office did not need approval and had the authority to take control .
The judge also ordered that no further changes be made to the computer system by anyone during the length of the lawsuit .
Hendershott said the Sheriff 's Office is conducting a criminal investigation into suspected mismanagement of the computer system .
He said the investigation targets Superior Court presiding Judge Barbara Mundell , County Manager Smith and other county personnel .
He did not provide details on the investigation .

The first stage is essentially a four - segment solidrocket booster like those used to launch NASA ?s space shuttles , except with adummy fifth segment on top .
Ares I - Xlaunched on a $ 445 million test flight to aid development of NASA ?s
Ares Irocket , the booster slated to carry astronauts to space after the shuttle fleetis retired .
The rocketprototype blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a briefsix - minute flight .
About two minutes intothe liftoff , the first stage separated from a dummy second stage made up offake segments .
The dummyupper stage crashed into the Atlantic Ocean and sank as planned .
The firststage , however , was expected to deploy three massive parachutes and splash intothe ocean much like NASA ?s shuttle boosters .
One of the giant , 150 - foot ( 46 - meter ) parachutes reportedly deflated as the first stage fell back to Earth , resulting in a harder - than - expected spashdown , according to a CBS News report .
Therecovery team is due to return to the Kennedy Space Center on Friday , NASAofficials said .
Spaceshuttle mission managers said the damage to Ares I - X?s first stage poses noconcern for the twin solid rocket boosters on the shuttle Atlantis , which wascleared for a Nov. 16 launch on Thursday .
The AresI - X booster is heavier than shuttle boosters and carried other modifications anda different parachute system , NASA ?s space operations chief Bill Gerstenmaiertold reporters .
Shuttle solid rocket boosters have only two parachutes , headded .
? It ?s atotally different system than ours , ?
Gerstenmaier said .
?
There ?s been no tie atall between what Ares has got and what we ?ve got .?
Shuttle officials said Ares I - X engineers will get their first up - close look at thedamaged rocket booster Friday once it arrives in Florida .
? Thebooster comes back in tomorrow , ? said shuttle integration manager Mike Moses .
?
Sountil that point , everything is probably speculation .?

Remastered Total Annihilation intro
Thanks to a contribution by TA community member , SnakeInTheMirror , Total Annihilation has seen what may be the first attempt at using neural network AI technology to enhance and upscale some of the venerable and memorable CG video that came with the game .
So , below is the introductory video from Total Annihilation for your viewing pleasure :
Upon clicking above , the enhanced video will play first , and then a split - screen is is employed so that you can compare with the original footage .
The improvement is noteworthy , and it 's definitely worth checking out if you have n't come across it already .

Interview with a Wotan Today I have an interview to share with Wotan , co-founder and leading man of the runaway train known as
What was your entry into the TA community ?
When did you first get the game and what were your initial thoughts about how it was constructed and its playability ?
My brothers and I opened up one of the very first LAN gaming sites in the USA back in 1996 , which we trademarked as the ‘ Matrix ’ , before shutting it all down right before a certain movie came out years later …
Anyway , we got heavily into real - time strategy gaming via Command & Conquer , that first year , when we started reading about this new ‘ 3D ’ game in PC Magazine called Total Annihilation .
With games like Quake and Magic Carpet , 3D was really in vogue as the Next Big Thing back then .
TA looked cool , but at first it did not really seem all the much different than Dark Reign and some of the other next gen RTS titles on the horizon .
That changed in the fall of ’ 97 when we first started up TA though .
We had these " ginormous " 20 ” CRTs ( you could play games on these for an extra $ 2.50 an hour ) running TA at 800x600 .
My first memory of the game is playing on ‘ Rock Alley ’ as Core ( color red , of course ) looking at the massive Goliath tanks pushing northward toward my Arm enemy ( blue , naturally ) .
The depth , both map terrain and the amount of units was jaw dropping .
I ’d be lying if I said that is what hooked me on TA though – the real grab came a bit later when we found we were able to make maps after the release of Total Annihilation : Core Contingency .
The seemingly endless creative potential as much as the playability is what really struck me about TA and it has remained that way ever since .
How did Escalation come about and what were your initial goals for the project ?
The road to Escalation was quite a long and winding one on my side .
I started out making maps and was really into the TAMEC scene early on .
My younger brother introduced me to 3rd party units and I was again smitten with the concept of realizing one ’s own vision for the ideal game .
Like anyone else , I started out patching together different units into a collection to fill out the game .
It was fun , but they were not my units and many others were doing it better , especially Uberhack and Brave Sir Robin .
I really started to cut my teeth into learning about modding with Uberhack along with running a community of like - minded players and would - be modders by participating there .
NJ_Thug was also a huge help and taught me 3D texturing in Rhino .
C_A_P taught me the conversion process for adding Total Annihilation : Kingdoms tilesets and features into TA ( I did the Creon , Zhon , and Aramon conversions that many still use today ) .
I did a lot of small collaborations with Genghis Khan X , Caer , Silencer , Chinahook , VanTheMan , Sinclaire , Immerman , and many others before meeting this guy who was working on a new race called The Talon …
It was not until two years later though , and after working on my own popular mod ( with help from Boogalizer and Warlord ) , that TheRegistered One , The Talon ’s founder - and I realized that we could do something really special for TA .
In a nutshell , merge the production quality standards of TheRegistered One 's brilliant work with the popular concepts and scope presented in my project into the ‘ Ultimate TA Mod ’ - Total Annihilation : Escalation .
For full - res pics and more previews on upcoming releases , check out the TA : Escalation Discord !
What do you envision the end - result of this momentous amount of work , the creation and execution of Total Annihilation : Escalation to be , and has that vision changed over the course of time due to the advancements in scripting and engine knowledge that have occurred over the years ?
Until recently , the end result was really nowhere in sight – just churning out new ideas and concepts in line with all the new hacks and tweaks made available through the hard work of guys like Xon , Zwzsg , xpoy , and Admiral_94 and many others .
Escalation certainly evolved with these new capabilities as we often forged them into unexpected and new units and concepts for the game .
So many fresh ideas bore fruit early on that we soon realized that The Talon would likely have to be mothballed in favor of a more " fleshed - out " Arm and Core .
This resulted in completing a true Level - 3 tier and even larger Tier - 4 units .
Collaborations also continued to help round out the overall game with help from Archdragon , N72 , R1ME , Keeper , Idec , Zodius , MattyWS+ , Nightmare , and others .
Now , years later , the answer is clear at least for me : Wrap up Tier - 3 development , finish the Tier - 4 ‘ mini- tier ’ , and re-introduce The Talon in some form .
Do you hope that Escalation will outlive and outgrow Total Annihilation as a game , in the same way that a project like Zero - K arguably outgrew its origin ?
I ’d say yes being a bit selfish in that regard , and in a way that has already happened .
Over the years we worked with so many talented , but different folks ( both players and creators ) , such that the net effect has become greater than the sum of its parts .
If you go online where TA is still played most ( GameRanger ) , far more people play Escalation than OTA and that has been the case for quite a while now .
Many of the former professional TA player ranks have gravitated toward the mod and have contributed also .
However , Escalation is still " locked " within the TA ecosystem given that its assets are derived conceptually somewhat from TA itself .
Personally , I ’d love to see Escalation go beyond the TA engine , but unless that engine supports the core essence of TA ( Robot War Engine being the best possibility ! ) , it likely wo n’t happen anytime soon .
The best possibility for any TA mod to outgrow the venerable TA engine though really lies with Total Annihilation : Zero in my opinion – it is truly a remarkable and fantastic achievement by Vohvelieläin !
Do you feel that a project like Escalation could be considered a more faithful " spiritual successor " to original Total Annihilation than the new real - time strategy titles that have been labeled as such , outside of the fact that Escalation is built on TA 's engine ?
What , if any and in your opinion , were the key ingredients of Total Annihilation that the " spiritual successor " games missed out on ?
As for all the so called " spiritual successors " , the problem in my mind is that they fail to follow the very basics of what made TA so great !
That starts with the left mouse click functions ( why do all ‘ modern ’ games shy away from this !? ) .
To all Devs out there :
If it is not left - mouse click , it is not TA no matter how it looks , so start here with your next " spiritual successor " .
Next , is the infamous ‘ strategic zoom ’ ( aka Icon Wars ) .
While , in principle , this is a really cool feature in new games , the creators of Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation forgot something very important : the more you zoom out , the less detail you should have on your own and your opponent ’s forces .
Namely not having icons that tell you exactly what type and level the unit is , along with full control of said icons such that zooming back in is unnecessary or even detrimental to winning a completive .
Keep the action where it is – the tactical layer .
Finally , I ’d add the immersive - ness of that close up action as an important factor along with a rich variety of units .
I found SupCom ’s units to be ‘ holographic ’ often lacking mass and feel , made worse by the very soft weapon and explosion sounds .
Planetary Annihilation was hamstrung by round planets ( kudos for trying something different , but … ) , a single race , and the strangely unnatural , natural " flow field " pathing mechanics .
Ashes Of The Singularity suffered from a lack of essential unit basics like mechs and tanks and also stealing our color schema and name in their sequel !
For full - res pics and more previews on upcoming releases , check out the TA : Escalation Discord !
What work remains in order for you to consider Escalation to be a finished product , and do you imagine that there will be new territory to explore once main production has ceased ?
Aside from the goals mentioned earlier ( wrap up T3 development , finish the T4 ‘ mini- tier ’ , and re-introduce The Talon in some form ) , it will be great to finally have a polished installer ( KmKickle and Draken have started ) , a finished AI ( TaFan97 & Fortitude are on this ) , and cleaned up Windows 10 support ( Thaldren 's Project Valkyrie ) .
As for the Escalation community and our future , FN202 has our growing player base in great hands with the Total Annihilation Demo Archive and the new competitive gameplay ladder - with a ' locked ' in Total Annihilation : Escalation , we 're poised for an even richer asset of games and hopefully some big tournaments again !
I would really like to sit back and enjoy the game as a player for once while taking on less demanding projects like revisiting the possibility of Escalation based missions ( hopefully with Warlord ) and sunset things with getting back to where it all began – map making .
I think there is still untapped potential with maps and tilesets in TA - both making larger maps playable online and in creating some awe - inspiring masterpieces .
I am actually surprised that this has not happened already on a larger scale given the tools out there .
MattyWS + has started some incredible work here , but there are still many new worlds yet be explored .
Today I have an interview to share with , co-founder and leading man of the runaway train known as Total Annihilation : Escalation .
Without further ado .. What was your entry into the TA community ?
When did you first get the game and what were your initial thoughts about how it was constructed and its playability ?
How didcome about and what were your initial goals for the project ?

TA Zero Alpha 4d
Here is a little Christmas present for you !
Version Alpha 4d of Total Annihilation Zero !
Unlike the previous releases , Alpha 4d does not expand the game with new units , but rather focuses on finalizing the current content and fixing old mistakes .
Most notably , this includes a complete overhaul of all weapon sound effects , new water and lava splash animations , reworking parts of oldest unit models , and over 200 balance adjustments .
The main theme of these balance changes is trying to slightly shift focus away from the heaviest units of each tier , and allowing players to field tier 2 light units a little bit faster , without changing the overall cost of getting a single tier 2 heavy hitter by much .
Another sweeping change then is that weapon ranges of most units have been reduced , primarily to fit them within sight ranges .
In addition to the usual mod content , ddraw fix version 10 ( made by ajh2794 ) is included in the Alpha 4d download in a separate folder .
While it is still work - in - progress , it should result in increased frame rates for all users , and should allow people who have previously needed to use the hotfix to play without any issues .
The old hotfix is still included as a backup option .

Chris Taylor Announces New Game During the
" His new company , Kanoogi , shares its name with a new cloud - based gaming platform that Taylor has developed himself . "
A bit about the new game from the article ;
" Intergalactic Space Empire is a real - time strategy game , and can be played on any online - capable device that can run a modern web browser .
It s built in C++ , running on a cloud - based virtual machine , and is a deliberate throwback to an earlier era of video games , featuring 2D graphics , a single map , and a top - down environment .
Notably , its graphics are rendered locally on the players device , as opposed to the Google Stadia approach of doing all the work in the cloud and sending it to the player as a video feed .
However , the game itself runs in the cloud , and takes up no space on the local device being used to play it .
According to Taylor , the player will never have to install or update Intergalactic Space Empire ; it s meant for fast - paced , drop - in , drop - out play . "
So there you have it .
Not TA2 ( although no one expected that ) but it's a much need interesting and fresh take on the RTS genre .

TA Zero Map Pack 1c
New version of Total Annihilation Zero Map Pack is finally here !
Long time in the making , Version 1c adds several new maps to the pack , remakes two of the oldest maps , and overhauls the rest .
These maps make use of a wide variety of new map features , including lava eruptions and other animated pieces , and exotic crystal formations that can be reclaimed several times .
Several mistakes on the oldest maps have been fixed , and some purely visual map features have been adjusted so that wreckage will not magically disappear when units are destroyed on top of them .

Every sperm and every egg , fertilized or not , is a living , breathing person , endowed by its Creator with certain inalienable rights .
At least , that ’s what the proposed 2010 personhood amendment to the Colorado state constitution implies .
No , it does n’t say that literally , but thanks to the vague wording of the amendment , that ’s one possible interpretation .
It ’s also clear from an article in The Colorado Independent that this is only half of what the amendment ’s authors intended .
“ It ’s intended to account for human beings who may be created through asexual reproduction in laboratories and used as raw material for research , organs , or stem cells .
Fertilization would not have properly applied to asexually reproduced humans , but even asexually reproduced human beings have a definite biological beginning , ” [ Gualberto Garcia ] Jones explained .
( Jones heads the organization that initiated this year ’s amendment )
That this law could be interpreted to include sperm is an ironic example of the law of unintended consequences .
The amendment ’s final language , on which Colorado will vote in November 2010 , is as follows :
SECTION 1 . Article II of the constitution of the state of Colorado is amended BY THE ADDITION OF A NEW SECTION to read :
SECTION 2 . Person defined .
As used in sections 3 , 6 , and 25 of Article II of the state constitution , the term “ person ” shall apply to every human being from the beginning of the biological development of that human being .
So what does “ biological development ” mean ?
Last year ’s amendment defined a person as starting with a fertilized egg ( and it lost by a 3:1 margin ) , and the new amendment could be interpreted to mean the same – a zygote is a person .
But this time , the amendment ’s language is even broader .
The Independent article makes it clear that this was intentional on the part of the amendment ’s authors .
The language was written specifically to “ to be more comprehensive in our definition of a person , ” and the result is that , if passed , the amendment will outlaw abortion , many types of birth control , stem cell research , and could potentially outlaw fertility clinics .
“ Beginning of the biological development . ”
That phrase may be perfectly clear to a conservative Christian abortion activist like Jones , lawyers and judges will have a more difficult time interpreting what it does to Colorado ’s laws .
Last year , our own Dr. Slammy and commenters pointed out a number of the absurdities that went along with last year ’s failed amendment , such as allowing a pregnant woman to drive in the HOV lane , the legal drinking age becomes 20 years , 3 months , sex with a pregnant woman becomes menage - a- trois , a woman who is not aware that she is pregnant while engaging in a harmful activity of any kind could be charged with neglect , and so on .
The new proposed amendment is even broader in its possible interpretation because a single cell – an egg – would be defined as a “ person ” this time .
And as a result , the possible ramifications are even more farcical .
The problem is that it ’s really hard to define when a “ person ’s ” biological development starts .
You could say that it starts when an egg is fertilized and be relatively safe ( if it passes in 2010 and survives the inevitable legal challenges , that ’s probably how this amendment would ultimately be interpreted ) .
But it ’s possible that the amendment would be interpreted more broadly .
After all , that egg started its development years or decades before it was fertilized .
If the egg is damaged , then the “ person ’s ” development will be adversely affected .
And damaged eggs happen all the time – they ’re one of reasons for miscarriages and failures to conceive .
Does that mean that we need to protect a woman ’s children when they ’re eggs in a girl toddler ’s immature ovaries ?
And how , exactly , are we going to do that ?
Are we willing to charge prepubescent girls with child neglect for daring to play soccer and risking ovary damage ?
What ’s next , forcing women to wear petticoats and ride horses sidesaddle ?
Actually , I suspect that many of Jones ’ supporters would find cultural regression to Victorian or Puritan values to be pleasantly refreshing .
And since a human ca n’t develop without the aid of sperm ( cloning aside ) , does development start when intercourse and ejaculation provide the sperm ?
Or does it start in the man ’s testicles ?
Or even before then ?
Damaged sperm are a lot more common than damage eggs – that ’s the biological reason that men produce billions of them .
Is each damaged sperm an example of child neglect ?
Should we charge a little league coach with manslaughter if he accidentally throws a baseball into a boy ’s crotch with an errant pitch ?
And should urologists be prosecuted for accessory to murder for performing a vasectomy ?
The zygote personhood amendment last year crashed and burned because Coloradans understood that it was a legal minefield of epic scale .
This proposed personhood amendment is even worse .
Any legislation that makes a minimum of 20,000 separate changes to Colorado law is going to have a huge number of unpredictable unintended consequences .
One of those unintended consequences will be that Colorado will become more of a laughingstock than it was during the Amendment 2 debacle decades ago , or than Kansas was after its school board voted to permit the teaching of “ intelligent design . ”
It will be in the voters ’ hands in 2010 .
Hopefully they ’ll make the right decision next year just as they did last year .

UPDATES THE END OF ‘ OPRAH ’ : Daytime Diva Giving Up Syndie Talk Show
EXCLUSIVE : This morning I have more information behind the scenes and about the future of the daytime diva ’s decision to end her syndicated The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2011 .
( I was first to report this back on November 5th , and she ’ll announce the news on her show today — her last live show of the calendar year . )
Yesterday , Oprah called the two Hollywood moguls who needed to know .
First , her close friend Disney CEO Bob Iger whose owned - and - operated ABC affiliates long have made up Oprah ‘s core station group .
And then CBS Inc chairman Les Moonves whom she reached Thursday night ( NY time ) .
“ I just announced it to my team and I feel great about it , ” sources tell me Winfrey said to Moonves .
“ So you ’re going to do the show on Discovery ? ” he asked .
“ No , ” Oprah assured him .
“ I ’m not bringing The Oprah Winfrey Show to cable .
I ’ll do something else with that channel . ”
So what is that “ something else ” ?
Besides overseeing programming , my sources say that , instead of a carbon copy of her longtime daytime talker , she ’s now privately talking about hosting a show “ that ’s smaller and different ” on the Discovery Communications start - up OWN , aka the Oprah Winfrey Network , which boss David Zaslav decreed two years ago would replace the Discovery Health Channel and reach into 70 million homes .
That show wo n’t be based in Chicago : it will move to Los Angeles where the OWN headquarters is based , according to my sources who also say she wants to divest her real estate in Chicago “ as soon as possible ” .
[ 5 AM UPDATE : I ’m receiving no definitive word on what happens to her Chicago - based company Harpo . ]
She explained to insiders , “ Why would anybody stay in Chicago ?
It ’s freezing here , and I have a mansion in Montecito that I have n’t been able to enjoy . ”
Another reason she has n’t is taxes .
My sources say Oprah and her people have long limited the time she spends in Montecito so she does n’t exceed the number of days mandating her to pay exorbitant taxes as a California resident .
Oprah was supposed to reveal whether or not she ’d continue The Oprah Winfrey Show to Moonves in early October .
Instead , she kept telling CBS , which syndicates Oprah under a deal re-signed in 2004 with King World which is now part of CBS Television Distribution , that she had n’t decided anything yet and would make a decision “ very shortly ” .
And Moonves never really believed she ’d quit a pulpit that gave her such a huge amount of influence , and a pulpit with such a hefty paycheck .
He thought a 1 - or 2 - year extension was possible and probable .
Oprah and Moonves had a number of conversations that kept CBS dangling .
“ Look , if I do it , it ’s with you guys . ”
That news appeared to knock Sony out of the box even though its television syndication arm had been courting her hard in the hope of handling any extension of her daytime talker .
Sony had successfully launched this season Dr Oz , Harpo ’s latest daytime talk show star .
And Sony had just announced it would syndicate the next star from Oprah ’s stable , interior designer Nate Berkus .
But my information is that Winfrey never truly negotiated with CBS .
Moonves had scheduled a face - to - face with Oprah and her personal and professional posse at her Montecito compound in October to discuss her future plans .
But then her bodyguard passed away .
So the meeting was canceled .
Moonves offered to drive up to Montecito another time to see her .
My sources explain the daytime diva told the CBS boss : “ I love you .
You ’re a great salesman .
But what are you going to say to me to make me want to do the show ?
Do n’t bother spending 2 hours to drive up here . ”
“ Les Moonves , Bob Iger , and Sony will flip out .
The only winner is David Zaslav , ” one of my insiders warned me back in early November 5th if Oprah canceled her syndicated show and focused only on OWN , which the Discovery Communications boss had been begging her to do before the end of 2011 , to the point of giving her an ultimatum that she ’d lose her channel altogether .
CBS again is reiterating that , because its deal with Oprah from a few years ago called for an increasingly lower distribution fee , “ it ’s so low it does n’t hurt us , ” an insider told me last night .
“ Les is n’t happy this happened .
But it doesnt hit us until 2012 . ”
Still , the news could hurt CBS ’ stock price today .
I know Moonves was surprised by my scoop on November 5th that Winfrey had already made a decision to stop her syndication show when the contract expires .
My reporting back then showed Oprah ’s decision was so definitive that she and her advisers were already trying to figure out what to do with her mini-city in Chicago , and which personnel she can and will move out to LA in the next six months .
In late October , Oprah called a confab in Los Angeles and met with everyone associated with OWN .
She also personally heard programming pitches .
Yesterday , late in the afternoon ( Chicago time ) , Winfrey told her Oprah staff of her decision .
Harpo Inc president Tim Bennett also sent out a missive to her show ’s business partners informing them that the daytime diva would announce the end of The Oprah Winfrey Show on air today .
Word began to spread , and TV affiliates began to report the news on local newscasts as the mainstream and Hollywood press got wind of the coming announcement .
Naturally , Oprah wanted to the biggest audience possible for her live swan song .
After all , it is November sweeps .
And no doubt she ’ll keep the tension mounting in a countdown to her last show on September 9th , 2011 .
Leaving the extraordinary visibility she enjoyed through syndication is a huge gamble for Oprah as a TV brand .
Oprah is viewed by an estimated 7 million people a day ( though that audience has fallen by half over the past 10 years ) and in 140 countries .
It has been estimated that she currently earns about $ 275 million a year in showbiz income .
Long the No. 1 rated daytime talk show , Oprah also made Winfrey into the richest African American woman worth $ 2.3B at last count , a worldwide media personality with a powerful media empire around her , a celebrated actress who doubled as a film and television producer , a force in both book and magazine publishing .
But there ’s also no question that Oprah is a much more controversial figure now than she ’s ever been before because of her very public wealth and fame and politics and beliefs .
For many years she was enjoying high ratings and fat cash license fees from TV stations and big popularity .
But her ratings have been in double - digit decline in recent years .
And given the financial crisis which has put TV stations on life support because of the plunge in advertising , Oprah was unlikely to be able to demand another big cash raise to continue her show in syndication — especially in today ’s climate when stations are bartering with syndicators , not paying them .
“ It had the potential to bankrupt stations .
She would have wanted all cash up front .
GMs would have told her to go away , ” one source explains to me .
When Oprah leaves syndication , it will open up time slots and free up station cash not just for existing daytime talk show stars but also new ones .

A pregnant Scottish woman who had to be flown to Sweden for life - saving treatment for swine flu has spoken for the first time of her ordeal .
Sharon Pentleton told the BBC's Panorama that she was " terrified " after she woke up in a foreign hospital hooked up to a ventilator .
She had to be put on a lung bypass machine to allow her lungs a chance to recover from the illness .
At the time of the outbreak in July , no machines were available in UK .
" I was terrified , I did not realise where I was or anything so , and they were talking strange , " she told the BBC .
" I was hooked up to all sorts of machines , I do n't know ... I had a ventilator . "
No beds Ms Pentleton , of North Ayrshire , was six months pregnant when she originally went to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock with severe back pain .
She was initially treated for appendicitis before the diagnosis of swine flu .
After her condition rapidly deteriorated and she slipped into a coma , doctors decided she required the bypass procedure known as extra corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) .
HOW AN ECMO MACHINE WORKS 1 .
Blood is drained out of the body through a vein into the ECMO machine , which removes carbon dioxide and adds oxygen allowing the heart and lungs to rest
2 . Blood is warmed before being returned to the heart - flow of blood out of the body is steadily reduced as patient recovers
The machine takes over the lung function and adds oxygen to the blood , allowing the lungs to recover and medication to treat infection to take hold .
There are only five dedicated adult ECMO beds in Britain , located at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and none was available when she was struck down .
In Stockholm , she spent almost two weeks hooked up to the machine and had to have a tracheotomy to aid her breathing .
" It was really , really horrible , that 's the only way I can describe it and then I had all these tubes , could n't breathe on my own , " she said , adding that the true threat to her life only hit her once she was flown home in mid-August and later released from hospital .
" I think it really only sank in when I come home ... when I entered the house , that 's when I realised exactly what had happened . "
' Wee miracle ' Despite making a full recovery , Ms Pentleton said she was still fearful of the illness , especially given how sick she became despite not having any previous health issues .
Read Fergus on Flu blog " I 'm still quite scared , I do n't like to think about it .
I realise how close I was to not being here so I still kind of worry about it .
And every slight , like wee sniffle or something I 'm really panicking . "
Ms Pentleton , who is already the mother of a two - year - old daughter , said she still suffered from shortness of breath and worried about giving birth next month .
She also fears for her unborn son .
" They 've told me he 's still active and he 's still growing fine .
They told me nothing to worry about with him , because I was worrying about brain damage because everything that I 've been through and the medication I 've been on .
" But they say there 's just a slight chance , they can't tell you 100 % but they say its very unlikely that he 's been damaged in any way - which is a wee miracle . "
Ms Pentleton and her family had words of praise for the medical teams both in Scotland and Sweden who cared for her .
They have launched a fundraising campaign to help raise the money for Scotland to buy and run its own dedicated adult ECMO unit .

Convicted pedophile Dennis Ferguson has been ordered to leave an inner Sydney swimming pool , packed with children attending an open day .
A member of the public contacted the pool 's management after spotting Mr Ferguson going into the changeroom of the complex on Sunday , Network Seven reported .
Hundreds of people , including many children , were attending an open day at the pool at the time .
Police were contacted and officers approached Mr Ferguson , who completed a 14 - year sentence for sexually assaulting three children aged six , seven and eight in a Brisbane motel in 1987 .
Network Seven said there was no suggestion by police or any member of the public that Mr Ferguson was doing anything wrong when he was asked to leave .
In four decades and thousands of transactions with my fellow man I 've neither initiated nor accepted force as a means to accomplish anything .
And yet , I 've decided to become more skilled in the use of a gun to keep force , violence , crime and tyranny out of my life where they belong .
Even with a perfect record of non-violence my intuition tells me I 've got some gun work to do — to keep it that way .
And like car insurance , wearing a seatbelt or taking vitamins the most it will do is keep things the same , because :
Investments in self - defense return a maximum of keeping what you already have .
Most of the efforts of arming myself have been spiritual and intellectual .
In fact , I 've put 1000 times more effort into avoiding violence than on fighting skills .
That seems low but 1000 - to - 1 is probably normal .
My job does n't involve teaching karate or any kind of self - defense training .
This article is about increasing the " 1 " side of this ratio to " 2 " and I 'll give 76 reasons for doing so .
A Few Words on the 1000
Preferred areas of focus for optimal living are : Values , Goals , Strength , Talent , Education , God , Health , Family , Prayer , Money , Intuition , Liberty , Barter , etc .
Any plan that emphasizes a gun instead of these is doomed from the start .
I 'm adding gun skills on top of the cornerstones for optimal living .
Most countries do n't have this luxury , even in 2009 .
They have to use sticks and clubs and will be in trouble with the state for using even these .
Of course , their predators will be using all the latest weaponry without a care in the world of legal consequences .
That 's just how governments and criminals roll everywhere in the world except Switzerland and parts of the U.S .
Luckily for me , the valiant work of my ancestors guarantees me a right they did n't have :
To use a gun to protect my family .
The stabilizing peace that follows in the wake of private gun ownership enables my family to continue focusing almost completely on the ideals of a purposeful life .
Spiritual Without Physical Is NOT Holistic
No author can write about only spiritual avoidance of violence and claim to be holistic .
And nobody on this planet can claim the moral high ground on a guy with a revolver under his bed to protect his family .
Authors like Deepok Chopra and Wayne Dyer talk about removing violence from our thoughts .
And they 're right !
No doubt this thought removal is key to the success of avoidance .
But , their advice is not Holistic :
It does n't integrate the physical with the spiritual and mental aspects of the subject .
These authors write about spiritual avoidance of violence within a context of safety provided by others .
It could be police , local security or guards hired for large events .
It ’s more likely to be you or one of their neighbors that truly protects them because :
Living With Glocks : Th ... Boatman , Robert H. Best Price : $ 19.91 Buy New $ 93.08 ( as of 03:35 EST - Details )
" Even though most people do not carry guns , the mere possibility that an intended victim could be armed with a handgun eliminates millions of crimes every year " ( Living with Glocks by Robert H. Boatman ) .
Although eliminating violence from our lives begins with our own thoughts , the complete chain of preparation must contain a physical deterrent to force .
It ’s not a failure of the spirituality of the victim to get mugged .
It ’s a lack of holistic preparation .
There must be physical resistance to force to supplement the spiritual .
Something lacking in physical protection enabled Gandhi to be shot and killed while having his nightly public walk .
And the Dalai Lama makes a reasonable and non-violent statement when he says , " If someone has a gun and is trying to kill you , it would be reasonable to shoot back with your own gun . "
( Seattle Times , May 15 , 2001 ) .
In Luke 22:36 Jesus " . . . said to them , " But now , whoever has a money belt is to take it along , likewise also a bag , and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one .
. . . "
None of these men advocate violence .
The most they speak about is defense in a situation where violence is thrust against them .
Why Now ?
Why Bother ?
Reason # 73 , The Bureau of Justice 's national average says I have a 1 - in - 4 chance of being a victim of violent crime in my lifetime .
If living in a major population center that increases to a 1 - in - 9 chance , annually .
That 's on the high side for me , going it alone .
But , it 's too high for my family .
What happens to this already high risk when you factor in our current economic meltdown ?
( Reason # 18 ) , double - digit unemployment rate ?
police budget cuts ?
( Reason # 16 ) .
Have these factors been causing more home invasion robberies ?
( Reason # 10 ) .
The latest one in Pensacola was pulled off by a band of para - military thugs .
They practiced up on invasion techniques and are connected with other home invasions in Florida and other states .
These five reasons were enough to spur the question :
What happens if someone less spiritual or desperate brings violence into our lives ?
Things to Try Before a Gun
After reading the book Dial 911 and Die I would n't bet my families lives on police protection .
The police only document crime .
They have no legal responsibility to prevent it ( Reason # 22 ) .

Worst - case scenario , I agree with Boston T. Party that many tools & tactics should be used before a gun :
Avoidance Guile & Wit Verbal warnings & Profanity Sly escape Pepper spray Baton Hand - to - hand combat
Realistically , most should use their remaining strength to flee after step # 5 , above .
If that 's not possible , Gary Kleck says in Reason # 11 , that " Those who resist violent attack with a gun are injured less than half the time of those who offer no resistance .
Even then , those Defenders actually fired their gun in fewer than one out of four cases .
Effort Ratio Becomes 500 - to -
1
My avoidance to fighting skills ratio will be moving to 500 - to - 1 .
Actually , most of my gun efforts fall into the avoid side of the equation since the mere presence of a gun prevents violence most of the time .
However , I 'll have to learn how to use it which adds a solid fighting skill making the new ratio more like 500 - to - 1 .
Gun Insurance Is Not Free
You do n't need car insurance without a car .
And , you do n't need gun insurance without a life .
Only the owner can decide if they have something worth protecting .
And only the owner can decide what insurance is best .
There 's cost and hassle to bringing more tools into my life , especially ones that need to be kept nearby to be useful .
Every tool requires research , purchase , maintenance , storage , training , etc .
I expect to need a gun less often than a hammer , but , borrowing a gun is not an option .
Taking precautions is always harder than doing nothing .
If I accept the risk I can still skip the whole gun thing .
We 're talking statistical risk , here .
Nobody can actually prove something will happen if I take no precautions at all .
Bottom line :
You do n't have to do anything and nobody can prove you 're wrong .
Proof is only possible at the end of your life looking backward .
And , unlike car insurance the state will never make gun insurance mandatory .
They 're too busy trying to disarm the public under the guise of making us safer .
Gun Control Is Victim Disarmament
If I put a sign in my front yard that says " Gun- Free Zone " then according to gun control folks my house will be safest house on the block .
Nonsense .
Criminals ignore the law .
That 's how they got to be criminals .
The only people who abide by " Gun Control " are law abiding victims .
That 's why every place with " Gun Control " becomes a " Victim Disarmament Zone . "
All studies show a dramatic decrease in violent crime when more private citizens are permitted to defend themselves ( Switzerland , all concealed carry states ) .
Conversely , violent crime rises in direct proportion with the number of gun-control laws ( Reason # 37 ) as seen in England , Australia , and all states where 2nd amendment rights are denied like California , New York , Illinois , etc .
There was an uproar when a man in New Hampshire was seen with a revolver on his hip near where Obama was speaking .
What the media did not report is that Obama is surrounded with guns everywhere he goes .
The MSM message is : Guns are safe when the police have them , but they 're not safe when you have them .
I did n't need a permit , registration , fingerprinting , background check or state exam to exercise my 1st amendment right to write this article .
Why do I need them to exercise my 2nd amendment rights ?
Pure nonsense .
Having a Gun Is Its Own Best Use
Unlike most tools , the primary use of a gun is to prevent itself from having to be used , at all .
In fact , guns are in full use while they 're not being fired .
Infrequent use proves , rather than disproves , their necessity .
If you think only tools that are used frequently are necessary then stop wearing your seat belt , cancel your home , car and health insurance and put a sign on your front lawn announcing you live in a gun- free house !
After much thought on the subject I 've come to the conclusion that the simple act of having a gun is its own best use ( Reason # 1 ) .
Like a battleship parked off the coast its mere presence changes the dynamic of the situation without having to fire a single shot .
By " dynamic " I mean that predators tend to behave themselves and move on to an easier " unarmed " prey .
By having a gun you become too dangerous to your predators .
Criminals interviewed in jail say they do n't want anything to do with an armed civilian .
That change in my human predators is exactly what I want to accomplish .
At best , guns keep honest and polite people honest and polite .
Kind of like the masterlock I use on my gym locker .
It 's never been touched , except by me , and yet it is used fully every time I work out .

" The Bureau of Justice 's national average states that I have a 1 - in - 4 chance of being a victim of violent crime in my lifetime .

A free person 's right to defend his or her life is a very personal right , a " fundamental right " — pre-existing our U.S. Constitution — which is more important than our property , our ability to speak - out on political issues , our right to vote , or our rights to a Miranda warning when approached by a police officer .
Throughout history this has always been true among free people . "
" During the years American Colonists were bickering with Great Britain over taxes , representation , and rights ; the one thing that finally provoked a shooting - war with their mother - country was Britain 's use of armed soldiers to disarm free citizens .
The Founders were well - read on history and the classics , and well - acquainted with what England did to it's " subjects " in Ireland ; first disarming them , taking over all their lands and resources by force of British arms , and consigning the Irish to virtual serfdom or slavery .
The most loyal of America 's Founders knew that government 's disarming of its free - citizens was the first step to slavery .
" Slavery " was the word they used .
History has confirmed this basic truth countless times in countless countries over the succeeding 200 years .
Free , law - abiding citizens do not give up their right to arms . "

After the Deadline , Language Checking Software Used by WordPress , Now Open Source
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 26 , 2009
If your blogging platform of choice is WordPress , then you 've no doubt noticed recent improvements to the way it catches spelling , style , and grammatical errors .
That 's thanks to acquisition of After the Deadline , a language checking software package designed for WordPress and TinyMCE .
The plugin's creator , Raphael Mudge , announced today that he has released the source code for After the Deadline ( AtD ) under the GNU General Public License .
" We ’re also announcing a jQuery API for After the Deadline .
Now you can add an AtD check to a DIV or TEXTAREA with little effort , " writes Mudge .
This is the same API that powers the Intense Debate plugin I wrote about recently .
The source code and resources are housed here , along with documentation to help you get started .
To learn more about how the service works , be sure to check out the demo and try it for yourself .
Mudge told me he 's anxious to see how open source projects and Web apps use the code .
" I 'd like to see AtD spread as far and wide as possible .
I 'm an inventor first and have this desire to see my inventions help people .
Wikipedia is one project where I think AtD could help empower their contributors to do more .
Part of the fun of a project like this is having no idea how far it could go .
I really look forward to seeing what people do with it . "
Johnson Sprints to Historic Fourth Straight NASCAR
Title
Jimmie Johnson needed only to place 25th to gain his fourth straight NASCAR Sprint Cup Series title , but was not content with that and instead opted to win history records in style .
He finished 5th place behind Denny Hamlin and shouted “ How ’ bout some history ? ” as he crossed the finish line .
He was still ranked at 23rd position by Lap 121 out 267 .
He started climbing the list with 65 laps still remaining in the race .
He placed 5th with 11 laps still remaining .
He wanted to race out the leader but he was told by his crew chief Chad Knaus not to and to remain cruising nice and smoothly .
He now alone holds the record of most number of consecutive wins after breaking the three straight wins a piece with Cale Yarborough .
This season covered 36 races over 10 months .
2009 Raybestos Rookie of the Year awardee Joey Logano became the youngest driver to claim the honor after winning 26 out of 35 races in the freshman class .
[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
Emphysema and cystic fibrosis patients who need new lungs are faced with a life - threatening problem : more than 80 percent of donated lungs ca n’t be used — they ’re inflamed and barely functional .
But a new approach , detailed this week in the new journal Science Translational Medicine , describes a novel gene therapy that can repair these damaged lungs — and make them available for transplant .
Researchers first developed a system for preserving the lungs .
They put the organs in a glass chamber and kept them functioning and at human body temperature .
This technique proved better than freezing .
Then they inserted into the lungs a gene IL - 10 .
The gene plays a key role in inhibiting the immune response .
About six hours after injection , the cells start producing proteins that combat the damaging inflammation .
The presence of the IL - 10 gene may also lower the chances that the recipient of the lung will reject the transplanted organ .
After the gene therapy , treated lungs showed improved blood flow and were significantly better at taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide .
The technique could double the number of lungs available for transplant , truly making patients breathe easier .

( Not so ) risky business : How Tom Cruise 's impressive - looking stunts are made easier than they seem
Clinging on for dear life , Tom Cruise desperately holds on to a car bonnet as Cameron Diaz drives it down the street at breakneck speed ... at least that 's what the director wants you to think .
But this is a stunt sequence from their action - comedy Wichita , where nothing is quite what it seems .
Get off my car : Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise film an action sequence in Wichita but it's not quite this simple
Look below at our more loosely cropped picture and you will see the bigger picture .
Although Ms Diaz is behind the wheel of the black Cadillac , this is just a dummy car covering the actual low - lying vehicle .
Peering out underneath
Tom 's flailing legs is the real stunt driver wearing a crash helmet and all around them are lights , cameras and a host of gadgets and film tools .
Cruise and Diaz perform a scene from their new film Wichita .
But look closer under Tom 's legs and you will see the actual stunt driver who is controlling the vehicle as it swerves
Intrigued , MailOnline asked stunt co-ordinator and performer Steve Truglia , who designs and arranges shots for movies , TV shows and commercials , to cast an expert eye over our pictures from the Cruise / Diaz set in Boston .
He pinpointed the uses of each piece of equipment and the information he passed on is fascinating - not just to film geeks .
' The very reason for this elaborate set - up is to make it look real , ' said Mr Truglia .
' A lot more movement can be captured using this technique . '
Traditionally in car chase scenes , the car is placed on the back of a low loader trailer .
In this case a specially designed low loader has been set up with a dummy car at the front , allowing a stunt driver to control the vehicle from underneath .
' The advantage of this method is that cameras can be placed in a variety of angles showing the artist on the bonnet , the artist driver and the background moving past in a realistic manner as the whole mechanism drives down the road , ' Mr Truglia said .
' It looks like the stunt driver is providing sideways swerving by driving the wheels which are on the road behind the low loader .
This allows shots of the car apparently skidding all over the road . '
Although making up just seconds of footage , the expensive stunt scenes can take weeks to prepare and film .
' In most cases , storyboards are drawn up so that everybody knows exactly what the director wants to see , ' the British stunt co-ordinator said .
' Then the stunt co-ordinator offers safe solutions to the director .
Given the budget , we can achieve almost anything visually without hurting anyone .
Tom Cruise prepares to stand up next to a dog co-star as his car in driven by a stunt driver behind a film truck ... ...
Look closer and you 'll see the dog has been replaced by a puppet as Tom Cruise clambers over the top of the moving vehicle .
He is supported by wires at the back .
' Where the action is potentially dangerous for the artist , we use stunt performers to test the limits of what 's safe .
In this case a stunt double would have ridden the rig to determine the likelihood of the artist falling off the bonnet .
' A location manager will oversee the pre-arranged use of the public highway , often with police blocking roads off .
Medics will be on standby in case of an accident . '
Only then can the cameras start to roll for real .
The action can be shot anything from one to dozens of time , depending on lighting issues , dialogues glitches and background noise .
The low loader would travel up to 60 mph in a straight line or 30 mph during swerves , according to expert stunt co-ordinator Steve Truglia
Although it looks risky , Tom Cruise has very little chance of falling off the car .
He would be secured to the vehicle by wires and a harness , which is digitally removed in post production .
' For this kind of shot I would probably set a maximum of 30 mph with swerving and up to 60 driving in a straight line on a completely locked off road , ' Mr Truglia said .
' I would insist on safety wires .
I notice that in one picture the bonnet seems to have some stuck on grippy patches to reduce Tom 's sideways movement . '
A lot of clever editing follows with cuts between close - ups showing the artists , wider shots of an actual car with stunt doubles on the bonnet and the action in the context of the street .
' It is usually very expensive to create stunt shots , ' Mr Truglia said .
' You have the specialist building of dummy cars , special effects people , stunt people , and the extra time taken to do something like this whilst keeping everybody safe .
' It is a huge team effort to make a great movie and everyone plays their part . '
Steve Truglia specialises in designing and arranging stunt action sequences on any scale .

But whoever said Tom does n't take risks ...
Far from shirking danger duties , Tom Cruise has had his fair share of on - set thrills .
In Mission : Impossible II , for example , he insisted on doing his own stunts on motorbikes and cars - and one memorable ' knife - on - eyeball ' sequence .
The scene involved a fight between him ( as Ethan Hunt ) and the villain Sean Ambrose , played by Dougray Scott .
Watch out :
That 's Cruise 's actual eye very near a real knife
Do n't look now : Sean Ambrose ( Dougray Scott ) ( L ) tussles with Ethan Hunt ( Tom Cruise ) ( R )
Cruise insisted that a real knife be used - and that it stop precisely one quarter of an inch from his eyeball , against the wishes of director John Woo .
The weapon itself was connected to a wire that was carefully measured to achieve the effect .
Soixante mille caméras installées dans les rues de France d'ici à 2011 , dont un millier à Paris , contre un parc global de 20 000 actuellement ; 28 millions d'euros consacrés au développement des projets .
La vidéosurveillance est devenue l'un des maillons essentiels de la politique de sécurité du gouvernement .
Brice Hortefeux , qui a présenté , jeudi 12 novembre , les orientations de sa politique , l'a rappelé .
Le ministre de l'intérieur , comme avant lui Michèle Alliot - Marie , a plusieurs fois annoncé le " triplement " du parc de caméras .
Présentant , le 2 octobre , le plan national de prévention de la délinquance , le premier ministre , François Fillon , a qualifié la " vidéoprotection " de " priorité absolue " et a annoncé que le dispositif serait étendu à d'autres sites que la voie publique ( parties communes des habitations , transports , commerce ) .
Soixante - quinze nouvelles villes devraient être équipées dans les mois qui viennent .
Le partenariat avec le secteur privé va être étendu .
En 2009 , le Fonds interministériel de prévention de la délinquance ( FIPD ) a prévu d'y consacrer une enveloppe de 28 millions d'euros sur un budget total de 37 millions .
Le gouvernement parle de " vidéoprotection " , un terme jugé moins agressif que celui de vidéosurveillance , mais la bataille n'est pas que sémantique .
RAPPORT CONTRE RAPPORT
En face , l'opposition grandit face à une politique jugée liberticide .
Le collectif Démocratie et libertés , créé contre le plan de 1 226 caméras à Paris , a déjà réuni plus de 8 000 signatures .
Un autre collectif , Souriez , vous êtes filmés , constitué depuis 1995 , organise régulièrement des débats sur le sujet .
Dans les conseils municipaux , les discussions sont animées et dépassent parfois le simple clivage gauche - droite .
Evoquant les questions de sécurité lors d'un déjeuner avec des élus de la majorité , le 15 septembre , Nicolas Sarkozy avait déclaré , selon l'un des participants , que le gouvernement trouverait les moyens de développer la vidéosurveillance " par- dessus la tête " des maires réticents …
A Bondy , en Seine - Saint - Denis , le maire PS , Gilbert Roger , a ouvert le débat au sein de son conseil municipal , un an avant l'installation des premières caméras .
Partisans et opposants s'affrontent aussi sur le terrain de l'efficacité de la vidéosurveillance .
Dans un rapport commandé par le ministère de l'intérieur et rendu public en juillet , un inspecteur de l'administration , un responsable de la hiérarchie policière et un colonel de gendarmerie concluaient à une baisse de la délinquance plus forte , en moyenne , dans les communes équipées de vidéoprotection que dans celles qui ne le sont pas .
A partir d'un échantillon composé de 53 communes en zone police ( 2 591 caméras ) , et 63 brigades de gendarmerie ( 1 257 caméras ) , ce rapport niait tout effet " plumeau " , soit un effet de déplacement de la délinquance vers des zones non surveillées .
Toutefois , ses auteurs relevaient qu'il fallait une " forte densité " de caméras installées , et une localisation bien pensée , pour que ces dispositifs permettent l'interpellation de délinquants sur la voie publique .
" Bien qu'ils apportent une aide indiscutable ( … ) leur impact sur le taux global d'élucidation reste encore modéré " , avançaient - ils prudemment .
En dessous d'une caméra pour 2 000 habitants , " les agressions progressent même plus que dans les villes qui n'ont aucun équipement " …
Sous le titre " Un rapport qui ne prouve rien " , deux universitaires se sont , eux , appliqués à démontrer l'inefficacité de cet outil .
Tanguy Le Goff , chercheur associé au Centre de recherches sociologiques sur le droit et les institutions pénales ( CESDIP - CNRS ) , et Eric Heilmann , enseignant à l'université de Dijon , mettent en cause la méthode fondée sur des chiffres de délinquance générale qui recouvrent des délits très divers .
Ils estiment que la contribution de la vidéosurveillance à l'élucidation des faits est " marginale " .
" Dans l'échantillon retenu de 63 gendarmeries , 770 faits ont été élucidés grâce à la vidéosurveillance en 2008 , soit 12 faits par an et par brigade , autrement dit un par mois " , soulignent les chercheurs .
" PAS D'ÉTATS D'ÂME "
A Bondy , une première série d'une dizaine de caméras a été implantée en 2008 , autour du quartier de la gare RER .
Une seconde série est en cours d'installation dans un quartier où , selon le maire , " pas un commerçant n'a été attaqué au moins une fois " .
Comme partout ailleurs , le dossier technique , les implantations des caméras , leur nature , fixe ou mobile , ont été du ressort de la police .
Les images parviennent ensuite , de nuit comme de jour , au siège de la police municipale et au commissariat de Bondy .
" Je n'ai pas d'états d'âme " , affirme le maire , Gilbert Roger qui indique que ces caméras ont permis notamment d'interpeller des auteurs de vol à l'arraché .
Toutefois , l'élu constate que les chiffres de la délinquance sur sa commune , non seulement n'ont pas baissé mais continuent même de progresser .
" Je ne sais pas si tout ça est 100 % efficace , dit - il , mais cela donne le sentiment d'être dissuasif .
Avant , nous avions plus de rassemblements de jeunes adultes consommateurs d'alcool . "
A la demande des fonctionnaires municipaux , " pour les rassurer " , des caméras ont même été installées à l'intérieur de l'Hôtel de Ville .
Mais tout ceci à un coût très lourd .
La dizaine de caméras autour de la gare de Bondy a nécessité un budget de 100 000 euros , pris en charge à 60 % par l'Etat .
" Comme il n'y avait pas beaucoup de projets en Seine - Saint - Denis , l'apport financier de l'Etat a été plus grand " , rapporte - t - il .
Ailleurs , c'est souvent moins .
Il faut ajouter les frais de télétransmission des images et le coût de trois fonctionnaires délégués à plein - temps pour regarder les écrans , en se relayant toutes les deux heures .
Ces fonctionnaires de la mairie , installés dans les locaux de la police municipale , ont reçu un agrément spécial .
A Paris , le coût du plan de 1 226 caméras pourrait atteindre la somme globale de près de 300 millions d'euros sur une quinzaine d'années , générant sur ce seul aspect économique , de vives réserves d'élus .
Et puis , il y a les frais d'entretien .
A Sartrouville ( Yvelines ) , sur les cinquante premières caméras installées , onze ont été détruites volontairement .
C'est , en tous les cas , un marché juteux pour les sociétés privées , sélectionnées sur appel d'offres , à qui sont confiées le parc des caméras .
Selon le FIPD , la participation de l'Etat aux études préalables , aux frais d'installation ou d'extension des systèmes doit se situer entre " 20 % et 50 % maximum " du montant des projets .
Intégrée depuis plusieurs années dans le travail quotidien de la police , la vidéosurveillance n'est pas " l'assurance absolue " de réussite d'élucidation des crimes et délits , notait le rapport commandé par le ministère .
Les caméras du petit village de Bréau , en Seine - et - Marne , ont bien enregistré l'image du détenu Jean - Pierre Treiber .
Mais à ce jour le fugitif , évadé de prison depuis le 8 septembre , court toujours .

Abstract : " Follow the water " is the canonical strategy in searching for life in the universe .
Conventionally , discussion of this topic is focused on the ability of a solvent to support organic chemistry sufficiently rich to seed life .
Although this is a necessary condition for the emergence of life it is far from being sufficient .
Perhaps more importantly , solvent must promote self - organization of organic matter into functional structures capable of responding to environmental changes .
In biology , they are mostly based on non-covalent interactions ( interactions that do not involve making or breaking chemical bonds ) , strength of which must be properly tuned .
If non-covalent interactions were too weak , the system would exhibit undesired , uncontrolled response to natural fluctuations of physical and chemical parameters .
If they were too strong kinetics of biological processes would be slow and energetics costly .
Non-covalent interactions are very strongly mediated by the solvent .
In particular , potential solvents for life must be characterized by a high dielectric constant to ensure solubility of polar species and sufficient flexibility of biological structures stabilized by electrostatic interactions .
Among these solvents , water exhibits a remarkable trait that it also promotes solvophobic ( hydrophobic ) interactions between non-polar species , typically manifested by a tendency of these species to aggregate and minimize their contacts with the aqueous solvent .
Hydrophobic interactions are responsible , at least in part , for many self - organization phenomena in biological systems , such as the formation of cellular boundary structures or protein folding .
Strengths of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are similar and can be balanced over a wide range of temperatures , which considerably increases the repertoire of interactions that can be used to modulate biological functions .
Some properties of water , e.g. its chemical activity against polymerization reactions , are considered as unfavorable to life .
In actuality , this might be a favorable trait because life requires a balance between constructive and destructive processes .
For example , molecules synthesized in response to specific conditions must be degraded once these conditions change .
Otherwise regulation of biological processes would be virtually impossible .
Water might not be the only liquid with favorable properties for supporting life .
One example is formamide , which might be present elsewhere in the universe in sufficient quantities to warrant interest as a potential alternative to water for the origin of life .
However , further studies on physical , chemical and biological properties of non-aqueous solutions are needed to draw firmer conclusions on this subject .

Yesterday , we brought you the insurance company that would n’t insure a 17 - pound infant because he was too heavy .
Today , we bring you the investment bank that manages to double its bonuses during the worst recession since the Great Depression .
On Thursday , Goldman Sachs will announce the firm ’s bonus payments for 2009 .
Analysts expect the bonus pool to mushroom to $ 23 billion — double the bonus pool paid to employees in 2008 .
Earlier this year , Goldman Sachs said that it had put aside $ 11.4 billion for bonuses during the first half of the year .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The absolute size of compensation payouts will rise significantly , ” Keith Horowitz , an analyst at Citigroup , wrote in a note to clients two weeks ago , highlighted by Andrew Sorkin in The New York Times ‘ dealbook column Tuesday .
How much is $ 23,000,000,000 ?
For one thing , it ’s enough to send 460,000 full paying students to Harvard University for one year , or 115,000 for four years .
It ’s enough to pay the health insurance premium for the average American family ( $ 13,375 ) 1.7 million times .
It ’s enough to upgrade 191 million computers to Windows 7 operating system ( priced at $ 119.99 ) , or to buy 115 million iPhones at $ 199.99 ( provided the recipient was willing to sign a two - year contract ) .
Or , apparently , it ’s enough to reward the employees of Goldman Sachs for a bonanza trading year , at a firm where average employee compensation was recently $ 622,000 — and likely to be greater this year .

The $ 23 billion figure could leave some American taxpayers woozy — the US government bailed out Goldman Sachs with a multi-billion payment last year , which the firm has since repaid .
But while Goldman is likely to pay its biggest bonuses ever to employees , the firm pays very little in taxes worldwide .
In 2008 , the company was said to have paid just $ 14 million in taxes worldwide , and paid $ 6 billion in 2007 .
The firm ’s corporate tax rate ?
About 1 percent .
According a prominent tax lawyer , “ They have taken steps to ensure that a lot of their income is earned in lower - tax jurisdictions . ”

Sorkin says Goldman ’s CEO is trying to hold off criticism by making a big charitable donation .
“ Now there ’s talk inside Goldman that it is considering making a huge charitable donation — perhaps more than $ 1 billion — as a way to help deflect the criticism , ” Sorkin says .
“ Such a donation would be a welcome gesture that would no doubt benefit many needy organizations .
But it would most likely be seen for what it is : a one - time move to draw attention away from where most of the money is really going .
A large charitable donation also raises questions about the company ’s fiduciary duty to its shareholders ; it could be seen as giving away profits that ostensibly belong to them . ”
Negative ads have prejudiced voters against Michael Ignatieff , and brought Stephen Harper within reach of a majority government .
The Conservatives now lead the Liberals by about 10 percentage points .
The situation seems unlikely to improve .
The Prime Minister 's divisive partisan tactics have diminished the public 's respect for politicians in general .
In just four years , he has changed the tone of media coverage and public discourse , shifting the mood of the nation toward cynicism and selfishness .
Liberal infighting has not helped , while the NDP has missed two opportunities – on climate change and macroeconomic policy – to capture the national imagination with bold ideas .
There is only one surefire way to prevent a Harper majority .
The Liberals and NDP should agree to not run candidates against each other in the next campaign .
In each riding , the party whose candidate fared worst in the last election would pull its current candidate out , or refrain from nominating one .
Both parties would win more seats , with the Liberals potentially forming a majority government .
Based solely on the results from October 2008 , the agreement would , in itself , deliver 30 to 40 additional seats to the Liberals and another five to 10 seats to the NDP .
The Bloc Québécois would not be part of the deal but could be expected to win around 40 seats in total .
Importantly , what is proposed is not a coalition , but a one - time ceasefire between two opposition parties whose combined vote share last time was significantly higher ( 44.4 per cent versus 37.6 per cent ) than the Conservatives .
No effort would be made to coordinate platforms , though the absence of debilitating head - to - head races between Liberals and New Democrats would direct both parties ' attention onto the Conservatives .
Nor would the agreement extend to post-election power sharing .
If the Liberals were in a position to form a minority government , they would be free to seek support from any of the other parties – including the Conservatives .
The only post-election condition in the agreement should be an unqualified public commitment to holding a national referendum on proportional representation within the first year .
The commitment would include the provision of sufficient public funding to ensure in - depth discussion and widespread knowledge of the arguments both for and against the proposed change .
Proportional representation would produce a much fairer allocation of seats than our current first - past - the - post system and boost voter turnout and political engagement by making every vote count .
Many New Democrats might wish to make the immediate introduction of proportional representation a condition of the ceasefire agreement , since a referendum might not produce the desired result .
However , such an approach would enable the Prime Minister to make proportional representation the principal issue in the campaign , instead of his record and the alternative policies offered by the other parties .
A ceasefire agreement would likely be opposed by some insiders , in both parties , who benefit from the existing system .
It would certainly inconvenience some candidates who have already been nominated , and would have to stand down .
Most , however , would probably accept that larger , more important interests are in play .
The ceasefire agreement , once struck , could be expanded to include the Green party , which has always sought proportional representation and would benefit substantially from it .
The Greens obtained nearly 1 million votes ( 6.8 per cent ) but no parliamentary representation in the last election .
They finished second in five races , though the party 's only realistic chance of winning a seat in the next election is in the B.C. riding of Saanich - Gulf Islands , where Elizabeth May is running and the Liberal finished second to the Conservative last time .
An arrangement could be made to rectify this lack of representation by giving all five second - place Greens a clear run in the next election , with May having that opportunity in her new riding – in return for the Green party withdrawing its candidates from every other race .
The chances of the Liberals forming government appear to have slipped away .
The future of the country is in the balance .
Whether we like it or not , the parties of the progressive centre have reached a decision point .
Will we let an outdated electoral system deliver a majority Conservative government on the basis of the preferences of less than 40 per cent of voters – and less than 25 per cent of those Canadians who are eligible to vote ?

It ’s widely believed that Apple will deliver a tablet sometime in early 2010 , and even though the device ’s specifications are n’t completely known , that has n’t stopped analysts from talking about the millions of dollars in additional revenue that a tablet will bring in .
It ’s easy , though , to get caught up in the hoopla surrounding an Apple tablet , which is why it might be a good idea to take a step back and ponder , “ Are we hyping up the tablet into something it ’s not ? ”
For whatever reason , people are looking at the Apple tablet as if it ’s the second coming of the iPhone , both in terms of the financial success it will bring to Apple and in terms of its potential impact on the tech industry .
But the fact of the matter is that there ’s a lot we do n’t know about the tablet , and from the information that ’s been reported , the tablet does n’t seem worthy enough to warrant its rumored $ 600 - $ 700 price tag .
Here ’s what we “ know ” about the tablet .
By all accounts , the upcoming Apple tablet will sport a 10 - inch multitouch screen with built - in 3G connectivity .
Okay , that ’s a solid start .
But is a glorified iPod Touch with always on Internet that enticing for $ 700 , especially when the number of places that offer free wi-fi these days seems to be increasing exponentially ?
There ’s got to be more , but as things tend to be with Apple rumors , there are a lot more questions than answers .
A constant question mark about the rumored tablet is whether it will run OS X , or perhaps a modified version of the iPhone OS .
And most recently , a report mentioned that Apple has been exploring ways to integrate the tablet as some sort of dual screen for Apple ’s iMac and lineup of notebook computers .
But even assuming that the tablet will run OS X and will serve as a kick - ass second monitor for Mac owners , it ’s still comes up short for its rumored price point .
A 10 inch screen is great , and will undoubtedly make watching videos and using applications a more enjoyable experience , but at 10 inches , the tablet is just a tad more portable than a small MacBook .
Size wise , it ’s basically stuck in no -man ’s land – not small enough to fit in your pocket , but not big or rugged enough to just toss in your backpack either .
And again , constant 3G Internet access is great , but that does n’t constitute a “ blockbuster ” feature that would create lines around the block at Apple stores .
So taking that all in , we have to wonder if the Apple tablet will be a game changing device like the iPod and iPhone , or if it ’ll be more like a hobby Apple tinkers around with like it does with the Apple TV .
We have to believe , though , that there ’s more to this Apple tablet than meets the eye .
A lot more .
Previous tablet offerings have failed to impress consumers , and as opposed to other markets it ’s entered ( MP3 players , Smartphones ) , the tablet market does n’t really exist on the scale that would warrant Apple ’s involvement .
And the Apple TV aside , Apple simply does n’t enter a market unless it feels that it can sell a significant number of units .
So if Apple does in fact release a tablet in 2010 , it will only do so if it genuinely believes that it can push a ton of them out the door .
But to do that , it needs some sort of groundbreaking feature that we can’t quite put our finger on .
A large multitouch screen with 3G access is a good start , but that ’s certainly not enough .
Rumors of an Apple tablet have abounded for years now , and Apple has reportedly scrapped and re-started the project on numerous occasions .
With that in mind , it seems a bit premature to start looking at an Apple tablet as the second coming of the iPhone .
As it stands now , an Apple tablet is a bunch of hype resting on scattered reports from rumor sites and financial projections from analysts .
An Apple tablet might very well be a cool and game changing product , but until we know more about it , it ’s probably too soon to start singing its praises .
And lastly , we ’d be remiss if we did n’t look back at the groundbreaking announcement of the iPhone at MacWorld in 2007 .
Prior to Steve Jobs ’ keynote , Apple sites were running wild with reports of a potentially new product called an “ iPhone ” – but no one was quite sure what features it would have .
Looking back , even the most optimistic and wildly imaginative mockups and descriptions of the iPhone paled in comparison to what Steve Jobs eventually introduced .
While most people were thinking about how Apple might add a phone to an iPod , Apple was busy working on adding phone functionality to multitouch media and Internet device .
If an Apple tablet is going to succeed and sell , Jobs and company will have to come at it with a completely fresh take on the tablet , much like it did when it designed the iPhone .
But a revolutionary product like the iPhone does n’t come around once every 3 years , or even once every 8 years .
So while we ’d love to be proven wrong , we ca n’t help but wonder if rumors about the impending Apple tablet have gotten out of control .
What do ya’ll think ?
Will an Apple tablet deliver the goods ?
Or will it be a hyped up , yet still attractive , disappointment ?

Friday Q&A 2009 - 11 - 13 : Dangerous Cocoa Calls
It 's another Friday , and so time for another Friday Q&A .
This week , Quentin Carnicelli ( one of the guys who signs my paychecks ) suggested that I talk about dangerous API calls in Cocoa .
First , let me clarify what I mean by a dangerous call .
I do n't mean something that is obviously dangerous , like -[ NSFileManager removeFileAtPath : handler : ] .
That call is dangerous because you could use it to wipe the user 's entire hard drive , but it 's not interesting , because it 's obvious that it can do this .
Instead , I 'm going to cover calls which are subtly dangerous , things which you might easily use in an innocent manner , only to discover later that bad things can occur .
Without further ado , here are my dangerous calls :
-[ NSTask launch ]
This call is dangerous because it throws exceptions when it fails , and it can fail for completely mundane problems , like trying to execute a file that does n't have the executable bit set .
Because the Cocoa tradition is to only throw exceptions for programmer errors , this can cause trouble for the unwary programmer who does n't wrap this in a @try block .
-[ NSTask waitUntilExit ]
This one looks tremendously innocent .
The problem is that , if the task is still running , it will run the runloop to wait for the task to exit .
Even that would not be a problem , except that it runs the runloop in the default mode .
Because of this , all timers , callbacks , etc. , that are installed in the default mode will continue to run , but will be running in a context they did not expect .
This call looks like a simple blocking call , but it can potentially lead to the invocation of random timers or other callbacks .
This in turn can easily lead to deadlocks or data corruption .
+[ NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats :]
This returns a timer whose memory management is difficult to get right .
Many people simply stash the return value in an instance variable .
This is legitimate , because the runloop is documented to retain the timer .
However , the runloop will release it as soon as it's invalidated , which will happen once a non-repeating timer fires , and also upon explicit invalidation .
It 's easy to get this wrong and end up with a dangling reference , and a lot of code has this problem .
To make things even more fun , the timer retains its target , so if you retain the timer , you 're likely to set up a retain cycle .
NSHost
Yes , this entire class is dangerous , and should not be used .
Why ?
It 's an unfortunate confluence of two otherwise unrelated properties of the class .
The first property is that NSHost has a blocking API .
It accesses network resources , and as such any call to it can take an indefinite amount of time .
This is fine by itself .
The second property is that NSHost returns shared objects , but NSHost is not thread safe .
This means that it can only be safely used on the main thread .
Put the two together , and you have a class which can block any time you use it , but which can only be used on the main thread .
Since it 's unacceptable to indefinitely block the main thread of an application , this basically means that you can't use NSHost .
NSBundle
This one has half of the problems of NSHost .
NSBundle returns shared objects , but is not thread safe , so it 's main - thread only .
It 's still safe to use from the main thread .
The reason I mark it as dangerous is because the fact that it 's unsafe to use from secondary threads is not really documented , but rather has to be inferred from the fact that it's not thread safe and the fact that the instances are shared , and it can be tempting to use it from other threads .
-[ NSBundle unload ]
Because it 's very easy to make references to memory within a bundle 's code ( e.g. by creating instances of an Objective - C class defined within the bundle , or by referring to literal strings defined within the bundle ) , and extremely difficult to make sure that all such references are gone , it 's generally not safe to unload code on Mac OS X .
If any such dangling references remain , your application will crash .
-[ NSImage imageNamed : ] , followed by mutation
This call is very convenient , but it returns a shared object .
A lot of code will make this call , and then immediately start resizing or drawing into the object that it returns .
This can mess up the shared image for any other code that uses it .
If you 're going to modify the image , then you need to copy it first , but this is n't immediately obvious .
-[ NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate ] used for elapsed time
How many of you have written code like this ?
BOOL success ; NSTimeInterval start = [ NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate ] ; do success = [ self trySomething ] ; while ( ! success && [ NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate ] - start <= kTimeoutInterval ) ;
I 'm guilty of it myself .
It 's a pretty natural way to write a timeout loop .
There are many other circumstances where you might use this sort of thing too , not with an explicit loop , but in something more asynchronous .
So what 's the problem ?
-timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate uses the system clock , which can be changed !
Imagine that your program enters this loop , but before it can exit it , the system clock is set back by a day .
Your timeout has now gone up to a day !
Or imagine the opposite , that the system clock is suddenly set forward .
Your timeout will suddenly become zero .
Mac OS
X tries to make time adjustments smooth .
For example , if the NTP client discovers that your clock is a few seconds out of whack , it will gradually pull it back in rather than making the adjustment all at once .
However , sudden adjustments are still possible , even if rare , and your code should be robust against them .
Even the gradual adjustments will cause your timeouts to change duration , albeit not by a huge amount .
The bad news is that Cocoa does n't make it easy to do this right .
You want to use a consistent , non-adjustable for elapsed time , but Cocoa has no APIs for such a thing .
The OS does , so you just have to drop down a level .
My preferred API for this task is mach_absolute_time .
However , this returns a value that 's in terms of arbitrary timebase units , not something comfortable like seconds or nanoseconds .
It 's not hard to convert , but requires some work .
Apple has two examples of how to convert the return value into something sensible .
Two other reasonable alternatives are the Carbon calls Microseconds and UpTime .
Distributed Objects
I 've said it before , but Distributed Objects need special care and attention .
The trouble is that DO looks like a completely transparent way to access objects in other processes , but it does n't entirely succeed at this .
It can still be a good way to do IPC , but it requires more care than you might think from reading through the documentation on it .
For details on why that 's so , my original post on the subject covers it all .
Conclusion
No , that 's not a dangerous Cocoa call , it just means that we 're done for the week .
Come back in seven days for another exciting edition .

It was n't all that long ago that Microsoft was talking up the Virtual WiFi feature developed by Microsoft Research and set for inclusion in Windows 7 , but something got lost along the road to release day , and the functionality never officially made it into the OS .
As you might expect with anything as big and complicated as an operating system though , some of that code did make it into the final release , and there was apparently enough of it for the folks at Nomadio to exploit into a full fledged feature .
That 's now become Connectify , a free application from the company that effectively turns any Windows 7 computer into a virtual WiFi hotspot -- letting you , for instance , wirelessly tether a number of devices to your laptop at location where only an Ethernet jack is available , or even tether a number of laptops together at a coffee shop that chargers for WiFi .

An Oregon hardware hacker and author has been hit with federal criminal charges arising from his longstanding business of selling unlocked cable modems that can be used to steal extra speed from a broadband provider , or obtain free service .
Ryan Harris , known by his pen name DerEngel , was charged in Boston with a conspiracy count , and charges of aiding and abetting computer intrusion and wire fraud .
" I read the indictment – it's complete bullshit , " says 26 - year - old Harris , author of the 2006 book Hacking the Cable Modem .
" They 're filling in their own blanks .
From my website I would never sell to anyone who had the intent to break the law . "
Harris is the project organizer of TCNiSO , a band of tinkerers specializing in cable modem hacking .
For five years the group has been producing tutorials on how to bypass the firmware locks on Motorola Surfboard modems – a process that sometimes involves soldering a special cable to a hidden terminal inside the device , or exploiting a buffer overflow in the modem 's web interface .
TCNiSO also openly sells pre-modded modems for $ 100 which are already loaded with the group 's custom firmware , which lets the user control the modem 's functionality .
Harris sold two unlocked Motorola Surfboard modems to an FBI agent through TCNiSO.
net .
The group 's work has been a boon to cable modem " uncappers , " who use the customized modems to crank up the speed of their internet access by downloading special configuration files from an ISP 's server .
Users have also wielded the hacked modems to get free service by spoofing another customer 's MAC address – an attack that only works from a home that 's wired to the cable network but has n't had service officially activated .
But Harris has long publicly distanced himself from the criminal applications of his work .
" I never had instructions on my website to teach people how to do this , " he says .
" I never condoned this type of behavior . "
Indeed , most of the charges in the six - count indictment announced Monday focus on the activities of others .
Four wire - fraud charges are based entirely on the fact that a juvenile computer hacker known as " Dshock " downloaded TCNiSO 's firmware and used it to steal broadband .
Dshock pleaded guilty in Boston last year to computer intrusion and interstate threats in connection with DDoS and swatting attacks , and has since been sentenced to 11 months in custody .
But the feds do n't allege that he knew or worked with Harris ; just that he was one of the thousands of people to use the TCNiSO site .
The indictment notes , however , that users openly sought and shared advice on uncapping and stealing cable ( .pdf ) on TCNiSO .
net 's public forums .
And the FBI allegedly found a single damning message on the forum posted personally by " DerEngel " in 2007 .
" Does anyone have any verified MAC addresses and / or config files for Phoenix ( Az ) ?
If sensitive , just pm me .
Rewards will follow : ) "
The government says that TCNiSO has generated revenues of more than $ 1 million since 2003 .
Harris is free on his own recognizance and scheduled to appear in court in Boston later this month .
He vows to fight the case .
" I 'll tell you right now I 'm not going to plead guilty . "
He 's making a list of the legitimate uses of unlocked modems – he says he 's sold some to cable - modem companies as diagnostic gear – and is trying to raise funds for a private attorney .
" The only evidence they have is the business I 've been running for the last five years , " says Harris .
" It 's like arresting every firearms dealer , because handguns can be used to commit murder . "

Images from LCROSS Visible Light Camera reveal a plume reaching 3.7 miles to 5 miles ( 6 km to 8 km ) high just seconds after the spacecraft crashed into our moon .
NASA scientists have finally seen in their data a debris plume createdby the impact of a moon probe last week .
The faint plume was seen in the data from the engineeredcrash one week after the impactof the LCROSS probe .
Scientists are hoping that analysis of the plume will showsigns of water ice ejected from the probe ' starget crater , named Cabeus , at the lunar south pole .
The debris plume , created by the probe 's Centaur stagerocket , was captured by the LCROSS ultraviolet / visible and near infra-redspectrometer .
Its signature was faint , but distinct .
" There is a clear indication of a plume of vapor andfine debris , " said Anthony Colaprete , LCROSS principal investigator andproject scientist .
The magnitude , form , and visibility of the debris plume addadditional information about the concentrations and state of the material atthe impact site .
? Within the range of model predictions we made , the ejectabrightness appears to be at the low end of our predictions and this may be aclue to the properties of the material the Centaur impacted , " Colapretesaid .
The LCROSS spacecraft also captured the Centaur impact flashin both mid-infrared ( MIR ) thermal cameras over a couple of seconds .
Thetemperature of the flash provides valuable information about the composition ofthe material at the impact site .
LCROSS also captured emissions and absorption spectra acrossthe flash using an ultraviolet / visible spectrometer .
Different materialsrelease or absorb energy at specific wavelengths that are measurable by thespectrometers .
With the spacecraft returning data until virtually the lastsecond , the thermal and near - infrared cameras captured excellent images of the Centaur impact crater at a resolution of less than 6.5 feet ( 2 m ) .
The imagesindicate that the crater was about 92 feet ( 28 m ) wide .
" The images of the floor of Cabeus are exciting , " Colaprete said .
" Being able to image the Centaur crater helps usreconstruct the impact process , which in turn helps us understand theobservations of the flash and ejecta plume . "
The LCROSS team will continue combing through and examining the probe 's data in the coming weeks to see if they can find signs of water ice .
" We are blown away by the data returned , " Colaprete said .
" The team is working hard on the analysis and the dataappear to be of very high quality .?
Water has alreadybeen detected in small quantities all over the lunar surface , bound to theparticles of dirt that coat the moon .
And evidence from other spacecraft suggests there is water ice in permanently shadowed craters like Cabeus .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a great vote counter .
As the healthcare vote on Saturday night demonstrated , she knew just how many votes she had to turn to win the bill .
And she did it by allowing lawmakers from swing - state districts -- many with strong Catholic constituencies -- to first vote against insurance funding for abortion .
Abortion foes hailed the move as what was called " a nail in the eventual coffin of Roe v. Wade . "
Now , as the bill moves to the Senate , pro-abortion groups are mobilizing for a fight .
" It is unconscionable that anti-choice lawmakers would use health reform to attack women 's health and privacy , but that 's exactly what happened on the House floor , " said Nancy Keenan , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America .
" The fight is not over .
...
We will continue to mobilize our activists and work with our allies in Congress to remove this dangerous provision from the healthcare bill and stop additional attacks as the process moves to the Senate . "
Added Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America , " Women do not plan to have unintended pregnancies .
...
Proposing a separate abortion rider or single - service plan is tantamount to banning abortion coverage since no insurance company would offer such a policy . "
New York Democrat Anthony Weiner said this morning that the House bill , in effect , leaves women without protection .
Even if someone wants to purchase her own policy that covers abortion , he said , she might have trouble finding an insurance company to offer it .
Take a listen .

The loss of a gene through deletion of genetic material on chromosome 15 is associated with significant abnormalities in learning and behavior , said a consortium of researchers led by Baylor College of Medicine in a report that appears online today in the journal Nature Genetics .
" This research goes about 95 percent of the way to pinning these problems in a specific group of individuals to this gene , " said Dr. Arthur L. Beaudet , chair of molecular and human genetics at BCM .
He believes that the deletion will be identified in other people with behavioral problems as well as schizophrenia , developmental delay and epilepsy .
The gene 's role in schizophrenia has been under study for some time .
Previously , a larger deletion containing more genes had been reported in people with the same constellation of disorders .
In this work , Beaudet , Dr. Pawel Stankiewicz , assistant professor of molecular and human genetics at BCM , and colleagues found that a smaller deletion of genetic material - the whole of the gene in question , CHRNA7 , and a part of another - was associated with similar problems in 10 members of four families .
" We scanned the genome of about 10,000 people to find this rare but important defect , " said Stankiewicz .
" This gene encodes a subunit of a nicotinic receptor , " said Beaudet .
" It is a gene that mediates the response to nicotine via a receptor whose normal ligand is acetylcholine . "
The gene encodes a protein called an ion channel , which allows ions to flow in and out of neurons in the brain .
Defects in ion channels have previously been associated with forms of epilepsy or seizure disorder .
" If insufficient expression of the nicotinic receptor causes most or all of the problems associated with deletions in this particular area of chromosome 15 , then it offers a target for drug treatment , " said Stankiewicz .
One such drug mentioned in the paper is Chantix , a medicine now used in smoking cessation efforts .
In this study , an international group of researchers identified 10 people from four unrelated families with the same deletion in the chromosome .
The area deleted encompasses all of CHRNA7 , which encodes a whole subunit of the nicotinic receptor .
Nine of the 10 subjects had developmental delay and / or mental retardation .
Four of the 10 had seizure disorders or an abnormal electroencephalogram ( EEG ) .
In two of the families studied , the patients had inherited the deletion from a parent .
In one family , researchers found the same deletion in the patient 's mother , two siblings , maternal aunt and maternal grandmother .
Both the patient 's mother and her sister had mental retardation and epilepsy .
His both siblings had developmental delay .
The patient had severe mental retardation and obesity and mild facial dysmorphism .
A second patient with impaired growth and severe developmental delay inherited her deletion from her mother , who had normal intelligence but had suffered from epilepsy from childhood .

Personality traits associated with chronic worrying can lead to earlier death , at least in part because these people are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors , such as smoking , according to research from Purdue University .
" Research shows that higher levels of neuroticism can lead to earlier mortality , and we wanted to know why , " said Daniel K. Mroczek , ( pronounced Mro-ZAK ) a professor of child development and family studies .
" We found that having worrying tendencies or being the kind of person who stresses easily is likely to lead to bad behaviors like smoking and , therefore , raise the mortality rate .
" This work is a reminder that high levels of some personality traits can be hazardous to one 's physical health . "
Chronic worrying , anxiety and being prone to depression are key aspects of the personality trait of neuroticism .
In this study , the researchers looked at how smoking and heavy drinking are associated with the trait .
A person with high neuroticism is likely to experience anxiety or depression and may self - medicate with tobacco , alcohol or drugs as a coping mechanism .
They found that smoking accounted for about 25 percent to 40 percent of the association between high neuroticism and mortality .
The other 60 percent is unexplained , but possibly attributed to biological factors or other environmental issues that neurotic individuals experience , Mroczek said .
The researchers analyzed data of 1,788 men and their smoking behavior and personality traits over a 30 - year period from 1975 to 2005 .
The data was part of the VA Normative Aging Study , which is a long - term study of aging men based at the Boston VA Outpatient Clinic .
Mroczek and his co-authors , Avron Spiro III and Nicholas A. Turiano , published their findings in this month 's Journal of Research in Personality .
A better understanding of the bridge between personality traits and physical health can perhaps help clinicians improve intervention and prevention programs , Mroczek said .
" For example , programs that target people high in neuroticism may get bigger bang for the buck than more widespread outreach efforts , " he said .
" It also may be possible to use personality traits to identify people who , because of their predispositions , are at risk for engaging in poor health behaviors such as smoking or excessive drinking . "

I like my G1 .
It is , by far , the best phone I have ever had .
I love how it feels in my hand , not too light or too heavy ; it fits just right !
Â
I even got used to the keyboard .
At first , I did n’t like the lip on the phone as it made getting to the keyboard challenging .
But … I adjusted .
The pictures , video and voice recording capabilities are good enough for me .
It does everything I need it to do and I only recently took off those protective covers on the main screen and camera .
My kids are n’t allowed to touch my phone and my “ dad sensor ” goes off if they are within reach of it !
If phones had new - car smell mine would reek of it !
My phone rocks !!
I am being told now , much to my dismay , that my trusty companion is obsolete .
It ’s barely a year old and already scheduled for the trash heap .
When did this happen ?
When did my phone become a wild opposum ?
( They have a one year life span , look it up ! )
Â
This is the first phone I have ever owned that outlived its hype .
All my other phones were collecting dust in the “ junk drawer ” along with some change , pencils , some paper clips and that garage door opener I can never find long before they were publicly called out as “ old ” or “ uncool . ”
The Android tsunami is coming though and it looks like the G1 is being carried away by the undertow .
The worst part of all this is that I ’m with T - Mobile and my Android options are the Cliq and myTouch 3G .
Not the worst options in the world but I want the Droid .
Not only is my phone suddenly old and uncool , so is my carrier !
I am all for technology moving forward but I ’m having a hard time keeping up .
The ups and downs of G1 ownership have been wild this week .
Down – Reading that the G1 may not get Eclair !
– Reading that the G1 may not get Eclair !
Up – Seeing a video showing it DOES support Eclair .

Both because I like it and ’ cause I ’m cheap .
Hopefully we get Eclair .
Hopefully something “ Droid-ish ” comes down the T - Mobile pipe .
Hopefully I remain cool and hip even though my phone is “ old . ”
No really , I ’m cool and hip !
Late Friday night , Google filed a revised version of its book settlement with the New York court that is overseeing the case .
The new version limits the settlement to works published in a handful of English - speaking countries , and contains significant concessions that appear to be direct responses to some of the criticisms of the deal .
Nevertheless , some of its harshest critics have clearly not been placated , as the revised deal has already come under fire due to continuing legal , privacy , and business issues .
Perhaps the most significant change made to the deal is the limit to its scope .
The EU as a whole ( and several of its member countries ) objected to several aspects of the settlement , which could have seen Google offer scans of European works that have never been licensed for sale in the US .
Google offered to add European publishers and authors to the board that oversaw the handling of book content , but that was apparently not enough to satisfy the European publishing business ; as a result , most of the EU has been dropped .
The exception is the UK , which is being included along with Canada and Australia ( but not Ireland or New Zealand ) , as these nations are considered to have a publishing business and copyright laws substantially similar to the US ' .
Each of those nations will get a minimum of two representatives on the Book Registry : one publisher , one author ( the same deal European rightsholders were offered ) .
Authors also get a number of concessions , such as the right to reject arbitration for disputes , and the ability to attend any arbitration settings via videoconference ( to save on travel expenses ) .
They 'll also be represented by an independent fiduciary that will be appointed for the purpose of representing authors who have n't claimed their works .
Revenue for unclaimed works will be held for 10 years , and the fiduciary will be able to spend part of that revenue on a search for the rightsholders of these works .
A number of the other changes seem intended to address some of the pointed criticisms the initial settlement had received .
Authors will gain the right to allow their works to be distributed under the license of their choice , including Creative Commons licenses .
Those concerned about the vague future uses given to Google for scanned works can be reassured that only three will be allowed : print - on - demand , download , and subscription services .
Librarians were also considered , as the board will be able to allocate additional public terminals in libraries as it deems appropriate .
A clause that required the Book Registry to grant Google any deals given to other businesses ( termed " most favored nation " ) was also dropped .
Not everything seems to be Google providing concessions in response to criticism , though .
Google gets the rights to provide works at a discount , provided that the rightsholders get paid as if the discount were n't in effect .
Its love of algorithms also shines through : " The Amended Settlement clarifies that the Pricing Algorithm used to establish the Settlement Controlled Prices for Consumer Purchase will be developed to simulate the prices in a competitive market and that the price for a Book will be established without regard to changes to the price of any other Book . "
Continuing criticism
Although the deal has seen substantial revisions , a variety of interested parties clearly feel that the changes are more cosmetic than substantial .
A variety of news sources are suggesting that the US Department of Justice 's most significant issues with the settlement have been ignored : the settlement provides Google with access to copyrighted works unless their owners opt out , which is a significant change to copyright policy .
Google would also be given immunity from future copyright suits .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation and ACLU also consider the changes to privacy policies in the revised settlement to be inadequate , as the only additional language suggested that , " Google will not share any private information with the Registry without valid legal process . "
The Open Book Alliance , a consortium that includes both authors groups and some of Google 's fiercest competitors , compared the revisions to a " surgical nip and tuck . "
Many of the concerns were listed by others , such as the need for Congress to address orphaned works rather than a private legal settlement , and the fact that the settlement is opt- out .
But some of the complaints simply seem to be the result of uneasiness about the fact that some of these competitors have given up on book scanning , leaving Google with an essentially open field .
In any case , it 's clear that the revisions to the settlement have not satisfied everyone with interest in the matter .
Despite the fact that some of the loudest complaints are coming from Google 's competitors , it 's clear that a few of the issues highlighted by the deal 's critics have merit , and focus on the significant legal implications of the revised deal .

An FAQ is also available , but it 's pretty insubstantial .
More on Mathematical Diseases
A summary of some your ideas on mathematical diseases
John Conway is a world renowned mathematician , who defies a simple description .
He has worked on countless games , puzzles , and easy to state , but often hard — if not impossible — to solve problems .
These range from his classic game of Life , to his work on Surreal numbers ; from his work on polyhedra , to his special notation for huge numbers .
At the same time he has made deep contributions to many , if not most areas , of modern mathematics : from group theory , to number theory ; from algebra , to geometric theory .
There is only one John Horton Conway .
Today I want to talk about some of the mathematical diseases that were raised by those who were kind enough to comment on my previous discussion .
The response was so strong that I thought I would collect some of your comments in one place .
I hope that this either helps someone to make progress on one of these diseases or to help spread them to others .
Conway was the source many of the popular MD’s , which is probably not too surprising given his wide range of results , that includes many unusual problems .
He once gave the keynote address at SODA .
This conference , the Symposium on Discrete Algorithms , is theoretical , but a bit more down to earth than FOCS , for example .
Conway ’s presentation was a strange and wonderful one — at many levels .
The main part of the talk was an impressive demonstration of his Doomsday algorithm .
This algorithm allows one to calculate the day of the week from any date by a “ simple ” rule — Conway himself can do this in realtime .
Thus ,
The funniest part of his demonstration was that people would ask dates and get back days of the week , but for many of them we had no idea if Conway was really correct or not .
Oh well .
Personally , of his many theorems , his 15 - Theorem is one of the neatest :
Theorem :
If a positive definite integral quadratic form represents all positive integers up to 15 , then it represents all positive integers .
Conway proved this with William Schneeberger in 1993 : see this for a overview of the result .
Forget how one proves such a theorem , my question is more basic : where do you get the intuition that such a theorem might even be true ?
Let ’s turn now to the previous comments , with some extra annotation , here and there .
Some Mathematical Diseases ( MD )
Conway ’s Thrackle Conjecture : Joseph O’Rourke suggests this one : which he says “ bites me about once every two years ”
I did not know this conjecture .
See this for a description of this amazing simple sounding problem .
László Lovász has worked on the problem so this disease can affect even one of the best mathematicians in the world .
Conway ’s Game of Life : John Sidles suggest this one and , adds “ What a great subject ! ”
He says , To lead off , a wholly benign , utterly useless , and wonderfully enjoyable MD is the study of self - replicating structures in Conway ’s Game of Life .
The accomplishments of the Life community over the last 39 years are so amazing , that all one can say is Golly !
The Game of Life is played on an infinite grid of squares .
It is not really a game , it is a zero player game , one starts off by providing the seed — by marking some finite set of squares in the grid .
Then the game is entirely deterministic , at each time instance , it evolves using 4 simple rules .
Conway ’s original question was :
Is there a seed which can grow indefinitely ?
For the answer to this , and a beautiful exposition on the game itself , please see the this article on the game .
Collatz Problem : Akash Kumar suggests the famous conjecture , which is also called the Collatz Conjecture .
He says , “ This `seemingly ’ toy problem has much to offer as shown by its resistance to attempts at solving it . ”
I was introduced to this famous problem , while I was a graduate student , by Albert Meyer .
I tried to show that the mapping had no cycles by a modular argument .
It failed .
Somehow the problem never has appealed to me again .
Definitely , a simple to state , but very hard problem .
Palindromic Number Conjecture : Ted Carroll suggests this one .
He says , “ I suck non-mathematicians in with that one all the time — especially computer people because there ’s a proof that the conjecture holds for binary . ”
Start with a number and reverse it , then add the two together .
Repeat until a palindrome is reached .
Does this always happen ?
See this for an example and more :
which is a palindrome .
Specifically , the number has attracted lots of attention .
Starting with , after being iterated to million digits a palindrome is yet to be found .
Curiously , in the binary case , there is a very short counterexample that can be shown to never reach a palindrome .
Goldbach Conjecture : Akash Kumar and Tom both suggest this one .
Akash says , “ I mean , I find it really amazing that this problem is accessible to people like me with a modest mathematical background and is so profound that it has avoided attacks by best brains . ”
Tom says that “ Everyone has dreamed about solving these at least a little bit at some stage in their life .
There ’s even a ( fictional ) book written about this problem about a man obsessed with solving it . ”
The book titled , “ Uncle Petros and Goldbach ’s Conjecture ” by Apostolos Doxiadis is well written and fun .
I would definitely recommend it to you .
See this for other examples of Goldbach ’s Conjecture appearing in popular culture .
The best known results about the Goldbach Conjecture are :
Every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes .
This result is due to Matveevich Vinogradov .
Every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes .
This result is due to Chen Jingrun .
He proved it during the “ culture revolution ” in 1966 , and at first the western mathematicians did not believe that he had achieved this great result .
He had .
Splay Conjecture : Mihai Pătraşcu suggests this one .
This conjecture concerns the behavior of certain tree data structures .
See this for an introduction to the question .
A real computer science question .
Graceful Tree Conjecture Ibrahim Cahit and Shiva Kintali suggested this one .
Cahit explains ,
Let me give short explanation why GTC is a mathematical disease .
Alexander Rosa has identified essentially three reasons why a graph fails to be graceful : ( 1 ) has “ too many vertices and not enough edges , ” ( 2 ) “ has too many edges , ” and ( 3 ) “ has the wrong parity . ”
If for any graceful tree an arbitrary vertex can be assigned the label 0 ( rotatable tree ) then the proof of the GTC would be piece of cake .
Unfortunately not all trees are rotatable .
Similarly if all trees are alpha-valuable ( a kind of balanced labeling stronger than graceful ( beta - valuable ) labeling ) then the proof of GTC follows easily .
What remains is an algorithmic proof attempt based on the induction on the diameter ( the length of the longest path in a tree ) of a tree .
Unfortunately most of the trees with diameter greater than have no alpha-labeling .
In the past I have attempted twice ( once in 1975 , settled a class of symmetric trees and again 1980 , settled all trees of diameter ) .
I did n’t give up , it is a disease after all .
Despite of huge efforts very little known for about graceful trees e.g. , any tree with vertices has a graceful labeling and all trees of diameter up to are graceful .
Riemann Hypothesis : Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram suggests this one .
He says , “ Although not so easy to state , I think Riemann Hypothesis has attracted quite a lot of attention .
See here for a list of attempted proofs . ”
Two mathematicians from Purdue recently made independent claims , incorrectly , that they have proved the famous theorem .
The Riemann has been claimed many times previously by both amateurs and professionals .
I asked some experts the other day what is up with this great problem .
The answer was there seems to be no progress ; the conjecture is still as unreachable as ever .
4 - Color Theorem : Gilbert Bernstein and Gil Kalai both suggest this one .
Gilbert says that “ 633 configurations is still too many ! ”
Kalai adds ,
Once I had some idea about 4CT ( which asserts that every planar cubic graph is 3 - edge colorable ) and relating it to Tverberg ’s theorem , and I remember Laci Lovász asked me : “ Can you use your approach to prove that a bipartite cubic graph is 3 - edge colorable ? ”
( Which is an easy graph theory result . )
Dealing with bipartite cubic or even with bipartite planar cubic graphs looks like a good test - case for various hypothetical approaches .
I have outlined an approach that we have suggested for a “ human ” proof in a previous discussion .
Roughly , we show that even proving that every planar cubic graph is approximately - edge colorable , is enough to prove 4CT .
Still we are unable to prove that this is true .
Reconstruction Conjecture : Harrison and Ryan Williams suggest this one .
Harrison explains why the conjecture is related to the GI conjecture :
As someone who ’s been bitten by the reconstruction bug , I ’ll tell you that it is indeed related to graph isomorphism on a fundamental level .
Here ’s a brief sketch of why :
If we label the vertices of a graph , then reconstruction is trivial — we just glue the induced subgraphs together so that the labels match up , and in fact we only need three induced subgraphs to reconstruct our original graph .
The reconstruction conjecture is that , if we forget the labels , then this “ gluing ” process is still unique ( up to graph isomorphism , of course ) .
This feels like it should be intuitively true , but there ’s a crucial problem : namely , if the graph has a large automorphism group , then its induced subgraphs can get “ put into ” the original graph in many different ways , and it ’s not clear that the global properties of the graph do n’t change .
So much of the work on graph reconstruction centers around understanding just how automorphism groups of graphs behave , and how they relate to combinatorial properties .
( From the other direction , by the way , it ’s an old result of Béla Bollobás that almost all graphs are reconstructible , since random graphs do n’t allow us to embed large subgraphs into them in more than one way . )
Ryan Williams adds ,
Allow me to get a little bit infected
If we assume the graph reconstruction conjecture , does this imply anything interesting about the complexity of graph isomorphism ?
If you want to tell whether two - node graphs are isomorphic , and you know that this “ reduces ” to checking whether there is an “ isomorphism matching ” between two sets of graphs on nodes each , can you get a recursive algorithm ?
I have to say that I love this conjecture , but have some immunity — I have never thought about it all .
The Status of : This was suggested by Ninguem .
He says :
Roger Apéry was a professor at a small French university .
He was past the age most mathematicians prove big theorems , he had a history of bad proofs , not a big research output and , I was told , also an alcoholic .
But he was a professional mathematician and not a crank .
He showed that is not rational .
We still do n’t know whether is transcendental .
An anonymous commenter adds ,
The reason people were initially skeptical was that Apéry gave a very weird talk presenting the proof .
In the talk , he stated some implausible - looking identities and recurrences , with no hint of how to prove them , and he showed that they implied the irrationality of .
He apparently did n’t respond well to questions , and this led people to wonder whether he actually had a proof of the identities .
Maybe he had just conjectured them based on numerical experiments , and perhaps they were n’t even true .
He eventually came out with a paper that proved everything , and he probably had the proofs at the time he gave the talk , but he certainly did n’t explain it at all clearly at that time .
I think it was n’t until Don Zagier came up with his own proofs of Apéry ’s assertions that everyone became convinced it definitely worked ( although everyone got very excited even before that , once they checked everything numerically and found that it all seemed to work ) .
I heard that when Apéry wrote on the board the key identity he needed ,
he gave a very strange answer to “ where did this identity come from ? ”
He is alleged to have answered , “ they grow in my garden . ”
Obviously , this did not help make people feel comfortable .
The identity is wonderful , the proof is correct , and the values of the zeta function at other odd integers is still a mystery .
Finding New Crypto-Systems : Chris Peikert suggests this one .
He says :
As one of the many who search for new cryptosystems , allow me to defend the affliction ( before someone develops a vaccine ) !
Sure , factoring - and discrete - log - based systems are great for Alice and Bob ’s everyday secret messages , but
What if you do n’t believe that these problems are truly hard ?
What if someone builds a quantum computer ?
( What if it happens sooner rather than later ? )
What if your device is constrained and can’t handle 2048 - bit exponentiations ?
What if you need “ extra features , ” like delegation , revocation , or homomorphisms ?
What if you want to be guaranteed security even if some / most of your secret key leaks out via a side channel ?
Your standard - issue cryptosystems do n’t admit very satisfactory answers to these questions .
That ’s why we need to look for more
I agree with all he says , but I still think the search for new systems has a bit of an MD flavor , however .
Rudrata Problem : Proaonuiq suggested this one .
He says ,
In the Harary paper they cite the Rudrata disease , an old and widespread one .
I like specially the RCD - variant ( Rudrata problem for Cayley Digraphs ) , also old and widespread .
Be aware : the later infection is harder to cure than the more general Rudrata disease , since the problem seems simpler !
I was puzzled by the reference to the “ Rudrata disease , ” since I had not heard of it before .
I found out that it is another name for the Hamilton cycle problem , which is of course NP - complete .
A special case of the Hamilton cycle problem is the famous knights tour problem on a chessboard .
The pattern of moving a knight on a half - chessboard was presented back in the century by the Kashmiri poet Rudrata in a Sanskrit poem .
Hence the name “ Rudrata disease . ”
Thus , this open question is about understanding the structure of Hamiltonian cycles on special graphs that arise from groups — Cayley Digraphs .
I can see why this could be an MD .
I have to add a comment on a related but completely different topic : how good are you at chess ?
Moving knights on a chessboard can be used to rate your chess ability .
There is a simple test :
One places four pawns on the chessboard at certain locations .
Your job is to move the knight from one corner of the board to the other as fast as possible .
You must visit all squares in a certain order , and can never visit the squares that are occupied by the pawns .
You can have the knight visit a square more than once .
The time that you take to do this task apparently correlates very well with your chess ability .
I was given the test by a friend , and did not do very well .
Long List of Problems :
These were all suggested by Gil Kalai .
He says the following : ( I have made some minor edits — I hope that I have not changed any content by mistake . )
Let me adopt the MD term under a slight protest and mention some of my favorites MD ’s that I spent most time studying .
The rate of error - correcting binary codes ( and spherical codes ) .
( Infected by Nati Linial ) A very easy to describe problem .
You want an error correcting binary code on bits with minimal distance .
What is the largest possible rate as a function of .
( A closely related problem is about the densest sphere packing in high dimensional spaces . )
Is the Gilbert - Varshamov lower bound the correct one ?
Can the MRRW upper bound ( the best known one ) be ( even slightly ) improved ?
A ( somewhat ) related ( easier ) problem : Can you find an elementary construction ( not based on algebraic geometry ) for large - alphabets codes with better rate than Gilbert - Varshamov .
( The zig - zag success for expanders give some little hope . )
The - conjecture for spheres :
This is probably the first problem on my list .
I started working on it the earliest and probably spent more time on it than on any other .
It is a little hard to explain and motivate .
But there are quite a few people who thought about the problem .
( There are a few posts about it on my blog ) .
The Hirsch conjecture ( and strongly polynomial LP ) I wrote about it amply on my blog .
The Erdös - Rado Delta system - conjecture
This is on Gowers ’s possible future polymath projects so let me not elaborate further here .
The Cap set conjecture
It is about the largest size of a subset of not having three elements that sum to zero .
Closely related to Roth ’s and Szemerédi ’s theorems .
Borsuk ’s conjecture .
I do n’t think Jeff Kahn and I were “ obsessed ” about the problem while working on it for quite a few years .
It is not clear if an obsession mode is a good sign .
Our approach to the problem is somewhat related to a famous open problem which is still open and is on Alexander Rosa ’s list and was always high on Jeff ’s list : The Erdös - Faber - Lovász conjecture .
( Jeff settled the EFL conjecture skepticism and Jeff and Paul Seymour solved it fractionally . )
Bible codes
This represents an applied topic that I intensively ( and obsessively ) spent much time in the late 90’s .
At the end I was a coauthor of a 4 - author paper containing a thorough refutation of the scientific evidence for the existence of bible codes .
It was a good ( while strange ) introduction for me on various issues regarding statistics , science , Learnability , even philosophy of science .
Learnability vs rationality
One tempting “ cure ” for various diseases , especially of conceptual nature , is “ learnability ” via VC - dimension .
I was very optimistic at some time about the usefulness of replacing “ rational ” by “ learnable ” in the foundations of theoretical economics .
Infeasibility of quantum computers
This represents a current main research interest .
P NP and related issues
It is probably a good instinct whenever you study some new notion about Boolean functions ( or simplicial complexes which are just monotone Boolean functions ) to spend a little ( let me repeat : a little ) time on thinking : does this new notion has bearing on P NP or other questions in computational complexity ?
Most often you can easily realize that the answer is no , and sometimes you realize that the answer is no after some more effort .
A little flirt with Poincaré I was interested in triangulation of manifolds for which the links of vertices are of the simplest possible kind : stacked spheres .
( They are the boundaries of a set of simplices glued together along facets . )
For dimension greater than three , I proved that such a simply connected manifold is a sphere .
For dimension three , I could not prove it and it is a very very very special case of the Poincaré conjecture .
( I still cannot prove this special case directly . )
If you drop the assumption that the manifolds are simply connected then for you are left with very simple handle body manifolds .
I do not know ( and am curious to know ) which - manifolds have a triangulation where are links are stacked spheres .
Open Problems
Solve some of these MD’s .
Or suggest some others .
One of my favorites that is missing is the power of polynomials over composite moduli .
An Approach to the P=NP Question ?
How finding upper bounds can separate complexity classes
Dexter Kozen is a famous theorist , who among many other wonderful things co-invented the notion of alternating Turing Machines .
He also is the author of a terrific book — his other books are pretty neat too — but this one is my favorite .
Dexter also proved a controversial theorem decades ago about the power of diagonal methods in the separation of complexity classes .
More on that later .
Today I want to talk about a possible approach to the separation of powerful complexity classes .
The approach is based on a diagonal argument , as predicted by Dexter ’s paper .
The method is general , and tries to separate classes not by lower bounds , but finding upper bounds .
When alternating Turing Machines were discovered , the idea was somehow in the “ air . ”
Two papers at the same FOCS presented essentially the same results ; these papers were later merged into one famous paper by Ashok Chandra , Dexter Kozen , and Larry Stockmeyer .
I was at Yale , in the computer science department , when Dexter co-invented alternation .
It ’s a long time ago , but I was working with a graduate student named David Cotton .
He was , one of the few students who I worked with over the years that dropped out of the PhD program — I somehow failed him .
He had some family issues that probably made it hard for him to continue , but I always felt bad that he did not get his degree .
I have lost touch with him , and hope he is doing well .
I mention David because just before FOCS that year , David was beginning to work on alternation .
We did not call it that , of course , but as I said the idea was in the “ air . ”
He was working on relating alternating time and space , when we heard about the FOCS results .
We did not have the results , but I think that David was getting close , since he was a very strong problem solver .
One example of his ability was evident one day at a problem seminar that we ran at the time at Yale .
The seminar meet once a week , where we discussed open problems and people presented ideas or even solutions to the problems .
One week someone , I forget who , presented a neat problem about finding a linear time algorithm for a certain problem — let ’s just call it X .
The plan was to meet the next week and see if anyone had solved the problem .
David did not attend the meeting when we discussed X . Since this was pre-email and Internet , I do not think he even heard about the problem .
That week I spent a huge amount of time trying to get a linear time algorithm for the problem .
Partly , X was a cool problem , and mostly it was the competitive spirit .
I wanted to solve the problem , before anyone else did .
I eventually found a complex recursive algorithm that seemed to be linear , but the analysis of the running time depended on solving a tough recurrence — one that was too hard for me to solve .
So I when down the hall to see Stan Eisenstat , who is a numerical analyst , and can solve just about any recurrence .
He convinced me quickly that my algorithm ran in time , and I stopped working on the problem — I had no other ideas .
At the next meeting of the seminar , Stan started to explain a linear time algorithm that he had “ found . ”
I quickly saw that Stan was presenting “ my ” algorithm , but he had changed his mind and now could prove that it ran in linear time .
However , the analysis was really complex , soon the blackboard was covered in mathematics : a lemma here and an equation there .
It was a mess .
Then , David walked in ; he always arrived late for the seminar .
He saw Stan at the board and asked someone what was he doing .
They handed David a sheet that described the problem X that Stan was trying to solve .
David said to no - one in particular , “ but that is trivial . ”
Stan ignored him .
Then , David said it louder , and finally Stan turned to David , and as Stan slowly put his chalk down , in the chalkboard tray , he said with a smile on his face : “ so why do n’t you come up and show us your solution . ”
David stood up , walked up to the board , picked up the chalk , and proceeded to present an algorithm that ran in .
The algorithm , once you saw it , was obviously correct — we all had missed it .
Stan was speechless , as we all were .
The meeting broke up .
Too bad David moved on to other things .
In any event , let ’s turn to see how we might solve P=NP .
Perhaps if David was around still , perhaps he could help us make the following ideas work .
Upper Bounds That Imply Lower Bounds
I would love to see us start to prove some serious separation results .
I know I have argued for possible collapses , but I do believe that some of our classes may be different .
So I decided that it was time to write about an attack on separation theorems .
Here goes .
The main issue that I see is that lower bounds are very difficult .
You then say , “ how can we then prove separation results without proving lower bounds ? ”
The answer is based on using simple diagonalization along with some combinatorial cleverness .
The hope is that this method will be able to avoid the known pitfalls — such as oracle results .
The method is based not on finding lower bounds , but on proving upper bounds .
A simple analogy is : suppose I want to show you that .
I can do two things : I can prove that is small , and conclude that must be less than ; or I could prove that is large and conclude that is larger than .
They are really different approaches .
Here is an old example that I have mentioned before — I have already discussed this theorem .
If all sets in P have quadratic size circuit complexity , then a neat result of Ravi Kannan shows that P NP .
More generally ,
Theorem :
Suppose there is a constant so that for any computable in polynomial time , for each the circuit complexity of is .
Then , P does not equal NP .
Proof :
By way of contradiction assume that P NP .
Ravi ’s theorem proves that for any there is a set in second level of the polynomial hierarchy that requires a circuit of size for all .
But , since we have assumed that P NP , the hierarchy collapses : thus , there is a set that is in P , yet requires circuit complexity of .
This is a contradiction , since we are free to choose so that .
Conditional Upper bounds and Separation
The basic insight is that we are good at creating algorithms , and terrible at proving that algorithms do not exist .
My approach to separation is to show that the following type implication can be proved :
Where the statement is an assertion that a certain upper bound is true , conditioned on the assumption that .
The conditional assumption is “ free , ” since we can assume it and reach a contradiction .
Thus , the upper bound can use any consequence of the collapse .
In particular the upper bound can use guessing and counting as part of the algorithm .
Note , this follows since the collapse makes all of these fall into the class .
I have several upper bounds in mind .
Today I will present the simplest one that is based on the determinant .
There are technically weaker statements that I believe can be used .
Of course the ultimate goal is to try and get an upper bound assumption that is provable .
Such a bound , would lead us to an unconditional separation of the classes and .
Note , before we go further that there is one interesting difference in this approach from trying to find a circuit lower bound .
We currently have no idea how to prove strong circuit lower bounds in the general model .
Even worse there is evidence that they may be hard to prove — for example , the work on Natural Proofs .
On the other hand , there is no reason , that I know , to believe that clever upper bounds , especially conditional ones , exist for reasonable problems .
We need only apply our algorithmic creativity to show that the right is true and then we are done .
We are trying to prove implications of the form :
Here means the statement :
I like the notation since it emphasizes the fact that is being conditionally assumed .
What To Try To Prove ?
I think that P=NP is possible , but if I had to try to prove that they are unequal I would proceed as follows .
I would try to first prove something much “ easier , ” well at least not as hard as the full problem .
What I would do is try to prove that
It is entirely possible that could equal so that the above could certainly be true .
This reminds me of a great talk given by Juris Hartmanis at Yale back in the 1970 ’s — see my earlier post .
During the talk , he put up a slide that showed ,
He then pointed out that at least one of the subset relationships must be strict , but we have no idea which one .
The reason they must be strict is that is easily shown by diagonalization to be weaker that : thus , they all can not be equal .
But which subsets are strict ?
Describing Circuits
We need a notion of non-uniformity .
Suppose that is a circuit and is a string .
Say that describes if for all ,
Let us use to denote this .
Now suppose that is a set .
We use TC to mean that that there is a depth and a polynomial , so that for all there exists a general boolean circuit of size with the following property :
There is a threshold circuit of depth and size at most such that
The circuit describes , that is where is some natural encoding of the threshold circuit ;
The threshold circuit computes for all inputs of length .
The above definition is like a second level of non-uniformity .
Instead of requiring a short description for the threshold circuit , we require a circuit of small enough size , which provides a short description of the threshold circuit that computes
By let us mean the boolean function of deciding the determinant of an by matrix , where the entries are from the finite field of two elements .
How To Try To Prove It ?
Here is a sample of the type of result we are working on :
Theorem : Suppose that computing is in TC for any .
Then , L #P is true .
I am working on the proof of this with my graduate student Shiva Kintali .
The rough outline is this .
Assume by way of contradiction that L= P — call this the “ collapse . ”
Then , suppose that is a Turing machine that runs in time say .
The actual running time will depend on the constant in the collapse of P to L— but , for the outline we will ignore this .
The goal is to simulate in time , which will violate the classic time hierarchy theorem .
How do we do this ?
Well we have a number of powerful tools that we can use :
We have the collapse , which allows us to “ count ” the size of any easy - to - describe set .
This is very powerful .
We also have that the determinant can be computed by some circuit that has constant depth and polynomial size .
Note , we do not know which circuit it is , but , we do know that there is some circuit .
circuit that has constant depth and polynomial size .
Note , we do not know which circuit it is , but , we do know that there is some circuit .
We can “ find ” the circuit by using the collapse again , since the collapse allows us also to do guessing efficiently .
Of course , we must be able to check that our guess is correct .
Finally , we can reduce the simulation of to determining whether or not a graph is connected .
This can be done by calculating a determinant by the famous Matrix Tree Theorem .
Note , we are using the following fact : a graph is connected if and only if it has a spanning tree , which in turn is true if and only if a certain matrix has a non-zero determinant .
Open Problems
Can we make this work ?
We actually think we can weaken the hypothesis on the determinant quite a bit .
Roughly we only need that an approximate determinant type function can be computed efficiently — more on this soon .
He picked her so carelessly , and his thought process was so cynical , that he should stand in the dock of public opinion before Palin does .
Her vanity led her to say yes to his crazy offer .
But he gave her that chance .
And in the end , she is his responsibility .
And that 's why in fact the pushback has been almost milquetoast .
How do Steve Schmidt and John McCain reveal the truth about Palin when that truth only further proves their fantastic incompetence , nihilism and unseriousness with respect to government ?
And what 's truly telling about Washington is that a man like McCain , who perpetrated this nonsense and even now refuses to take an ounce of responsibility for it , is nonetheless invited on countless talk shows and treated like the hero he always was .
And no one demands he account for this train - wreck outside his tested cant about Palin " exciting the base . "
If he had any sense of responsibility , he would resign .
And if the Washington media had any sense of responsibility , it would never invite him on TV again without demanding he take responsibility for what he nearly did to the national security of this country .
No one who put this person near the nuclear button should have a future in public life .
But this is Washington .
And they protect their own .

Crude is still being discovered ; existing fields are not being exploited to the full .
So it 's hard to predict the exact point at which the world 's dwindling reserves will precipitate a crisis .
But it 's coming
Massive new oil finds off the southern states of America and Brazil plus exciting discoveries in currently non-producing countries such as Ghana and Uganda sit uneasily with claims the world is running out of crude .
BP recently boasted about a " giant " strike on the Tiber field in the Gulf of Mexico and BG , the former exploration arm of British Gas , talked of its " supergiant " at the Guará prospect off South America , yet critics argue they cannot make up for the fast depletion of existing fields .
These " peak oil " believers say the high point of oil output could even have passed already .
They argue it will take 10 years to develop the likes of Tiber while a string of similar discoveries would have to be made at very regular intervals to move the peak point back towards 2030 the projection used in some scenarios put forward by the International Energy Agency .
The debate has intensified in recent weeks after whistleblowers claimed the IEA figures were unreliable and subject to political manipulation – something the agency categorically denies .
But the subject of oil reserves touches not just energy and climate change policy but the wider economic scene , because hydrocarbons still oil the wheels of international trade .
Even the Paris - based IEA admits that the world still needs to find the equivalent of four new Saudi Arabias to feed increasing demand at a time when the depletion rate in old fields of the North Sea and other major producing areas is running at 7 % year on year .
" The fields which are producing today are going to significantly decline .
We are very worried about these trends , " says Fatih Birol , the chief economist at the IEA , who has gradually ramped that depletion figure upwards and has expressed deep concerns at a huge fall - off in the current levels of investment in the sector .
Birol and the wider industry are certainly well aware that the days of " easy " oil are over .
The big international companies such as BP and ExxonMobil are struggling to find enough new oil to replace their exploited reserves year - on - year and Shell found itself on the end of a major fine for exaggerating its reserves report to the Securities & Exchange Commission in the US .
The energy groups used to rely on the easily exploited shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico , politically friendly areas of the Middle East and geologically simple reservoirs off Britain to feed their refineries and petrol stations .
But as these wells begin to run dry , Big Oil is being forced into ever more physically or politically demanding areas to bring home the crude – at much greater financial cost .
The Tiber find is just one example .
There may be as many as 4bn barrels of oil in place – as much as the North Sea 's Forties field – but the hydrocarbons are located in 4,100 feet of water , which makes them very expensive to extract .
And BP admits there can be no guarantee exactly how much can be recovered from the lower tertiary sands of the Gulf .
The same is true of BG 's find in the Santos Basin off Brazil .
The company says at least 2bn " recoverable " barrels are in place , part of an estimated 150bn in what are , again , very deep waters – and in a part of the world that has bittersweet memories for the foreign oil producers .
Peter Odell , professor emeritus of international energy studies at Erasmus University in Rotterdam but with close links to Opec , says the new finds really are highly significant .
" It shows the industry is capable of finding more oil than it uses and shows we have not come to any peak . "
But that is not accounting for politics and the rise of the " resource nationalism " that has made the multinationals persona non grata in some of the great oil - bearing regions .
BP was among the companies that saw its assets seized in a $ 30bn grab by president Hugo Chavez in Venezuela during 2007 , while Exxon resorted to London 's high court to try to wrestle back its interests there .
Developing countries such as Venezuela , Nigeria and Russia have increasingly been moving down the road to self - reliance , developing their own state - owned firms at the expense of the international players .
But this can mean that western know - how and finance is sacrificed , slowing down the rate of oil development if not losing new reserves completely .
BP , Shell and Exxon have all had tussles with the Kremlin over their oil holdings in Russia , while Shell has found the government in Nigeria increasingly truculent over attempts to re-open the Niger Delta oil wells shut down due to guerrilla action .
The western firms see part of their salvation coming from being able to enter markets from which they have previously been barred , such as Iraq .
But , leaving aside continuing questions about physical safety , both BP and Exxon have signed deals there in recent weeks on terms so tight they would have been inconceivable only a few years ago .
Exxon repeatedly threatened to walk away from any new involvement in Iraq – still one of the biggest reserve holders in the world – but in the end accepted a paltry deal , under which it would be paid $ 1.90 per barrel produced .
It had been arguing for $ 4 but originally wanted control of the reserves , not just what amounts to a service fee for production .
Increasingly , Big Oil is also moving into environmentally sensitive areas that put it in collision with environmentalists , such as the Barents Sea off Norway , the waters around Alaska and – if it can get its hands on it – the Arctic itself .
In the meantime , the oil companies have moved into all sorts of " unconventional " projects such as " gas- to - liquids " ( converting natural gas into petrol and diesel ) and , most controversially , the tar sands of western Canada .
These reserves offer enormous new quantities of oil but can only be extracted by mining or other methods which themselves require large amounts of energy and water .
The Athabasca sands being developed by Shell and others in Alberta are a number one hate target for Greenpeace and the new breed of socially responsible investment funds run by the Co-op and others .
They could hold reserves of 170bn barrels , making Canada number two behind Saudi Arabia , but are only considered commercially viable if the crude price remains above at least $ 50 a barrel .
In the first three months of the year , Shell alone lost $ 42 m on its oil sands operations as the price of world oil slumped from its 2008 high .
The oil companies cut back their exploration and development spending in the face of lower crude prices and reduced demand from a recession - hit world .
But as central banks continue to pump money into their economies , stock markets recover and China 's industrialisation kicks back into gear , demand for oil has been growing .
And this is expected to continue .
The IEA predicted in the just - published 2009 World Energy Outlook that oil demand would grow from 85 m barrels a day today to 88 m in 2015 and reach 105 m in 2030 .
The organisation presumes that the challenge of meeting that demand can equally be met with a mixture of higher Opec production and considerably more output from unconventional sources .
These assumptions became the centre of an explosive debate three weeks ago after the Guardian spoke to IEA insiders who expressed deep concerns about the methodology and " politicisation " of the figures .
Some senior figures are unhappy about what they see as over - optimistic forecasts coming out of the agency which represents the interests of 28 consumer countries , particularly the US .
One whistleblower said : " Many inside the organisation believe that maintaining oil supplies at even 90 m to 95 m barrels a day would be impossible , but there are fears that panic could spread on the financial markets if the figures were brought down further .
And the Americans fear the end of oil supremacy because it would threaten their power over access to oil resources . "
These expressions of concern have stoked the fires of the " peak oil " community , which has been warning for some years that global politicians are failing to move fast enough to conserve oil and move to a low - carbon economy .
The dissidents include experienced oil investors such as Matt Simmons of Simmons & Co , committed green entrepreneurs such as Jeremy Leggett of Solarcentury , as well as many more impartial MPs such as John Hemming and apparently independent academics .
Kjell Aleklett , professor of physics at Uppsala University in Sweden , is one of the latter .
His new report , " The Peak of the Oil Age " , claims crude production is more likely to be 75 m barrels a day by 2030 than the " unrealistic " 105 m projected by the IEA .
This would clearly lead to massive price escalation in a world that expects to see demand grow to feed the expanding economies of China and India even while politicians try to grow wind , solar and other low - carbon energy sources .
Aleklett , who runs the Global Energy Systems Group at Uppsala university , describes the IEA 's report as a " political document " developed for consuming countries with a vested interest in low prices and says he too has talked to sceptics inside the Paris organisation .
The IEA has dismissed suggestions of internal ructions over the figures and has dismissed as " groundless " suggestions that the US was influencing the outcome of its forecast deliberations .
Meanwhile it has defended its overall projections and pointed out that 200 " independent " experts are given sight of its findings , satisfying its demands for peer assessment .
Birol says : " We are very proud of our analysis and independence .
We have a lot of critics .
It 's not possible to make everyone happy . "
But the row rumbles on .
John Hemming has just written to the IEA challenging a range of its figures while urging the UK government to take " peak oil " more seriously .
The UK Industry Task Force on Peak Oil , which includes a variety of companies such as Virgin , Scottish & Southern Energy and Stagecoach , has also written to ministers calling for action .
These critics are united in their fear that " economic dislocation " is likely once the world wakes up to the potential for shortages and the price of oil races back up , not only to last summer 's $ 147 a barrel , but more likely to $ 200 .
They point out that the world 's big recessions tend to have been generated at least in part by sudden escalations in energy costs .
" The risks to UK society from peak oil are far greater than those that tend to occupy the government 's risk thinking , including terrorism , " says Will Whitehorn , a senior Virgin executive .
" We fear this is because of over - estimation of reserves by the global oil industry , underinvestment in exploration and production , or a combination of the two . "
The Department of Energy and Climate Change denies it is complacent , saying it accepts there is a " significant challenge " to attract the kinds of investment needed to keep the oil flowing .
It points out how it has been working with governments individually and collectively to speed up crude production levels while joining the other G20 members in calling for more transparency from producing countries over key aspects of energy output and depletion .
" We are training ministry officials in Nigeria and Iraq , for instance , to help them with licensing and other aspects of oil which will help them speed up the rate of production , " explains a DECC spokeswoman .
She declines to comment directly on the IEA figures that caused the recent row but points out that Britain relied on a wide source of information and not just the agency 's figures .
The UK Industry Task Force , which will produce a new report in January , is still upset that the Wicks review on energy security published this summer concluded " there is no crisis " – a position accepted by the government .
Leggett , a member of the task force , argues that it was a similar lack of urgency that led to the implosion in the financial markets .
The lesson to be learned from Pakistans apparent success is that in international affairs , as in other matters , the less the U.S. government does the better .
---------
News reports from Pakistan indicate that more than 1.5 million refugees from the Swat Valley , scene of fighting between government troops and Taliban insurgents , have returned to their homes .
How soon the remaining refugees are repatriated will depend on whether government troops can maintain calm in the face of renewed violence .
Some 2.3 million people are thought to have fled the fighting , which began this spring when the Pakistan army launched an offensive to drive the Taliban out of the region .
While its too soon to gauge the long - term effects of the campaign , its not too early to learn from the experience .
And the most important lesson here , from a U.S. perspective , may be the following : that countries such as Pakistan are capable of solving their own problems without U.S. meddling .
During the presidential campaign , then Senator Joe Biden predicted it would not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama . 
An international crisis , Biden warned , would quickly test the mettle of this guy . 
Just four months after taking office , Obama was confronted , with Taliban militants advancing within 60 miles of the capital of nuclear - armed Pakistan .
The government of President Asif Ali Zardari had attempted to negotiate with the Taliban , allowing them to impose harsh Islamic law in portions of Pakistans North West Frontier Province adjacent to the Swat Valley .
In exchange , the Taliban offered a cease fire .
But the arrangement was unacceptable to the United States , since the Taliban had made it clear that any area they controlled would provide refuge for Usama bin Laden .
That s when Pakistans military decided to significantly step up its operations in the Swat Valley , which the Taliban had controlled since 2005 .
Previous military operations against militants in the region had lukewarm support from the public largely because they were viewed as proxy operations for the United States , and anti-American resentment runs high .
The United States did not help the situation with reports that the Obama administration was wooing Zardaris main political adversary , former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif .
Senior administration officials strongly denied this , saying on the eve of Zardaris visit to Washington earlier this year that the United States continues to fully support the Zardari government .
Yet , the view from Islamabad was that the United States was trying to meddle .
As one senior Pakistani official put it ,  What are the Americans trying to do , micromanage our politics ?
This is not South Vietnam .
Understandably , the United States primary concern was preventing the Taliban from gaining control of Pakistans nuclear arsenal .
Yet , full - scale U.S. military operations to avert such a situation were out of the question .
The last thing the United States needed to do was invade another Muslim country and lend credence to the claim that we are waging a wider war against Islam .
Even the kinds of military operations that U.S. forces have been conducting are unhelpful .
As has been demonstrated in Afghanistan , air strikeseven if they are carefully targeted too often produce civilian casualties .
The result is increased anti-Americanism and more sympathy and support for Al - Qaeda and its ilk .
Giving the Pakistani government more money and arms also has solved little .
Since 9/11 , Pakistan has received some $ 12 billion in mostly military aid from the United States , ostensibly to reimburse the government for the cost of operations against Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
The trouble is :
Most of that money has been used to buy heavy arms , such as F - 16 fighter jets , and other equipment ill - suited for counterinsurgency operations , but more appropriate for a conventional war with India .
In many ways , the United States managed to maneuver itself into a corner .
The best option remaining to the administration was to do as little as possible .
U.S. meddling in Pakistans internal affairs helped create Pakistans problems .
Doing less has now enabled the Zardari government to more clearly define where U.S. and Pakistani interests coincide and where they diverge , and move forward accordingly .
The lesson to be learned from Pakistans apparent success is that in international affairs , as in other matters , the less the U.S. government does the better .
I am a Shia Muslim and I abhor the burqa .
I am offended by the unchallenged presumption that women covering their heads and bodies and now faces are more pious and true than am I .
Islam in all its diverse forms entitles believers to a personal relationship with Allah – it cuts out middlemen , one reason its appeal extended to so many across the world .
You can seek advice from learned scholars and imams , but they cannot come between your faith and the light of God .
Today control freaks who claim they have a special line to the Almighty have turned our world dark .
Neo - conservative Islamic codes spread like swine flu , an infection few seem able to resist .
The disease is progressive .
It started 20 years ago with the hijab , donned then as a defiant symbol of identity , now a conscript 's uniform .
Then came the jilbab , the cloak , fought over in courts when schoolgirls were manipulated into claiming it as an essential Islamic garment .
If so , hell awaits the female leaders of Pakistan and Bangladesh .

Soon , children as young as four were kitted up in cloaks and headscarves ( " so they get used to it , and then later wear the full thing , " said a teacher to me who works at a Muslim girls ' school ) and now for the graduation gown , a full burqa , preferably with dark glasses .
White liberals frame this sinister development in terms of free choice and tolerance .
Some write letters to this paper :
What is the problem ?
It is all part of the rich diversity of our nation .
They can rise to this challenge , show they are superhuman when it comes to liberty and forbearance .
They might not be quite so sanguine if their own daughters decided to be fully veiled or their sons became fanatic Islamicists and imposed purdah in the family .
Such converts are springing up in Muslim families all over the land .
Veils predate Islam and were never an injunction ( modesty of attire for men and women is ) .
Cultural protectionism has long been extended to those who came from old colonies , in part to atone for imperial hauteur .
Redress was necessary then , not now .
What about legitimate fears that to criticise vulnerable ethnic and racial groups validates the racism they face ?
Racism is an evil but should never be used as an alibi to acquit oppressions within black and Asian or religious communities .
That cry was used to deter us from exposing forced marriages and dowry deaths and black - upon - black violence .
Right - wing think tanks and President Sarkozy of France scapegoat Muslims for political gain and British fascists have turned self - inflicted " ethnic " wounds into scarlet propaganda .
They do what they always have done .
Self - censorship will not stop them but it does stop us from dealing with home - grown problems or articulating objections to reactionary life choices like the burqa .
Muslim women who show their hair are becoming an endangered species .
We must fight back .
Our covered - up sisters do not understand history , politics , struggles , their faith or equality .
As Rahila Gupta , campaigner against domestic violence , writes : " This is a cloth that comes soaked in blood .
We cannot debate the burqa or the hijab without reference to women in Iran , Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia where the wearing of it are heavily policed and any slippages are met with violence . "
What happened to solidarity ?
Violent enforcement is evident in Britain too .
A fully veiled young chemistry graduate once came to my home , her body covered in cuts , tears , bites , bruises , all happily hidden from view .
Security and social cohesion are all threatened by this trend – which is growing exponentially .
As for the pathetic excuse that covering up protects women from male lasciviousness – it has n't stopped rapists in the most conservative Muslim nations .
And what a slur on decent Muslim men , portrayed as sexual predators who cannot look upon a woman without wanting her .
We communicate with each other with our faces .
To deny that interaction is to deny our shared humanity .
Unreasonable community or nationalistic expectations disconnect essential bonds .
Governments should not accommodate such demands .
Naturists can't parade on the streets , go to school or take up jobs unless they cover their nakedness .
Why should burqaed women get special consideration ?
Their veils are walls , keeping them in and us out .
We need an urgent , open conversation on this issue – which divides the Muslim intelligensia as much as the nation .
Our social environment , fragile and precious , matters more than choice and custom should to British Muslims .
If we do n't compromise for the greater good , the future looks only more bitter and bleak .
Saying so does n't make me the enemy of my people .

Progressive group pledges withholding contributions to Dems until healthcare initiative with ' robust public option ' signed into law ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon

Guest blogged by Ernest A. Canning
Coinciding with an internal Senate Democratic Caucus debate over health care reform that Senator Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) described as only “ slightly less raucous than the town hall meetings , ” the non-affiliated progressive activist group Democrats.com has launched a petition campaign aimed at curtailing donations to official Democratic fundraising organizations [ emphasis in original ] until " the Democratic Congress passes --- and President Obama signs --- healthcare reform with a robust public option . "
That " robust public option " is defined in the petition as being " based on Medicare rates , not negotiated rates , " available " nation - wide , with no state opt- outs , " " administered by Medicare , not a for - profit insurance company . " and " available immediately . "
The idea that the public option would be managed by a private insurance company has recently emerged in reports of Congressional negotiations aimed at merging various versions of the legislation passed by separate committees in the House and Senate , as noted by RAW STORY 's John Byrne today .
The progressive activists campaign calls for signatories to respond to requests for donations from the three major Democratic campaign / fundraising organizations --- the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) --- with a http://www.democrats.com...rike-for-public-option\ " > link to the petition , instead of funds , until such legislation has been passed and signed by the President .
" Until then , " the petition states , " I will only support individual Democrats who support single - payer Medicare for All ( the 88 sponsors of HR 676 ) . "
" We elected solid Democratic majorities in Congress and a Democratic President to fulfill Democratic promises of progressive change , " the statement continues , " We did not elect Republican Senator Olympia Snowe to break those promises . "
The complete short petition follows in full below ...
robust public option : I write to inform you that I am joining the Democratic Donor Strike against the DNC , DSCC and DCCC , which will last until the Democratic Congress passes - and President Obama signs - healthcare reform with a • based on Medicare rates , not negotiated rates
• nation - wide , with no state opt-outs
• administered by Medicare , not a for - profit insurance company
• available immediately Until then , I will only support individual Democrats who support single - payer Medicare for All ( the 88 sponsors of HR 676 ) , or ( at a minimum ) pledge to vote against a bill without a strong public option .
I will also support challengers who support Healthcare Not Warfare .
We elected solid Democratic majorities in Congress and a Democratic President to fulfill Democratic promises of progressive change .
We did not elect Republican Senator Olympia Snowe to break those promises .
And if a small number of corporate - funded Democrats in the Senate and House stand in the way , it is the job of our leaders - Harry Reid , Nancy Pelosi , and President Obama - to persuade those Democrats to stand with the party that elected them .
Even ' fiscally conservative '
Democrats have absolutely no excuse for voting against a robust public option , because CBO says it will save $ 110 billion .
So if I receive a fundraising email from the DNC , DSCC or DCCC , I will reply with a link to this petition .
If I receive a fundraising call , I will tell the caller about this petition .
If I receive a fundraising letter , I will return the envelope with a link to this petition : http://www.democrats.com...strike-for-public-option
We desperately need real health reform , starting with a robust public option .
Until you deliver on your promises of change , I will reserve my contributions for individual Democrats who will truly fight for what we all believe .
UPDATE 10/29/09 :On
10/28/2009 Democrats.com announced that 21,651 donors had joined the strike for a robust public option .
Not a very impressive statistic , but then I suspect most Americans are unaware of the donor strike .
What do these strange , odd - year elections – suddenly so feverishly important , now that America 's excitable right - wingers from Rush Limbaugh on down demand that they be – tell us about Barack Obama 's political health ?
Not very much , really .
Certainly , the Republicans have reason to celebrate their wins in the governors ' races in Virginia and New Jersey .
The latter , especially , is a feather in the party 's cap , and if Obama suffered one hurtful blow tonight , it happened because he campaigned for that state 's Democratic governor Jon Corzine on three occasions .
That Obama could n't pull Corzine 's irons out of the fire does tell us that some of that 2008 lustre is gone , even in a pro-Obama state .
But it tells us other things too .
As much as pundits try every four years to use Virginia and New Jersey results as precursors to next year 's congressional elections , what they actually are is post - cursors : in every election since 1989 , the two states have chosen a governor from the opposite party of the president elected the year before .
So they 're simply reacting against what America ( and often they themselves ) did 12 months prior .
Exit polls say that Obama was n't much of a factor in either state .
In Virginia , evenly divided on whether they were voting to express support for or opposition to him .
In addition , both Democrats happened to be bad candidates .
And both results , New Jersey 's especially , tell us that a financial crisis is a lousy time to be a governor .
I hate to be so tacky as to insert a bit of substance into a political column , but since the crisis hit 14 months ago , 31 states have raised taxes and most have chopped all manner of services .
All but a handful of governors sank below 50 % , as Chris Christie in New Jersey and Bob McDonnell almost surely will by next summer or fall , when voters re-learn the old lesson that it is n't possible to cut taxes while improving services after all .
The McDonnell victory was widely expected , the Christie win certainly not a shocker .
But the night 's most surprising outcome , and the one with the most significant and least predictable impact , came in the high - profile race in a congressional district in upstate New York , where Democrat Bill Owens pulled off an upset against a Conservative , Doug Hoffman .
It was a special election , to fill a vacancy .
The local GOP mandarins put up a veteran politician , a moderate woman .
The national right - wing went ballistic – she 's pro-choice , among other thought crimes – and rallied around Hoffman ( New York state has a multi- party system , so Hoffman was the nominee of the Conservative party ) .
The Republican , Dede Scozzafava , was surrounded and attacked by the likes of Sarah Palin , Glenn Beck and others .
Last weekend she quit the race – and then endorsed Owens .
The district voted narrowly for Obama in 2008 but has n't sent a Democrat to Congress in more than a century .
Late polling was relatively close , but it showed Hoffman ahead , and conservative Palinites across the country were licking their chops – this result , they said , will show that America is fed up with Obama 's socialist agenda .
A Hoffman win would have emboldened the Palin wing of the GOP , which has promised to find tea-party style conservatives to challenge Republican moderates in primary contests next year ( there 's only one Republican moderate left in Washington , but I suppose they see matter differently than I do ) .
A Hoffman win also would have scared moderate Democrats in Congress out of their knickers , which in turn could well have had an impact on the coming healthcare votes .
So a major bullet was dodged there , by a margin of roughly 4,200 votes , and Republican and conservative self - immolation will , delightfully , continue .
Oh yes – Mike Bloomberg .
Well , he was re-elected New York City 's mayor .
But in spending $ 100 m of his own money , against about $ 8 m spent by opponent Bill Thompson , he finally repelled a sizeable chunk of New Yorkers , because he won by a far lower - than - expected 4 % .
Maybe New Yorkers will finally say " enough " four years hence .
And finally , and sadly , a ballot proposal in Maine to outlaw gay marriage was narrowly passed .
All 30 such measures that have been placed on state ballots have passed , but there was hope that this one , in a northeastern state , might not make it .
It almost did n't .
That wall will fall soon , somewhere .
In sum , a good Republican night , but you can bet that Hoffman result , which came in after midnight , darkened their moods considerably .
It was the only major race in which the candidates were arguing about what 's going on in Washington .
The guy who runs that town still is not as despised as the right wing thinks he ought to be .
A Philippine politician was charged with mass murder on Friday after authorities accused him of ordering soldiers , police and other gunmen to kill at least 57 defenceless people in an organised slaughter .
Andal Ampatuan Jnr , a mayor in the lawless southern Philippines who until this week was an ally of President Gloria Arroyo , was charged with seven counts of murder , the government said .
" He was the one who gave the instructions .
He was among those ... who killed the victims , " Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera told reporters as she outlined the case against Ampatuan Jnr .
Devanadera also announced the suspect 's father , the leader of the Ampatuan clan and governor of Maguindanao province , was among eight other members of the powerful family under investigation and not allowed to leave the country .
An emotional Devanadera earlier on Friday gave the most detailed official account yet of Monday 's election - linked massacre , saying the female victims may have also been raped .
HBO and Martin Scorsese are officially business buddies .
The premiere cable channel has confirmed that they ’ve picked up 11 more episodes of Scorsese ’s Prohibition - era drama , “ Boardwalk Empire , ” based on the strength of the pilot that he directed .
The series , set in 1920s Atlantic City , chronicles the life of part - politician , part - gangster , Nucky Thompson ( Steve Buscemi ) .
The pilot episode was penned by “ Sopranos ” writer Terence Winter and shot in and around New York in July .
Depending on his schedule , Scorsese , who is an executive producer on the series , may direct more episodes down the line .
Production is expected to begin later this fall . —
After discussing the two page Too Big Too Fail , Too Big To Exist legislation that has been drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) and the Wall St Regulations drafted by Senator Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , Rachel gets into the meat of the topic to explain just how low the free market , conservative and Corporatist status quo will go to make a buck , and man , it 's as low as it gets .
Maddow : " . . .
As Republicans and Conservative Democrats in Congress start lining up with Corporate America and agaiinst new regulations now , consider the alliance they 're making .
Populist columnist David Sirota today made this catch from the business newsletter Inside U.S. Trade , this is a D.C. based publication on trade issues , its ' especially for people in international business .
What else are business groups worried about and lobbying against , other than the new Wall St regulations ?
I would n't believe this if I had not seen this myself , but check this out , quote . "
Business groups are worried by the potential effects of provisions banning the import of all goods made with convict labor , forced labor , or forced or indentured child labor that were included in a recent customs bill .
" American business groups are concerned , upset , worried was the actual phrase , worried about laws against using SLAVES and child labor . "
" Quote " Business sources say [ the bill ] could cause DHS to more - actively seek out imported products made with child labor , forced labor or convict labor " " OH NO !
How will Corporations save themselves from that onerous rule that you can't use SLAVES and PRISONERS and CHILDREN to mkae your products if you want to sell that product in the United States .
Darn that liberal red tape ! " " Quote " Sources conceded that this was a sensitive issue because business groups do not want to be seen as opposing strict measures guarding against human rights abuses .
However , one souce did expect a push from lobbyists closer to the Finance Committee mark up of the bill .
" Wow .
I 'm guessing that business interests are OK with something like this being discussed in a subscriber only industry newsletter publication like Inside US Trade , I 'm guessing they might NOT want it to be widely known that they 're lobbying to stop rules against SLAVERY ! "
" But actually , you never know .
The Heritage Foundation is a Conservative Think Tank that has a very high profile , uh , that is very high profile in Washington , and that maintains all sorts of websites and educational public venues to maintain their ideas , and on the Heritage Foundations " Over - Criminalized " blog , the Heritage Foundation too singles out the " Child Labor Safety Acts " which levees fines and jail time for Comapnies using child labor as an example of what they call " Trivial conduct [ that ] is now often punished as a crime .
" I mean , honestly !
Kids these days !
In my day we'd be delighted to be chained to the loom for a few pennies a day . "
" For the record , the Heritage Foundation also singles out Meil , Neil Ambercrombie 's bill against War profiteering as another example of making something trivial into a criminal matter . "
" Business interests and their think thanks friends on the right have every right to lobby on anything they want to .
Think that Wall St , despite almost destroying the whole economy of the United States , should be left to it 's own devices again ?
You know , go ahead , make your case , I 'd love to hear it .
Think that child labor and slave labor and forced convict labor are cheap and therefore cool with you , go ahead , make your case , I would LOVE to hear it .
But unless you are going to make your case for things like that in total secrecy , know that the case against you is there to be made too , and that will apply to any member of Congress who sides with you as well , you child labor endorsing , pro slavery FREAKS ! "
Often , I hesitate to use the phrase " Wage Slave " to describe the phlight of the oppressed , struggling American worker in our class war Corproatist economy out of respect to those who are actually suffering under slavery in the world today and the Americans who are descended from actual slaves .
It is an ugly subject and I wish to avoid stoking ugly memories .
But the fact that we even have to discuss the issue of FORCED SLAVE LABOR in modern day America on any level is PROOF of how low our Capitalist pig system will go to squeeze every cent they can out of other , less fortunate human beings , and all in the name of the almighty dollar .
The outsourcing fed free market system does just that , sending American jobs to places on this earth where wages are so cheap and the standard of living so low that people literally work like slaves just to be able to barely eat the next day .
The same PIGS who crashed our economy and are now preparing to fight Wall St re-regulation tooth and nail are the very same people who profit from modern day slavery and the virtual wage slavery that perpetuates the class war , both around the world , and here in America today .
They are the anti-union crowd who HATES when people organize and FIGHT BACK .
They would prefer labor that is totally OWNED by capital , and they will call anything short of their preferred unfettered , free market slave wage capitalism socialism , because , in essence , all labor movement have their distant roots in the idea that organized labor is the ONLY thing that can negotiate with the Capitalist power brokers that fought the civil war , and continue to fight war after war after war , both bloody and silent , in order to oppress and control the labor of other human beings for their own profit .
The very same business interests that use astroturfed protests against refrom are the SAME forces that fight anti-SLAVERY laws today , TODAY , in an America that is actually two America 's , one where there is a roaring 20's right now for the fortunate and a Great Depression 2.0 for everyone else .
The veil , soon , will come off on the class war , if it has not already , and the Republicans and Conservative / Moderate Democrats who will fight these reforms on behalf of their Corporate masters will soon be revealed as the tools that they are , because you can NOT be a populist and fight on behalf of the moneyed powers for too long before you are exposed for what you are , and it is our job to expose them .
But know this , and remember itwhen you fight and confront the Corporatism that lies at the heart of the Conservative movement and their fake populist enablers .
They would enslave you too if they could , and they are doing everything they can to reduce the American worker to the wage slaves that they seek .
By driving up unemployment they force us to fight for smaller and smaller wages , by privatizing the public sector and de-regulating business they drive prices and profits up reduce the social saftey net to the size where it can be drowned in a bath tub .
What evil lurks in the hearts of men ?
Probably the same evil that lets men fight to allow slavery elsewhere while feigning to fight on behalf of liberty , justice and the American way over here .
We are at class war , against a model that would rob you for profit , deny you and your family their health for profit and literally enslave your fellow man , all for 30 pieces of gold .
The Class War will NOT be televised , rather , it will be traded on Wall St and defended by the lobbyists who seek to kill Democracy and replace it with a kinder , gentler slavery , available at Walmart in a neighborhood near you .
So , the next time you are confronted by a Conservative , take pity on the poor fool , and try to educate them about the fact that they are fighting FOR the slave masters , they are fighting FOR their own enslavement to a slave wage for profit system that they call freedom while they fight the imagined tyranny that their slave masters call it when we try to take their right to enslave people away from them .
Lord , what fools we mortals be ?!

Following requests for feedback in April , the W3C finally launched their sparkly new website on 13 October .
The World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) is an international community of organizations , full - time staff , and public members who work together to develop web standards and technology specifications ( HTML , XML , CSS , DOM , RDFa , SOAP , SVG , semantic web , etc . ) .
Until recently , those of a polite disposition would describe the website as functional rather than usable or attractive .
The W3C hope the redesign will make the site easier to navigate and more pleasant to use .
The new site is undoubtedly an improvement .
The design is clearer , far more attractive , and works on all modern browsers ( as well as IE6 ) .
A flexible layout is used which switches to a “ mobile view ” single column when the browser viewport width is reduced below 481 pixels .
It ’s a nice touch , although I ’m not convinced many mobile users have an urgent need to access the site ?
The content is as thorough as ever , although it ’s evident some pages are incomplete .
The first sections I visited were browsers and authoring tools — these are of significant interest to developers , yet no content is available ?
It ’s understandable that the site and specifications will evolve , but why provide a home page link to missing content ?
Behind the scenes , the site uses XHTML 1.0 strict throughout and every page I tested passed validation .
Ironically , the CSS does not validate primarily because of numerous IE6 hacks .
Neither does the site pass automated accessibility validation : form controls have missing labels , there are linking issues , and descriptive meta tags are not used .
The “ view : desktop , mobile , print ” control at the top of the page is powered by JavaScript .
Unfortunately , it lacks progressive enhancement : the control never appears if JavaScript is disabled or unavailable in your browser .
That strikes me as slightly bizarre : a control which benefits mobile users will probably fail on many mobile devices ?
The view control is the only JavaScript functionality I could find .
So why does the site require the full jQuery library and a cookie plugin ?
I ’ve nothing against jQuery , but a better standalone widget code could have been developed which was a fraction of the download size and supported more browsers .
Perhaps I ’m being a little overly - critical , but should n’t the W3C lead by example ?
I like their new site , but it would be better if the developers had followed the guidelines they were publishing .
What do you think of the new W3C site ?
Should they fix the validation and accessibility problems ?
Or are they simply using the hacks and shortcuts many web developers use on a daily basis ?

DETROIT ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Most people assume the Packard Plant in Detroit is vacant .
It 's an industrial ruin where the last car was manufactured 53 years ago .
Almost all the windows are blown out .
Collapsed walls litter the overgrown sidewalks with broken bricks , mixed with charred metal and shattered glass .
But one tenant remains headquartered among the vines , rust and graffiti .
Where 11,000 employees once clocked in , now just 10 workers for Chemical Processing Inc. show up each morning .
Running a business in a facility widely assumed to be deserted has its challenges .
The address surprises customers .
The landlord does n't make repairs .
And sometimes , scrappers steal your power lines .
It 's happened to Chemical Processing President Bruce Kafarski a half - dozen times in past two years .
" People kept cutting down the electric lines for the copper , " he says .
" The city would replace the lines with aluminum , but the scrappers would n't know that till they got them down and looked .
We 'd be left for a day or two without power . "
Kafarski is remarkably unfazed by this .
He 's equally calm about the fires .
Detroit has an arson problem -- one that peaks each year in late October .
This Friday , the night before Halloween , is known locally as Devil 's Night , an evening when firebugs take to the streets to torch empty buildings .
In the '80s and early '90s , it really was hellish , residents say .
As many as 800 dwellings went up in flames each year .
Then the city cracked down and began marshaling thousands of volunteers to patrol the streets .
The fire count fell -- a bit .
But at the Packard Plant , any day can be Devil 's Night .
" During the summer the Detroit Fire Department was going there almost every day , " says Jason Frattini , a firefighter with the nearby city of Eastpointe who sometimes goes by with his camera to document the Packard Plant blazes .
In this vast , 3.5 - million - square - foot labyrinth , small fires turn into big ones before anyone takes notice .
But Chemical Processing has stayed safe from the flames .
When something ignites nearby , Kafarski and his workers intervene .
Last summer , for example , Kafarski found a fire smoldering just one floor above .
" There happened to be a pool of water nearby , " Kafarski says .
" I got a cup and a bucket .
It was pretty easy to put out . "
After 51 years in the Packard Plant , it takes a lot to ruffle Kafarski .
His father started the company in a garage just after World War II , joining Detroit 's mass of independent auto suppliers .
Chemical Processing specializes in industrial finishing services , coating small metal parts like car door latches and gears .
Work for Ford 's ( F , Fortune 500 ) suppliers brings in a big chunk of the company 's sales .
When Packard Motor Car Co. merged with Studebaker and shut down its Detroit plant , other industrial firms took up residence in the cavernous space .
In the 1960s , Chemical Processing had around 90 employees working three full shifts .
Its neighbors included shipping companies , manufacturers and dozens of other auto suppliers .
But the plant was too vast for the city once it began losing its industrial base .
By the late 1990s , it had become a decaying eyesore the city wanted to demolish .
After a long court battle , the city foreclosed on the owner for unpaid taxes and seized control of the building .
In 1997 it ordered the remaining 87 tenants to leave .
Most did .
Chemical Processing -- and the building 's owner -- clung on .
For more than a decade , an appeal went back and forth in court .
For two years the building has been back in control of landlord Romel Casab .
Even he is surprised Chemical Processing stays put .
He 's offered the company space in nicer buildings out in the suburbs .
Casab does n't fence off or guard the Packard Plant .
No one does .
The cavernous network of tunnels and collapsing buildings is completely open to explorers and vandals .
" It 's not only a local attraction .
People come from all over the country to take photos and have underground adventures , " says Bill McGraw , a former Detroit Free Press columnist who wrote about the plant frequently in his 37 years with the newspaper .
Dozens of Web sites feature the photos and stories urban spelunkers bring back from their trips .
Protecting his facility from vandals is far from Kafarski's biggest challenge .
Sales have steadily declined over the past decade , and for the last year , they 've been horrible .
Chemical Processing is barely breaking even .
" There have been times when I 've just felt like giving up , " Kafarski says .
" The people get me through .
That makes me feel like I 'm accomplishing something .
It 's just nine jobs , but I know everyone .
It 's personal .
You know their struggles , and you know what the job means to them and their families . "
But Kafarski can't continue to spend the 70 hours a week it takes to keep the firm going .
His wife passed away two years ago , leaving him to raise twin 9 - year - old daughters on his own .
" They 're my life now , " Kafarski says .
" Now , I put in 30 hours , if I 'm lucky . "
He has the opportunity to merge with another local finishing company , and the other firm 's building is better maintained -- and less likely to be burned down or condemned .
If the merger goes through , Kafarski expects he'd move over his equipment and his workers .
Still , he has a soft spot for the historic plant .
" Sometimes when I need a break , when my head needs clearing , I go and just walk the building , " says Kafarski , who studied accounting in college and never intended to return to the family business .
Like many in Detroit , Kafarski's family history is intertwined with Packard Plant .
Both of his grandfathers worked there , helping build luxury automobiles in a plant that was for years the world 's most modern manufacturing facility .
Kafarski recently found the gold watch his grandfather received when he retired from the company .
Kafarski does n't expect to pass Chemical Processing on to his daughters .
" There was always the business cycle , but you knew it would come back , " he says .
" This time , nobody expects it will come back like it did before . "
But he might one day give them his grandfather 's gold watch , and tell them the story of the Packard Plant and its 102 - year - history .
And that of the last industrial tenant left operating , fending off the city , the elements and the scavengers to fire up the machinery on its plant floor each morning .

Wife snares paedophile husband by posing as online schoolgirl using computer in room next door
A wife posed as a schoolgirl online to catch her husband using an internet chatroom to groom underage girls for sex .
Cheryl Roberts , 61 , had become concerned about the amount of time her husband David spent at his computer .
When a strongly - worded sexual message appeared on his screen while he was out , her suspicions were raised even further , a court heard .
Cheryl Roberts , 61 , was so shocked by the behaviour of her husband David Roberts ( right ) she contacted the police and the NSPCC
To her disgust , Mrs Roberts discovered that her 68 - year - old husband of 20 years had been logging on to a teenage chatroom .
The message , signed with his nickname Corky , had been sent to an underage girl , but showed on his screen again when she sent her reply .
Rather than confront him , his wife used a second computer in their home to join the same chatroom , pretending she was a 14 - year - old girl .
The court was told that the couple then exchanged messages - while he was in his private study and she was in their living room next door .
As well as sending explicit messages , Roberts even used a webcam to film himself performing a sexual act , thinking it was being watched by a young girl .
But after he propositioned the ' girl ' and asked to meet her for sex , his wife decided to act , contacting the police and the NSPCC .
When police seized his computer and found dozens of illegal child - porn images , Roberts assumed he had been caught out by routine monitoring of downloads .
He was stunned when detectives broke the news that he had actually been chatting up his wife .
Roberts , a former pub landlord who has grown - up children , denied having sex with any schoolgirls - but admitted he had been ' prepared to do so ' .
At Cardiff Crown
Court he admitted engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and making and possessing illegal images .
Although the sexual activity was actually witnessed by his wife , the fact that he intended his actions to be seen by a 14 - year - old girl meant he was charged as if this had actually been the case .
Roberts was given a three - year community order and banned from access to children under the age of 18 , in person or online .
Judge Christopher Vosper QC said he could not impose a long enough sentence for him to be treated behind bars but ordered him to attend a ' community sexual offenders group work programme ' .
He will also have to register as a sex offender for five years .
The court heard that the couple , from Bridgend , South Wales , are getting divorced .
Mrs Roberts , who has two children from a previous relationship , has moved out of their home and is staying with friends .
She said yesterday : ' I was shocked at the sentence - I do n't think he 's got what he deserves .
' I thought the judge would be a lot harder and that he might go to prison .
I still feel very angry towards him .
It is hard to think that a man you married could do this .
' But I did the right thing and I do n't regret it .
Now I just need some time to think and put all this behind me .'
Last week author Michael Pollan made a statement that upset many .
His words , " A vegan in a Hummer has a lighter carbon footprint that a beef eater in a Prius . "
Obviously his claim drew immediate criticism , but is there any truth to his words ?
Well , it turns out that Pollan was indeed wrong across the board .
Gidon Eschel and Pamela Martin from the University of Chicago decided to investigate the claims made by Pollan .
According to their research , switching from a meat eater to a vegan saved around 2 tons of CO2 per person each year .
Additionally , a Hummer emits an average of 4.76 tons of additional CO2 pollutants than a Prius does per year .
The conclusion , a vegan in a Hummer would still contribute an additional 2.76 tons of CO2 than a meat eater in a Prius would .
Pollan decided to retract his statement by saying , " After digging into it further , and consulting Gidon Eschel , I do n't feel comfortable defending [ my earlier statement ] .
It 's much more important to keep the focus on the central thrust of the environmental case against eating industrial meat , which is not in dispute and certainly does not stand or fall on the case of the vegan Hummer driver . "
Pollan is the author of The Botany of Desire , The Omnivore 's Dilemma in which he constantly opposes meat eaters and suggests they have a negative impact on the environment .
However , as we know by now , the Prius is one of the cleanest vehicles on the planet and as such should not be subjected to the claims made by Pollan .
The Prius achieves 50 mpg , does so without emitting a high amount of pollutants , sells in high volumes , and throughout its production cycle has saved millions of gallons of gas each year compared to its gasoline only counterparts .

Celtic Diva at Blue Oasis has this interesting bit of speculation on how Miss Palin has been getting around :
Sarah Palin arrived in North Carolina Sunday by way of Asheville .
She was slated to have a much - touted dinner with Franklin Graham and his father Billy .
While this is a video made by a fan ( so pardon the drippiness ) it does provide a good view of the plane she arrived on ... and the call number .
You may also see some " interesting " dynamics at play :
" Linda , Thought I would let you know .
The plane Sarah flew in to Asheville had the N number 262SP .
The SP does not stand for Sarah Palin but the plane is owned by Samaritans Purse .
I checked it out at the FAA registry .
Wonder if that plane is being used at Rochester and other book signing destinations ?
Samaritan donations being put to good use to haul Palin 's carcass around . "
As if that was not interesting enough , he wrote back later :
Tried to check the flight activity for this airplane ( N262SP ) at Flightwise.com .
The flight activity for this plane is blocked by the owner .
Guess he does n't want anyone to know where he is flying .
This is a good site to track an airplane 's activity .
Might come in handy for checking the use of AK state airplanes .
Yup , especially those Alaska planes now leased by Samaritan 's Purse up here .
It seems that one must apply to have their plane 's schedule made " private " and in doing so , a reason must be provided .
I 'd love to see the reason Franklin Graham gave for blocking access .

Heene during a CNN interview stoked the idea the family could have planned the balloon incident as a hoax to get attention .
FORT COLLINS , Colo . 
Authorities investigating the family accused of carrying out the balloon boy hoax to promote a reality show said Monday they do n't expect to bring possible charges until at least next week .
Larimer County sheriff 's spokeswoman Eloise Campanella said Monday that investigators do n't anticipate finishing their reports and presenting them to the district attorney 's office until next week .
It will then be up to prosecutors to decide whether to file charges against Richard Heene and his wife , Mayumi .
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mike Fergus confirmed Monday the agency had opened an investigation into the incident but declined to provide any details .
" Once that ( investigation ) opens up , mum 's the word until the investigation is complete , " Fergus said .
The balloon 's flight prompted the FAA to suspend northbound departures from Denver International Airport for about 20 minutes on Thursday afternoon , said airport spokesman Chuck Cannon .
Meanwhile the lawyer for the couple said Monday that he expects authorities to bring charges against his clients .
Heene family attorney David Lane , a high profile Denver defense attorney , made the media rounds Monday morning discussing his clients ' case and their willingness to turn themselves in to authorities .
" We 're not sure what charges ( the sheriff ) is even looking at yet , " Lane said .
" I 've said repeatedly I need to see what evidence they 've got . "
Lane said " The whole Heene family feels that they are in fact under seige at this point . "
Lane 's interviews came a day after the Larimer County sheriff 's Office said it had evidence the " balloon boy " incident was an orchestrated publicity stunt to promote a reality TV show .
The Heenes , of Fort Collins , Colo. , triggered a frantic rescue effort when they reported that their 6 - year - old son had floated away in a helium balloon .
The parents had been planning Thursday 's drama for at least two weeks to help land a deal for a TV show , Larimer Country Sheriff Jim Alderden said Sunday .
" They put on a very good show , … and we bought it , " he said .
The couple met in acting school , he said .
TV viewers were riveted by the 50 - mile flight of the UFO - like balloon , which they thought was carrying little Falcon Heene .
After it touched down and he was not inside , a search continued until he was found at home .
The boy said he had been hiding .
LOCAL COVERAGE : Balloon family faces felony charges HELPER : Researcher says he worked on UFO hoax VIDEO : Father denies scare was hoax AUDIO : Family calls 911 ON DEADLINE : Was media full of hot air ?
Alderden said he would recommend the district attorney file charges of conspiracy , contributing to the delinquency of a minor , attempting to influence a public servant and making a false report to authorities .
He declined to say whether the couple had confessed .
Alderden said if the district attorney 's office goes forward with the charges , deputies will seek restitution to cover its costs of the search .
The dollar amount that would be sought was not immediately available .
Alderden also said his office will consult with the Federal Aviation Administration and the FBI on whether federal charges are warranted .
Lane said Monday the whole event has been a " nightmare for the family . "
" These folks are absolutely willing to turn themselves in , " he said .
" I do n't want to see a perp walk done for media consumption in this case .
I do n't think it 's humane to arrest people in front of their children , especially when they 've agreed to turn themselves in . "
In addition to drawing up possible felony charges against Heene , investigators say they want to question an associate of his after e-mails surfaced showing the two had discussed a balloon hoax months ago as part of a public relations campaign for the reality show .
Robert Thomas of Denver claimed Heene had told him he was planning a media stunt to promote a proposed reality show .
Thomas , a self - described researcher , sold his story to Gawker.com and provided the website with e-mail exchanges between him and Heene .
Thomas said the show would feature Heene as a mad scientist who carries out various scientific experiments .
" This will be the most significant UFO - related news event to take place since the Roswell Crash of 1947 , and the result will be a dramatic increase in local and national awareness about The Heene Family , our Reality Series , as well as the UFO Phenomenon in general , " according to a copy of the show 's proposal provided to the site by Thomas .
Gawker.com editor - in- chief Gabriel Snyder confirmed the New York - based website paid Thomas , but declined to say how much for the story billed with the headline : " Exclusive : I Helped Richard Heene Plan a Balloon Hoax . "
Snyder said Thomas was planning to meet with investigators , though sheriff 's officials did not return messages seeking confirmation .
Messages left for Thomas by the Associated Press were not returned .
Thomas , 25 , said in his Gawker.com story that the plan he knew about did not involve Heene 's children .
The couple 's three boys , 6 , 8 and 10 , were " 100 % involved " but are unlikely to face charges , Alderden said .
Larimer County 's Child Protection Services will investigate whether they are in danger , he said .
The Heenes , who have appeared on ABC TV's Wife Swap , describe themselves as storm chasers .
Alderden said Richard Heene has a high school education and is a contractor who lays tile .
As for a " nutty professor " image , the sheriff said , " He may be nutty , but he 's not a professor . "
A handwritten note taped to the Heenes ' front door said : " Thank you for all of your support .
We are not taking any interview anymore .
We are tired .
Thank you . "
" This thing has become so convoluted , " Richard Heene told the Associated Press while shopping at Walmart with his wife and sons Sunday , tears welling in his eyes .
Alderden said the Heenes ' story seemed believable at first , partly because they gave officers access to the house and children .
The " a - ha moment " came as the family was interviewed that night on CNN , he said .
When Richard Heene asked Falcon why he did n't come out when he heard his parents calling his name , the boy said , " You guys said that we did this for the show . "
Alderden said the Heenes were in talks about a TV deal and might have thought the project needed a " spark . "
His office is investigating whether the couple conspired with anyone else , such as an entertainment program , to stage Falcon 's disappearance .
He said he would seek restitution for the search but is doubtful the family could pay .
" I do n't think there 's much to recover , " he said .

Mike ’s Nature trick
by Jean S on November 20th , 2009
So far one of the most circulated e-mails from the CRU hack is the following from Phil Jones to the original hockey stick authors – Michael Mann , Raymond Bradley , and Malcolm Hughes .
From : Phil Jones
To : ray bradley , mann@xxxxx.xxx , mhughes@xxxx.xxx Subject : Diagram for WMO Statement Date : Tue , 16 Nov 1999 13:31:15 +0000 Cc : k.briffa@xxx.xx.xx ,t.osborn@xxxx.xxx
Dear Ray , Mike and Malcolm , Once
Tim ’s got a diagram here we ’ll send that either later today or first thing tomorrow .
I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) amd from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline .
Mike ’s series got the annual land and marine values while the other two got April - Sept for NH land N of 20N .
The latter two are real for 1999 , while the estimate for 1999 for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90 .
The Global estimate for 1999 with data through Oct is +0.35 C cf. 0.57 for 1998 .
Thanks for the comments , Ray .
Cheers Phil Prof. Phil Jones Climatic Research Unit Telephone +44 ( 0 ) xxxxx School of Environmental Sciences Fax +44 ( 0 ) xxxx University of East Anglia Norwich Email p.jones@xxxx.xxx

The e-mail is about WMO statement on the status of the global climate in 1999 - report , or more specifically , about its cover image .
Back in December 2004 John Finn asked about “ the divergence ” in Myth vs. Fact Regarding the “ Hockey Stick ” - thread of RealClimate.org .
Whatever the reason for the divergence , it would seem to suggest that the practice of grafting the thermometer record onto a proxy temperature record – as I believe was done in the case of the ‘ hockey stick ’ – is dubious to say the least .
mike ’s response speaks for itself .
No researchers in this field have ever , to our knowledge , “ grafted the thermometer record onto ” any reconstrution .
It is somewhat disappointing to find this specious claim ( which we usually find originating from industry - funded climate disinformation websites ) appearing in this forum .
But there is an interesting twist here : grafting the thermometer onto a reconstruction is not actually the original “ Mike ’s Nature trick ” !
Mann did not fully graft the thermometer on a reconstruction , but he stopped the smoothed series in their end years .
The trick is more sophisticated , and was uncovered by UC over here .
( Note : Try not to click this link now , CA is overloaded .
Ca n’t even get to it myself to mirror it . - A )
When smoothing these time series , the Team had a problem : actual reconstructions “ diverge ” from the instrumental series in the last part of 20th century .
For instance , in the original hockey stick ( ending 1980 ) the last 30 - 40 years of data points slightly downwards .
In order to smooth those time series one needs to “ pad ” the series beyond the end time , and no matter what method one uses , this leads to a smoothed graph pointing downwards in the end whereas the smoothed instrumental series is pointing upwards — a divergence .
So Mann ’s solution was to use the instrumental record for padding , which changes the smoothed series to point upwards as clearly seen in UC ’s figure ( violet original , green without “ Mike ’s Nature trick ” ) .
TGIF - magazine has already asked Jones about the e-mail , and he denied misleading anyone but did remember grafting .
“ No , that ’s completely wrong .
In the sense that they ’re talking about two different things here .
They ’re talking about the instrumental data which is unaltered – but they ’re talking about proxy data going further back in time , a thousand years , and it ’s just about how you add on the last few years , because when you get proxy data you sample things like tree rings and ice cores , and they do n’t always have the last few years .
So one way is to add on the instrumental data for the last few years . ”
Jones told TGIF he had no idea what me meant by using the words “ hide the decline ” .
“ That was an email from ten years ago .
Can you remember the exact context of what you wrote ten years ago ? ”
Maybe it helps Dr. Jones ’s recollection of the exact context , if he inspects UC ’s figure carefully .
We here at CA are more than pleased to be able to help such nice persons in these matters .

Shropshire sky diver Paul Lewis has described the moment his parachutes became tangled during a 10,000 ft jump .
The 40 - year - old crashed on to a warehouse roof near Tilstock Airfield in Whitchurch , while filming for the Parachute Centre on 14 August .
He had attempted to deploy his main parachute about 40 seconds after jumping from the aircraft .
But when it failed to open properly he released it and deployed his reserve , only to encounter the same problem .
Mr Lewis said both chutes opened but suffered twists , then he went unconscious .
The American Food Supply : Full Of Rat Excrement , Maggots And Insect Heads
Do you know what you are eating ?
Most Americans simply do not understand that the FDA actually allows rat excrement , maggots and insect heads to be put into their food .
The FDA only allows a small amount of these things , but they do explicitly allow them .
You do n't believe this ?
Well , you can read it for yourself .
The FDA has published a pamphlet entitled “ The Food Defect Action Levels : Levels of Natural or Unavoidable Defects in Foods That Present No Health Hazards for Humans ” that tells food producers exactly how many " natural contaminants " are allowed in our food .
The following are just some examples of the allowable levels of " natural contaminants " that the FDA lists in the pamphlet .....
Canned Citrus Juices ( such as orange juice ) - 5 or more Drosophila and other fly eggs per 250 ml or 1 or more maggots per 250 ml
Cornmeal - Average of 25 or more insect fragments per 25 grams
Cranberry Sauce - Average mold count of 15 %
Fig Paste - 13 or more insect heads per 100 grams of fig paste
Macaroni And Noodle Products - Average of 225 insect fragments or more per 225 grams
Mushrooms -
Average of over 20 or more maggots of any size per 100 grams of drained mushrooms
Crushed Oregano - Average of 300 or more insect fragments per 10 grams
Peanut Butter - Average of 30 or more insect fragments per 100 grams
Spinach - Average of 50 or more aphids , thrips and / or mites per 100 grams
Tomato Paste , Pizza And Other Sauces -
Average of 30 or more fly eggs per 100 grams OR 15 or more fly eggs and 1 or more maggots per 100 grams
Wheat - Average of 9 mg or more rodent excreta pellets and / or pellet fragments per kilogram
Are you starting to get the picture ?
We do n't know about you , but we do not want ANY insect heads in our fig paste .
But , oh boy , if there is a 14th insect head in 100 grams of fig paste THEN the food producers get into big trouble .
No wonder so many people are getting sick from their food .
Even the ingredients in our food supply that are supposedly " safe " have been found to be quite the opposite .
Remember all those commercials recently that told us how safe and wonderful high fructose corn syrup is ?
Well , it turns out that definitely is not the case after all .
In one stunning new study , almost half of the tested samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup contained significant levels of mercury .
In addition , the same study found mercury in almost a third of 55 popular brand name food and beverage products where high fructose corn syrup is the first or second listed ingredient .
If you are not familiar with high fructose corn syrup , you should be .
It is in thousands of our food and beverage products .
Go into your refrigerator and look at how many products it is in .
And the truth is that it is chock full of mercury .
You see , mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal .
Among other things , mercury can cause serious brain damage , deafness and blindness .
It is incredibly harmful for humans .
But it tastes so good !
And who cares if there are insect fragments in our peanut butter ?
After all , it tastes so great on a piece of toast !
The truth is that we live in a society where it is hard to trust anyone or anything .
In the past we could eat dinner without any worries , but we are moving into a time when we are going to have to think very carefully about what we are putting into our bodies .
Please be sure that you are putting safe , healthy food products into your emergency food supply .
Catholic pastors directed to distribute anti-health reform materials at mass
by John Tomasic
This past weekend the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops instructed pastors at parishes across the country to distribute material urging Catholics to oppose the health reform bills making their way through Congress for allowing public funding of abortions .
Priests were to insert the Bishops Conference pdf leaflets and letters into parish news bulletins , distribute them at church doors or place them in pews .
They were also directed to read a statement at mass to reinforce the message .
The Lie
HEALTH CARE REFORM IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES , NOT DESTROYING THEM .
Abortion is not health care because killing is not healing .
For over 30 years , the Hyde Amendment and other longstanding and widely
supported laws have prevented federal funding of elective abortions .
Yet health care reform bills advancing in Congress violate this policy .
Americans would be forced to subsidize abortions through their taxes and health insurance premiums .
We need genuine health care reform — reform that helps save lives , not destroy them .

The truth
WASHINGTON -- Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pledged Sunday that President Barack Obama will support barring public funding for abortion in any health care overhaul legislation .
" That 's exactly what the president said and I think that 's what he intends , that the bill he signs will do , " she said on ABC's " This Week . "
at 1:45 in the video - the President says it will not fund abortions
Oddly enough , the Catholic statement instructing Priests on how to discuss this issue in the Mass also criticizes the Bill for not providing health care for immigrants - a point Republicans have been very critical of , as when Joe Wilson shouted ' You Lie ' to the President .
No matter what , we must have an HONEST discussion on this issue - from our moral leaders , especially our Churches .
It may seem that the thousands of people who converged on the University of California Berkeley 's famous Sproul Plaza , home of the free speech movement , on 24 September were simply upset about money .
Where has all the money gone ?
Who has taken it away ?
And perhaps there is no one to blame .
The University of California finds itself with a shortfall of $ 1.15 bn for the next two years , the result of an $ 813 m cut in state funding and another $ 225 m increase in costs for student enrolment .
Everyone knows that the state government is dysfunctional , that public funding decreased by 40 % between 1990 and 2005 and that this year alone brought another 20 % reduction , accelerating the abandonment of the premiere public university by a California legislature fully paralysed by minority rule ( a two - thirds majority is required for sealing any budgetary deal ) and Proposition 13 ( the 1978 ban on increasing property taxes that strangleholds any attempt to increase revenues for public services ) .
It would seem like UC faces the same situation as other public services and institutions : layoffs , cutbacks , decreased services and the prospect of a seriously compromised education for undergraduates and graduates alike .
So what 's the problem ?
Mid-summer , when no one was around , UC president Mark Yudof invoked " emergency powers " to implement furloughs on staff and faculty , and sent word to campuses that drastic cuts had to be made in operating expenses .
Claiming that the UC system has no funds from which to draw in such dire moments , Yudof devised a plan , which includes a graduated salary reduction programme for staff and faculty .
One might have expected faculty and staff to understand the dire circumstances that led to these lamentable cuts .
But it became clear that certain cuts actually devastated some programmes , while others absorbed the setback with ready reserves .
The administration did not wait to reach a settlement with the unions .
The faculty briefly canvassed were certainly not party to the decision .
As a result , the bad news that deans handed down at the beginning of the semester eliminated 2,000 positions , gutted programmes that train high school teachers in science education , closed courses in East Asian languages and advanced Arabic , overburdened classrooms , shut students out of their majors , let scores of lecturers go and closed the university library on Saturday .
In addition , the administration demanded of students tuition and fee increases of nearly 40 % , imperilling the very notion of an affordable public university and forcing many students to leave the university or scramble for full - time jobs .
Yudof 's attempts to explain himself have only helped solidify a sense of outrage on the part of faculty , staff , students and the wider public .
The result is a profound and growing scepticism about Yudof 's ability to advocate for the future of the public university .
Those of us who were trying to develop a balanced critique of both the paralysis of the state economy and the questionable governance by UC administrators were incredulous when Yudof gave an interview to the New York Times Magazine in which he bragged about his own $ 800,000 salary , shamelessly displayed his anti-intellectualism , described his entry into the field of education as " an accident " and complained that he tries to speak to faculty and staff about the budget , but it is " speaking to the dead " .
Suddenly , the problem was not only fiscal – " we do n't have the money " – but a more profound loss of confidence in the mode of governance and the figure of authority entrusted with making the case for public education to the state and federal government during these hard times .
Faculty , staff and students are collectively outraged that the university has failed to make public and transparent what the cuts have been and will be , and by what criteria and set of priorities such cuts are made .
Rage also centres on the devastation of " shared governance " – the policy that faculty must be part of any decision - making that affects the academic programmes and direction of the university .
In its place , a " commission " was appointed by the administration with paltry representation by faculty .
Emphatically missing are those in the arts and humanities .
No answers are forthcoming to a set of burning questions :
Why in this age of slash and burn has the UC administration bloated by 283 % , as their own public financial reports make plain ?
And why does the university spend $ 10 m a year on inter- collegiate athletics and over $ 123 m on a new athletic centre ?
During a time of corrosive neo-liberalism and rising doubts about education and the arts as public goods worthy of state support , the administration ducks and hides – when it is not boasting about its own stupidity , failing to take up the task of making its decision - making process transparent , refusing to honour the mandate to bring in the faculty to share in establishing priorities and weakening the safeguards against a rampant privatisation of this public good that will undercut the university 's core commitment to offer an education both excellent and affordable .
Many sceptics murmured that the call for a walk out and teach in on 24 September would come to nothing .
So when over 5,000 students , staff and faculty crowded the open common of Berkeley alone ( and several thousand more on the other 10 campuses ) , every major national and international media outlet took stock .
The vocal and theatrical demands of the demonstrators were not , as governor Arnold Schwarzenegger quipped , just noise coming from another " screaming " interest group .
On the contrary , a rare solidarity among unions , students and faculty sought to " save the university " , and their cry clearly struck a chord across a broad political spectrum .
Robert Reich , former US secretary of labour , joined other faculty for a pointed speak - out the night before .
Faculty and students clustered into an array of groups , pursuing strategies from mainstream lobbying to anarchist display .
The administration was clearly shaken , and subtle hints of division among administrators could be detected .
Some congratulated the demonstrators , and others hissed .
My wager is that the walls of the university will shake again – and again – until the message is received :
This fiscal crisis is also a crisis in governance .
The administration needs to make their books transparent , re-engage shared governance and set their priorities right so that the US can continue to claim a public institution of higher learning where a student does not require loads of money to receive a superlative education .
This is the promise that we see dying at this moment , and the very thought sends us into the streets en masse .
Taking small trees from a crowded stand in the forest is much like thinning carrots in a row : the remaining plants get more light , air and nutrients .
Carrots grow longer and straighter ; trees get bigger and healthier .

And when the trees are left whole , they sequester carbon .
“ For every ton of wood , a ton and a half of carbon dioxide is locked up , ” he said , whereas producing a ton of steel releases two to five tons of carbon .
So the more whole wood is used in place of steel , the less carbon is pumped into the air .
These passive solar structures also need very little or no supplemental heat .
Tom Spaulding , the executive director of Angelic Organics Learning Center , near Rockford , Ill. , northwest of Chicago , knows about this because he commissioned Mr. Gundersen to build a 1,600 - square - foot training center in 2003 .
He said : “ In the middle of winter , on a 20 - below day , we ’re in shorts , with the windows and doors open .
And we do n’t burn a bit of petroleum . ”
“ It ’s eminently more frugal and sustainable than milling trees , ” he added .
“ These are weed trees , so when you take them out , you improve the forest stand and get a building out of it .
You have n’t stripped an entire hillside out west to build it , or used a lot of oil to transport the lumber . ”
Mr. Gundersen had a rough feeling for all of this 16 years ago , when he started building a simple A - frame house here for his first wife and their son , Ian , now 15 .
He wanted to encourage local farmers to use materials like wood and straw from their own farms to build low - cost , energy - efficient structures .
So he used small aspens that were crowding out young oaks nearby .
“ I would just carry them home and peel them , ” said Mr. Gundersen , who later realized he could peel them while they were standing , making them “ a lot lighter to haul and not so dangerous to fell . ”
Major Hasan : Soldier of Allah ; Many Ties to Jihad Web Sites Officials say accused Ft. Hood shooter used many e-mails for overseas contacts .
Nov. 12 , 2009  -- United States Army Major Nidal Hasan proclaimed himself a " soldier of Allah " on private business cards he obtained over the Internet and kept in a box at his apartment near Fort Hood , Texas .
Hasan , the alleged perpetrator of last week 's fatal shootings in Fort Hood , TX , was charged Thursday with 13 counts of premeditated murder under Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice , which can carry a sentence up to death or life imprisonment .
The cards make no mention of his military affiliation , but underneath his name he listed himself as SoA ( SWT ) .
SoA is commonly used on jihadist Web sites as the acronym for Soldier of Allah , according to investigators and experts who have studied such sites .
SWT is commonly used by Muslims as an acronym for Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala , Glory to God .
" He was making no secret of allegiances , " said former FBI agent Brad Garrett , an ABC News consultant .
" It 's one more piece of evidence that might have come out if investigators had taken a hard look at Hasan , " said Garrett .
" It does n't say he 's about to go out and shoot a bunch of people , but there 's something not quite right for an Army major to self - identify that way . "
The green and white business cards include the title Behavior Heatlh ( sic ) Mental Health and Life Skills .
Hasan listed a Maryland area mobile phone number and an aol.com e-mail address .
U.S. officials and analysts told ABCNews.com today that Hasan used multiple e-mail addresses and screen names as he contacted several jihadist web sites around the world .

In addition to his contacts with suspected al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen , authorities said there is evidence he contacted other radical sites and individuals , including some in Europe .
On Hasan 's official Army personnel record , obtained by ABCNews.com . , Hasan lists his e-mail address using the first name of Abduwall , instead of Nidal .
Abduwalli , in Arabic , means " slave of " the great protector , or God .

BEIJING : It is only the other day that China showed off its DongFeng 31A intercontinental ballistic missile , which has a range of 11,000 km capable of hitting targets in the United States .
It was a major decision to display this missile for military experts around the world to watch and behold .
Within a fortnight of displaying its power during the celebration for the 60th anniversary of the Chinese republic on October 1 , a section of the country ���s Communist Party appears worried about India���s decision to produce the Agni V missile .
The party���s organ , People���s Daily has run a report saying Agni V is similar to DongFeng 31A and capable of hitting Harbin in northern China , which is close to the Russian border .
It is not clear why the paper chose to compare Agni V with its 5,000 kms range with DongFeng 31A , which has a much longer range and has already been tested .
Agni V with its 5000 km range can hit several areas of China .
But the People���s Daily specifically mentioned Harbin at a time when Russian prime minister Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was visiting Beijing to attend the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation .
It must be understood that sensitive reports published in the People���s Daily are cleared by senior party officials .
The report has been simultaneously published in several newspapers across the country .
The paper noted that Agni - 5 is highly road - mobile , and Harbin can come within its striking range if the missile is moved to northeast India .
It said Agni - 5 can ���can reach every continent except North and South America��� .
DongFeng 31A is capable of hitting the American continent as well .
Tropical cyclones , or hurricanes as they are known in the regions bordering the Atlantic Ocean , are among nature 's fiercest manifestations , capable of releasing as much energy as 10,000 nuclear bombs .
Hurricane Katrina leveled New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast leaving more than 1,800 people dead ; Typhoon Morakot killed more people and did more damage to Taiwan than any other storm there in recorded history ; and Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar ( Burma ) and resulted in at least 146,000 fatalities .
Could the formation of these storm systems be tempered or even arrested by technical means ?
This past June , a plan to reduce the severity and frequency of hurricanes leaked to the public in the form of a patent application under Bill Gates 's name ( along with many others ) , resuscitating speculation about a scheme that has been proposed off and on since the 1960s .
The core of the idea remains the same : mixing the warm surface waters that fuel tropical cyclones with cooler waters below to drain storms of their energy .
But now Stephen Salter an emeritus professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh proposes a new — and possibly more realistic — method of mixing .
Salter has outlined in an engineering paper the design for a floating structure 100 meters in diameter — basically a circular raft of lashed - together used tires ( to reduce cost ) .
It would support a thin plastic tube 100 meters in diameter and 200 meters in length .
When deployed in the open ocean , the tube would hang vertically , descending through the warm , well - mixed upper reaches of the ocean and terminating in a deeper part of the water column known as the thermocline , where water temperatures drop precipitously .
The point of this design is to transfer warm surface water into the deeper , cooler reaches of the ocean , mixing the two together and , hopefully , cooling the sea surface .
Salter 's design is relatively simple , using a minimum of material in order to make the construction of each of his devices cheap ( millions of used tires are thrown away each year , worldwide ) ; his scheme would also require the deployment of hundreds of these devices .
Using horizontal wave action at the ocean surface , passive no -return valves would capture energy by closing after a wave has passed through them , allowing the circular interior of each device to raise the level of the seawater within the device by , on average , 20 centimeters .
The weight of the gathered warm water would thereby create downward pressure , pushing it down the tube .
The idea is that hundreds of these floating wave - powered seawater pumps would be deployed year - round in areas , such as the eastern tropical Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico , where hurricanes typically spawn or grow in intensity .
( The devices would not , as widely speculated , be deployed only in the path of a hurricane that already formed . )
Salter says he was inspired to invent his device after seeing the damage wrought by Katrina .
" I was called to a meeting at [ intellectual property firm ]
Intellectual Ventures where they wanted to talk abut hurricanes , and they were very enthusiastic about it , " he says .
The pumps have been named the Salter Sink by the firm , which patented them .
Bill Gates was in the session at which Salter proposed the pumps , according to Intellectual Ventures CEO Nathan Myhrvold , and it is the company 's policy to list as authors everyone present at a brainstorming session on the patents that are filed as a result of it .
Biological productivity could be side benefit
By mixing warm sea-surface water with the colder water beneath year - round , Salter thinks these pumps could keep the surface temperature below the 26.5 degrees Celsius threshold , beyond which the frequency and severity of hurricanes increase markedly .
Salter and some of his co-authors on the original patent think the pump might even increase the biological productivity of the seas in which it 's deployed , because it would mix nutrient - rich , deep water with warm , relatively nutrient - poor surface water .
Nutrients from deeper parts of the ocean would be brought to within 100 meters of the surface , the deepest that sunlight can penetrate and power the photosynthetic plankton that are the base of the ocean food chain .
This would be a boon to fish populations in the ecologically unproductive " biological deserts " of tropical seas where hurricanes spawn and the devices would be deployed .
In these areas , little mixing occurs and populations of plankton — and therefore fish — are limited by available nutrients .
Ricardo Letelier , a microbial oceanographer at Oregon State University , however , points out that the effects of increasing available nutrients in the ocean can be unpredictable .
" If you were to keep the pumps running continuously … you may allow phytoplankton to bloom , " he says .
" If you do it for too long , you get a successional pattern where grazers take over and recycle nutrients .
And that 's one of the problems we 've had with iron fertilization experiments — the response of biological systems are not linear . "
And Letelier warns that deep ocean waters contain a great deal more dissolved CO2 than surface waters do , because expiring plankton sink in the water column , almost like the rotting leaves on a forest floor .
In addition , the solubility of CO2 in water increases with depth and decreasing temperature .
As a result , mixing the two layers of the ocean would inevitably lead to significant transfer of CO2 from the biggest carbon sink on Earth — the ocean — to the atmosphere .
The process is similar to what happens when you open a carbonated beverage — the drop in pressure causes dissolved CO2 to come out of solution and enter the air .
Is the thermal effect sufficient to abort fledgling storms ?
Even if the pump were to succeed , bringing surface water to the depths of the ocean would have little effect on sea-surface temperatures , says Bill Smyth , a physical oceanographer and member of the Ocean Mixing Group at Oregon State University 's College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences .
That 's because the first 20 to 100 meters of the ocean above the thermocline are already so well mixed .
" If you take 20 gigawatts of heat away from surface , you think that has to cool it , but that is not necessarily true , " Smyth says .
" What it 's actually going to do is raise the base of the mixed layer .
If the base is at 50 meters , and you pump away the upper meter of the ocean , the mixed layer will then extend down to 49 meters .
It 's not that the 20 gigawatts disappear into thin air .
It 's just that it 's not doing anything useful in terms of changing sea-surface temperature . "
Salter counters that many of the areas where his pumps would be deployed , such as the Caribbean , have thermoclines that start at depths as shallow as 10 to 15 meters below the surface , thereby requiring significantly less pumping in order to strip the warm water from the top layer .
" It would just mean you 'd need to pump for longer , but then [ the ] effect would last a lot longer , " Salter says .
Are ocean thermal systems just too big for this technique ?
Letelier thinks that , based on Salter 's current plan , the scale of any deployment that would have sufficient effect on ocean temperatures to alter hurricanes would be impractically large .
And he may know whereof he speaks , because he collaborated on a different ocean - pumping scheme involving long , meter - wide plastic tubes designed to suck water from the depths .
That project failed after only 48 hours in 2006 in Hawaii but nonetheless is still being pursued by a company called Atmocean .
" I would n't be surprised if in the work of Salter you 'd need at least one of these pumps per square kilometer just to make a dent , " Letelier says .
" That is a huge endeavor .
You cannot do it , basically . "
But Salter estimates that the mean annual transfer rate of a Salter Sink from the ocean surface to the depths would be 150 cubic meters of seawater per second , or 9.5 gigawatts of power — the equivalent of 10 large nuclear or coal - fired power plants ( although this thermal energy has proved difficult to harvest ) .
So , at this rate he calculates that for hurricane alteration his plan would require hundreds of sinks , and not the millions that have been proposed in other oceanic pumping schemes , including one in which Letelier was involved .
Then , there are the shearing currents
Another concern is shearing currents .
Jonathan Nash , an oceanographer at Oregon State who is also part of the Ocean Mixing Group , points out that at the interface of the ocean 's warm surface water and the cooler water beneath a wide array of competing and reinforcing undersea streams cause powerful shearing currents in which different layers of the ocean move opposite one another at speeds ranging from 20 to 50 centimeters per second .
" Those currents will take this tube and push it sideways .
It will get flattened where the shear layer exists , " Nash says .
Salter avers that it would be possible to create a downward tube constructed of stiffer materials , but even an extremely strong structure might not be enough , Letelier says .
" In the open ocean the amount of shear that goes on in the upper 50 meters of the water column — the mixed layer — they are incredible forces , " Letelier says .
" A 100 - meter diameter and 100 - meter - deep system in the ocean is a big wall against those currents . "
The next step : Money
Despite their concerns about the plan , both Smyth and Letelier think it is worth doing more work to address the issues in the existing proposal .
Unfortunately , funds to actually build one of Salter 's devices have yet to materialize .
" We are doing early prototypes to test the idea but our business model is invention , " says Intellectual Ventures spokesperson Shelby Barnes .
" We are simply not funded to do the next level of in - depth research needed , but our inventors would be interested in collaborating if there were additional resources . "
To wit , Intellectual Ventures does not actually build any of the ideas it patents , despite the substantial fortunes of Myhrvold and others who are involved , which means a willing licensee would have to take on the project .
One use of future versions of the Salter Sink could be experiments that examine the responsiveness of the microbial communities of the ocean to mixing .
If the Salter Sink were to be evolved into a practical geoengineering scheme , preliminary experiments of this kind would be absolutely necessary , Letelier says .
" There are some pretty big holes in the thinking that need to be patched up , " Smyth says .
" In science we try not to say anything 's impossible or step on anybody 's bright idea , but stripping away the entire wind–mix layer of the ocean — that is a huge task . "
Actually the " webcartoonist lifestyle " involves massive amounts of self - loathing , drinking too much , and horrible sleep habits .
So I guess it 's still pretty much like liberal arts college .
See you tomorrow !
PARIS ( Reuters ) - A French supermarket chain said Wednesday it arranged for some of its workers to be present at a visit by ministers to one of its shops which turned into a publicity nightmare for the politicians .
Journalists accompanying Education Minister Luc Chatel and Commerce Minister Herve Novelli on a supermarket visit in a town southeast of Paris , accused the ministers of using fake shoppers when a group of well - dressed women suddenly flooded the empty aisles .
In front of television cameras the women then praised the government - backed price freeze of certain stationery supplies before the start of the new school year , journalists said .
“ The management of Intermarche took the initiative to invite a certain number of workers for the ministers ’ visit , ” the store said in a statement issued in response to the stories .
It said Chatel and Novelli had nothing to do with this plan .
Ministerial publicity stunts are not uncommon in France .
In 1990 then Tourism Minister Olivier Stirn was forced to resign after revelations a public question - and - answer session had been bolstered by paid supporters .
One of the women at the Villeneuve - le - Roi supermarket on Wednesday was Virginie Meyniel , a local politician for the ruling UMP party of which Chatel is also a member .
“ Maybe Virginie Meyniel was there by coincidence , but you could doubt it , ” said Celia Quilleret , a journalist for radio France Info .
Meyniel told Quilleret she just happened to be in the supermarket , which was mostly empty , as is usual on a quiet morning in August .
Quilleret said the women had been waiting by the stationery shelves before the ministers ’ arrival .
Left - wing newspaper Liberation said journalists had seen some of the women who met the ministers leave in a shared car , without buying anything .
A spokeswoman for Luc Chatel declined to comment and said the department was preparing a response .
The public relations service for the UMP party said it could not immediately comment .

Helmand Province , Afghanistan
With the war increasing , Air Force Pararescue has been crisscrossing the skies picking up casualties .
That ’s the Green Zone of Helmand Province , the opium capital of the world .
Those fields are the great ATM of our enemies here .
The fertilizer used to make those fields green is the same fertilizer used to make countless bombs .
We are flying in a special U.S. Air Force Pavehawk helicopter to fetch a seriously ill British soldier .
In Iraq , many of the casevacs were done by ground forces .
In other words , if we hit a bomb or got shot , soldiers would load up the dead and wounded and rush them to the CSH ( Combat Support Hospital or “ cash ” ) .
But in Afghanistan most of the fighting occurs outside the cities and far away from the base hospitals .
Rescue helicopters stationed at places like Bagram , Kandahar Airfield and Camp Bastion have been flying thousands of missions .
There are numerous helicopter rescue “ services ” in Afghanistan .
For instance , the British have MERTs ( Medical Emergency Response Teams ) that fly in a CH - 47 , and the U.S. Army uses Pavehawks as does the U.S. Air Force .
Special operations teams normally cover their own evacuations .
This U.S. Army rescue helicopter parked at Camp Bastion ( Helmand ) flies with the red cross symbol allowing the enemy to get a better aim at the helicopter .
Unfortunately , by displaying the red cross symbol , the helicopters are not allowed to carry miniguns or other large weapons .
This seems a rather questionable decision given that the Taliban and other enemies could not give a hoot about law .
It is unclear why the Army decided that a red cross provides more protection than miniguns .
These Air Force “ Pedro ” rescue helicopters have two miniguns each ( total of four miniguns ) , and the PJs all carry M - 4 rifles .
They do fire those weapons in combat .
In July , a helicopter swooped down during a rescue and picked up some wounded soldiers and then was shot down .
The second Air Force helicopter had to get the U.S.
Army patients off the bird that had been shot down .
But there was not enough room in the second bird for the Pedro crew .
( No injuries . )
So the tiny Army OH - 58 Kiowa helicopters flew out — Kiowas only seat two people and both seats were full — and some of the Pedro folks had to clip onto the skids and fly out like James Bond .
The damaged helicopter was left behind .
Bullets had hit a fuel line and caused the fuel to leak out , and so the pilot had no trouble landing , but the helicopter was now stuck in the middle of nowhere .
So after the Pedros rescued U.S. soldiers who then rescued Pedros , other soldiers flew out to rescue the Pedro helicopter .
The plan was to cut off the rotors and have a bigger helicopter use a cable to lift out the Pavehawk and fly it back to base .
But when the soldiers started using a saw on the rotors , sparks hit the fuel that had leaked and the Pavehawk burned to the ground .
The Army killed the Air Force ’s helicopter .
The helicopters take hits .
On another mission in Helmand , an RPG shot through the tail but luckily it missed the transmission ; if the RPG had hit the transmission , the entire crew likely would have been killed .
And so . . . those miniguns come in handy .
The gunners are great shots and can return accurate fire within seconds .
Some readers have gotten upset that I call them “ Pedro , ” thinking the name is secret .
The concern is welcome but not warranted in this case .
The Pedros do n’t care and they even have a Pedro patch .
It is quite ironic that the state that introduced the practice of no - fault divorce to the country and forever changed marriage would want to stop divorce entirely .
Here ’s a quick history lesson for all of you , in 1970 , State Assemblyman Jim Hayes of Long Beach was going through a nasty divorce .
To make life easier for people like himself he introduced a bill , which resulted in the nation ’s most progressive no - fault divorce law .
The first full year of the no-fault law , the state registered a record 112,942 divorces , a 28 percent increase from just the year before .
To put that number in perspective consider that , in 1960 , there had been only 105,352 marriages in California .
By 1980 , embarrassed by the divorce plague in their midst , California lawmakers implemented a quick fix of world class caliber : they would no longer keep or publish statistics .
Anyway , now RescueMarriage.org , has proposed an amendment would change California ’s constitution , to eliminate the ability of married couples to get divorced .
They could , however , still seek an annulment .
Its not on the ballot yet and would require 700,000 signatures to get an up or down vote .
The measure is being pushed by those who support gay marriage to make a point to those who argued for Proposition 8 last year .
Remember those people saying that gay marriage should be banned because it ruins the sanctity of marriage and the family unit ?
Well this campaign is a direct , and hilarious , response to them .
I think I ’m more excited for the opposition ’s response than anything .

Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband acknowledged anxieties about nuclear power but said it had a " relatively good " safety record in this country .
" The basic message here is , we can't say no to all of the nuclear or all of the low carbon fuels that are out there , " he told GMTV .

" We need nuclear , we need renewables , we need clean coal , we need all of those things if we are going to make that transition to cleaner energy . "
Mr Miliband was speaking as he was due to announce a series of national policy statements which would include a list of sites deemed suitable for new nuclear developments .
Under changes to the planning laws , the Infrastructure Planning Commission ( IPC ) will be able to speed through the proposals for new schemes if it decided they fitted in with the policy statements .
But shadow energy secretary Greg Clark said that a simple ministerial statement on the issue was inadequate and called for a Commons vote to give the process " democratic legitimacy " .
" It is a national emergency and it's been left far too late - we 've known for the last 10 years that most of our nuclear power fleet would come to the end of its planned life , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" So whatever happens with these statements we 've got a black hole , but actually we do need a different planning system , we need a fast track for major items of infrastructure .
" The trouble with the way the Government 's doing it is , it has no democratic component .
The statements will just be read out to MPs without a vote and the decisions will be taken by an unelected , unaccountable official .

" We think it should be a minister taking that decision , accountable to Parliament , with the necessary time limit , about three months , so it does n't delay the process .
" But it does need to have democratic legitimacy otherwise people will find this an imposition that they will rail against . "
Mr Miliband said it would not be his decision about whether a new nuclear power station is built in an area .
" It is not going to be a decision for me , it is going to be a decision for an independent commission that will take a view about what the local feeling is , " he said .
The proposed changes contrast with examples such as the six - year struggle to steer the Sizewell B power station through the planning process , and is likely to encourage foreign firms such as E.ON , RWE npower and EDF to produce a new fleet of UK power stations that could be up and running by 2017 .
Alongside nuclear power , the Government will issue draft policy statements setting out the national need for new energy infrastructure including renewables , fossil fuels , gas and infrastructure , as well as an overarching energy statement .
Green groups expressed dismay at the prospect of new nuclear power and warned the Government could be open to legal challenge if the statements do not properly consider climate change .
They have also raised concerns that people will not be able to influence decisions on major projects because schemes covered by the statements will not be subject to public inquiry .
But the Government insists firms will have to work closely with local regions and show they have consulted widely to gain approval .
The statements are expected to cite the finite nature of fossil fuels and the pressing demands of climate change while making the case for nuclear power stations .
Mr Miliband will also set out the financial and regulatory framework for driving forward clean coal " carbon capture and storage " technology , but Greenpeace said neither should be part of Britain 's future energy mix .
Robin Oakley , head of the group 's climate and energy campaign , said : " Nuclear is a dangerous and expensive irrelevance to tackling climate change and providing real energy security .
" We do n't need coal or nuclear , because proven green technologies such as wind and combined heat and power stations can secure Britain 's energy needs , create green jobs and slash our emissions . "
Friends of the Earth executive director Andy Atkins said the battle against climate change should be at the core of all Government decisions to meet commitments on reducing emissions .
And he added : " Building new nuclear reactors is not the answer to the challenges of climate change and energy security .
" Nuclear power leaves a deadly legacy of radioactive waste that remains highly dangerous for tens of thousands of years and costs tens of billions of pounds to manage .
" And building new plants would divert precious resources from developing safe renewable power , while doing little to bring about the urgent emissions reductions that are desperately needed within the next decade . "
Mr Miliband , who will unveil the draft national policy statements to the Commons , said they were crucial for the shape of Britain 's future energy supply .
" We know the low - carbon transition is a huge challenge , " he said .
" We now need to move on to getting the actions in place to make it happen .
" That is why the national policy statements and Infrastructure Planning Commission are important , because the truth is that we are not going to be able to deliver a 21st century energy system with a 20th century planning system . "
It was not a very good week for my sleeper picks for Week 2 ( click here for the original article )
JaMarcus Russell – 7 - 24 , 109 yards , 0 TD , 0 INT
LeSean McCoy – 5 carries for 18 yards ; 4 receptions for 37 yards
Antwaan Randle - El – 4 receptions for 39 yards
Vernon Davis – 2 receptions for 32 yards
Wow , none of those players did much to help fantasy owners .
Keep in mind that these weekly picks are always going to be extremely risky , that ’s why they are considered sleepers .
They are more along the lines of those who have the potential to breakout and can be used in case of an emergency .
So , with that said , let ’s take a look at some deep sleepers for the upcoming fantasy week :
Jason Campbell – Washington Redskins – @ Detroit
He really has n’t been that bad , throwing for 453 yards , but only 1 TD and 1 INT .
His season did kick off against the New York Giants , where he faced constant pressure from one of the elite defenses in the game .
Last week he had the Rams , a team far less imposing .
Though they failed to find the end zone , he did throw for 242 yards .
This week the Redskins face another sub par defensive unit in the Lions , a team who has allowed 255.5 yards per game in the early going , as well as 8 TD threw the air , by far the most in the league ( second place is 5 ) .
While Drew Brees and company are partially to blame , we all honestly know that they just are n’t the best defense in the league .
Campbell also has Santana Moss at his disposal , a player who is just aching to have a huge breakout performance .
He had over 1,000 yards receiving last season , but to date has just 41 yards on 5 catches .
This week could easily be his coming out party , and with it should come a solid performance from Campbell , making owners in two - QB leagues happy .

Chansi Stuckey – New York Jets – vs. Tennessee
The Titans have given up the most receiving yards in the game , at 339 / game over the season ’s first two weeks .
Mark Sanchez , who was limited in the first half to just five throws , went off in the second half and really showed that he has the potential to put up strong games no matter what the circumstances .
Stuckey has shown that he has a good rapport with the rookie , completing 8 passes for 101 yards and 1 TD .
The Jets have shown that they are willing to put the game in the hands of the passing group and given the struggles of the Titans defense , this could be the week that he really has a big game .
Owned in 14 % of Yahoo Leagues and 7.9 % of ESPN Leagues
Ricky Williams – Miami Dolphins – vs. San Diego
It is Ronnie Brown who garners most of the attention in Miami , thanks to the focus he gets in the Wildcat formation .
Williams , however , has been extremely impressive in the early going and certainly has the potential to bring value in those leagues that use a flex option .
He has rushed for 108 years on 26 carries , averaging over 4 yards per carry , while also catching 3 passes for 22 yards and a TD .
The Chargers are in the bottom ten in the league in rushing yards allowed ( 139 per game ) , facing two teams that do not focus as strong a running game as the Dolphins ( Raiders & Ravens ) .
Look for the Dolphins to try and hammer out the running game once again , which could bring a big game for Williams .

CHAPTER 5 MARKSMANSHIP TRAINING
Marksmanship training is conducted in three phases .
Section I of this chapter discusses the first phase , preliminary marksmanship training ( nonfiring individual skill proficiency ) .
Section II discusses the second , phase , basic gunnery , during which the soldier learns to apply the fundamentals of gunnery and to zero the M203 during qualification exercises in day , NBC , and night conditions .
The third phase , advanced gunnery , is discussed in Chapter 6 .
Every phase has the same three objectives : to teach each grenadier to hit the target accurately with the first round , to adjust fire , and to do both quickly .
WARNING
BEFORE ALLOWING ANYONE TO MOVE BETWEEN STATIONS , ENSURE THAT ALL RIFLES AND GRENADE LAUNCHERS HAVE BEEN CLEARED , THAT BOLTS REMAIN TO THE REAR , AND THAT BARREL ASSEMBLIES REMAIN IN THE OPEN POSITION .
ANYONE OBSERVING AN UNSAFE ACT SHOULD CALL " CEASE FIRE " AND NOTIFY RANGE PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY .
Section I. PRELIMINARY MARKSMANSHIP TRAINING
Grenadiers and leaders must master marksmanship fundamentals before firing individually or collectively .
During preliminary marksmanship training , grenadiers learn and demonstrate the individual skills that prepare them to fire live ammunition .
After learning the characteristics and mechanics of the weapon ( Chapters 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , they learn the four fundamentals of marksmanship .
These are followed by sight manipulation and response to fire commands .
Dry - fire exercises are excellent for training to proficiency .
Good preliminary marksmanship instruction ( PMI ) improves individual proficiency , which in turn improves the proficiency of collective fire .
5 - 1. FOUR FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKSMANSHIP
The four fundamentals of M203 marksmanship are steady position , aiming , breathing , and trigger control .
When the soldier changes his position , only the first fundamental ( steady position ) varies .
The other three remain the same .
a. Steady Position .
This varies according to the position .
(1) Prone position .
If you fire prone , try to use a prone supported position ( Figure 5 - 1 ) .
( a) Lie face down , grasp the M16 pistol grip with your right hand and place the butt of the rifle into the pocket of your right shoulder .
( b ) Lower your right elbow to the ground so your shoulders are level .
This places the weight of your body behind the weapon , which enables you to recover quickly each time you fire .
( c ) Grasp the rifle magazine with your left hand .
Straighten your upper body , and spread your legs a comfortable distance apart .
Try to point your toes outward and relax your ankles , so your heels will rest on the ground .
Relax the weight of your upper body forward onto your left arm .
( d) For ranges greater than 150 meters , lower the buttstock of the weapon to obtain the proper sight alignment and sight picture .
Grip firmly to prevent this from moving the weapon from your shoulder pocket .
WARNING
ENSURE THE SLING IS CLEAR OF THE WEAPON MUZZLE

( d) Move the butt of the rifle into the pocket of your right shoulder , still holding the rifle pistol grip with your right hand .
( e ) Rest your right elbow on the inside of your right knee .
( f ) Pull the weapon down slightly with your left hand , and pull it to the rear firmly with your right hand .
( g ) For ranges greater than 150 meters , lower the buttstock of the weapon to obtain the proper sight alignment and sight picture .
Grip firmly to prevent this from moving the weapon from your shoulder pocket .
( 4 ) Sitting position , cross-ankled .
Figure 5 - 4 shows the cross-ankled sitting position .
To assume this position --
(a) Sit facing the target half right .
( b) Extend your legs from your body , and cross your left ankle over your right ankle .
( c ) Keep both ankles straight .
( d) Grasp the rifle magazine with your left hand and the rifle pistol grip with your right .
( e ) Place your left upper arm across your left knee .
( f ) Move the butt of the rifle into the pocket of your right shoulder .
( g ) Lower your right elbow so that your upper right arm is in contact with your right knee .
( h)
For ranges greater than 150 meters , lower the buttstock of the weapon to obtain the proper sight alignment and sight picture .
Grip firmly to prevent this from moving the weapon from your shoulder pocket .
( 5 ) Sitting position , cross-legged .
Figure 5 - 5 shows the cross -legged sitting position .
To assume this position --
(a) Sit down facing the target half right .
( b ) Cross your left leg over your right leg , and draw both feet close to your body .

( g ) For ranges greater than 150 meters , lower the buttstock of the weapon to obtain the proper sight alignment and sight picture .
Grip firmly to prevent this from moving the weapon from your shoulder pocket .
( 6 ) Squatting position .
Figure 5 - 6 shows the squatting position .
( a) Turn half right to the target , and with your feet a comfortable distance apart , squat as low as you can , keeping both feet flat on the ground .
( b ) Grasp the rifle magazine with your left hand .
( c ) Place your left upper arm inside your left knee and the butt of the stock into the pocket of your right shoulder , then grasp the rifle pistol grip properly .
( d) Lower your right elbow against the inside of your right knee .
( e )
For ranges greater than 150 meters , lower the buttstock of the weapon to achieve proper sight alignment and sight picture .
Grip firmly to prevent this from moving the weapon from your shoulder pocket .
( 7 ) Fighting position .
If you fire from a fighting position , try to use support ( Figure 5 - 7 ) .
( a) Place your right foot against the rear of the fighting position , then lean forward until your chest is against its forward edge .
( b ) Grasp the magazine with your left hand .
( c ) Place your left elbow on or against solid support .
( d) Use your right hand to position the butt of the stock in the pocket of your right shoulder , then grasp the rifle pistol grip properly .
( e )
Place your right elbow on or against a solid support , and relax into a comfortable firing position .
( f ) For ranges greater than 150 meters , lower the buttstock of the weapon to achieve proper sight alignment and sight picture .

NOTE :
The weapon must not touch the support .
(8) Standing position .
Figure 5 - 8 shows the standing position .
( a) Face the target standing , and spread your feet a comfortable distance apart .
( b) Grasp the rifle pistol grip with your right hand and the rifle magazine with your left hand .
Then place the butt of the stock into your right shoulder so that the sight is level with your eyes .
( c ) Hold your right elbow high to form a good pocket for the butt of the stock and to permit a strong rearward pressure with your right hand .
( d) Hold most of the weight of the weapon with your left hand .
( e ) Shift your feet until you achieve a natural aiming stance .
( f ) For ranges greater than 150 meters , lower the buttstock of the weapon to obtain the proper sight alignment and sight picture .
Grip firmly to prevent this from moving the weapon from your shoulder pocket .
b. Aiming .
Aiming procedures for every position are as follows :
(1) Aligning sight .
When using the leaf sight , align it with the front sight post of the M16 .
When using the quadrant sight , align its rear sight aperture with its front sight post .
Picture a horizontal line through the center of the leaf sight or rear sight aperture .
The top of the M16's front sight post should touch this line .
Picture a vertical line through the center of the leaf sight or rear sight aperture .
This line should vertically dissect the front sight post ( Figure 5 - 9 ) .
(2) Focusing .
For either sight , focus on the front sight post ; a good firing position places your eye directly on line with the center of the leaf sight or rear sight aperture .
Your eye 's natural ability to center objects in a circle and seek the point of greatest light will help you align the sight correctly .
( 3 ) Obtaining sight picture .
To achieve a correct sight picture , align the front sight post and leaf sight or rear sight aperture with the target .
For area targets , aim where the round 's bursting radius will make the round most effective .
For point targets , aim at the target 's center of mass .
c. Breathing .
The technique for breathing is the same for every position : Breathe naturally .
Exhale most of your air , hold your breath , and fire before you become uncomfortable .
In combat , just choke off your breath before firing .
d. Trigger Control .
The technique for trigger control is the same for every position .
Place your trigger finger ( the index finger of your left hand ) , between the first joint and the tip of your finger ( not at the extreme end of your finger ) on the trigger .
Adjust for your hand size and grip .
Then , squeeze your trigger finger to the rear without disturbing the lay of the weapon .
5 - 2. LIMITED VISIBILITY
The fundamentals of marksmanship are almost the same in limited visibility as in normal visibility .
The best field - expedient method for firing the M203 grenade launcher is the marked - sling method .
a. Steady Position .
An M203 with an AN / PVS - 4 mounted on it leans to the left .
When assuming a steady position , the grenadier must apply more rearward pressure to compensate for the lean , then steady the weapon .
b. Aiming .
The grenadier sights with the reticle of the AN / PVS - 4 rather than with the M203's iron sights .
Sighting this way requires him to change position , which breaks his stock weld and makes the weapon seem heavier .
c. Breathing .
Though breathing itself is affected little by limited visibility , using night vision devices ( NVDs ) that magnify the field of view increases the effect of weapon movement caused by breathing .
d. Trigger Control .
This is the same regardless of visibility conditions .
The objective is to keep the weapon aligned with the target .
e. Night Vision Devices .
The AN / PVS - 7 is issued for use with the M203 , whereas the AN / PVS - 4 is normally issued for use with crew - served weapons .
M203 gunners may qualify with either device .
In a defensive position , the gunner identifies targets during daylight and constructs aiming or elevation stakes , or both .
Because the AN / PVS - 7 rear sight must be set to the far setting to sense rounds , the gunner cannot see both the M203 sights and the target at the same time .
Therefore , stakes are more important with the AN / PVS - 7 than with the AN / PVS - 4 .
( On the rear sight of the M16A1 , the far setting is " L. "
On the rear sight of the M16A2 , the far setting is " 02 . " )
f. Marked - Sling Method .
To use this method , the grenadier must --
(1) Loosen the sling , assume a kneeling position , and place the forward foot in the sling .
( 2 ) Ensure the sling is taut and vertical between the front sling swivel and the boot .
If not , the rounds will impact at a greater range than desired .
To check this , tie one end of a string or thread to a weight , such as a cartridge case , and tie the other to the sling swivel .
Let it hang freely , and align the edge of the sling with it to ensure the sling is vertical .
( 3 ) Fire several rounds to determine the desired range .
( 4 ) Where the sling is held to the ground by the foot , mark the sling with colored tape , paint , ink , or whatever is available .
Mark the position of the buckles so that , if either is moved , the grenadier can return them to their original positions and be assured of constant range accuracy .
( 5 ) If the sling gets wet , it may stretch or shrink , indirectly causing the rounds to impact closer or farther than desired .
5 - 3. NBC ENVIRONMENT
The fundamentals of marksmanship remain valid in the NBC environment , but some modifications may be needed to accommodate the equipment .
a. Steady Position .
Bulky NBC wear requires the grenadier to press the stock of the weapon more firmly into his shoulder pocket .
b. Aiming .
This is affected little by NBC .
c. Breathing .
Wearing the protective mask makes breathing more difficult .
Grenadiers must try to breathe normally to avoid hyperventilating while firing .
d. Trigger Control .
All soldiers must wear rubber gloves .
5 - 4. FIRE COMMANDS
Standard fire commands are explained to grenadiers , then used during all gunnery training that follows .
Trainers give the appropriate elements before each dry - fire or live - fire exercise .
The grenadier performs as directed and repeats each element as it is announced .
( Chapter 6 provides a detailed explanation of fire commands . )
a. Alert .
The trainer gives the alert as a fire mission .
On hearing this , the grenadier loads the weapon and moves the safety lever to FIRE .
b. Direction .
The trainer gives the direction to target .
c. Description .
The trainer describes the target , for example , " bunker " or " machine gun position , " and the grenadier lays on the target .
d. Range .
The trainer gives the ( estimated ) range to the target , for example , " 150 . "
e. Method of Fire .
The method of fire for either target is three rounds .
On the basic range , grenadiers fire at both point and area targets .
f. Command to Open Fire .
To open fire , the trainer commands COMMENCE FIRING or AT MY COMMAND .
When ready , the grenadier announces " Up " and fires or waits for the command to fire .
When all grenadiers are ready , the trainer gives the actual command to fire .
5 - 5. DRY -FIRE EXERCISES
Dry - fire exercises train grenadiers in the techniques of loading , unloading , immediate action , fundamentals of marksmanship , and sight manipulation .
These exercises are conducted with training practice ( TP ) or dummy rounds .
The trainer gives fire commands as appropriate .
a. Loading and Unloading Exercise .
This trains the grenadier to operate and clear the weapon proficiently .
Loading and unloading procedures ( Chapter 2 ) should be practiced with dummy ammunition .
b. Immediate Action Exercise .
This exercise is conducted with a dummy round and the basic grenade launcher target .
(1) Load the weapon with a dummy round , and aim the it at one of the targets on the basic grenade launcher range .
( 2 ) Maintain the sight picture while you pull the trigger to simulate firing .
( 3 ) When you are informed that you have a misfire , apply misfire procedures , then continue to fire ( Chapter 4 ) .
c. Aiming Exercise .
This exercise requires the grenadier to simulate firing a dummy round at a target on the basic grenade launcher range .
(1) Maintain your sight picture throughout the firing cycle .
( 2 ) If , after firing , you note that the sight picture has moved , then you were unsteady when you fired .
( 3 ) After each shot , apply immediate action procedures to extract and eject the dummy cartridges .
Then recock the barrel assembly .
d . These exercises train the grenadier to operate and adjust both quadrant and leaf sights .
(1) Range .
Manipulate the sights to different range settings ( quadrant sight - - 50 to 400 meters ; leaf sight - - 50 to 250 meters ) .
To learn to make fine adjustments for elevation , manipulate the sights from the minimum to the maximum setting .
When you do not have time to adjust the sights , you may adjust the aiming point instead .
( 2 ) Windage .
Depress the rear sight aperture left and right , and traverse the windage screw across the entire scale .
e. Dry -Fire Proficiency ( Performance ) Exam .
Grenadiers practice the dry - fire tasks until they become proficient in operating the weapon ; then they take the dry - fire proficiency exam ( Appendix C ) .
This exam emphasizes learning by doing .
Before he can progress to live firing , each grenadier must demonstrate skill in every task in the exam .
f. Remedial Training .
Soldiers who do not pass the performance exam must attend remedial training , after which they are retested .
The soldiers who pass may help train those having difficulty .
5 - 6. SENSING AND ADJUSTMENT OF FIRE
The grenadier determines ( senses ) where the grenade landed relative to the target , then adjusts elevation and deflection .
a. Sensing .
As soon as the grenade explodes , determine where it exploded with respect to the target .
This is called " sensing " ( the impact ) and has two aspects : range and deviation .
Because the casualty radius of the HE round is 5 meters ( 5 1/2 yards ) , determine both range and deviation to the nearest 5 meters .
(1) Range .
Sense the range as one of the following : Short .
The grenade burst between you and the target .
Over .
The grenade burst beyond the target .
Target .
The grenade hit any part of the target .
Range correct .
The grenade burst slightly left or right of the target , but at the correct range .
Doubtful .
The grenade burst left or right of the grenadier , but you cannot sense the range .
(2) Deviation .
Announce a deviation sensing as either -- Right or left of the target .
On line with the target .
b. Adjustment of Fire .
To ensure a second - round hit , adjust your fire by sensing the impact of the round and manipulating the sight .
(1) If time allows , whether using the AN / PVS - 4 or AN / PVS - 7 , adjust the sights , but if time is critical , adjust the point of aim instead .
( 2 ) If the grenade lands more than 25 meters over or short of the target , adjust the range quadrant to bring the next grenade on target .
( 3 ) If the grenade explodes less than 25 meters from the target , adjust the point of aim to bring the next grenade on target .
( 4 ) If the launcher is properly zeroed , deviation errors will be small , and you can easily correct them by adjusting the aiming point .
However , a wind strong enough to move the grenade out of its normal trajectory will increase the size of the deviation errors .
After observing the effect of the wind on the strike of the grenade , compensate for the effect of the wind by aiming into it .
This should help bring the next grenade on target -- for example , if the grenade bursts to the left and short of the target , sense the strike of the round relative to the target , then adjust an equivalent distance to the right and over the target to achieve a target hit .
Watch the flight of the grenade to the target .
This will help determine the effect of the wind on the grenade as it moves toward the target .
Evaluating and compensating for the wind before firing increases your chances of achieving a first - round hit .
5 - 7. GRENADE LAUNCHER RANGE LAYOUT
The grenade launcher range is designed for all grenade launchers .
Because soldiers can qualify on this range in all conditions , it prepares grenadiers for combat situations .
The range has four stations .
Figure 5 - 10 shows the range layout .
Minimum range personnel and their duties are the same for M203 qualification firing as they are for other grenadier firing .
These personnel include an OIC , NCOIC , safety officer , ammunition NCO , tower operator , station NCOs , primary trainer , and concurrent training trainers .
Local policy may require more personnel .
( Appendix D discusses range safety ; FM 25 - 7 provides a detailed setup and target configuration for this range . )
5 - 8. DESCRIPTION OF RANGE AND TARGETS
The range has four self - contained stations .
It is 30 meters wide by 500 meters deep , and has a no - HE fire zone out to 165 meters .
( Grenadiers can fire HE only on Stations 1 , 3 , and 4 . )
Targets should be built from a durable material to reduce downrange target maintenance .
Those within each station must be grouped and spaced so that the grenadier may fire on close - range , midrange , and long - range targets , in that order .
The following description of the stations and targets is included to help trainers maintain control during zeroing , practice , and record fire :
NOTE : To simplify the task of finding and destroying duds , trainers must ensure the impact area is free of any vegetation other than short grass .
a. Station 1 consists of a prone fighting position with a log or sandbag support and a zeroing target at 200 meters .
The target should be constructed of logs or other suitable material .
It must have a surface at least 2 meters high by 2 meters wide ( 6 feet by 6 feet ) .
The target should be clearly marked with a large " Z " painted in a color that contrasts with the surrounding background , and that is visible in different sun or glare conditions .
b. Station 2 consists of an upright log or log wall , a kneeling firing position about 4 feet high , and two point - type targets .
The targets include a simulated window or door of a building at 90 to 100 meters and a small bunker or fighting position , with overhead cover , at 125 meters .
The targets may be constructed of logs , sandbags , or other suitable material .
c. Station 3 consists of a fighting position and two targets .
The targets are a two - person bunker at 150 meters and an automatic weapon position at 175 meters .
The bunker represents a point target , and the automatic weapon position represents a target that can be engaged with area - type fire .
The targets may be constructed of logs , sandbags , or other suitable material .
FIGURE 5 - 10 .
GRENADE LAUNCHER RANGE .
d. Station 4 consists of a prone fighting position with a log or sandbag support and two area - type targets ( with personnel targets in the open ) at 250 and 350 meters .
The log or sandbags at the firing position are used for support and cover .
The targets are E- type ( NSN 6920-00-795-1086 ) and F - type ( NSN 6920-00-0714589 ) silhouettes .

You ’ll need an actual website first , and that ’s what we ’re here to do . ”
Him : < rolls eyes and looks at his now fully mortified son sitting across the table from me >

Good choice , son .

I ended the meeting and left right then .
The village of Jericho , Arkansas ( pop. 174 ) is home to exactly zero operating businesses , and until recently * , seven police officers and 18 volunteer firefighters .
All 18 volunteer firefighters in the village of Jericho , Akransas have resigned in outrage over the shooting of the assistant fire chief on August 27 .
Don Payne , the assistant fire chief , had been in court earlier contesting a speeding ticket , and had returned to contest a ticket issued to his son .
Payne was upset ( and it seems rightly so ) about the traffic tickets ; the Jericho PD was well - known for their ticket - writing propensity , even going so far as to write tickets where they had no jurisdiction to do so :
[ Judge Tonya Alexander ( who has since resigned ) ] has voided all the tickets written by the department both inside the city and others written outside of its jurisdiction — citations that the department apparently had no power to write .
That day , all seven Jericho police officers were in court .
Some accounts indicate that the officers were upset because the judge was dismissing many of the tickets and everyone seems to agree that Payne was visibly upset , but what happened — well , that ’s when shit got weird .
One of the police officers shot Payne in the back .
Take a minute and let that sink in .
There is no reason , whatsoever , for any of the thugs in uniform to have drawn on Payne that day .
He was outnumbered seven - to - one and presumably outgunned seven - to - none .
Aside from treating all firearms as if they are always loaded and ready to fire , the most important rule of firearm safety is DO NOT POINT A WEAPON AT ANYTHING YOU’RE NOT PREPARED TO DESTROY .
That a weapon was trained on Payne , and subsequently discharged , speaks volumes about the Jericho PD .
The Police Department has since been disbanded ( good riddance to bad rubbish ) and the County Sheriff has assumed jurisdiction .
* Update : ( 9/24/2009 )
This report suggests that the Police Department in Jericho is back on duty , or at least “ back on duty ” enough to act as security detail for the Mayor , keeping those pesky news reporters away .
The report also indicates that an arrest warrant has been issued for former assistant fire chief , Don Payne , for “ felony battery ” of a police officer .
There is special place in hell for bastards like this
Ben Goldacre , Saturday 14 November 2009 , The Guardian
It ’s always interesting when people take pseudoscience out of its natural habitat – Islington – and off into a place where the stakes are quite high .
Like the polio vaccine scare in Nigeria .
Or Aids denialism in South Africa .
Or detecting bombs in Iraq , where the New York Times and magician James Randi have uncovered a nonsense of truly epic proportions .
A British company called ATSC are selling a device which can detect guns , ammunition , bombs , drugs , contraband ivory , and truffles .
The bomb detection equipment that you see in airports weighs several tons , and can only operate over tiny distances .
The ADE 651 uses “ electrostatic magnetic ion attraction ” and can detect these things from a kilometre away , through walls , under the ground , underwater , or even from an aeroplane 5 km overhead .
ATSC ’s device is pocket sized and portable .
You simply take a piece of plastic - coated cardboard for your chosen target , which has been through “ the proprietary process of electro - static matching of the ionic charge and structure of the substance ” , pop it into a holder connected to a wand , and start detecting .
There are no batteries and no power source : you hold the device to “ charge ” it with the energy of your body , becoming perfectly relaxed , with a steady pulse and blood pressure .
Then you walk with the wand at right angles to your body .
If there is a bomb on your left , the wand will drift to the left , and point at it .
Like a dowsing rod .
Similar devices have been tested repeatedly and shown to perform no better than chance .
No police force or security service anywhere in the developed world uses them .
But in 2008 , the Iraqi government ’s Ministry of the Interior bought 800 of these devices – the ADE 651 – for $ 32 m .
That ’s $ 40,000 each , rather brilliantly , and they ’ve ordered a further shipment at $ 53 m .
These devices are being used at hundreds of checkpoints in Iraq , to look for bombs .
Dale Murray , head of the National Explosive Engineering Sciences Security Center at Sandia Labs , which does testing for the Department of Defense , has tested various similar devices , and they perform at the level of chance .
On Tuesday , two people working for The New York Times went through 9 Iraqi police checkpoints which were using the device , and none found the rifles and ammunition they were carrying ( with licenses ) .
Major General Jehad al - Jabiri is head of the Ministry of the Interior ’s General Directorate for Combating Explosives .
“ I do n’t care about Sandia or the Department of Justice or any of them , ” he says .
“ Whether it ’s magic or scientific , what I care about is it detects bombs . ”
How would you know ?
There are no independent tests of the ADE651 that I could find .
The simplest explanation is that nobody could really be bothered .
Magician James Randi can .
He has carried a cheque for $ 1 m in his jacket pocket for many years , in an admirably expensive act of passive aggression , and he will give this cheque to anyone who can provide proof of supernatural phenomena .
Last year he invited the manufacturers of the ADE 651 to come forward , and see if their device works better than chance .
They have not .
I guess if you ’ve trousered $ 85 m , you do n’t care about The Amazing Randi and his puny cheque .
We all have our excuses .
General Jabiri , meanwhile , challenged an NYT reporter to test the ADE 651 , placing a grenade and a machine pistol in plain view in his office .
Every time a policeman used it , the wand pointed at the explosives .
Every time the reporter used the device , it failed to detect anything .
“ You need more training , ” said the general .
Compassionate and Candid Portland , Oregon Social Security Disability , SSI , Workers ’ Compensation & Personal Injury Attorney
Many people find themselves in need of assistance after they have become disabled or injured , have been wrongfully denied benefits or compensation , and are enduring financial hardship .
My name is Sara L. Gabin , and I have been an Oregon lawyer in the Portland area since 1981 .
It is my goal to help each of my clients receive the compensation they deserve , whether it is in the form of Social Security disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits , workers ’ compensation benefits , or a recovery from an accident injury .
Each legal action is unique , and it is my role as your Portland Social Security Disability lawyer to make sure your needs are met and that you understand your rights throughout the process .
I am dedicated to giving your case the care and attention it needs to bring about the best possible outcome for you .
If you believe you ’ve been improperly denied Social Security disability benefits or workers ’ compensation benefits , or if you feel overwhelmed with the insurance companies when seeking personal injury damages after an accident , contact me to discuss your situation .
Social Security Disability
Disabled Widows ’- Widowers ’
Disabled Adult Child , and
Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) Claim(s )
As an attorney practicing for over 36 years , I have seen the struggles that people endure when they are too sick to work and need to deal with the complexities of applying for Social Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits .
I make it my mission to ease this process by providing the legal support and knowledge that my clients need .
An individual may qualify as disabled if he or she has been unable to work a 40 - hour workweek for a period of 12 continuous months .
After identifying a disability that is confirmed by a doctor , a claimant may apply for the following benefits :
Social Security Disability Insurance ( SSDI ) : Candidates for SSDI are people who have become disabled after having earned a certain amount of “ work credits . ”
Successful claimants will have shown that the disability occurred while they still paid for insurance coverage that included SSDI benefits .
Disabled Widows Income ( DWI ) : Candidates for DWI benefits are age 50 , were married at least 10 - years to the deceased spouse , have not remarried , and who became disabled within seven years of the death of the deceased spouse .
Disabled Adult Child ( DAC ) : DAC candidates are people who have become disabled before the age of 22 and may be eligible to receive benefits based on a retired , disabled or deceased parent ’s earning history .
Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) : SSI is a benefit available to individuals with disabilities who do not have an earnings record sufficient to qualify for SSDI .
SSI benefits are only available for disabled claimants whose asset and household incomes fall within certain guidelines .
As a Portland Social Security Disability attorney , I assist my clients in the initial application process when they need or want my assistance at that step .
Most often , however , I represent claimants after an application is denied , through the next four levels of appeal - reconsideration , hearing , appeals council review , and federal court review .
No matter what level of appeal you find yourself at , strict time limits apply .
You have only 60 - days to appeal a denial , starting five - days from the date you received the unfavorable notice or decision .
You are presumed to have received an unfavorable notice or decision within 5 - days of the mailing date .
If you ’ve been injured at work , it is important that you both report the injury to your employer and seek medical treatment promptly .
Notice to your employer should always be in writing , and you should keep a copy for your records .
A detailed account should be provided as soon as possible to establish the basis for showing the work activities that were the cause of your harm , in case future disputes arise .
Job -related injuries can be in the form of a single accident event , for example an accident involving the use of machinery .
They can also come in the form of an occupational disease , such as a repetitive use injury that occurs gradually over weeks , months or years .
Although the process of filing a workers ’ compensation insurance claim may seem daunting when you are focusing on the more pressing matter of trying to do your job or getting back to health , it is important to file a claim as quickly as possible so that you can get back on your feet both physically and financially .
In Oregon , the available benefits may include medical costs , time loss benefits of two - thirds your average weekly wage , permanent disability benefits , and vocational rehabilitation costs if you are unable to return to your previous position .
If your employer fails to assist you in filing your workers ’ compensation claim , denies a claim improperly , or closes your claim , you should contact a seasoned attorney to help assert your rights .
The time limits are inflexible when appealing a denial of compensation or claim closure .
An appeal must be filed within 60 - days from the date printed on the denial or Notice of Closure you receive .
I represent clients in appeals , claim closures , medical services disputes , mediation and settlements , and third - party claims .
When you have been hurt in an accident caused by someone else ’s carelessness , you may seek compensation for your harm by making a claim for personal injury with the at fault party ’s insurance carrier , and , later , as is often necessary , by filing a personal injury lawsuit .
I represent clients in an array of accident cases , including those involving car crashes , slip and falls , third - party claims that occur while you are at work , and medical malpractice .
Personal injury claims require proving that the defendant owed the victim a duty of care and breached this duty with some careless action .
For example , a driver has a duty of care to others on the road to drive as a reasonable person would in similar circumstances .
A person who is distracted by his or her phone and causes a crash as a result likely would be found to have breached this duty .
The same is true of a property owner who neglects his property and allows an unsafe condition to occur that injures those who come onto his property by permission or invitation .
You must show that your injuries are the result of that careless action , and must be able to identify quantifiable damages .
These can include both economic harm , such as medical bills and lost income , and non-economic harm , such as pain and suffering .
My physical office address is in Lake Oswego .
My clients come from Clackamas , Multnomah , Washington and Yamhill Counties .
I work carefully in evaluating each and every case to make sure I have the entire story so I can pursue all claims appropriately and fight for your rights .
I provide candid legal advice regarding your situation and the possible outcomes for your Social Security , workers ’ compensation , or injury claim .
Additionally , my fees are strictly contingent , which means that I only get paid if you successfully receive benefits or recover damages .
If you believe you need legal assistance from a Portland Social Security Disability lawyer or a workers ’ compensation or personal injury attorney to help you pursue what is due to you , contact me at ( 503 ) 620-3171 or through our online form to discuss your case .
I am candid , perhaps to the point of being very direct .
No one has the time to waste hearing anything but my best opinion .
That means I will tell you exactly what I think .
I will tell you when I have insufficient information to give an assessment .
I will ask you very specific “ yes ” or “ no ” answer questions to help both of us come to terms with the sticking points of your case .
All cases have glitches .
We both need to understand both what is possible and what is necessary to achieve as your case proceeds .

Did Texas just de-recognize marriage ?

Texas ' gay marriage ban may have banned all marriages
AUSTIN  Texans :
Are you really married ?
Maybe not .
Barbara Ann Radnofsky , a Houston lawyer and Democratic candidate for attorney general , says that a 22 - word clause in a 2005 constitutional amendment designed to ban gay marriages erroneously endangers the legal status of all marriages in the state .
The amendment , approved by the Legislature and overwhelmingly ratified by voters , declares that " marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman . "
But the troublemaking phrase , as Radnofsky sees it , is Subsection B , which declares :
" This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage . "
Architects of the amendment included the clause to ban same - sex civil unions and domestic partnerships .
But Radnofsky , who was a member of the powerhouse Vinson & Elkins law firm in Houston for 27 years until retiring in 2006 , says the wording of Subsection B effectively " eliminates marriage in Texas , " including common - law marriages .
She calls it a " massive mistake " and blames the current attorney general , Republican Greg Abbott , for allowing the language to become part of the Texas Constitution .
Radnofsky called on Abbott to acknowledge the wording as an error and consider an apology .
She also said that another constitutional amendment may be necessary to reverse the problem .
" You do not have to have a fancy law degree to read this and understand what it plainly says , " said Radnofsky , who will be at Texas Christian University today as part of a five - city tour to kick off her campaign .

That 's what I thought .
It says " marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman , " and " This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage . "
So there 's only marriage , as defined , and no new ( created ) or adopted ( recognized ) status is allowed .
So , what 's the problem , again ?

I was married in 2000 .
But I guess 2005 my marriage was null and void .
Hmmm , I ’ve been living in sin huh ?

Barbara Ann Radnofsky is either an idiot , or is pushing an agenda .
The amendment ’s first subsection defines marriage .
Only an attorney , or someone looking to muck things up can ignore the first have of this amendment and then claim Texas is banning marriage or will not recognize marriage .
Clearly , ( IMO ) the second phrase is stating the State will nor raise or recognize something else ( not involving a man and a woman ) as a marriage .
You may agree or disagree with the passage of the amendment but it is pretty clear in what is covered an not covered to me when I read it .
To : MetaThought
" The amendment , approved by the Legislature and overwhelmingly ratified by voters , declares that " marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman . " " OK , so marriage as defined in the TX constitution is stated as clear as a bell here .
But the troublemaking phrase , as Radnofsky sees it , is Subsection B , which declares : " This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage . "
OK , so let 's substitute marriage in this subsection with the declaration stated above ...
This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to .
So , what is not clear about that ?

The Rat AG homosexualist wants you to think that .
You can't read the second sentence in isolation .
It 's a basic rule of construction .
The first sentence defines marriage .
The second sentence says that the State cannot create any other relationship either identical to , or similar to marriage .
It 's very simple .
The pervert AG candidate is attempting to rip the second sentence out of context .
Typical rat libtard " thinking " .

Prop. 2 HJR 6 Chisum - Staples
Ballot Language
“ The constitutional amendment providing that marriage in this state consists only of the union of one man and one woman and prohibiting this state or a political subdivision of this state from creating or recognizing any legal status identical or similar to marriage . ”
“ Enmienda constitucional que dispone que en este estado el matrimonio consiste exclusivamente en la unión de un hombre y una mujer y que desautoriza , en este estado o en alguna subdivisión política del mismo , la creación o el reconocimiento de cualquier estatus jurídico idéntico o semejante al matrimonio . ”
Brief Explanation
HJR 6 would provide that marriage in Texas is solely the union of a man and woman , and that the state and its political subdivisions could not create or recognize any legal status identical to or similar to marriage , including such legal status relationships created outside of Texas .
Recognizes marriage .
Prohibits the state and districts from establishing another construct identical or similar to marriage .
Acknowledges marriage in our state .
This is a frivilous bit of judicial activism that will cost the taxpayers money .
To : ExGeeEye
“ I guess it takes a lawyer ’s mind ” Exactly ... and a blatant disregard for the English language .
The state may not create ... identical or similar to ... marriage .
In other words ... another entity ( implied ) ... identical or similar to marriage ( not marriage itself ) .
Only a lawyer could try to find a gray area there .
Vinson and Elkins usually hires bright people .
I wonder what happened in this case .

There is a long and remarkable article in the current New Yorker about a man who was executed in Texas in 2004 for deliberately setting a fire that killed his three small children .
Rigorous scientific analysis has since shown that there was no evidence that the fire in a one - story , wood frame house in Corsicana was the result of arson , as the authorities had alleged .
In other words , it was an accident .
No crime had occurred .
Cameron Todd Willingham , who refused to accept a guilty plea that would have spared his life , and who insisted until his last painful breath that he was innocent , had in fact been telling the truth all along .
It was inevitable that some case in which a clearly innocent person had been put to death would come to light .
It was far from inevitable that this case would be the one .
“ I was extremely skeptical in the beginning , ” said the New Yorker reporter , David Grann , who began investigating the case last December .
The fire broke out on the morning of Dec. 23 , 1991 .
Willingham was awakened by the cries of his 2 - year - old daughter , Amber .
Also in the house were his year - old twin girls , Karmon and Kameron .
The family was poor , and Willingham ’s wife , Stacy , had gone out to pick up a Christmas present for the children from the Salvation Army .
Utrecht city council is to pay commuters who avoid the morning rush hour on the A2 € 4 a day , the Telegraaf reports on Wednesday .
Long delays are expected on a stretch of the A2 near the Oudenrijn junction because of roadworks over the next months .
This section of the motorway is already a notorious traffic blackspot and ‘ we hope to avoid extra jams by doing this , ’ project manager Rob Mouris told the paper .
Cameras alongside the motorway will register which cars are eligible for the pay - out , the paper says , but does not explain how they will be selected .
Drivers invited to apply for the jam - avoidance scheme will get € 4 for every day they do n’t use the A2 and alternative routes between 6 am and 10 am , the paper said .
( CNN ) -- A Louisiana justice of the peace who drew criticism for refusing to marry an interracial couple has resigned , the secretary of state 's office said Tuesday .
Keith Bardwell resigned in person at the Louisiana secretary of state 's office , said spokesman Jacques Berry .
The state Supreme Court will appoint an interim justice of the peace to fill Bardwell 's position , Berry said , and a special election will be held next year to fill the position permanently .
Bardwell , a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish 's 8th Ward , refused to perform a marriage ceremony for Beth Humphrey , 30 , and her boyfriend Terence McKay , 32 , both of Hammond , Louisiana , and sign their marriage license .
The two were married by another justice of the peace .
The couple filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against Bardwell and his wife , Beth Bardwell , on October 20 , claiming the two violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment .
Bardwell , speaking to CNN affiliate WBRZ , said he was advised " that I needed to step down because they was going to take me to court , and I was going to lose . "
" I would probably do the same thing again , " he said .
" I found out I can't be a justice of the peace and have a conscience . "
Sen . Mary L. Landrieu , D- Louisiana , who had called for Bardwell 's dismissal , said Tuesday night that " Bardwell has finally consented to the will of the vast majority of Louisiana citizens and nearly every governmental official in Louisiana .
Bardwell 's refusal to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples was out of step with our Louisiana values and reflected terribly on our state .
We are better off without him in public service . "
Initial reports were that Bardwell refused to issue a marriage license to the couple , but in the lawsuit Humphrey and McKay say they obtained the license from the parish court clerk 's office and contacted Bardwell to see if he would perform the ceremony and sign the license to legally validate the marriage .
Humphrey wound up speaking by telephone with Beth Bardwell , the lawsuit said , and Beth Bardwell asked Humphrey if they were a " mixed couple . "
When told they were an interracial couple , Beth Bardwell said , according to the lawsuit , " We do n't do interracial weddings , " and told her the two would have to go outside the parish to marry .
Bardwell did not return repeated phone calls from CNN in October , but told CNN affiliate WAFB that he had no regrets about the decision .
" It 's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you have n't done wrong , " he said .
In addition , he told the Hammond Daily Star in an October story that he did not marry the couple because he was concerned for the children that might be born of the relationship and that , in his experience , most interracial marriages do n't last .
" I 'm not a racist , " he said .
" I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house .
My main concern is for the children . "
Humphrey said in October that she wanted Bardwell to resign .
" He does n't believe he 's being racist , but it is racist , " she said .
According to the lawsuit , Bardwell estimated he refused to marry at least four other interracial couples in the past 2½ years .
" Defendant Beth Bardwell ... aided , abetted and conspired with defendant Keith Bardwell to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected civil rights , " according to the suit .
No response to the suit has been filed , and it was unclear whether the Bardwells had retained an attorney .
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages , claiming that Humphrey and McKay suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said he believed Bardwell should lose his license , and the National Urban League called for an investigation into the incident by the U.S. Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division , saying in a statement that Bardwell 's actions were " a huge step backward in social justice . "
According to the Census Bureau , Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black .
The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially - based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 ruling in the case Loving v. Virginia .
In the unanimous decision , the court said that under the Constitution , " the freedom to marry , or not marry , a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State . "

Hypothesis that depressed individuals make more realistic inferences than do non-depressed individuals
Depressive realism is the hypothesis developed by Lauren Alloy and Lyn Yvonne Abramson [ 1 ] that depressed individuals make more realistic inferences than non-depressed individuals .
Although depressed individuals are thought to have a negative cognitive bias that results in recurrent , negative automatic thoughts , maladaptive behaviors , and dysfunctional world beliefs , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] depressive realism argues not only that this negativity may reflect a more accurate appraisal of the world but also that non-depressed individuals ' appraisals are positively biased . [ 1 ]
Evidence for [ edit ]
When participants were asked to press a button and rate the control they perceived they had over whether or not a light turned on , depressed individuals made more accurate ratings of control than non-depressed individuals .
[ 5 ]
Among participants asked to complete a task and rate their performance without any feedback , depressed individuals made more accurate self - ratings than non-depressed individuals . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
For participants asked to complete a series of tasks , given feedback on their performance after each task , and who self - rated their overall performance after completing all the tasks , depressed individuals were again more likely to give an accurate self - rating than non-depressed individuals .
[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
When asked to evaluate their performance both immediately and some time after completing a task , depressed individuals made accurate appraisals both immediately before and after time had passed . [ 16 ]
In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain , depressed patients were shown to be more accurate in their causal attributions of positive and negative social events than non-depressed participants who demonstrated a positive bias . [ 17 ]
This difference was also reflected in the differential activation of the fronto - temporal network , higher activation for non self - serving attributions in non-depressed participants and for self - serving attributions in depressed patients , and reduced coupling of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex seed region and the limbic areas when depressed patients made self - serving attributions .
Evidence against [ edit ]
When asked to rate both their performance and the performance of others , non-depressed individuals demonstrated positive bias when rating themselves but no bias when rating others .
Depressed individuals conversely showed no bias when rating themselves but a positive bias when rating others . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]
When assessing participant thoughts in public versus private settings , the thoughts of non-depressed individuals were more optimistic in public than private , while depressed individuals were less optimistic in public . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ]
When asked to rate their performance immediately after a task and after some time had passed , depressed individuals were more accurate when they rated themselves immediately after the task but were more negative after time had passed whereas non-depressed individuals were positive immediately after and some time after . [ 10 ] [ 14 ]
Although depressed individuals make accurate judgments about having no control in situations where they in fact have no control , this appraisal also carries over to situations where they do have control , suggesting that the depressed perspective is not more accurate overall . [ 25 ]
One study suggested that in real - world settings , depressed individuals are actually less accurate and more overconfident in their predictions about the future than their non-depressed peers . [ 26 ]
Participants ' attributional accuracy may also be more related to their overall attributional style rather than the presence and severity of their depressive symptoms . [ 27 ]
Criticism of the evidence [ edit ]
Some have argued that the evidence is not more conclusive because no standard for reality exists , the diagnoses are dubious , and the results may not apply to the real world . [ 28 ]
Because many studies rely on self - report of depressive symptoms and self - reports are known to be biased , the diagnosis of depression in these studies may not be valid , necessitating the use of other objective measures .
Due to most of these studies using designs that do not necessarily approximate real - world phenomena , the external validity of the depressive realism hypothesis is unclear . [ 28 ]
There is also concern that the depressive realism effect is merely a byproduct of the depressed person being in a situation that agrees with their negative bias . [ 5 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]

* Jury rejects Fair Isaac claims related to credit scores
* Fair Isaac says to appeal
* " FICO " score , VantageScore at issue ( Adds VantageScore Solutions CEO comment ; updated shares )
NEW YORK , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) - A federal jury in Minneapolis on Friday ruled against Fair Isaac Corp FICO.N in its lawsuit accusing Experian Plc EXPN.L and TransUnion LLC of antitrust and trademark violations for using a credit scoring system that competes with its widely used " FICO " score .
The verdict allows Experian and TransUnion to continue to use their " VantageScore " rating .
Experian and TransUnion , in separate statements , said the jury also found that Fair Isaac made a misrepresentation to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in registering a trademark for its credit score .
Fair Isaac said it plans an appeal .
In its October 2006 lawsuit , Fair Isaac alleged that VantageScore , which uses a 501 to 990 range , was confusingly similar to its FICO score , which uses a 300 to 850 range .
It said use of VantageScore constituted trademark infringement , unfair competition and a deceptive trade practice .
Another credit bureau , Equifax Inc EFX.N , was originally also a defendant , but was dropped from the case in June 2008 when it entered a marketing agreement with Fair Isaac .
Credit bureaus get royalties when they sell credit scores to banks and other lenders , which use the scores in deciding whether and at what cost to make loans to consumers .
Creators of VantageScore contended the 501 to 990 more easily aligns with letter grades ranging from " A " to " F . "
They set up the joint venture VantageScore Solutions LLC in 2006 to develop an alternative to FICO .
Barrett Burns , chief executive of VantageScore Solutions , said the case 's outcome could result in added market share .
" The lawsuit been a distraction , and I am sure there have been some lenders out there that have been hesitating using VantageScore , " he said in an interview .
Fair Isaac previously said it would appeal a July decision by U.S. District Judge Ann Montgomery to dismiss some of its claims in the case .
In late afternoon trading , Fair Isaac shares were unchanged at $ 18.77 on the New York Stock Exchange .
1887 : Charles - Édouard Jeanneret - Gris , better known to the world as Le Corbusier , is born in the Swiss city of La Chaux - de - Fonds .
He will change his name and take French citizenship in his 30s .
More importantly , he will help pioneer the International Style of architecture and is one of the most influential proponents of the machine aesthetic .
Jeanneret - Gris ' interest in design and architecture came early in life .
He attended the local art school , where he studied under architect Rene Chapallaz , who became a major influence .
After moving to Paris in 1907 , he toiled for Auguste Perret , an architect renowned for his work in reinforced concrete construction .
A few years later he continued on to Berlin , where he became fluent in German and schooled under Peter Behrens , another architect with bohemian predilections esteemed for his industrial designs .
By the time he returned to Switzerland , where he spent the World War I years , Jeanneret - Gris ' guiding aesthetic was well formed .
In adopting the single - name pseudonym Le Corbusier , when he returned to Paris shortly after the war , Jeanneret was following a popular bohemian practice of the time .
He took the name , in fact , during a brief period where he abandoned architecture for painting and sculpture .
Like his artistic brethren , Le Corbusier was making a symbolic statement that anyone was capable of reinventing himself .
But his estrangement from the drafting table did n't last long .
By 1922 , he was back at it , picking up where he had left off , this time in partnership with his cousin , Pierre Jeanneret .
That meant continuing the theoretical development of the style that would come to define not only his own work but an entire school of architecture .
If his early years were spent as a provincial architect , his aesthetic was anything but .
His formative work , which included a number of private homes and villas , reflected his reverence for the machine aesthetic .
Le Corbusier admired the design of well - built automobiles and the great trans -Atlantic steamships of interbellum Europe .
His attitude can be summed up by his most famous quote : " A house is a machine for living in . "
( The man was born and raised in a town known for its watchmaking .
How Swiss is that ? )
His signature buildings , for example the Villa Savoye outside of Paris ( built in the late ' 20s ) , embody this architectural style , which he referred to generally as Purism , after the art form that was itself a rejection of Cubism .
The lines are clean and sharp ( in contrast to the full and curvaceous lines of Streamline Moderne , then very popular ) , and the interior functions are precise and laid out in a modular way .
Villa Savoye is also built on reinforced concrete stilts , another Le Corbusier trademark and one of his " five points of architecture . "
But Le Corbusier did n't limit himself to the design of single structures .
He 's also remembered for his theories on urban planning and renewal , which , again , reflected his rejection of traditional models .
Never one to make modest proposals , Le Corbusier tried to interest Parisian officials in bulldozing the Marais and replacing the district with a forest of egalitarian skyscrapers surrounded by tracts of open space .
For Le Corbusier , this radical plan represented a complete break with the past , something he continually advocated as necessary for society to advance .
Fortunately for Paris , if not the betterment of society , his idea was rejected .
Frustrated in his dream of becoming the latter - day Baron Haussmann , Le Corbusier looked elsewhere for opportunities to implement his Radiant City urban plan .
Eventually , a number of these unités were built around Europe , the first ( and most famous ) of these in Marseilles .
If they bear more than a passing resemblance to Soviet - style architecture , it 's worth noting that Le Corbusier was influenced by his study of an earlier communal project , the Narkomfin Building in Moscow .
Like a lot of so - called visionaries , Le Corbusier was an active self - promoter .
He authored numerous books on architecture and design and openly courted protégés .
Like modern - day Apple devotees slobbering at the feet of Steve Jobs , Le Corbusier 's acolytes worshiped him with blind , near - religious fervor .
His critics , however , were less sanguine .
The harshest of them argued that his urban designs , especially , were cold and sterile , and worse , the product of technical incompetence .
Nevertheless , by the time he died in 1965 , Le Corbusier 's enormous influence on 20th - century architectural sensibilities was indisputable .
He ranks in a select pantheon alongside such worthies as Mies van der Rohe , Walter Gropius and Frank Lloyd Wright .

The Pakistani government has lost control of rogue military and intelligence officers who aid Al Qaeda and its allies and play a double game with the West , a renowned French judge asserts in an upcoming book .
For three decades , Jean - Louis Bruguiere was an investigative magistrate , a powerful role that combines the duties of prosecutor and judge and allowed him to cultivate high - level contacts from Algiers to Moscow .
He stepped down from that post in 2007 , and now serves as the European Union ’s envoy to Washington on issues related to the financing of terrorism .
His 481 - page book , “ What I Could Not Say , ” is to be published Monday in France .
An advance copy obtained by The Times bolsters the 66 - year - old official ’s swashbuckling reputation with previously undisclosed witness testimony and intelligence documents from a trove of case files .

Pakistan ’s government has long faced criticism that elements of its security services have protected militant groups .
The government says it is trying to purge them , and it has launched offensives this year against militants in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan , where its forces are currently battling entrenched Taliban fighters .
The book details French investigations of extremist activity in Pakistan , including a case in which officials went as far as hiding militants from CIA inspection teams at a training camp run by the Pakistani military .
Military handlers then sent the trainees on terrorist missions to the West , Bruguiere asserts .
The United States made strategic errors in dealing with Pakistan , he says , adding that it might be too late to clear the security forces of those who sympathize with the extremists .
Islamic radicals seemed to benefit from “ a certain sympathy , to say the least ” within Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence agency , he writes , citing one of his cases .
“ We did not have the impression that our interlocutors considered [ Al Qaeda militants ] to be terrorists . ”

Published as interviews with Jean - Marie Pontaut , an editor at L’Express magazine , the book is a portrait of one of Europe ’s best - known crime fighters .
The stocky , square - jawed , restless Bruguiere comes from a line of judges dating back to Napoleonic times .
He tells of interrogating fanatics and eating crocodile meat during a harrowing investigative trip to Zaire , now the Democratic Republic of Congo .
But he also writes about growing up among Surrealist painters , who were friends of his father , an art aficionado .
And he participated in Paris ’ leftist student protests of May 1968 .
Tracing a history of modern - day terrorism , the book describes the nine - year investigation of the 1989 bombing of a flight from Chad to Paris that killed 170 people .
The global hunt culminated in the convictions , in absentia , of top Libyan officials .
The judge also recounts the fight against far - left and Palestinian groups supported by the Soviet Union .
After terrorist attacks on France in the 1990s , Bruguiere became an expert on Al Qaeda and an early warning voice .
Today , he says , errors by Washington contributed to the crisis in Pakistan .
“ The situation in Pakistan is among the most worrisome , ” he writes .
“ The central government has lost control of certain elements of the army and the ISI , an intelligence service that no longer has the trust of its foreign partners . ”

The judge cites his investigation of Willie Brigitte , a Frenchman who was convicted of terrorism charges in 2007 .
After the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States , Al Qaeda militants helped Brigitte go to Pakistan to train with hundreds of Arabs and Westerners and several thousand Pakistanis and Afghans at a mountain complex in Punjab .
Affiliated with Al Qaeda , the camp was run jointly by the Lashkar - e - Taiba extremist group and Pakistani security forces , which supplied arms and instructors , the book says .
CIA officers accompanied by Pakistani officials made four inspections of the camp , part of an agreement in which Pakistan had promised to prevent foreign militants from training with Lashkar , Bruguiere writes .
“ But , since most of the officers of Lashkar belonged to the army , these inspections were doomed to draw a blank , ” the book says .
“ The foreign recruits were alerted on the eve of the arrival of the inspection teams by their instructors , military men informed by their hierarchy .

“ The trainees then had to . . . erase any traces of their presence and head to an elevation of more than 13,000 feet while the inspection lasted . ”
The book says Brigitte testified that his handler was a Pakistani military officer , identified as Sajid , who sent the Frenchman to Australia to join a cell plotting bomb attacks on targets that included a nuclear plant .
Alerted by French investigators on Brigitte ’s trail , Australian police arrested the group in 2003 .
Sajid also dispatched militants for missions in Britain and in Virginia , where authorities later convicted Americans who were part of a group known as the “ paintball jihadis ” and who were fellow trainees of Brigitte , the book says .
A French court convicted Brigitte on terrorism charges and sentenced him to nine years in prison .
In 2006 , Bruguiere went to the Pakistani port city of Karachi to investigate a suicide bombing that had killed 11 French naval contractors three years earlier .
Pakistani security officials were uncooperative and hostile , he asserts .
Advertisement
“ French officials in Pakistan were the target of threats and physical intimidation : a way of dissuading us from returning , ” he writes .
The George W. Bush administration underestimated the threat in Pakistan largely because it was distracted by the war in Iraq , Bruguiere says .
He says U.S. - French tensions over Iraq did not harm anti-terrorism cooperation , and he writes about his many friends and allies in U.S. law enforcement .
But Bruguiere says he warned U.S. officials that the war would worsen Islamic extremism .
He dismisses former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz as “ men who did not understand the Arab world ” and “ felt invested with a quasi - divine sense of mission . ”
At the same time , Bruguiere shares with U.S. conservatives a deep suspicion of Iran .
Attacks by Iranian operatives in France and elsewhere show that Tehran ’s security apparatus is the “ real heart of power , ” the book says .

Iran has used systematic deception to manipulate Western diplomats in talks about its nuclear program , while preparing a global terrorist infrastructure that could be used in a confrontation with the West , Bruguiere charges .
Iran also could strike in unexpected ways in remote places such as West Africa or Latin America , where Tehran ’s longtime ally Hezbollah has an entrenched presence , Bruguiere warns .
“ These networks . . . are able to create circumstantial alliances with drug cartels operating in Colombia and Mexico , ” the book says , referring to the convergence of extremists and traffickers as “ a complex configuration of threats directed at the United States . ”

" And you thought liberal bias was limited to the evil mainstream media , " said Amy Sullivan in Time .
The guys at Conservapedia ( aka , " the trustworthy encyclopedia " ) have launched a project to retranslate the Bible , because , they say , " liberal bias has become the single biggest distortion in modern Bible translations . "
They want to " replace liberal words like ' labor ' " with terms conservatives like better , and " explain the numerous economic parables with their full free - market meaning . "
This takes crazy to a whole new level .
Okay , so " an explicitly ' conservative ' interpretation " of the Bible is n't such a great idea , said Ken Shepherd in Newsbusters.org .
But it 's interesting that Time 's Sullivan and others are lambasting Conservapedia 's Conservative Bible Project after all the " reverent treatment " the media gave to the " so - called Green Bible , " an edition that claimed that " eco-neglect " violates Jesus ' teachings by hurting the poor .
How about treating both projects with equal doses of " scorn and thoughtful criticism " ?
Conservapedia 's mission is in a class by itself , said Rod Dreher in BeliefNet .
" The insane hubris of this really staggers the mind . "
As Catholic blogger Mark Shea says , " some of this has a grain of sense to it , as ideological madness always does .
For instance , the dumb attempts to feminize Scripture are pernicious and need to stop . "
But it 's just laughable to think there are people out there trying to " make sure the Lord does n't go all wobbly on us . "
One of the " most well - worn clichés in modern politics " is that conservatives are a bunch of " scary Christianists , " said Paul Zummo in Southern Appeal ( via First Things ) .
But it 's the Left that is trying to " recruit Jesus Christ to their cause , " hoping to sell their positions on economic issues with their portrayal of " Jesus Christ , socialist superstar . "
But it 's all a smokescreen , because they know they 've run afoul of church teachings on matters such as abortion , euthanasia , and gay marriage .
It 's hard to believe society has sunk this low , said Eduardo Penalver in Commonweal .
Let 's hope the Conservative Bible Project turns out to be a hoax — it 's certainly funny , whether it's " satire or simply authentic insanity . "
But " it ’s a sad commentary on the state of our political discourse that it ’s so hard to tell the two apart these days . "
It became clear early in his administration that Barack Obama 's White House is addicted to the ' unprecedented . '
The W.H. 's use of ' unprecedented '
The Obama White House is addicted to the “ unprecedented . ”
Perhaps it was a sign when President Barack Obama sat down in January to record his first weekly address and announced : “ We begin this year and this administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action . "

What has followed is declaration after declaration of “ unprecedented ” milestones .
Some of them are legitimate firsts , like the president ’s online town hall at the White House in May .
But others the president wins merely on a technicality , and several clearly already have precedents .
The White House ’s announcement of its unprecedented — “ a first by an American president visiting China ” — town hall meeting with students in Beijing , for instance , drew a collective eye roll in certain circles back home , namely among former aides to President George W. Bush , who had already been grumbling about Obama ’s carefree application of “ unprecedented . ”
“ I think I attended a town hall with President Bush in China , ” former Bush adviser Karen Hughes quipped with a laugh , recalling a 2002 Bush speech in Beijing at which he took questions from the audience .
“ I thought :
Were they asleep ?
Or were they dreaming ?
I remember standing and watching President Bush engage in a town hall that I believe was televised . ”
President Bill Clinton also took questions from Chinese students at an event during a trip to the country in 1998 , then did a radio call - in show in Shanghai the next day .
The White House ’s characterization of Obama ’s Beijing town hall mirrored the description staff gave Obama ’s address to students on the first day of school , which the Education Department called “ historic . ”
Yet President George H.W. Bush delivered an address to students , as did President Ronald Reagan .
Maybe it was the streaming online video of Obama ’s speech to students that was unprecedented ?
Either way , for a president whose approach to exaggerated critiques of his administration is to “ call ‘ em out ” and who has made an issue of forcing corporate America to expose the fine print , one wonders whether his use of “ unprecedented ” would pass his own litmus test .
Indeed some of his efforts are unprecedented .
Obama noted , for example , that world leaders took “ unprecedented steps ” on nuclear nonproliferation at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council that he was the first U.S. president ever to chair .
But at times Obama ’s use of “ unprecedented ” is questionable .
Obama has said he “ took office amid unprecedented economic turmoil ” and that the situation demanded “ unprecedented international cooperation ” and resulted in his signing of the “ unprecedented " Recovery Act .
Yet it seems the Great Depression and the New Deal might be considered precedents for the current economic crisis and the $ 787 billion stimulus plan .
And Obama ’s promise of “ an unprecedented effort to root out waste and inefficiency ” sounded a lot like promises of past presidents .
“ I believe the Congress and the American people approve my goals of economy and efficiency , ” President Lyndon B. Johnson told Congress in 1965 .
“ I believe they are as opposed to waste as I am .
We can and will eliminate it . ”
On bipartisanship , Obama raised a few eyebrows when during his first press conference he cited “ putting three Republicans in my Cabinet ” as “ something that is unprecedented . ”
“ He is right — assuming he 's talking specifically about selecting three Republicans ( and not Democrats in a Republican administration ) simultaneously and during the first term ( not over the course of a presidency ) , ” the National Journal pointed out .
The magazine noted that Johnson , Harry S. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt had three Republicans serving in their Democratic administrations .
Republicans Gerald Ford and Dwight Eisenhower had three Democrats serving in theirs .
The White House stands by its claims .
“ During his first year in office , President Obama has taken historic and , in some cases , unprecedented actions to fulfill his campaign promise to change business as usual in Washington and confront the wide - ranging challenges facing America , ” said deputy White House press secretary Josh Earnest .
“ Cynics may say they ’ve heard it all before , but the progress we ’ve made on health care reform , energy reform and transparent government demonstrates these changes — in the view of the American people — can’t happen soon enough , ” he said .
And when it comes to the Chinese town hall , White House officials say the ex-Bush aides have it all wrong — saying it was the first full - blown “ town hall ” by a U.S. president in China ( because Clinton and Bush took questions after a speech ) .
It was also the first U.S. presidential event streamed to an Internet audience in China and the first with questions from the Internet .
And it garnered the biggest viewership , with 55 million online hits alone — making its audience unprecedented , oneofficial said .
The desire to be seen as treading on an unbeaten path is a part of the Obama brand .
His candidacy was built on the notion that his rise to the presidency followed no footprints .
He was n’t a Clinton or a John McCain .
He had a uniqueness that made him an unprecedented , if not unlikely , candidate .
That theme , which is driven by his personal narrative , has carried over into the White House .
And in the context of the something - to - prove drive of a young president with scant executive experience , the Obama White House has used “ unprecedented ” as a rhetorical means through which he has asserted himself .
It ’s also a reflection of the president personally .
“ It says how very unique he feels he is , ” said Stephen Hess , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Eisenhower , Nixon , Ford and Carter administrations .
Hess described Obama as “ a man who sees himself as unprecedented in every way … given his background — his mother , his father , where he grew up , how he became president of the United States . ”
“ Of course , biblically , there ’s nothing new under the sun , and for most everything he ’s done as president there is some precedent for somewhere , ” he added .
“ What he does is variations on a theme . ”
Still ,
Hess said , the word does n’t have “ great political currency . ”
“ I do n’t think he gets special credit for being unprecedented , but he thinks that way , ” he said .
“ I think that tells us more about him than really anything else about how he runs the White House . ”
Andrew Jackson was the first president to use the word “ unprecedented , ” in 1831 , according to a search of the archives of The American Presidency Project .
For more than 100 years afterward , presidents used the word “ unprecedented ” in 72 speeches and mostly reserved it for major addresses .
But since FDR talked of meeting “ the unprecedented task before us ” during his first inaugural address in 1933 , presidents have used the word on almost 2,000 occasions to describe everything from the death of Elvis Presley ( Carter ) to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan ( Reagan ) .
Obama has relied on “ unprecedented ” in more than 90 instances , using the word at least 129 times in everything from major addresses to small speeches , statements , memorandums and proclamations .
( Bush , by contrast , used the word 262 times over eight years . )
Obama has used “ unprecedented ” to describe his efforts on science research , his plan for the auto industry and his administration ’s ethics , transparency and accountability guidelines .
He has promised an “ unprecedented commitment ” to education , to developing clean energy and “ to preserving America 's treasured landscapes , ” which , Obama has noted , have seen “ unprecedented droughts ” and “ unprecedented wildfires ” in the face of climate change .
There has been “ unprecedented consensus ” on health care reform under Obama ’s watch , as well as “ the unprecedented intervention of the federal government to stabilize the financial markets ” and an “ unprecedented ” bank review .
His administration has also taken “ unprecedented action to stem the spread of foreclosures , ” Obama said , including the creation of “ an unprecedented fund , in partnership with the Federal Reserve , ” to get credit flowing .
“ I wonder if they believe that everything is really unprecedented , or is it just their talking point , ” said former Bush spokesman Gordon Johndroe , who is among those smarting over Obama ’s use of unprecedented .
“ This rhetoric is more understandable during a campaign , but I ’m not sure it ’s going to get them far while governing when the facts do n’t always agree . ”
It arguably started during the campaign , when Obama ’s team was clocking one unprecedented milestone after another : his trip to Europe , his Internet connectedness , his fundraising strategy , his rallies , his crowds .
Obama ’s election was historic .
His inauguration broke attendance records that reportedly required “ unprecedented ” security .
And sure , once in office , the administration faced a massive economic crisis .
And , yes , the Obama team brought the White House onto Facebook and Twitter .
But by applying the “ unprecedented ” label to a so many scenarios in government — from transparency to efforts to reduce the environmental impact of mountaintop coal mining — the Obama administration risks outsize expectations and overhype .
“ It comes close to a certain arrogance , ” Hughes said , “ as if this president has done things that no other president has ever done before — except that they have done them before . ”
Obama even treads on unprecedented territory in ways he ’s not trying to highlight .
At this point in his presidency he ’s spent more time on the golf course , for instance , than his immediate predecessor .
He ’s also attended more fundraisers .
And sometimes he surprises people with his characterization of himself as " America 's first Pacific president , " as he did in Tokyo last week .
Obama 's unprecedented use of " unprecedented " will likely continue in his second year in office , when the administration is expected to tackle the unprecedented deficit .

Here 's my slide deck from my talk at last night 's New York Futures Salon .
This is the raw Slideshare conversion , so a few of the transitions end up as blank slides ( and you lose all of the nifty Keynote effects ) .
The talk was videotaped , and the recording will be available on the net Real Soon Now .
I 'll post a link when it 's available .
Overall , the talk went well .
Good questions , good crowd ( it ended up being considerably more crowded than the early gathering shown below ) .
I 'll have more to say in this week 's Fast Company piece .
Curiously , all this was foreshadowed nearly 70 years ago by one of the two men who , more than any others , were responsible for creating the government we now live under .
Altiero Spinelli , an Italian Communist sitting in a Fascist jail , sketched out how , in order to build a new United States of Europe after the Second World War , it would be necessary to piece together the new form of government gradually over many years without explaining its ultimate aim .
The day would come , however , when enough of it had been assembled and a convention could be summoned to draft , as its " crowning glory " , a constitution .
At last , said Spinelli , the peoples of Europe would see what had been done in their name and would greet it with " acclamation " .
For evolutionary scientists there is no such thing as " Darwinism " .
Instead we have a scientific theory that , in combination with Mendel 's work , provides the modern or neo -Darwinian synthesis , which explains the development of life on Earth .
Although this is a rather succinct definition it effectively sets the limits of the usefulness of Darwin 's theory .
However , in the last 150 years , there have been many attempts to take Darwin 's idea and apply it outside of the context for which it was developed , hence the influence of social " Darwinism " on concepts such as eugenics and a more recent Darwinian nihilism that absolves the individual of any moral or social responsibility .
There is an inherent danger in extrapolating science beyond the realm for which it was intended , but ironically this human trait is perhaps best understood as an evolutionary hangover from the development of our massively expanded brainpower .
We have an innate need to expand and develop ideas in order to explain our wider existence or justify our behaviours .
This inherent danger of using Darwin 's theory outside of its biological context has lead to attempts to portray Darwin as the de facto cause of 20th century genocide : see , for example , Andre Pichot 's book The Pure Society .
There is a fallacy at the core of this line of thinking – can scientists really be held responsible for what is done with their ideas when they are misunderstood and corrupted by groups such as the Nazis ?
I would argue that they cannot : the actions of criminals do not need such highbrow justification and trying to do so merely lends a pseudo - scientific veneer the actions of the Third Reich .
A newer and perhaps more insidious attempt to blame " Darwinism " for human atrocity comes in the form of Dennis Sewell 's book The Political Gene : How Darwin 's Ideas Changed Politics .
Sewell cites Darwin's work as the reason for the development of something that he broadly categorises as a form of moral detachment from societal rules and norms : evolution is random and without purpose therefore I can do whatever I please .
He argues that this moral vacuum can lead to disturbed teenagers perpetrating horrific crimes such as the Columbine school massacre .
Sewell does not propose that Darwin 's theory leads inevitably to such actions , however he suggests that some of Darwin 's other writings were racist and not in keeping with modern views .
This is hardly a stunning revelation : Darwin was a man of his time and of his society .
Sewell is making a common mistake in grafting the faults and flaws of Darwin the man onto Darwinian evolution .
Darwin the man has been venerated and condemned during the 2009 celebrations – surely it is now time to move on from either hero worship or iconoclasm to a more nuanced view , just as evolutionary biology has developed since 1859 .
An interesting parallel can be seen in how Islamists subvert the essentially peaceful message of Islam into a justification for violence and vitriolic hate .
One can no more blame the actions of misguided Islamists on Muhammad than the Nazis or high school shooters can be blamed on Darwin .
Humans have a tremendous capacity for selflessness and creativity but we also have an equally developed ability to cause destruction and misery .
Both extremes are a result of our evolutionary heritage .
If we blame Darwin for the dark side of human nature , logically we must also credit him with all that is good .

I n four years of researching and writing about Guanta ' namo , I have become used to uncovering shocking information , but for sheer cynicism , I am struggling to think of anything that compares to the revelations contained in the unclassified ruling in the habeas corpus petition of Fouad al - Rabiah , a Kuwaiti prisoner whose release was ordered last week by Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly ( PDF ) .
In the ruling , to put it bluntly , it was revealed that the U.S. government tortured an innocent man to extract false confessions and then threatened him until he obligingly repeated those lies as though they were the truth .
The background : lies hidden in plain sight for five years
To establish the background to this story , it is necessary for me to return to my initial response to the ruling a week last Friday , before these revelations had been made public , when , based on what I knew of the case from the publicly available documents , I explained that I was disappointed that the Obama administration had pursued a case against al - Rabiah , alleging that he was a fundraiser for Osama bin Laden and had run a supply depot for al - Qaeda in Afghanistan 's Tora Bora mountains , for two particular reasons .
The first was because a CIA analyst had interviewed al - Rabiah at Guanta ' namo in the summer of 2002 and had concluded that he was an innocent man caught at the wrong time and in the wrong place ; and the second was because , although al - Rabiah had said that he had met bin Laden and had been present in the Tora Bora mountains , he had provided an innocent explanation for both occurrences .
He had , he said , been introduced to bin Laden on a trip to Afghanistan to investigate proposals for a humanitarian aid mission , and he had been at Tora Bora -- and compelled to man a supply depot -- because he was one of numerous civilians caught up with soldiers of al - Qaeda and the Taliban as he tried to flee the chaos of Afghanistan for Pakistan , and had been compelled to run the depot by a senior figure in al - Qaeda .
These appeared to be valid explanations , especially as al - Rabiah , a 42 - year old father of four children , had no history of any involvement with militancy or terrorism , and had , instead , spent 20 years at a management desk job at Kuwait Airways , and had an ownership interest in some health clubs .
Moreover , he had a history of legitimate refugee relief work , having taken a six - month approved leave of absence from work in 1994 - 95 to do relief work in Bosnia , having visited Kosovo with the Kuwaiti Red Crescent in 1998 , and having made a trip to Bangladesh in 2000 to delivery kidney dialysis fluid to a hospital in the capital , Dhaka .
As a result , it appeared to me a week last Friday that Judge Kollar - Kotelly granted al - Rabiah 's habeas petition because neither his meeting with bin Laden nor his presence in Tora Bora indicated that he was either a member of , or had supported al - Qaeda or the Taliban .
However , now that Judge Kollar - Kotelly 's ruling has been issued , I realize that the account given by al - Rabiah during his Combatant Status Review Tribunal at Guanta ' namo in 2004 -- on which I based my account of his activities -- was a tissue of lies , and that the truth , hidden for over six years , is that , like torture victims groomed for show trials throughout the centuries , he made up false stories under torture , and repeated them obediently , fearing further punishment and having been convinced that he would never leave Guanta ' namo by any other means .
An introduction to the torture revelations , and an endorsement of al - Rabiah 's explanations about his time in Afghanistan
In her ruling , Judge Kollar - Kotelly methodically dissected the government 's case to reveal the chilling truth .
After noting , initially , that the " evidentiary record " was " surprisingly bare , " because the government " has withdrawn its reliance on most of the evidence and allegations that were once asserted against al - Rabiah , and now relies almost exclusively on al - Rabiah's ' confessions ' to certain conduct , " she added , with a palpable sense of disbelief :
Not only did al - Rabiah 's interrogators repeatedly conclude that these same confessions were not believable -- which al - Rabiah 's counsel attributes to abuse and coercion , some of which is supported by the record -- but it is also undisputed that al - Rabiah confessed to information that his interrogators obtained from either alleged eyewitnesses who are not credible and as to whom the Government has now largely withdrawn any reliance , or from sources that never even existed " If there exists a basis for al - Rabiah 's indefinite detention , it most certainly has not been presented to this Court .
In dealing with al - Rabiah 's background , and his reasons for traveling to Afghanistan , Judge Kollar - Kotelly was required to consider his own assertion that , after a preliminary ten - day visit in July 2001 to identify areas where humanitarian aid might be delivered , he returned in October 2001 " to complete a fact - finding mission related to Afghanistan 's refugee problems and the country 's non-existent medical infrastructure , " against the government 's claim that he was " ' not an aspiring aid worker caught up in the front lines of the United States war against al - Qaeda ' but instead was someone who traveled to Afghanistan in October 2001 as a ' devotee of Osama bin Laden who ran to bin Laden 's side after September 11th . ' "
Concluding that " The evidence in the record strongly supports al - Rabiah 's explanation , " Judge Kollar - Kotelly noted that he had officially requested leave prior to his departure , and quoted from two letters sent to his family .
In the first , on October 18 , 2001 , he explained that " for ten days he assisted with the delivery of supplies to refugees and that he was able to take video ' reflecting the tragedy of the refugees , ' but that he was unable to leave Afghanistan through Iran ( the route he took to enter the country ) because the borders had been closed . "
As a result , he " wrote in his letter that he and an unspecified number of other persons decided ' to drive four trucks to Pakistan making our way to Peshawar , ' " and he also asked his brother to notify his boss at Kuwait Airlines that he was having difficulties returning to Kuwait on time .
After noting that " The evidence in the record establishes that al - Rabiah did , in fact , travel across Afghanistan towards Peshawar , ultimately getting captured ( unarmed ) by villagers outside of Jalalabad " on approximately December 25 , 2001 " ( with Maher al - Quwari , a Palestinian who also ended up in Guanta ' namo ) , Judge Kollar - Kotelly quoted from a second letter sent to his family , in which -- ironically , in light of what was to come -- he wrote that he was " detained by the American troops and thanks to God they are good example [s ] of humanitarian behavior . "
He added that he was " detained pending verification of [ his ] identity and personality , " and that the " investigation and verification procedures may last for a long time due to the great number of detained Arabs and other persons " who had been fleeing the situation in Afghanistan , which " turned upside down between one day and night and every Arab citizen has become a suspect . "
Discrediting the government 's unreliable witnesses
Moving on to the government 's key allegations -- about Osama bin Laden and Tora Bora -- Judge Kollar - Kotelly dismissed the allegations regarding al - Rabiah 's supposed activities in Tora Bora , which were made by another prisoner who claimed that he " was told that al - Rabiah was in charge of supplies at Tora Bora , " by noting that , " Although his allegations are filled with inconsistencies and implausibilities , the Government continues to rely on him as an eyewitness . "
She also noted that , although the witness had identified al - Rabiah as the man under discussion , from his kunya ( nickname ) , Abu Abdullah al - Kuwaiti , the government had conceded that another Abu Abdullah al - Kuwaiti , an actual al - Qaeda operative named Hadi El - Enazi , was present in Tora Bora , and also noted that an interrogator had expressed doubt about the supposed eyewitness at the time ( much of the ruling is redacted , but this seemed to involve a claim that al - Rabiah 's oldest son was with him in Afghanistan , when this was demonstrably not the case ) .
Judge Kollar - Kotelly also dismissed two other sets of allegations by the supposed eyewitness .
Noting further " inconsistencies and impossibilities " in his accounts , she stated that " the Court has little difficulty concluding that [ his ] allegations are not credible , " and explained that , to reach this conclusion , she had also drawn on statements provided by al - Rabiah 's lawyers , which further undermined his reliability , " based on , among other things , undisputed inconsistencies associated with his allegations against other detainees , " and his medical records , which obviously indicated mental health problems ( although the description was redacted ) .
" At a minimum , " she added , " the Government would have had to corroborate [ his ] allegations with credible and reliable evidence , which it has not done . "
Osama bin Laden , it then transpired , appeared in allegations made by a second prisoner , who " alleged that al - Rabiah attended a feast hosted by Osama bin Laden , " where he " presented bin Laden with a suitcase full of money . "
This source also alleged that al - Rabiah " served in various fighting capacities in the Tora Bora mountains , " and that he " funneled money to mujahadeen in Bosnia in 1995 . "

We have this great little library around the corner , which is very convenient .
In London , there are lots of libraries , but it ’s such big city geographically that it ’s not always the case that there ’s a library just around the corner .
It ’s a nice library — it ’s right next to The Keats House , where John Keats lived next door to Fanny Brawne before heading off to Italy and an untimely death .
The trees at the edge of the Keats House grounds hang over the path that leads to the library doors , and in Spring there are lovely blossoms dropping petals on the path .
The building itself is that curious medley that one often encounters in England , a combination of a bit of old grandeur with some 1960s crap thrown in to make the interior more “ functional . ”
But it ’s comfortable , it has a good collection of books and newspapers , an attractive children ’s room , and a bunch of PCs that people use for internet access , and it used to have a neighbor ’s cat , Moggy , who would wander in and sleep all day before she died last Spring , much to the dismay of the regulars .
Recently there ’s been a change in tone .
There have been some new people showing up behind the desk , and they ’re all chirpy .
They ask questions , like “ Did you find everything you need ? ” , stuff like that .
They chat up the fact that , oh look , you have this book out , and that one too .
Personally , I find this a bit irritating .
I like my librarians on the reserved side , and not to be salesmen .
Fortunately , this has not been a regular occurrence , but it makes me nervous .
And it turns out that it may be part of a general plot to change the character of libraries in the area entirely .
Well , maybe not a plot–it may not be nearly as well thought out as a plot would be .
The Heath Library , as it ’s called , is part of the Borough of Camden library system .
And the Borough of Camden has been trying to figure out how to cut its budget .
Just like everyplace else in Britain , and the US , and any number of other places around the world these days .
So Camden has decided to make some adjustments to how library services are provided in the borough .
As the Camden New Journal reports this week :
CONTROVERSIAL plans to make a £ 2 million cut to the library budget by reducing staff and introducing self - service machines were finally signed off at the Town Hall last night ( Wednesday ) .
I ca n’t wait to see what self - service machines are all about .
Self - service for what ?
Ah , checking out books .
What could possibly go wrong here ?
Liberal Democrat culture chief Councillor Flick Rea resisted pressure for a rethink and agreed to proposals mapped out in the council ’s library reform programme , known as Growing Your Library and developed by council officials and consultants over several months .
Rea said the only way libraries would survive for future generations in its current £ 8.2 million budget .
“ Otherwise the service will not survive in the tooth and claw climate of modern local government finance , ” she said .
The cuts will be made over four years .
The plan here seems to be Growing Your Library by Cutting Its Funds .
Before making her decision , Councillor Rea heard deputations from library users who criticised the programme , including one from John Richardson of the Camden History Society who accused her of allowing it to be “ pushed through without democratic process ” .
She said the time saved by putting in self - issuing machines – and thus “ freeing up ” librarians to help readers – would be cancelled out by the staffing cuts .
“ There is no evidence that the library service will improve as a result of the changes , ” she added .
In addition to the 15 posts that have already been axed , more cuts , including some compulsory redundancies , are expected .
I hope someone eventually will explain to me why there never actually seems to be any money for saving the things that are worth saving .
And why we ca n’t just hire more librarians “ to help readers , ” whatever that means .
Finding books ?
Learning how to use the catalog ?
Finding stuff on the internet ?
People need help with these things ?
How did the Borough of Camden come up with these plans ?
Well , for all its concern about saving money , the Borough does n’t appear to mind spending a bit of money itself .
As the Camden New Journal reports in a separate article :
CONSULTANTS hired to help redesign Camden ’s library service were paid more than £ 2,000 a day over the summer .
American firm IDEO was paid £ 47,000 for 23 days work on the Growing Your Library ( GYL ) project , according to information released following a request by the New Journal under the Freedom of Information Act .
The work was part of a major overhaul of the library service in Camden , which will see some staff jobs cut and machines introduced .
Look , those machines again .
Reports suggested consultants visited a series of businesses , including the glamorous Apple Store in Regent Street , to see what ideas could be transferred to council - run libraries .
Well , I can certainly see how hitting the Apple Store would be useful in trying to redesign library services .
On its website IDEO describes itself as an “ innovation and design ” company .
It lists some of its better known clients , a roll call of American multi-billion - pound organisations , including the Bank of America , food giant Nestlé and the charity set up by billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft owner Bill Gates , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
Actually , the Ideo website is a hoot .
Where do these people come from ?
Oh , Palo Alto , as it turns out .
It ’s like a William Gibson novel , one of the recent ones — everything is symbolic , and of the moment , or something .
Someone named Ted Brown seems to be the design guru of the company , and you can hear him drone on in a video the site helpfully provides .
And there are lots of references to design — Climate Change and design , how design got small and then big again , that sort of thing .
Now , I do n’t doubt that design is important , Climate Change being a pretty good example of how better design can help us out quite a lot , but it ’s still not obvious to me how this is the group to talk to in order to determine how your library services can be “ improved . ”
So what did they actually do for Camden for two grand a day ?
It ’s not actually clear , because Camden wo n’t release the report that they spent £ 47,000 on .
Freedom of Information officers at the Town Hall refused to reveal what the council got out of the deal and a request to see a draft of the ideas supplied to the leisure department was refused on the grounds that they have not been introduced yet .
Although officers accepted it was in the public interest to reveal what the money was spent on for “ accountability and transparency ” reasons , they ruled that to “ prematurely ” disclose the findings would result in “ partial or inaccurate information being released ” and would not allow Camden time to discuss with staff how the plans might affect them .
Officials insisted it was in the “ public interest ” not to release any more information .
We certainly would n’t want to release anything prematurely , to give the wrong impression .
Just as well , because I imagine the discussion of the following probably needs some sharpening up :
Discussions held during a five - day workshop involving IDEO and library staff – described as a “ deep - dive ” brainstorming event – have been posted on the internal Camden intranet .
Details of some of the suggestions put forward by IDEO consultants have been criticised by staff , who contacted the New Journal to say the public would be “ horrified ” and “ amused ” at the “ absurdity ” of the week - long session and “ the way their council tax money has been spent ” .
The firm visited six businesses in London , including City Farm in Islington , the Apple Store in Regent Street and Jamie Oliver ’s cook shop Recipease in Clapham .
City Farm ?
Where the cows and chickens are ?
That should help .
Consultants spent time at three Camden libraries – Regent ’s Park , Kentish Town and Swiss Cottage – where they held meetings with library users and observed staff “ to find out how they actually provided and used services ” , but staff have queried their decision not to visit any celebrated libraries outside the borough .
Or any of the uncelebrated ones within the borough other than those three , for that matter .
The firm ’s main specification was to come up with innovative ideas about what libraries and librarians could offer in the future , when Camden launches the second phase of its library reform programme next year .
This must be where the “ self - service machines ” thing comes from .
Funnily enough , try as I might , I ca n’t find a single reference to anything about libraries on the Ideo website other than a link to an article in American Libraries magazine about “ Design Thinking ” in Libraries , by Stephen Bell , who may or may not be connected to Ideo .
The article and comments are great — about “ human- centered ” somethingorother , and –here ’s the kicker –providing a “ memorable library experience . ”
There ’s the Apple connection , all right .
So it ’s obvious why Camden chose Ideo to come up with some visionary thinking on how libraries can be improved at the same time their budgets are being hacked to death .
A council spokeswoman said : “ The council approached a number of specialists to bid for work on the Growing Your Library project .
IDEO , an international company whose UK headquarters are in Camden , was chosen in competition with a number of other agencies , as they offered the best combination of experience , capacity and proven track record in the field . ”
Well , if this was the best of the lot , what did the other bidders look like ?
I ’m reminded of that D.J. Taylor novel with a running subtext of the increasing rip - off of UK governments by management consultants running around a couple of decades ago in the country ’s haste to privatize everything that moved .
This sort of thing is the logical result — let ’s have a firm of design consultants decide what libraries are for and how they should be used .
After all , librarians would n’t necessarily have any idea of how to improve services , obviously , or anything above and beyond what you could extract in a day - long brainstorming session
Actually , given the apparently marginal state of libraries , we may as well have a design firm given an assessment of how to improve library usage .
Libraries in the UK ( and apparently in the US as well ) are under pressure — over the past ten years over 100 libraries have been closed in England , visits per capita have been declining ( marginally , but still ) , and expenditures per capita have been rising sharply .
I can think of lots to fault the Labour government for , but increasing funds to libraries ( until very recently ) is not one of them .
But , ultimately , libraries in the UK really depend on local council funding — and councils are currently hurting , so it ’s not surprising that libraries make an easy target .
It ’s not as if anyone actually makes money from them .
This is a familiar story , with a number of explanations — increasing access to the internet and other electronically - delivered information elsewhere , the increasing uneducatability of a number of children , and , perhaps , the possibility that people just read less — although I would need more convincing on this last point , in this country where not only is the major book award televised , but the bookmakers give odds on the potential winners .
So there are good reasons to get a broad range of inputs here .
But it ’s not clear to me that having librarians and library staff become the functional equivalents of the sales force at the Apple store is the right approach .
Or brainstorming sessions , for that matter .
What is needed , first of all , is a commitment to culture , and its preservation , and broad public access to it .
In many respects , there is an admirable commitment to this notion here , or at least there was when times were good .
But for a country with the literary heritage that this one has , even the closure of one library is a measure of our failure to meet this commitment
Sergeant Kimberly
Munley recalled today how she had been engaged in the mundane task of washing her patrol car when the call came that was to turn her into a US heroine .
The police officer credited with stopping a gunman at the Fort Hood military base in Texas last week described the confrontation in an interview – her first since the shooting – on the Oprah Winfrey show .
Munley , who had been on traffic duty that day , said she had abandoned her washing chore when a call came through that there was a shooting at the base .
She ran to the scene , which she described as " confusing and chaotic " , with 13 people already dead and dozens wounded .
People were pointing at a corner where they thought the gunman was .
She ran forward , turned the corner and fired twice .
Munley was hit by three bullets .
She described how the first shot felt like " a muscle being torn out of my leg " .
She underwent two operations , one on a severed artery .
But she was well enough on the evening of the shooting to speak by phone to family and friends .
Yesterday she met the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , who visited her in hospital .
Munley , 34 , a mother , said she expected her recovery to be slow but she knew she could do it .
" I 'm doing well , " she said .
" Every day is progress for me , and things are getting better day by day .
And emotionally , I 'm just hoping that the rest of the officers and the injured and the families of the deceased are healing as well . "
Although there is still some confusion about which shots brought down the alleged gunman , officials have attributed the bullets that brought him down to Munley .
The commander of the base , Lieutenant - General Bob Cone , said of Munley : " It was an amazing and an aggressive performance by this police officer . "
Munley had been trained in tactics for dealing with such a gun incident .
As part of that training , she had been told to fire rather than wait for additional back - up , a delay that is blamed for a high casualty toll at the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting .
Also interviewed today was her partner Sergeant Mark Todd , 42 , like Munley a civilian police officer , who said it was the first time in his career that he had used his weapon .
Major Nadil Malik Hasan , who is suspected of carrying out the shooting , is also in hospital .
He has not yet been charged and is refusing to talk to investigators .
It is alleged that he did not want to be deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq because he did not want to kill fellow Muslims , and that the military would not allow him to leave the services .

With ever - growing numbers of businesses and users , quite simply the internet is running out of Internet Protocol addresses with which to create new website domains .
With the problem compounded by the need for IP addresses for mobile phone users , the twenty year - old IP v4 system allocating IP addresses is showing the strain .
IPv6 is the newest version of the Internet Protocol offering space for longer addresses and increasing the number of available IP addresses from 4 billion to a staggering trillion trillion .
According to the latest IPv6 Deployment Monitoring Survey sponsored by the European Commission , not enough businesses are switching over to IPv6 .
The survey , which included 610 respondents from 54 countries , revealed that only 17 per cent of companies are making use of IPv6 .
The position has only marginally improved since ARIN 's survey in March 2008 with businesses remaining uncertain about the benefits of switching over .
Of those businesses that were n't considering switching to IP v6 , almost 70 per cent could n't understand the need for change .
The survey also revealed that 92 per cent of ISPs are not using IPv6 and are themselves unsure about whether to promote IP v6 uptake to their customers .
Why switch to IPv6 ?
So why should businesses change over to IPv6 ?
Even RIPE 's " IPv6 Act Now " site only warns us that " failure to adopt these new resources could mean a slowing in the pace of internet innovation " which is n't something most businesses are likely to worry about .
IP v4 addresses are likely to continue working long after all the available addresses run out , so the problem itself is only likely to affect new businesses or current businesses looking to expand their web presence .
That said , a change to IP v6 seems inevitable .
Cisco 's view is that " every customer in the market will face the inevitable transition from IP v4 to IPv6 . "
As such , the change to IPv6 will eventually be forced upon businesses as demand for IP addresses exceeds supply along with the associated costs of retraining staff , enhancing management tools , routers and operating or deploying IPv6 - enabled versions of applications .
Microsoft have already built support for IP v6 into Windows from XP to 7 , so it really boils down to a question of whether to change over to IP v6 sooner or later ?
What are the advantages of switching ?
Besides the capacity to have longer IP addresses - 128 bits instead of the current 32 - which might prove beneficial for various web apps , IP v6 offers tougher security thanks to the core feature of IP ( Sec ) which secures B2B data flows using AES and Triple - DES encryption .
IP ( Sec ) also offers strong authentication with a header extension that checks each data packet comes from the source address it claims and makes use of cryptographic keys to establish a session between computers or servers .
Besides better security , IPv6 also comes with auto - configuration , with IP v6 hosts detecting the presence of local networks and routers automatically potentially saving businesses money in terms of IP and network management .
Auto - configuration will also aid wireless mobile devices in connecting when travelling and discovering foreign networks .
Multicasting , or sending data packets to multiple recipients , is also supported by IPv6 , which is handy for videoconferencing and streaming video to other business users .
While IP v4 also supports multicast , it 's optional and not every router or host currently supports it .
IP v6 also has an anycast mode for sending information to the nearest member of a group of recipients .

Veterans and artists are raising a new flag at the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration Healthcare Center : a Strawberry Flag .
Part therapy , part art installation and part fundraiser , the project has created a raised strawberry field in the shape of an American flag .
Veterans tend the strawberries , transplanted from abandoned fields , and sell preserves they make from second - harvest fruit .
The project , spearheaded by artist Lauren Bon and psychiatrist Jonathan Sherin , associate chief of mental health for the center , aims to promote recovery and reintegration for the veterans .
It also is helping revitalize a campus that housed recovering Civil War soldiers and now serves the more than 500,000 veterans in the Los Angeles area .
The flag and its surroundings , about the size of a football field , holds red - berried plants growing in rows of raised white pipes in a ground coconut mixture .
Reclaimed trees and other plants outline the flag 's blue upper left corner , creating an open - air teahouse , where visitors can sit and drink tea , relax or meditate .
Supporting patriotism
The veterans and teahouse guests are the " stars " on the American flag , says Bon , 47 , granddaughter of diplomat and philanthropist Walter Annenberg .
She is one of three directors of the private Annenberg Foundation and heads Metabolic Studio , an art studio and charitable activity of the foundation , which supports the Strawberry Flag project .
Bon estimates Metabolic Studio has spent about $ 100,000 to cover veterans ' salaries , events and materials .
But many of the resources were free .
The reclaimed plants and the water from the Los Angeles river and rooftops came without a cost , and the VA is letting the project use the space rent - free .
" We 're doing this sculpture as a way to activate the site and a way to promote resources that support patriotism , " Bon says .
The grounds where the Strawberry Flag sits , and most of the surrounding buildings , were empty and only used occasionally as sets for movies or TV shows , before the project arrived , says site historian Janet Owen Driggs of the Metabolic Studio .
A pond filled with fish and watercress sits at the end of each pipeline , cleaning and adding minerals to the water .
Veterans and visitors pedal solar - powered stationary bikes next to the flag to pump water into the tubes .
Bobby Shelton , 75 , a Korean
War veteran , carefully checks each strawberry plant and the pond every day .
The project is a " wonderful idea , " Shelton says .
" It 's creative .
I like the purpose of it .
I 'm proud to be a part of the organization .
It gave me a new energy , a new source in life , motivated me to do more . "
Every weekday afternoon , tea and bread with treats including strawberry jam or sausage rolls are served at the flag .
Twice a month , high tea is held , and veterans and visitors come together to talk and enjoy – literally – the fruits of their labor .
' It raises my self - esteem '
Deborah Peterson oversees the kitchen where veterans make the preserves and prepare for daily teas .
Weekly " jam sessions " are social gatherings as well as a chance for veterans to learn how to make jam , she says .
Until the flag 's own strawberries are mature enough to harvest , the veterans are using berries from the VA farmers market , and getting help from a local jam company .
Jerome Larson , 40 , a veteran of the first Gulf War , is developing the print studio that makes maps of the VA campus and will supply the jam jars with labels featuring vets .
" A lot of us ( veterans ) are in recovery , and we 're just trying to move forward to getting established in the community , and this is a great way to do that , " Larson says .
" It raises my self - esteem and helps me focus on positive things in my life . "
Back at the flag , Charles Warren , 55 , a Vietnam veteran , leads spin classes on the eight stationary bikes .
The flag is a " pretty big deal , " Warren says , and reminds him of the military , where everyone works together to accomplish the mission .
" For them to come in with smiles and open arms and befriend us , it means the world to me , " he says .
The flag began with a few veterans in the VA 's compensated - work - therapy program and has expanded to more than a dozen , plus volunteers , says project coordinator Rochelle Fabb .
She notes the parallel between the flag and the veterans :
The workers are reclaiming the flag 's strawberries , and the veterans are reclaiming their lives .
" For me , it 's been about the people and the rejuvenation that I 've seen , " she says .

Climate disruption deniers have been claiming for years now that the global temperature has been cooling down , even though the temperature data clearly shows that it is n’t .
Scientists and statisticians have pointed out that , mathematically speaking , the recent reduced warming trend is well within the noise , or put another way , it ’s weather , not climate .
A new report by the Associated Press reveals what many of us knew already – the denier ’s claims do n’t hold water , statistically speaking .
The report is intriguing because the AP provided their data to four independent statisticians without telling them what it was , and all four found that the slower warming of the past decade was statistically insignificant with respect to the actual data .
In a blind test , the AP gave temperature data to four independent statisticians and asked them to look for trends , without telling them what the numbers represented .
The experts found no true temperature declines over time .
“ If you look at the data and sort of cherry - pick a micro - trend within a bigger trend , that technique is particularly suspect , ” said John Grego , a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina .
Furthermore , the data that the AP sent to the statistician came from two different sources – the National Climate Data Center ( NCDC ) , run by NOAA , and the satellite data preferred by climate disruption deniers that is generated by scientists John Christy and Roy Spencer from the University of Alabama in Huntsville .
In both cases , the statisticians found no statistically significant trends over the last ten years .
Statisticians who analyzed the data found a distinct decades - long upward trend in the numbers , but could not find a significant drop in the past 10 years in either data set .
The ups and downs during the last decade repeat random variability in data as far back as 1880 .
Saying there ’s a downward trend since 1998 is not scientifically legitimate , said David Peterson , a retired Duke University statistics professor and one of those analyzing the numbers .
Identifying a downward trend is a case of “ people coming at the data with preconceived notions , ” said Peterson , author of the book “ Why Did They Do That ?
An Introduction to Forensic Decision Analysis . ” ( emphasis mine )
The AP interviewed Don Easterbrook , who claimed that “ We started the cooling trend after 1998 .
You ’re going to get a different line depending on which year you choose . ”
According to one of the statisticians , the fact that you have to choose 1998 as your starting point in order to observe a ( statistically insignificant ) cooling trend is part of the problem .
Grego produced three charts to show how choosing a starting date can alter perceptions .
Using the skeptics ’ satellite data beginning in 1998 , there is a “ mild downward trend , ” he said .
But doing that is “ deceptive . ”
The trend disappears if the analysis starts in 1997 .
And it trends upward if you begin in 1999 , he said .
This is what ’s referred to in statistics as “ endpoint sensitivity , ” and it ’s the main reason that climate disruption deniers like Easterbrook can appear and sound so reasonable when they ’re actually misusing or misunderstanding the data .

Melting glaciers releasing pollutants from decades ago
A study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology has revealed a new and troubling aspect to climate disruption – as glaciers melt , they are releasing persistent organic pollutants like DDT , PCBs , other pesticides , and synthetic musks ( chemicals that mask body odor ) .
The scientists studied the annual sediment layers in a high alpine lake in Switzerland and found that there the annual flux of pollutants varied consistently across all the studied pollutants – the fluxes started low in the 1950s , peaked in the 1960s and 70s , dropped off again in the 1980s , and then rose to a new peak in the late 1990s .
But in the case of all the pollutants except for musks , the production of the pollutants ceased by 1986 at the latest , and the musks have been in constant production globally since the late 1980s .
The image at right illustrates these peaks for the various pollutants the scientists studied .
According to the study , the first peak corresponds closely to when the production of the various pollutants peaked , either in Switzerland or in continental Europe .
That peak likely is a result of airborne delivery of the pollutant , either by way of dust or precipitation depositing the pollution in the lake and surrounding land directly .
But since there has been no production ( or constant production ) of the pollutants in decades , it ’s extremely unlikely that dust or rain / snow is responsible for the second peak .
In addition , the authors compare the results from the high alpine , glacial melt - fed lake to several other lower altitude lakes .
The comparison shows that the low altitude lakes do not show the same spike in pollutants in the late 1990s that the alpine lake does , but they do show similar dust / precipitation driven spikes in the 1950s , 60s , and 70s .
As a result , the authors ’ hypothesized that glacial ice had been accumulating pollutants since the 1960s and 70s and then started releasing those pollutants into the lake as the pollution - laden ice melted .
And given the strength of their data , they ’re almost certainly correct .
The ramifications of this are significant .
Other studies have found recent increases in pollutants around the world even though the production of those pollutants stopped decades ago .
Pesticides have been discovered in alpine lakes in the Italian Alps and the Canadian Rockies , and Antarctic penguins have been found to have old DDT in their bodies .
If this result holds for other glacially - fed lakes around the world ( and there ’s no reason to believe that the results wo n’t hold ) , then the dangerous pollutants that environmentalists thought had largely been phased out will return and could cause similar ecological damage as they caused decades ago ( DDT - thinned eggshells , fishing limitations due to PCBs , etc. ) .
And all as a result of glacier melt that has been caused or enhanced by climate disruption - driven warming .
And the results of the study point out that the pollutants present in the studied lake are not likely to be everything that the glacier holds :
The burden of pollutants in Lake Oberaar sediment due to glacier melting is already in the same range as the earlier accumulation from direct atmospheric input .
The undiminished increase of the fluxes of many organohalogens into the sediment of Lake Oberaar does not yet prefigure an exhaust of the glacial inventory of these contaminants .
In other words , the environmental toll of these pollutants is n’t over yet by a long shot .

IEA : climate treaty necessary to keep energy prices low
There are many reasons to address climate disruption , ranging from saving species to reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil to reducing the chance of catastrophic drought .
The economy is usually not considered to be one of the reasons , especially by those who have a vested interest in maintaining their own profits at the expense of the environment and global climate .
However , there are those who say that addressing climate change is critical to maintaining a healthy future economy .
According to a new Reuters article , we can now add to that small but growing list the International Energy Administration ( IEA ) .
Reuters interviewed Fatih Birol , author of the International Energy Agency ’s World Energy Outlook , and he said that the world needed to work towards a carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) concentration of no higher than 450 ppm in order to keep energy costs from skyrocketing by 2030 .
According to Birol ’s estimates , Europe alone would see energy prices increase by 300 % over the average of what Europe paid over the last 30 years , from $ 160 billion per year to $ 500 billion .
Birol ’s also estimates that oil prices will reach $ 100 per barrel by 2015 and $ 190 per barrel by 2030 .
Given that there is evidence that the high oil prices of 2008 were part of what caused the global recession , this should make the U.S. and other oil dependent countries nervous .
And the global oversupply of natural gas that is keeping prices low in the U.S. this year wo n’t last – Birol estimates that the demand for natural gas by 2030 will far outstrip supply .
The Guardian is reporting that an anonymous IEA whistleblower is claiming that US pressure has been applied to redefine the point at which peak oil occurs .
If this is true and can be verified , then peak oil is probably much closer than previously expected and Birol ’s estimates are very likely optimistic .
Similarly , Reuters does n’t discuss whether Birol has any coal estimates or not , but the USGS has pointed out that the U.S. could be approaching “ peak coal ” as well , after which the price of energy would skyrocket .
Diversifying energy out of carbon - based fossil fuels makes sense from an environmental perspsective , from a climate disruption perspective , from a green jobs perspective , and from an economic perspective .
All that remains is for the world ’s governments to accept that it makes sense from a political perspective as well .

Floating cities as a response to sea level rise
Some ideas are just too cool and deserve mention just because they ’re cool .
According to the NYTimes blog Green Inc. , the Dutch are designing floating cities to replace or augment land - based cities as the global sea level rises over the next few centuries .
The floating cities would be connected to each other and to the mainland via floating highways and rail lines .
According to the article , the designers plan to use the ocean to help moderate the cities ’ temperatures in much the same way as ground source heat pump does – pump cold water up from the depths beneath the city in order to cool it efficiently .
In case you ’re not convinced that concrete can be made to float , there are floating bridges across Lake Washington in Seattle – the glacially - carved lake is far too deep to drive pilings into the lake bed to support the bridge , so it floats instead .
The first floating proof - of - concept residences in a Rotterdam residential neighborhood are expected to be available in 2010 .

American Physical Society rejects changes to climate change statement
Earlier this year , a small group of American Physical Society ( APS ) members requested that the APS change it ’s official statement on climate change .
This statement reads :
Emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the Earth ’s climate .
Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide as well as methane , nitrous oxide and other gases .
They are emitted from fossil fuel combustion and a range of industrial and agricultural processes .
The evidence is incontrovertible : Global warming is occurring .
If no mitigating actions are taken , significant disruptions in the Earth ’s physical and ecological systems , social systems , security and human health are likely to occur .
We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now .
Because the complexity of the climate makes accurate prediction difficult , the APS urges an enhanced effort to understand the effects of human activity on the Earth ’s climate , and to provide the technological options for meeting the climate challenge in the near and longer terms .
The APS also urges governments , universities , national laboratories and its membership to support policies and actions that will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
A committee was appointed by the Council earlier this year to determine if the latest science justified any changes to the statement .
According to the official APS press release , the committee recommended that no changes be made , and on November 8 , the Council of the American Physical Society “ overwhelmingly ” rejected the proposed changes to the 2007 statement on climate change .
Appointed by APS President Cherry Murray and chaired by MIT Physicist Daniel Kleppner , the committee examined the statement during the past four months .
Dr. Kleppner ’s committee reached its conclusion based upon a serious review of existing compilations of scientific research .
APS members were also given an opportunity to advise the Council on the matter .
On Nov. 8 , the Council voted , accepting the committee ’s recommendation to reject the proposed statement and refer the original statement to POPA for review .
The APS has over 47,000 members , of which only 206 appear to have signed the petition to the APS Council .
That ’s about 0.4 % of the APS membership .
According to the 2009 “ Six Americas ” study by the Yale Project on Climate Change and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communications , fully 18 % of Americans are either doubtful or dismissive of climate disruption .
If those numbers applied to the 47,000 members of the APS , we could expect almost 8500 signatories to the APS petition .
There are three possible interpretations of this difference :
Physicists may be less willing to sign online petitions for whatever reason (s ) .
Physicists may actually be more knowledgeable of the science and mathematics than the average American ( or less easily swayed by denial industry - manufactured FUD ) and thus they accept the overwhelming scientific data to date .
Both 1 & 2
My best guess is that it ’s probably option # 3 .
But even so , I doubt that reticence to sign petitions accounts for a 45 x difference from physicists to the general population .

A Paris court convicted the Church of Scientology of fraud and fined it more than 600,000 euros ( $ 900,000 ) on Tuesday but stopped short of banning the group as prosecutors had demanded .
The group ’s French branch immediately announced it would appeal the verdict .
The court convicted the Church of Scientology ’s French office , its library and six of its leaders of organized fraud .
Investigators said the group pressured members into paying large sums of money for questionable financial gain and used “ commercial harassment ” against recruits .
ADVERTISEMENT
The group was fined euro400,000 ( $ 600,000 ) and the library euro200,000 .
Four of the leaders were given suspended sentences of between 10 months and two years .
The other two were given fines of euro1,000 and euro2,000 .
However , the court did not order the Church of Scientology to shut down , ruling that it would be likely to continue its activities anyway “ outside any legal framework . ”
Prosecutors had urged that the group be dissolved in France and fined euro2 million ( $ 3 million ) .
The verdict is “ an Inquisition of modern times , ” said Scientology spokeswoman Agnes Bron , referring to efforts to rout out heretics of the Roman Catholic Church in centuries past .
The head of an association that helps victims of sects , Catherine Picard , called the verdict “ intelligent . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Scientology can no longer hide behind freedom of conscience , ” she said .
The Los Angeles - based Church of Scientology , founded in 1954 by the late science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard , has been active for decades in Europe , but has struggled to gain status as a religion .
It is considered a sect in France and has faced prosecution and difficulties in registering its activities in many countries .
Defense lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said during the trial that neither the Church of Scientology nor the six leaders on trial had gained financially from the group ’s practices .
ADVERTISEMENT
The original complaint in the case dates back more than a decade , when a young woman said she took out loans and spent the equivalent of euro21,000 on books , courses and “ purification packages ” after being recruited in 1998 .
When she sought reimbursement and to leave the group , its leadership refused .
She was among three eventual plaintiffs .
Olivier Morice , lawyer for civil parties in the case , said the verdict was “ historic ” because it was the first time in France that the Church of Scientology has been convicted of organized fraud .
ADVERTISEMENT
Investigating judge Jean - Christophe Hullin spent years examining the group ’s activities , and in his indictment criticized what he called the Scientologists ’ “ obsession ” with financial gain and practices he said were aimed at plunging members into a “ state of subjection . ”
The Church of Scientology teaches that technology can expand the mind and help solve problems .
It claims 10 million members around the world , including celebrity devotees Tom Cruise and John Travolta .
Belgium , Germany and other European countries have been criticized by the U.S. State Department for labeling Scientology as a cult or sect and enacting laws to restrict its operations .
Why are we asking this now ?
Because Jack Straw has used a visit to Washington to hint that Britain could finally get a written constitution spelling out citizens ' rights and codifying this country 's political system .
The Justice Secretary is already working on a new Bill of Rights and Responsibilities , clearly defining people 's relationship to the state , as part of a wide - ranging package of constitutional reform .
But he has , for the first time , also said the Bill could be a step towards a full written constitution to " bring us in line with the most progressive democracies around the world " .
Why do n't we have a written constitution ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Essentially because the country has been too stable for too long .
The governing elites of many European nations , such as France and Germany , have been forced to draw up constitutions in response to popular revolt or war .
Great Britain , by contrast , remained free of the revolutionary fervour that swept much of the Continent in the 19th century .
As a result , this country 's democracy has been reformed incrementally over centuries rather than in one big bang .
For younger countries , including the United States and Australia , codification of their citizens ' rights and political systems was an essential step towards independence .
Ironically , several based their written constitutions on Britain 's unwritten version .
What do our rights depend upon ?
Britain 's constitution has developed in haphazard fashion , building on common law , case law , historical documents , Acts of Parliament and European legislation .
It is not set out clearly in any one document .
Mr Straw said yesterday : " The constitution of the United Kingdom exists in hearts and minds and habits as much as it does in law . "
Nor is there a single statement of citizens ' rights and freedom .
As the Justice Secretary put it : " Most people might struggle to put their finger on where their rights are . "
What about the Magna Carta ?
When the barons forced King John in 1215 to sign the Magna Carta , it was an event that would reverberate through constitutional law eight centuries later .
The landowners were driven by a desire to protect their own interests rather than those of the people .
But the resulting document , which has no legal force today in this country , was a key inspiration for the architects of the US constitution .
It has had huge symbolic value in the development of Western - style democracy in that it limited state powers and protected some citizens ' rights .
Its key principles , including the right to a fair trial by one 's peers and protection from unlawful imprisonment , have underpinned common law .
What other constitutional landmarks have there been ?
The Bill of Rights of 1689 , which followed the accession of William and Mary to the throne after the " glorious revolution " bolstered the powers of parliament and , by extension , the rights of the sovereign 's subjects .
They included freedom from taxes imposed by the monarch and from being called up in peace - time to serve in the army without Parliament 's permission .
The Great Reform
Act of 1832 , which vastly increased the number of adult males entitled to vote in elections , is widely seen as the starting - point for establishing the sovereignty of citizens over parliament .
It set in train the process that led to the Representation of the People 's Act of 1928 , which gave all men and women over the age of 21 the right to vote .

Then there was Britain 's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973 , which brought the country for the first time under a degree of international judicial control .
Ten years ago Britain came closer than before to codifying individuals ' rights when the Human Rights Act enshrined the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law .
What are the advantages of awritten constitution ?
It has become almost a truism that British politics , beset by cynicism about politicians and undermined by falling turn - outs at general elections , is in crisis .
Supporters argue that producing such a document could tackle such disillusionment , at the same time as setting new , clear limits on the power of the executive .
The Liberal Democrats have called for the public to be involved in drawing up the constitution .
They say : " This would reform and reinvigorate the democratic process , putting individuals back in control instead of the wealthy , large businesses and the unions . "
And what are the disadvantages ?
" It it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , " argue opponents of a written constitution , who insist that the existing arrangements , however piecemeal their development has been , have worked well in practice .
There are , moreover , formidable practical problems to be overcome before such a document could be drawn up .
Would it be wide - ranging and largely abstract or would it list individuals ' rights in detail and provide an exhaustive summary of Britain 's constitutional settlement ?
If the latter , it could prove beyond the grasp of most of the citizens it would be designed to protect .
Why is the idea being floated now ?
It is a natural follow - on from the proposed constitutional reforms announced by Gordon Brown as one of his first acts in Downing Street .
He explained that he wanted to develop a " more open 21st - century British democracy which better serves the British people " .
As well as the British Bill of Rights , he suggested giving Parliament the right to approve any decision to send British troops to war and surrendering the prime minister 's power to appoint judges and approve bishops .
Such proposals would be small beer , however , compared with any move to write the country 's first constitution .
What happens next ?
Britain is not going to get the ground - breaking document any time in the near future .
Mr Straw said any attempt to encapsulate Britain 's constitutional arrangements in a single document should be done on a " bipartisan , consensual " basis over a period as long as 20 years .
He also said a national referendum would have to be held to approve the document if it ushered in significant changes .
Professor Robert Hazell , the director of the Constitution Unit at University College London , predicted Britain would never get a written constitution .
" Constitutions do n't get written in cold blood . "
Nick Herbert , the shadow Justice Secretary , was equally sceptical .
" The last thing Britain needs , with 2,000 years of history behind us , is more of New Labour 's blind constitutional vandalism , " he said .
Do we need a written constitution ?
Yes ...
* Britain's arcane hotch - potch of freedoms and rights cannot be defended in the 21st century
* It could help citizens clarify their rights and protect themselves against the state
* Most flourishing democracies base their institutions on a written constitution
No ...
* The system should not be tampered with as it has served Britain well for centuries
* The practical problems over what to include and leave out would be a logistical nightmare
* It could undermine the power of Parliament to scrutinise ministers on behalf of the public

According to long - time peace activist and Vancouver East NDP MP Libby Davies , “ The Olympics will come and go , but peace and justice will always be there . ”
Now Davies , a city councillor from 1982 to 1993 , fears that peace - friendly signs she helped launch within the city limits 25 years ago , proclaiming Vancouver to be a “ Nuclear Weapons Free Zone ” , are disappearing .
She worries about what this could mean for the city .
“ Many people have worked to make Vancouver a peace centre internationally — a peace and justice centre , ” Davies told the Georgia Straight from Ottawa .
“ I think that ’s a really proud history for Vancouverites .
So to see these signs disappear one by one — if that ’s indeed what seems to be happening — I think it takes away from that important history . ”
Davies said she wants the signs returned to their locations .
Nick Kawaza , city superintendent in charge of signs and road markings , told the Straight that the signs stopped being replaced after November 2005 .
He said there was “ no direct attempt ” to replace them with signs declaring Vancouver as Olympic host , but in 2006 those signs began appearing on city streets ahead of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics .
Davies said she has only seen two of the original signs — and the only one she recalls by location is on East 1st Avenue .
Kawaza said that some could be missing due to motor - vehicle accidents .
“ We still have the artwork , ” Kawaza said of the signs .
“ So it would be easy to make them up . ”
Former NDP premier Mike Harcourt told the Straight he was mayor at the time of the council vote in the early 1980s .
Harcourt said that he was active in supporting the local Walk for Peace at the time and remembers the tenor of the day .
“ I think we had over 125,000 people marching or strolling and walking and cycling and everything from Kits Park right across the Burrard Bridge to Vanier Park , ” he said .
“ It was very broadly based .
You know , the usual number of peaceniks involved , but huge numbers of Vancouverites came out to say , basically , ” ˜Let ’s start dismantling nuclear weapons . ’ ”
However , Harcourt was hesitant to suggest a return of the signage or any campaign without modern context .
“ President Obama met with [ Russian ]
President Medvedev and others just recently and then they were making noises about it , ” he said .
“ So if it was done to encourage them to do it , as a city that has been pushing for this for a long time , I think that if it was part of that campaign it would make a lot of sense .
But just to stick ’em up , you know , it ’s not very good issue development , if I can put it that way . ”
Davies said she agrees with Harcourt .
City spokesperson Wendy Stewart told the Straight she ’s not aware who gave the direction to stop erecting the nuclear - free signs , but she said that the elements took care of a lot of wooden signs that were built decades ago .
“ There was a Union of B.C. Municipalities grant that was available that was used to fund the new signs , ” she added .
“ They were originally ” ˜Welcome to Vancouver ’ signs , featuring the corporate look , and they have transitioned into Olympic signs . ”
Stewart said she does n’t know about a possible return to the old signage , but she said : “ Do n’t think so at this time . ”
For Davies , disarmament is part of a “ bigger question about the future of our planet and climate change ” .
She said many fighting for climate change were fighting for peace back then .
We 're not exactly sure what 's going on here , but it certainly seems like at least some Google Voice voicemails are being indexed and made publicly available somehow .
If you punch in " site : https://www.google.com/voice/fm/* " as a search string you get a few pages of what appear to be test messages , with a couple eye - opening obvious non-tests scattered in there as well .
Dates on these messages range from a couple months ago all the way until yesterday , so this is clearly an ongoing issue -- hopefully Google patches this up awful fast .
P.S. - Google Voice transcription accuracy really falls off a cliff when it 's listening to muffled audio , does n't it ?
Google says it 's changed how shared messages are indexed and made available to public searches , so we 're hoping this was just a one - time thing .

People who illegally download music from the internet also spend more money on music than anyone else , according to a new study .
The survey , published today , found that those who admit illegally downloading music spent an average of £ 77 a year on music – £ 33 more than those who claim that they never download music dishonestly .
The findings suggest that plans by the Secretary of State for Business , Peter Mandelson , to crack down on illegal downloaders by threatening to cut their internet connections with a " three strikes and you 're out " rule could harm the music industry by punishing its core customers .
An estimated seven million UK users download files illegally every year .
The record industry 's trade association , the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) , believes this copyright infringement will cost the industry £ 200 m this year .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The poll , which surveyed 1,000 16 - to 50 - year - olds with internet access , found that one in 10 people admit to downloading music illegally .
" The latest approach from the Government will not help prop up an ailing music industry .
Politicians and music companies need to recognise that the nature of music consumption has changed , and consumers are demanding lower prices and easier access , " said Peter Bradwell , from the think - tank Demos , which commissioned the new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori .
However , music industry figures insist the figures offer a skewed picture .
The poll suggested the Government 's plan to disconnect illegal downloaders if they ignore official warning letters could deter people from internet piracy , with 61 per cent of illegal downloaders surveyed admitting they would be put off downloading music illegally by the threat of having their internet service cut off for a month .
" The people who file - share are the ones who are interested in music , " said Mark Mulligan of Forrester Research .
" They use file - sharing as a discovery mechanism .
We have a generation of young people who do n't have any concept of music as a paid - for commodity , " he continued .
" You need to have it at a price point you wo n't notice . "
The Digital Economy Bill , which will become law next April , sets out new measures to crack down on internet piracy .
But these have generated criticism from internet service providers , who say they will be difficult to enforce .
Artists are also divided over the issue , with Lily Allen and James Blunt recently supporting the Government 's stance , while the Latin pop star Shakira argues that illegal file sharing brings her closer to her fans .
This year Virgin Media and Universal Music plan to launch the first music subscription service allowing customers to download and keep unlimited tracks from Universal 's catalogue for a fee of around £ 15 .
The most distant object ever observed in space has provided scientists with an unprecedented insight into the " cosmic dark ages " following the birth of the Universe some 13.7 billion years ago .
A gigantic explosion on the edge of the known Universe has been confirmed as the furthermost object in the cosmos .
It occurred nearly 700 million years after the Big Bang and its radiation has taken some 13 billion years to reach Earth – making it 13 billion light years away .
The explosion is one of many thousands of gamma-ray bursts that scientists have detected since they were first discovered more than 40 years ago by spy satellites designed to monitor the radiation emitted by man-made nuclear explosions .
This particular gamma-ray burst , named 090423 , occurred on 23 April and its afterglow lasted for about 10 seconds before it died out .
This was long enough for the Swift satellite operated by Nasa to identify its location so that other telescopes on the ground could analyse the explosion in more detail .

Gamma -ray bursts are the most energetic events known to scientists .
In just a couple of seconds these massively powerful explosions in space release as much energy as the Sun would release in its entire lifecycle of 10 billion years .
Finding a gamma-ray burst that is 13 billion light years away means that it must have taken place within the period known as the " cosmic dark ages " , a timespan of about 900 million years that separates the Big Bang from the formation of the earliest stars and galaxies .
" This observation allows us to begin exploring the last blank space on our map of the Universe .
It 's the first time that we 've seen an object within this period of the Universe 's dark ages , " said Nial Tanvir , of Leicester University , who led the study published in the journal Nature .
" We 're beginning to peer back to the era of the very first structures in the Universe .
It 's the last unexplained era because in broad - brush terms we have a reasonably good idea of what happened during the rest of the life of the Universe , " he added .
Gamma -ray bursts , named after the intense amounts of gamma radiation they release , are believed to occur when massive stars some 50 or 100 times bigger than the Sun are swallowed up by a newly formed black hole , which results in the instant conversion of matter into energy .
Astronomers believe that as the black hole swallows up the dead star , intense jets of gas punch their way through the stellar material , forming interactions with other stellar gases previously shed by the dying star , causing it to heat up and release short - lived after - glows of radiation , which can be detected and measured by astronomers on Earth .
Andrew Levan , of Warwick University , another member of the international research team , said that the very ancient age of the gamma-ray burst detected in April meant that the dying star that formed it must be one of the first to be created in the early Universe .
" We 're looking back into the Universe when it was very , very young and we 're seeing objects that formed in the very early Universe – it was one of the first objects to form after the Big Bang , " said Dr Levan .

" We thought that there were possibly stars there during this epoch but we 've not until now seen them before .
These early stars only lived for a few million years .
They lived fast and died young , " he added .
The explosion of gamma-ray burst 090423 occurred when the Universe was less than 5 per cent of its present age and a tenth of its present size .
Big Bang : Understanding the birth of the Universe
Q . Why do we think the Universe was created in a " Big Bang " ?
A. Theoretical cosmologists have predicted the existence of a Big Bang for about 50 years – the theory owes its name to the late Sir Fred Hoyle , who did n't in fact believe in such a sudden beginning .
However , astronomers have now made categorical observations that support the theory , including the discovery of the remnant " background radiation " left behind from the Big Bang , which now pervades the Universe .
Q. How do we know that the Big Bang occurred 13.7 billion years ago ?
A . One way is to measure the speed at which the Universe is expanding and to calculate something called the Hubble constant with great accuracy .
The Hubble Space Telescope did in fact do this and the calculations showed that the Universe has been expanding for about 13.7 billion years , hence the age of the Big Bang .
Q. How do gamma-ray bursts fit into the story of the Universe ?
A . These are massively powerful explosions , the most energetic events known to science .
They were first discovered in the 1960s by American Vela spy satellites designed to detect Soviet atomic tests .
Gamma -ray bursts are thought to be the result of newly - formed black holes swallowing up massive dying stars more than 50 times the size of the Sun .
So , gamma - ray bursts occur when a dying star disappears into a black hole releasing vasts quantities of energy in the form of radiation .
As such they have always existed for a long as there have been stars .
Q. Will we ever see to the edge of the Universe and what lies beyond it ?
A. Astronomers are seeing further and further back in time by observing objects that are further and further away from the Earth .
They hope to get very close to the Big Bang but there will almost certainly be some limit on how far back they can look – perhaps these earliest objects are just too small to ever see .
What happens beyond the Big Bang is largely a mystery , and a subject that cosmologists will speculate on endlessly for they are well known to be often in error , but never in doubt .
Thousands of children were forced to flee during the civil war A group of parents in Sierra Leone has accused a charity of sending more than 30 children abroad for adoption without consent during the country 's civil war .
The parents say they have no idea what happened to their children after they were handed over to Help a Needy Child International ( Hanci ) .
But the charity says it has documents signed by the parents giving permission for overseas adoption .
Sierra Leone was devastated by a decade of civil war , which ended in 2002 .
Children were frequently abducted and forced to fight in the brutal conflict .
' Convoluted issue '
The BBC's Umaru Fofana , in the capital Freetown , says the parents have been lobbying the government for years to find out what happened to their children .
He says they have become frustrated with what they see as a lack of action from ministers , so have taken their campaign to the media .
So many years have elapsed so I have to take my time to look at it very carefully
Soccoh Kabbia
Minister of children 's affairs
One parent told our correspondent how she agreed to let Hanci care for and educate her children at a local centre to save them from the war .
" We regularly visited our children at the centre until some time in 1998 when we stopped seeing them , " she said .
" We went to Freetown to find out what had happened , and we were told they had sent our children overseas and they would be visiting us every five years .
" We want the government to intervene and let us have our children back . "
The parents of more than 30 children make similar allegations .
But Hanci director Roland Kargbo denies the claims , saying the charity obtained written consent from the parents whose children were sent overseas .
" There were two agreements - one for children to be cared for and reintegrated into the community locally , and another for parents who wanted their children to be adopted , " he told the BBC .
" The parents know that , we have documents to support that . "
Minister of Children 's Affairs Soccoh Kabbia says the government is still investigating the issue .
" It is a convoluted story because so many years have elapsed so I have to take my time to look at it very carefully , " he said .
The children are believed to have been adopted by American families .

Moose eat plants ; wolves kill moose .
What difference does this classic predator - prey interaction make to biodiversity ?
A large and unexpected one , say wildlife biologists from Michigan Technological University .
Joseph Bump , Rolf Peterson and John Vucetich report in the November 2009 issue of the journal Ecology that the carcasses of moose killed by wolves at Isle Royale National Park enrich the soil in " hot spots " of forest fertility around the kills , causing rapid microbial and fungal growth that provide increased nutrients for plants in the area .
" This study demonstrates an unforeseen link between the hunting behavior of a top predator -- the wolf -- and biochemical hot spots on the landscape , " said Bump , an assistant professor in Michigan Tech 's School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science and first author of the research paper .
" It 's important because it illuminates another contribution large predators make to the ecosystem they live in and illustrates what can be protected or lost when predators are preserved or exterminated . "
Bump and his colleagues studied a 50 - year record of more than 3,600 moose carcasses at Isle Royale .
They measured the nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium levels in the soil at paired sites of wolf - killed moose carcasses and controls .
They also analyzed the microbes and fungi in the soil and the leaf tissue of large - leaf aster , a common native plant eaten by moose in eastern and central North America .
They found that soils at carcass sites had 100 to 600 percent more inorganic nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium than soil from surrounding control sites .
Carcass sites also had an average of 38 percent more bacterial and fungal fatty acids , evidence of increased growth of bacteria and fungi .
The nitrogen levels in plants growing on the carcass sites was from 25 to 47 percent higher than the levels at the control sites .
Since large herbivores , like moose , are attracted to nitrogen - rich plants , the carcass sites become foraging sites , further supplementing soil nutrients from the urine and feces of the animals eating there .
" I was initially skeptical that it would be possible to detect something as diffuse in the forest floor as nutrients from dead animals , " said Peterson , who has been studying the wolves and moose of Isle Royale for decades .
" It was gratifying to see Joseph succeed in following animal - derived nutrients back into plants to enrich them in protein , ready to be eaten again . "
Even moose killed in winter and mostly consumed produce substantial nutrient hot spots , Bump reports .
" At the landscape scale , long - term carcass deposition patterns could influence forest dynamics by shifting competitive relationships among tree seedlings through changes in the nutrient concentrations in their growth environment , " he writes .
Bump has observed similar effects on the soil and plant life at elk carcass sites in Yellowstone National Park , another place where wolves are predators and large herbivores are their prey .
And he adds that on the Arctic tundra , where soil nutrients are limited , others have found that the impact of a muskox carcass on surrounding vegetation is dramatic even after 10 years .
" Predation and nutrient cycling are two of the most important of all ecological processes , but they seem just about completely unrelated to one another , " observes Vucetich .
Also on the faculty of Michigan Tech 's School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science , Vucetich conducts an annual winter study of the wolves and moose of Isle Royale .
" Bump has led us to understand how these two seemingly disparate processes -- predation and nutrient cycling -- are in fact connected and connected in a most interesting way . "
The strong and unexpected connections between wolves , moose and the biogeochemistry of their ecosystem are important to policy makers involved in predator management and to a public increasingly concerned about conservation , Bump suggests .
The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the US Environmental Protection Agency .
The airlift rescue was helped by good weather , said coastguards
A driver " miraculously " escaped alive after his car plunged over a 200 ft ( 61 m ) cliff in north Devon , coastguards have said .
The man was airlifted from the car at Hartland Quay at about 0500 BST by a coastguard helicopter .
He is being treated at North Devon District Hospital .
The extent of his injuries has not yet been revealed .
Swansea coastguards said they were uncertain about why the car went over the cliff .
Steve Jones , Watch Manager of Swansea Coastguard said : " It 's miraculous that the occupant was found alive in the car and was talking to coastguards .
" It beggars belief .
I think he is very lucky to be alive this morning . "
Rescuers lowered
Hartland and Westward Ho ! Coastguard Rescue Teams found the car on the beach below the cliffs at 0524 BST .
Lights and equipment were set up on scene and the fire service was called to help .
A rescue helicopter was also scrambled along with an ambulance .
Two coastguard cliff rescuers were placed on a line and lowered to the site of the car , where they found a man inside alive .
A winchman was lowered onto the beach from the helicopter and the injured man was taken to hospital .
Mr Jones said : " Fortunately the weather was benign this morning which helped the extraction .
" The car is in no danger of being overtaken by the tide and a plan will be drawn up on how to remove the vehicle from its present position . "
“ There have been several peaks over 40 % in Spain , but this new one – lasting nearly six hours compared to around one hour the previous time – shows the huge part that wind can play in meeting Spain ’s electricity demand , ” Jacopo Moccia , regulatory affairs adviser for EWEA said .
The surge in wind power last night triggered water pumping stations which transport water into reservoirs .
This store of water will then be released over the day generating electricity via water turbines at times of peak demand .
The Spanish Wind Energy Association said the sustained peak in wind powered electricity production proves that “ wind energy is no longer marginal ” .
By 2020 Spain is expected to double its wind - power producing capacity from the current level of 16 gigawatts to 40 GW .
“ With this expected growth in capacity we could envisage wind meeting the vast majority of demand during times of peak supply by 2020 , ” Moccia said .
On average throughout the year , wind energy meets 12 % of Spain ’s electricity demand .
The largest producer of wind power in Spain is Iberdrola , with 27 percent of capacity , followed by Acciona on 16 percent and Endesa with 10 percent .
Spain ’s wind farms are on track to meet a government target of 20,000 MW in capacity by 2010 .
Installed wind capacity in Spain reached 16,740 MW in 2008 with the addition of 1,609 MW .
Expectations for the Spanish wind energy industry for 2009 are very high , with 18,500 MW of total capacity will be installed .
The wind sector expected this growth after the 3,500 - MW increase in 2007 , a special year in which companies made an effort to start up the greatest number of wind farms so they could benefit from the previous support system .
The total of 16,740 MW establishes Spain as the third country in the world in terms of installed capacity and will allow the 2010 objective ( 20,155 MW set by the Renewable Energies Plan 2005 – 2010 ) to be reached .
The addition of 1,609 MW in 2008 is an increase of 10.63 % , the third highest increase in absolute terms in the short history of wind energy in Spain .
The only higher annual increases were in 2007 ( 3,505 MW or 30 % ) and 2004 ( 2,297.51 MW or 37 % ) .
Electrical energy demand in 2008 was 266,485 GWh , a growth of 1.21 % over 2007 .
Wind energy met 11 % of this demand and was the fourth largest contributing technology in the generation system , besting hydropower ( 7 % of demand ) .
The other contributors to the system were gas combined - cycle power plants ( 32 % of total demand ) , nuclear power plants ( 20 % ) , and coal power plants ( 16 % ) .
On several occasions in 2008 , wind energy covered more than 40 % of hourly demand , and for several days it supplied more than 30 % of daily electricity demand .
For instance , on November 24 , wind energy supplied more than 35 % of the total electricity demand .
And on several occasions , production of wind energy reached more than 40 % of hourly demand .
Wind energy in Spain has also emerged as a driving force for industrial development .
In 2008 , investment was more than 2,250 million € , and about 50 % of Spanish wind energy equipment production is dedicated to the export market .
According to the “ Macroeconomic Study on the Impact of the Wind Energy Sector in Spain , ” the number of jobs related to wind power reached more than 40,000 in 2008 .
Of this total , the number of direct jobs in operation and maintenance of wind farms , manufacturing , assembly , research , and development is estimated at more than 21,800 .
The number of indirect jobs ( linked mainly to components ) is estimated to be more than 17,000 .
The industrial sector participating in the Asociación Empresarial Eólica , or ( Spanish Wind Energy Association ) has established a new objective of 40,000 MW for 2020 .
Use of wind power has lowered CO2 emissions by about 18 million tons just during 2008 .
Furthermore , wind generation has saved up to 6 million tons of conventional fuels .
Wind production has supplied the electrical consumption of more than 10 million households .
Gamesa installed more than 50 % of new capacity , according to the Spanish Wind Energy Association ’s Wind Observatory , with more than 9,480 MW ( including the subsidiary company MADE ) in Spain , which consolidates its leadership among manufacturers .
VESTAS , the second largest manufacturer , installed more than 15 % of new capacity in 2008 , adding 242.2 MW .

When Holden Thorp , the chancellor of the University of North Carolina , was looking for ways to cut the university ’s budget , he did what many executives in private industry do  hired a management consultant .
The consultant , Bain & Company , came up with recommendations that it said could save the university more than $ 150 million a year .
They included centralizing some of the university ’s widely dispersed procurement operations ( up to $ 45 million ) and information technology functions ( up to $ 19 million ) and simplifying its organizational structure ( up to $ 12 million ) .
And since Mr. Thorp hired Bain , both Cornell University and the University of California , Berkeley , have followed suit .
In each case , the management consultants examined business functions but stayed away from academic issues like courseloads and tenure .
“ Like any other large organization , ” Mr. Thorp said , “ we hire people , we buy stuff , we connect to the Internet , we build buildings and take care of our property , and we wanted Bain to look at how we could carry out those functions as efficiently as possible . ”

Apple is at it again — but this time it ’s taking on the cable companies .
The iPod purveyor wants TV networks to get on board with an all - you - can eat iTunes service that would let subscribers download unlimited television shows for around $ 30 a month .
Apple has been pitching the idea to cable and broadcast networks for months , but sources familiar with the talks said they are still at an early phase and nothing is imminent .
An Apple spokesman declined to comment .
i Tunes users can already buy individual movies and episodes of shows , but the monthly subscription - fee strategy takes square aim at cable companies , because subscribers would n’t need them to deliver their favorite programs in bulk .
The news was first reported on Media Memo , a blog that is part of Dow Jones ( News Corp. owns Dow Jones and The Post . )
An industry source familiar with Apple ’s plans said the company is pitching a revenue - sharing structure based on “ show usage . ”
In other words , Apple would pay networks more for shows that were very popular and less for shows that had fewer viewers .
The model might make sense for some , but network sources said it could hurt programming development , because big hits would make money but niche shows with smaller audiences would be left to languish .
“ The math does n’t work , ” one source said .
“ It makes the hits more revenue but there is no way to subsidize your losses . ”
The idea sounds promising and would build on Apple ’s success in the music business , but it faces many obstacles — including the long - standing and lucrative relationship between cable networks and cable operators .
Cable companies such as Comcast , Time Warner Cable and Cablevision pay billions to the cable networks to make their programming available to subscribers .
“ The first and foremost issue is violating the relationship with the cable operators , ” said one cable network source .
“ It jeopardizes a huge revenue stream . ”
Traditionally , cable companies have n’t paid the major broadcast networks — ABC , CBS , NBC and Fox — for their programming .
But the broadcasters are now pushing the cable companies to start paying them fees to carry their stations .
Apple would be going up against other online TV initiatives , including the Web site Hulu ; TV Everywhere , a service from Comcast and Time Warner that will allow cable subscribers to also watch their shows online ; and Netflix , which has deals to stream TV shows through video game consoles and other devices .

Plans to introduce secret inquiries into controversial deaths from which the public and bereaved families could be banned are to be pushed through the House of Commons by the Government .
Last night ministers suffered a humiliating defeat for the proposals in the House of Lords , but insisted that they were " clear " that " harmful material " must not be made public , and would reintroduce the measures in the Commons .
The new powers would allow them to turn inquests like that of Jean Charles de Menezes or those involving the deaths of British soldiers into secret hearings .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Civil rights campaigners , peers and MPs attacked the Government for trying to sneak through an " abuse of power " which struck at the heart of Britain 's ancient inquest system .
Baroness Miller , the Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokeswoman in the Lords , whose party tabled an amendment which succeeded in removing the secret inquiry clause , said that the Government had suffered a " self - inflicted " defeat .
She said : " Inquiries are a thing of the state and inquests are the thing of citizens .
The Government could have come up with the correct conditions to guard against secrecy without setting up a parallel inquest system .
It 's not a good argument to say , ' But if you knew what we knew you would n't object . ' "
The measure , buried in the Coroners and Justice Bill , gives the Lord Chancellor , currently Jack Straw , absolute discretion to order a secret inquiry in place of a public inquest .
It could mean that inquests that might expose the negligence of government or a public body or embarrass ministers or foreign allies could be censored .
It comes less than six months after Mr Straw dropped proposals to hold sensitive inquests behind closed doors without juries from the Bill following widespread opposition .
But the new plan has been quietly added to the Bill , in the shape of a provision allowing for an inquest to be suspended and a secret inquiry held in its place .
Liberty , the human rights group , said the illiberal powers would prevent bereaved families from discovering the truth about the death of a loved one .
Liberty 's director of policy , Isabella Sankey , said : " It beggars belief that this rotten policy has been resurrected .
It is thoroughly perverse for a Government that has spent over a decade lecturing the public about victims ' rights to attempt to exclude bereaved families from open justice .
When will New Labour 's obsession with secret courts and parallel legal systems end ?
There is no accountability without transparency . "

Deborah Coles , of the charity Inquest , said she was dismayed that the Government wanted to end the right to public inquests for all deaths : " This is yet another attempt to shroud in secrecy the details and actions of the most serious conduct of state agents . "
The Government says that the change is aimed at allowing inquests to go ahead when sensitive information needs to be considered by the inquiry .
Ministers point to the case of a 24 - year - old Londoner , Azelle Rodney , shot dead by police in 2005 .
More than four years after he was killed , his family is still waiting for an inquest to establish the exact circumstances of his death .
The case has raised concerns about the accountability of armed police and has fuelled accusations of a cover - up of a shoot - to - kill policy .
Mr Rodney was in a car with two other men what was stopped by armed police who had been tailing their vehicle .
An officer fired eight shots into the side of the car at Mr Rodney , who was in the back .
Six bullets hit him in the face , head , neck and chest .
Police maintain that his behaviour made the officer believe he was about to fire a weapon .
The other two men were jailed after admitting possessing guns in the car .
There is no evidence that Mr Rodney was holding a gun when he was shot .
The Rodney family has been told that an inquest into his death cannot go ahead because it would lead to the release of sensitive information about police operations .
In 2007 the coroner presiding over a pre-hearing into the killing said police editing of information made under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 – which covers information obtained from covert surveillance devices such as telephone taps and bugs – meant it was not possible to hold a meaningful inquest .
Last night the Government pledged to overturn the Liberal Democrat amendment .
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it was important that an inquiry into any death should be able to hear all the evidence , even if it meant that part of the hearing should be closed to the public .
She said to do otherwise would be a breach of a family 's human rights .
She added : " But it is also important that evidence is not allowed to harm police operations or the national interest . "
She said : " Liberty 's complaints are really about the terms of the Inquiries Act , which has been on the statute book since 2005 .
We have tabled some minor amendments in this Bill to give better effect to the policy , but those amendments do not lead to the lack of transparency and accountability that Liberty sets out . "
How often , really , does one combine the words " wow " and " toilet " ?
( If you have recently , I do n't want to hear about it . )
Well , say hello to the WOW Toilet Tank .
It 's a snazzy new toilet tank that can display ads .
It 's not just the urinals that are having all the marketing fun anymore !
The company behind the new contraption is already playing the capitalization card , even though they do n't seem to have secured a client yet .
Well , it 's just a matter of time , I 'm sure , before the accounts roll in , though I 'd guess companies like Taco Bell and their ilk will probably pass .
Pepto-Bismol would n't be a bad fit .
( The P&G brand is featured in one of the mock - ups on the Web site . )
But the WOW Toilet is n't even the strangest toilet - related marketing initiative this week .
That dishonor goes to Draftfcb 's print ad for French magazine Chronic ' Art ( see the full ad here ) , showing a zombie on the can .
( The pop-culture magazine promises to reveal " everything you ever wanted to know about zombies . " )
Judging from that guy 's expression , the last human brain he ate disagreed with him .
No matter how much he flushes , it 'll still smell like something died in there .

John Boehner 's statement is particularly telling :
The Obama Administration ’s irresponsible decision to prosecute the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks in New York City puts the interests of liberal special interest groups before the safety and security of the American people .
The possibility that Khalid Sheik Mohammed and his co-conspirators could be found ‘ not guilty ’ due to some legal technicality just blocks from Ground Zero should give every American pause .
emphasis added
Legal technicality ?
What could Mr. Boehner possibly mean ?
Ann Althouse knows what happens when you try someone who has been tortured by being waterboarded 183 times in one month .
So does Phillip Carter at Slate :
Any information gained through torture will almost certainly be excluded from court in any criminal prosecution of the tortured defendant .
And , to make matters worse for federal prosecutors , the use of torture to obtain statements may make those statements ( and any evidence gathered as a result of those statements ) inadmissible in the trials of other defendants as well .
Thus , the net effect of torture is to undermine the entire federal law enforcement effort to put terrorists behind bars .
With each alleged terrorist we torture , we most likely preclude the possibility of a criminal trial for him , and for any of the confederates he may incriminate .
Defense attorneys for Mr. Mohammed will claim that any statements previously made by the accused while in U.S. custody are inadmissible in a court of law .
They will claim that any statements made by associates of Mr. Mohammed under similar duress will be similarly inadmissible .
Americans will be reminded again of what the Bush administration 's reckless , immoral and counterproductive pro-torture policies have meant both for those we have detained and for our ability to prosecute them for their alleged crimes .
And when the masterminds of 9/11 and other terror attacks are convicted and safely locked away in American prisons after their convictions in spite of the torture - related hurdles thrown at them by the incompetent and immoral policies of the Bush Administration , Americans will be reminded that extra-legal and extra-Constitutional measures are not actually needed .
They will be reminded that the Bill of Rights and the American system of jurisprudence will work to protect the innocent and punish the guilty if allowed to do its job .
John Boehner , of course , is too smart to admit that .
Republican bloggers like Erick Erickson of RedState , however , are not .
I received this charming RedState Action Alert in my email this morning ( and , apparently , so did John Cole ) :
Today Barack Obama is going to announce that the terrorist mastermind of September 11th , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , will be sent to New York City for a criminal trial in a civilian court .
In that trial , the terrorist will get all the rights afforded an American citizen in a criminal trial , including the right to a fair trial , the right to a taxpayer funded attorney , the right to review all the evidence against him , potentially including classified intelligence matters , the right to exclude evidence against him including , potentially , any confession obtained through enhanced interrogation techniques , etc .
That pretty much says it all .
Republicans are n't terrified of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his possible ill deeds .
They 're afraid of what will happen if their own actions are brought to light , and what the consequences of their own ill deeds might ultimately be for the American people .
All of which is par for the GOP course .
THE OBAMA administration could not have picked a more inappropriate moment to cut off funding to a watchdog group documenting Iran ’s human rights abuses .
When Iranians protested the corrupt reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad this summer , the repressive regime took a lesson from Tiananmen Square and suppressed the popular uprising with force .
This makes it unsettling that the US State Department has turned down a federal funding request by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center .
The group , which has tallied the assassinations of political dissidents and investigated prisoner abuse , will shut down in the spring without grants to continue its vital work .
The State Department had no explanation for turning off the tap that has channeled more than $ 3 million to the group .
The Obama administration should not abandon its efforts to engage Iran .
But surely the United States , as it pursues diplomacy , can also finance a nongovernmental group that documents Iran ’s human rights violations .
If the United States buries its head in the sand as a precondition of talking with Iran , it would send the wrong message to the country ’s proponents of democracy .
Human rights groups watching Iran deserve US support as they continue to pressure the regime .
The uprising this summer exposed the cracks in the legitimacy of the entire Islamic republic .
Information about mass arrests and the abuse of prisoners will bolster the dissident movement - the one glimmer of hope that the Iranian police state will some day come to an end .

By Robert Tracinski - November 24 , 2009
In early October , I covered a breaking story about evidence of corruption in the basic temperature records maintained by key scientific advocates of the theory of man-made global warming .
Global warming " skeptics " had unearthed evidence that scientists at the Hadley Climatic Research Unit at Britain 's University of East Anglia had cherry - picked data to manufacture a " hockey stick " graph showing a dramatic - but illusory - runaway warming trend in the late 20th century .
But now newer and much broader evidence has emerged that looks like it will break that scandal wide open .
Pundits have already named it " Climategate . "
A hacker - or possibly a disillusioned insider - has gathered thousands of e-mails and data from the CRU and made them available on the Web .
Officials at the CRU have verified the breach of their system and acknowledged that the e-mails appear to be genuine .
Yes , this is a theft of data - but the purpose of the theft was to blow the whistle on a much bigger , more brazen crime .
The CRU has already called in the police to investigate the hacker .
But now someone needs to call in the cops to investigate the CRU .
Australian journalist Andrew Bolt has a good overview of the story , with a selection of incriminating e-mails that have already been discovered in the hacked data .
Note that these e-mails reveal more than just what it going on at the CRU , since they involve numerous leading British and American climate scientists outside of the CRU .
These e-mails show , among many other things , private admissions of doubt or scientific weakness in the global warming theory .
In acknowledging that global temperatures have actually declined for the past decade , one scientist asks , " where the heck is global warming ?...
The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't . "
They still can't account for it ; see a new article in Der Spiegel : " Climatologists Baffled by Global Warming Time - Out . "
I do n't know where these people got their scientific education , but where I come from , if your theory can't predict or explain the observed facts , it 's wrong .
More seriously , in one e-mail , a prominent global warming alarmist admits to using a statistical " trick " to " hide the decline " in temperatures .
Anthony Watts provides an explanation of this case in technical detail ; the " trick " consists of selectively mixing two different kinds of data - temperature " proxies " from tree rings and actual thermometer measurements - in a way designed to produce a graph of global temperatures that ends the way the global warming establishment wants it to : with an upward " hockey stick " slope .
Confirming the earlier scandal about cherry - picked data , the e-mails show CRU scientists conspiring to evade legal requests , under the Freedom of Information Act , for their underlying data .
It 's a basic rule of science that you do n't just get to report your results and ask other people to take you on faith .
You also have to report your data and your specific method of analysis , so that others can check it and , yes , even criticize it .
Yet that is precisely what the CRU scientists have refused .
But what stood out most for me was extensive evidence of the hijacking of the " peer review " process to enforce global warming dogma .
Peer review is the practice of subjecting scientific papers to review by other scientists with relevant expertise before they can be published in professional journals .
The idea is to weed out research with obvious flaws or weak arguments , but there is a clear danger that such a process will simply reinforce groupthink .
If it is corrupted , peer review can be a mechanism for an entrenched establishment to exclude legitimate challenges by simply refusing to give critics a hearing .
And that is precisely what we find .
In response to an article challenging global warming that was published in the journal Climate Research , CRU head Phil Jones complains that the journal needs to " rid themselves of this troublesome editor " - hopefully not through the same means used by Henry II 's knights .
Michael Mann replies :
I think we have to stop considering " Climate Research " as a legitimate peer - reviewed journal .
Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to , or cite papers in , this journal .
Note the circular logic employed here .
Skepticism about global warming is wrong because it is not supported by scientific articles in " legitimate peer - reviewed journals . "
But if a journal actually publishes such an article , then it is by definition not " legitimate . "
You can also see from these e-mails the scientists ' panic at any dissent appearing in the scientific literature .
When another article by a skeptic was published in Geophysical Research Letters , Michael Mann complains , " It 's one thing to lose Climate Research .
We can't afford to lose GRL . "
Another CRU scientist , Tom Wigley , suggests that they target another troublesome editor : " If you think that Saiers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp , then , if we can find documentary evidence of this , we could go through official AGU channels to get him ousted . "
That 's exactly what they did , and a later e-mail boasts that " The GRL leak may have been plugged up now w / new editorial leadership there . "
Not content to block out all dissent from scientific journals , the CRU scientists also conspired to secure friendly reviewers who could be counted on to rubber - stamp their own work .
Phil Jones suggests such a list to Kevin Trenberth , with the assurance that " All of them know the sorts of things to say ... without any prompting . "
So it 's no surprise when another e-mail refers to an attempt to keep inconvenient scientific findings out of a UN report : " I can't see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report .
K and I will keep them out somehow - even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is ! "
Think of all of this the next time you hear someone invoke the authority of peer review - or of the UN 's IPCC reports - as backing for claims about global warming .
This scandal goes beyond scientific journals and into other media used to promote the global warming dogma .
For example , RealClimate.org has been billed as an objective website at which global warming activists and skeptics can engage in an impartial debate .
But in the CRU e-mails , the global warming establishment boasts that RealClimate is in their pocket .
I wanted you guys to know that you 're free to use RC in any way you think would be helpful .
Gavin and I are going to be careful about what comments we screen through ....
We can hold comments up in the queue and contact you about whether or not you think they should be screened through or not , and if so , any comments you 'd like us to include .
[ T] hink of RC as a resource that is at your disposal ....
We 'll use our best discretion to make sure the skeptics do n't get to use the RC comments as a megaphone .
And anyone doubting that the mainstream media is in on it , too , should check out New York Times reporter Andrew Revkin 's toadying apologia for the CRU e-mails , masquerading as a news report .
The picture that emerges is simple .
In any discussion of global warming , either in the scientific literature or in the mainstream media , the outcome is always predetermined .
Just as the temperature graphs produced by the CRU are always tricked out to show an upward - sloping " hockey stick , " every discussion of global warming has to show that it is occurring and that humans are responsible .
And any data or any scientific paper that tends to disprove that conclusion is smeared as " unscientific " precisely because it threatens the established dogma .
For more than a decade , we 've been told that there is a scientific " consensus " that humans are causing global warming , that " the debate is over " and all " legitimate " scientists acknowledge the truth of global warming .
Now we know what this " consensus " really means .
What it means is : the fix is in .
This is an enormous case of organized scientific fraud , but it is not just scientific fraud .
It is also a criminal act .
Suborned by billions of taxpayer dollars devoted to climate research , dozens of prominent scientists have established a criminal racket in which they seek government money - Phil Jones has raked in a total of £ 13.7 million in grants from the British government - which they then use to falsify data and defraud the taxpayers .
It 's the most insidious kind of fraud : a fraud in which the culprits are lauded as public heroes .
Judging from this cache of e-mails , they even manage to tell themselves that their manipulation of the data is intended to protect a bigger truth and prevent it from being " confused " by inconvenient facts and uncontrolled criticism .
The damage here goes far beyond the loss of a few billions of taxpayer dollars on bogus scientific research .
The real cost of this fraud is the trillions of dollars of wealth that will be destroyed if a fraudulent theory is used to justify legislation that starves the global economy of its cheapest and most abundant sources of energy .
This is the scandal of the century .
It needs to be thoroughly investigated - and the culprits need to be brought to justice .

History , too , seemed to indicate that change was on the way .
After the Panic of 1873  which saw a run of bank failures , the shutdown of the New York Stock Exchange and soaring unemployment  labor unrest lasted for decades .
Three decades later , the Panic of 1907 saw prominent American lenders collapse , leading eventually to the creation of the Federal Reserve , a central bank to watch over all others .
“ Traditionally , the idea of a central bank had been repulsive , ” said Kenneth S. Rogoff , a Harvard economist and co-author of an international survey of financial crises , “ This Time Is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly . ”
The Great Depression so tormented Americans that it delivered the New Deal , a muscular collection of government programs whose hallmarks  unemployment insurance and Social Security  remain the primary components of the modern - day social safety net .
The banking crises of the 1930s prompted the passage of the Glass - Steagall Act , which divided investment banks from deposit - taking banks to prevent rampant speculation with ordinary people ’s savings , while instituting government guarantees on deposits .
( Many economists believe the final repeal of Glass - Steagall in 1999 played a key role in the reckless investment that triggered the latest crisis . )
Memories of trauma can last a long time .
Nearly a century has passed since Germany suffered the hyperinflation that helped set the stage for Hitler ; yet even today , fear of rising prices remains the primary force in contemporary German policy .
Earlier this year , governments from Washington to Beijing unleashed government spending to spur economic activity .
Not Germany , ever vigilant against triggering an upward spiral of prices .
The shock that accompanied the end of the American real estate boom once seemed a sentinel event that would bring tighter government scrutiny of the financial realm .
Yet as fear of catastrophe fades , the question is how quickly the momentum in Washington for tighter financial rules is diminishing and whether unemployed workers and strapped homeowners will feed a groundswell for change strong enough to offset government turf wars and the influence of financial industry lobbyists .
In Washington , on Wall Street and on Main Street , many are aware that the era of lightly supervised markets was fabulously lucrative for those positioned to capture a piece .
Financial services and real estate  nurtured by easy money  swelled into major sources of employment , while boosting stock portfolios for huge institutions and ordinary people alike .

Who will win the fiery battle on the passage of the controversial Reproductive Health ( RH ) bill now pending in both houses of Congress ?
The “ stubbornness ” of the Roman Catholic Church ( RCC ) hierarchy , said the proponents and supporters of the bill , hinders the passage of the said important piece of legislation , initiated in the House of Representatives by Albay 1st District Rep. Edcel C. Lagman with a counterpart bill in the Senate , authored by Sen. Rodolfo Biazon .
As of this writing , the RH bill in the Lower House is “ unfinished business ” while in the Senate , the Biazon bill is being reviewed , commented upon and is soon to be amended .
Last February 18 , the Forum for Family Planning and Development ( FFPD ) and the Social Weather Station ( SWS ) publicized the results of the latest survey showing the “ clamor ” of the public , particularly the residents of Manila , for the bill ’s passage .
However , the RCC ’s Episcopal Commission on Family and Life ( ECFL ) belittled the results of the FFPD - commissioned survey , which involved 600 residents of Manila ’s Districts 1 and 5 .
Based on 2007 data from the National Statistical Coordination Board ( NSCB ) , Manila has a total population of 1.66 million ,
Manila had been the focus of the debates on the issues surrounding RH , especially since former Mayor and now Environment Secretary Lito L. Atienza issued Executive Order No. 003 which implicitly “ bans ” the sale of contraceptives such as condoms , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , and other materials , and the provision of medical services to women suspected to have undergone abortion .
The former Manila government chief has been said to be giving cash gifts to families that have more children .
Some of the NGOs ( non-government organization ) working in Manila even went “ underground ” , said the FFPD and its partner women ’s NGO , Linangan ng Kababaihan ( Likhaan ) Center for Women .
Fe Nicodemous , an NGO worker working closely with migrants and families of migrants , said that she had been harassed by some people allegedly connected with the former mayor when she and her colleagues were giving free contraceptives in one of the slum areas of Manila years ago .
Pro-poor or anti-poor ?
Using poverty and women ’s health as the primary basis for promoting the RH bill , the FFPD released on Sept. 3 , 2008 its official statement the issue :
“ An effective population management is the road to development .
This is not a myth , but a hard fact that has been the subject of numerous researches and studies which revealed that rapid population growth has an adverse impact on economic development .
It is also a fact that the very core of a sound population control lies in the implementation of a sustainable family planning program capable of providing much - needed information and supplies to those who need these , ” read the first line of the position paper of the FFPD published on their official website ( insert URL : http://www.forum4fp.org/html/the-forum-position-paper.html).
FFPD believes that , beyond the glaring indicators related to the current state of reproductive health in the Philippines – the high maternal mortality rate , the rising number of abortion , the increasing child mortality , the growing number of people without access to basic health and social services – the only solution is the enactment and implementation of a Reproductive Health Law that “ will enable each Filipino to be accorded the right to information , the right to choose how many children to have and when to have them . ”
The position paper further read , “ The Forum for Family Planning and Development joins hands with other NGOS in expressing our strong support for the urgent passage of the bill on Reproductive Health .
The measure goes beyond its purpose of improving reproductive health and implementing a nationwide program on family planning as it creates a path towards a sound economic policy that will improve the lives of millions of Filipino households . ”
The FFPD paper added that couples , but most especially the women , should be given the freedom to choose the path they will take in raising their family .
“ We have been waiting for decades for our country to honor its commitments to the world – to make real its promise to uphold our people ’s right to reproductive health and family planning .
While we have waited and debated for decades on the matter , our women and young girls have been suffering and thousands have lost their lives – 10 women are dying every 24 hours due to pregnancy related complications , while young girls as young as 13 years old are getting pregnant .
This because they lack the information and family planning supplies that would have provided them with an option , ” the FFPD ’s paper further read .
However , the RCC hierarchy does not believe that a big population breeds poverty .
Earlier this year , in his New Year ’s message , Pope Benedict XVI said poverty is often considered a consequence of demographic change .
“ For this reason , there are international campaigns afoot to reduce birth rates , sometimes using methods that respect neither the dignity of the woman , nor the right of parents to choose responsibly how many children to have ; graver still , these methods often fail to respect even the right to life , ” the Holy Pontiff said in his message .
Furthermore , the Holy Pontiff said there are still millions of people who had escaped from poverty despite experiencing substantial demographic growth .
Based on the 1981 statistics of world poverty incidence , 40 percent of the world ’s population is in penury ; however , after several years , that number had been halved , the Pope pointed out .
“ This achievement goes to show that resources to solve the problem of poverty do exist , even in the face of an increasing population , ” the Pontiff said .
Good for or detrimental to women ’s health ?
While proponents and supporters of the bill say that use of artificial contraceptives do not endanger women ’s overall health , there are medical experts who say it does .
Dr. Angelita Miguel - Aguirre , head of the Makati Medical Society ’s Committee on Ethics , said in a statement that contraceptives inhibit and interfere with normal and healthy reproductive processes , resulting in serious complications and side effects .
She added that women pay a high price for “ tampering with nature . ”
Lagman ’s bill promotes the use of birth control pills , patch or injectable hormones , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , barrier methods ( condoms / diaphragms ) and sterilization ( ligation for women and vasectomy for men ) .
Aguirre said hormonal contraceptives such as pills , injectables ( DEPO - Provera ) , implants and patches that contain estrogens and progestins have been classified as carcinogenic , thus raising breast , cervical and liver cancer risks , as well as increasing the possibility of premature hypertension and coronary artery disease resulting to heart attacks and strokes , and thromboembolism / pulmonary embolism .
In addition to these , decreased libido , infertility , cramps , gallstone formation , nausea and bloating are said to be the other side effects of hormonal pills .
Condoms also cannot prevent the spread of sexually - transmitted infections such as the human immune - deficiency virus ( HIV ) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
The rubber comprising latex condoms has intrinsic voids about five micra whereas the HIV is only 0.1 micra .
Since this is a factor of 50 smaller than the intrinsic voids , the HIV can pass through the condom , she explained .
“ The condom and other barrier methods have the highest failure rate in preventing pregnancy and in protecting against sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) especially the human papilloma virus which is the major cause of cervical cancer in women , ” said Aguirre .
However , the RH bill ’s advocates say these are not true .
The side effects of pills , they say , are just temporary and some of them do even prevent cervical cancer .
Will it promote promiscuity or not ?
One of the fears of the conservative Church is that after the passage of the bill , promiscuity will be rampant among the youth .
Rev. Fr. Gregory D. Gaston , academic dean of the Holy Apostles Senior Seminary , Makati City , said that the RH bill seeks to establish a national family planning program that would include mandatory sex education and instruction on use of birth control for students in Grade V and higher levels in all public schools .
The Catholic Church , he said , considers this “ immoral ” .
“ The so - called sex-education programs promote promiscuity under the guise of reproductive health and reproductive rights .
Children and adolescents will be taught to have satisfying and safe sexual experiences outside marriage .
This is exactly the opposite of the virtues of holy purity , modesty and respect for oneself and others being taught by the Holy Church , ” he said in a statement .
On the other hand , Emee Lei Albano , a Catholic and a youth advocate of the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) in the Philippines , said in an interview with Bulatlat that the youth nowadays are more intelligent and responsible enough to know what is right and what is wrong for them .
“ I think the RH bill will just protect them and wo n’t make them immoral , unlike what some people wants us to believe , ” she said .
Will it solve the Philippines ’ problems ?
Some experts on bioethics say that while they commend efforts to improve the quality of life of the Filipino people and that they agree that there is a need to address present problems in reproductive health , they do not think House Bill No. 5043 address these in a holistic manner for it focuses mainly on pregnancy prevention .
A statement titled “ Consensus Statement on Reproductive Bill 5043 ” , which was signed and approved by Southeast Asian Center for Bioethics , argued that while sex education is an important part in the integral development of the child , the responsibility lies first with the parents .
The statement was signed by Fr. Fausto B. Gomez , OP ; Angeles T. Alora , MD ; Edna Monzon , MD , president of the Catholic Physicians ’ Guild of the Philippines and chairman of Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of Dominican - run University of Santo Tomas , chair of the Department of Bioethics at the University of Santo Tomas ( UST ) Faculty of Medicine and Surgery ; Mayumi Bismark , MD , president of the Bioethics Society of the Philippines ; and Mrs. Lucia V. Soltes of the Catholic Nurses Guild of the Philippines in 2008 .
“ Their role should be stressed .
It should also involve the school with teachers who should be educated .
The absence of content regarding values in the way sex education is being taught gives an impression that there is no universal value , human sexuality , not sex education , should be taught , ” the statement reads .
“ The program should provide information and definitions which are accurate and free of contradictions : the antiabortion stance of the bill is contraindicated by the promotion of contractive agents ( IUD and hormonal contraceptives ) which actually act after fertilization and are potentially abortifacient agents , ” the statement further read .
“ Nevertheless , clinical decisions , as permeated by RH , cannot be mandated ( refusing to refer patients to family planning services based on conscientious objection is penalized ) but must be left to the informed conscience of the health practitioner . ”
“ Human freedom is a universal right .
Health professionals and educators should be free to conscientiously object without fear of penalty and sanction , ” the statement stressed .
However , the FFPD and other RH advocates maintained :
We strongly believe that couples , especially women , should be given the freedom to choose the path they will take in raising their family .
This is a commitment our country made several times .
We affirmed this right in 1968 , during the International Year for Human Rights where United Nations Member States recognized the right of individuals and couples to decide their family size .
In August 1981 , the Philippines ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW ) which clearly upholds women ’s right to reproductive health services and education .
And in 1995 , we again made a promise to the rest of the world to provide our people with access to reproductive health services when we signed the International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) Programme of Action and the Beijing Conference on Women Programme of Action .
We have been waiting for decades for our country to honor its commitments to the world – to make real its promise to uphold our people ’s right to reproductive health and family planning .
While we have waited and debated for decades on the matter , our women and young girls have been suffering and thousands have lost their lives – 10 women are dying every 24 hours due to pregnancy related complications , while young girls as young as 13 years old are getting pregnant .
This because they lack the information and family planning supplies that would have provided them with an option .
We need to join hands for this national legislation that will bring tremendous improvements in the lives of our people .
This is not about politics or religion .
This is about , believing that each one of us should have the chance to live a healthy and dignified life , a human right that must be upheld regardless of one ’s faith and belief .
The latest SWS survey about the acceptance of the bill showed that 71 percent of respondents are in favor of the pending RH bill , while 76 percent support the bill ’s provision requiring public schools to teach family planning education .

It 's uncanny .
When known software gets repackaged for iPhones and iPod Touches and passes through the hallowed gates of the App Store , something happens :
Almost invariably , it gets cheaper .
Waaay cheaper .
Good right ?
Well , not always .

The App Store is a strange new place for developers .
Veterans and newcomers engage in bareknuckle combat , driving prices down to levels people would n't have imagined charging just a few years ago .
Margins drop to razor - thin levels while customers expect apps to get cheaper and cheaper , but with ever increasing quality and depth .
For developers , for other software platforms and potentially for the increasingly fickle customers themselves , it 's uncharted , and treacherous , territory .
But the most bizarre thing of all is — in an effort to keep people in the App Store , and to prevent competitors from getting a toehold in the mobile app business — Apple 's charting a course straight into it .

" The App Store is a very competitive environment , " says Caroline Hu Flexer , co-founder of Duck Duck Moose , an indie developer of children 's edutainment apps like Itsy Bitsy Spider .
" As an independent developer without a large PR budget or well - known brands , it can be very challenging , and you 're pretty much at the mercy of Apple . "
The Problem

Most iPhone apps had no life before the App Store , and currently have no life outside it .
But with those that did , you start to see a pattern .
App prices could reasonably be expected to fall over time — an older game is worth less to customers than a newer game , and with other types of software , a late - stage price drop is a great way to scoop up late adopters .
What 's strange , though , is how prices dramatically collapse after hitting Apple 's store .
Two weeks ago we flagged some bizarre differences in pricing between equivalent PSP and iPhone games .
Big titles , like Tetris and Fieldrunners , were inexplicably cheaper on the iPhone , even in cases where they were executed better .
This did n't make a whole lot of sense .
As it turns out , it had nothing to do with Sony and the PSP , and everything to do with the App Store .

As you can see in the chart above , many apps and services take a price dip in the App Store .
Zagat 's premium To Go guides cost a healthy $ 4 / month for Windows Mobile phones , but sell for just $ 10 / year on the iPhone .
CoPilot 7 , a navigation app , used to set you back a full $ 200 on a Microsoft - badged device ( later lowered to $ 100 ) ; the much - improved version 8 sells in the App Store for a measly $ 35 today .
The premium version of WeatherBug runs $ 5 for people who happened to buy BlackBerry 's touchscreen phone , but just $ 1 for anyone who bought Apple 's .
VR + voice recorder , a full - featured dictaphone app , runs $ 30 on BlackBerry , and an incredible $ 2 in the App Store .
So how can this little App Store , itself a subsection of the iTunes store , squeeze so many developers to the point of near - suffocation ?
Update : The BlackBerry Weatherbug app boasts a few extra features over the iPhone app , including push notifications .
This accounts for some of the price difference

The Economy
Some of this is pure Econ 101 :
The store serves a massive , captive audience that 's pre-trained to spend money in iTunes .
The promise of higher volume makes it easier for developers to lower prices , which they use , along with interesting features and clever marketing , to set themselves apart from the competition .
Advertisement
If things work out just right , the App Store can move a lot of software for you .
Spread your lower margins over tens of thousands of sales , and your $ 2 app could make just as much , if not more , than your old , slower - selling $ 30 app did .
The App Store recently passed the 2 - billion - download mark , and there are likely well over 50 million App - Store - ready devices in peoples ' hands right now .
A vast majority of these downloads — averaging an insane 35 per device — will likely have been free .
Only Apple knows just how many .
But even if just 5 % of the 2 billion downloads were paid for , that 's one hell of a market .
It 's true that prices are falling as more and more iPhone and iPod Touch owners enter the market .
But prices wo n't stop falling .
And more and more developers from all over the world are submitting apps , too , so fewer devs are guaranteed visibility .
Not all of the people investing time and money in their products are reaping the return they ( reasonably ! ) expected .

Newsweek 's exposé on the end of easy money at the App Store goes a long way toward making the case against going all - in as an iPhone dev .
Not only are development costs high , while success appears to be basically randomized .
But the story does n't explain exactly what happened to make the situation so grim .
The Culture
Giz stories rage about app prices all the time , and in your own private way , so do most of you .
Buying $ 1 songs and $ 2 TV shows has given us an expectation that apps should be cheap , no matter what their use .
The glut of free apps you see filling out the app charts every day does n't help either .
Software is worth less to us now , even though we use it more .

I spoke with Steve Andler of Networks In Motion , the company that makes Gokivo .
It 's an app that we savaged for its introductory price of $ 10 a month , which then dropped to $ 5 a month a few weeks ago .
Advertisement
Andler explained reaching the unrealistically low costs with one thing : diminished features .
Their app pulls up - to - date map , traffic and POI data from NIM 's servers in real time , meaning that — beyond developer costs — they have to constantly pay for new , fresh data to pass on to their customers .
But even at $ 5 a month , it 's just about impossible for Gokivo to compete with an app like MotionX GPS Drive , which is $ 3 a month , or $ 25 per year .
Advertisement
Andler says there are subtle differences in services offered , which is true — MotionX , for example , does n't yet read street names aloud when it gives you directions — but your average user probably does n't know this , and there 's a good chance MotionX might add it in an update later on , as their market share and revenues grow .
But the damage is done .
The app - buying customer is spoiled :
As far as we are concerned , turn - by - turn GPS apps should now cost no more than $ 3 a month , period .
This is the new retail , and it 's weird .

Loren Brichter , father of Tweetie , is used to getting yelled at by jaded app shoppers .
He 's charging $ 3 for Tweetie 2 , an update — but a whole new version , really — of his well - established Twitter app .
Offering the software as a free upgrade is n't realistic for him :
I priced Tweetie at $ 2.99 not based on how much work I put into it ( it would have been more ) , or to try and undercut other apps ( it would have been less ) , but simply because I felt like $ 2.99 was a reasonable price to pay for a Twitter client .
Impulse purchase , but not bargain - basement .
I never liked playing pricing games either — a popular pastime of other App Store devs .
It 's always been $ 2.99 , and will probably always be $ 2.99 .
Advertisement
His decision was n't easy .
And even though his app is the darling of the tech press , and has hundreds of great user reviews , he 's being lambasted for charging three measly dollars for a high - quality app that people will use again and again and again .
Before the App Store , a complaint this petty would n't have even made sense .
Apple
Advertisement
From the outside , it appears that Apple is encouraging a race to the bottom .
The top 10 lists in each App Store category — one of the only ways for an app to get any meaningful amount of iTunes visibility — are almost exclusively the territory of low - priced impulse buys , and are hard to cling onto for more than a few weeks at time .
Flexer , of Duck Duck Moose , says she 's experienced it firsthand :
The ranking by volume ( as opposed to revenue ) on the App Store seems to drive the prices of apps down .
Aside from being featured by Apple , exposure of an app is dependent on its ranking in the top lists , so developers lower prices to obtain a higher ranking .
Advertisement
This is echoed and amplified by the makers of Twitterific , an app that , in a bid to stay competitive , saw its price fall from $ 10 to $ 4 , despite active development and a growing featureset :
While these changes represent perks for users , it also means that sustaining profitability for a given piece of software in the App Store is nearly impossible unless you have a break - away hit .
Advertisement
And if things do n't change ?
Myself and others like me will have no choice but to focus our development efforts elsewhere .
Advertisement
With yesterday 's announcement that Apple is allowing free apps to include in - app purchases , things just got even more tumultuous .
Depending on how this is handled , the top " free " apps could all be paid apps in disguise .
Either that or the paid app rankings will be dominated by free - on - a - trial - basis teasers .
In either case , the rankings open themselves up for opportunistic abuse , and the highest goal for any honest , talented app developer — to just crack that list — just became more uncertain .
Advertisement
This is disastrous for developers , even if it 's mostly incidental , and a function of Apple trying to sell apps like they 've been selling music for years , despite a totally different set of product types and customer needs .
But Apple 's effect on pricing goes well beyond incidental .
At least in some cases , Apple calls the shots .
Advertisement
A high - profile dev team that has sold a number of apps in the store since the earliest of days , and who accordingly wishes to stay anonymous , told us as much .
When they approached Apple with their first app , they had a price in mind .
Apple told them it was too high , and that they 'd need to cut it to succeed .
They chopped it in half .
Even then , Apple told them to " be careful . "
This company made out fine , since they were in a position to adapt .
However , to play the volume game , they had to restructure their entire philosophy around a pricing structure that , just months before , would 've seemed ridiculous .
Advertisement
With over 2 billion data points to graph and filter to their heart 's content , Apple understands the App Store climate better than anyone else possibly can .
As such , their advice is probably golden .
Which is okay if you 're a relatively nimble , single - purpose company , and you can afford to risk restructuring everything you do around their store , and your costs can be covered at whatever price you evidently need to set to sell at a certain volume .
But you 'll just want to keep in mind that their advice is self - interested .
Apple wants cheap apps , to keep people buying them , and to keep other stores firmly in the second tier — and they 're not afraid to say it .
From Apple 's last quarterly report to investors , a line they 've been echoing since the store opened :
[ Apple ] also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company 's approach to providing [ digital app distribution ] seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions ... While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of third - party digital content and applications , these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing .

You do n't need to look back any further than the launch of the iTunes music store to see an Apple that will do everything it can to push other peoples ' prices down for their benefit .
Of course , they can't really fix prices for apps — they 're not songs or movies , and each one does something different — but they can nudge like hell .
What Happens Now
So what does the App Store Effect mean , right now ?
In the short term , we 'll get lower prices .
This is great .
But in the long term , it might not be sustainable .
Advertisement
The promise that sales volume will make up for the rock - bottom prices you need to charge just to be seen in your app category seems increasingly hollow , and to put it bluntly , if developers do n't have a chance in hell of recouping their fees , they 'll stop trying .
And I 'm not talking about 99 - cent iFart app spammers here — I 'm talking about big players who already make money selling software .
If the navigation companies , the big game studios and the premium content providers can't thrive in the App Store , they 'll have to leave ; even playing in Apple 's sandbox threatens and undercut their ( sometimes much more crucial ) product lines elsewhere .
And do n't forget , Palm and Android fans , this App Store Effect sends ripples well beyond the App Store .
Customers expect to see functionally identical apps priced the same way across platforms , because to us , that 's what makes sense .
Can devs really afford to port an app to the webOS to sell to the tens of thousands of Pre owners , when they 're expected to tag it with iPhone prices , calculated for a base of millions ?
Whether by Apple 's design or totally by accident , everyone who does n't own an iPhone will suffer for it .

The App Store Effect illustrates a new kind of economy , and it 's not going to go away .
In fact , it 's going to get worse .
Developers will either adapt , die or leave .
But where will they go ?

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan  Militants stepped up their fight against the Pakistani government on Friday , striking a building belonging to the country ’s main intelligence agency in the northwestern city of Peshawar , Pakistani television reported .
The early morning explosion killed at least eight people and wounded more than 30 in what has become a grimly familiar cycle of violence .
Peshawar , a bustling city on the edge of Pakistan ’s western frontier , has been particularly hard hit , with near daily bombings that have unsettled residents and interrupted daily rhythms .
“ Peshawar seems to have become the main target , ” said Hasan Askary , an analyst , speaking on Dawn Television .

The bombing ’s location left no doubt about the insurgent ’s motive : Pakistan ’s intelligence agency is a symbol of the power of the military , which has been conducting a campaign against Taliban militants in the western mountains of South Waziristan .
Borderlands was a highly anticipated release on the PC , but a one - week delay of the PC launch meant that console gamers were able to enjoy the gun-collecting goodness ahead of their PC gaming brethren .
A few gamers were lucky enough to find stores that were willing to sell the boxed PC copy of the game before the street date , however , but when they installed the game and tried to play , they found that without the title being authenticated online , the disc and key were worthless .
The problem ?
They forgot that buying a PC game does n't involve a product , but a license .
Gearbox head Randy Pitchford was sympathetic to the complaints of fans who scored early copies .
" I do n't know if something can be done to unlock copies for people that somehow get a copy before the street date ...
I certainly can't do anything about it , but I understand and am sympathetic to the frustration , " he told Big Download .
He remembers a time when he had an early copy of Half Life 2 and was likewise locked out of the game due to authentication .
" I know how that feels .
I 'm sorry it 's happening to customers of Borderlands and I wish there was something I could do about it . "
So what happened ?
Once the game leaves the hands of the developer and goes to the publisher , there is n't much they can do about issues like this .
The publisher decides when the game gets sold , and when it can be played .
The reasoning behind these dates ?
Piracy , promotion , linking the launch up with other markets ... it can be a complex thing to decide when to sell a game .
The difference now is that there is technology in place to lock players out even when they are able to talk a store into selling it early .
We reached out to Hal Halpin , the President of the Entertainment Consumers Association , to see if he could explain the situation .
" Probably the most important thing for consumers to understand when discussing this subject is that they 're not buying a product to own , but rather purchasing a licensed copy — restricting use to the Terms of Service or End User License Agreement , " he explains .
" Unlike a console game , which you purchase and own outright , PC games have severely restricted ownership issues due to the nature of the transaction .
If merchants choose to break street date and sell the product early , consumers are still agreeing to the licensing terms that the publisher includes in the click - wrap . "
So if the terms are that the game requires activation , and that will only be made available on a specific date , there is really nothing anyone can do .
Halpin and the ECA have long argued for more open end - user licensing agreements .
" All of this of course , really goes to the point that we need to drive toward a standardized EULA and more general openness about what publishers are selling and consumers are buying .
This Borderlands example lends even more credence to that position , " he told Ars .
The takeaway ?
These days , even if you have the box and disc in your hand , if the publisher does n't want you to play the game , you wo n't be able to .
The physical product you purchased was basically a means of transporting the data and license to you , not a product in and of itself .
That 's bad news for gamers who want to play a game before everyone else , but good news for publishers looking for more control of how and when their games are played .

THE victory in May of Sri Lanka 's army over the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam should have been a cause for almost universal celebration .
The Tigers , seeking to monopolise the politics of the country 's Tamil minority , were pioneers in suicide - bombing and leaders in child - conscription .
They were as brutal towards Tamils as towards the Sinhalese majority .
Many foreign countries banned them as terrorists .
After 26 years of warfare , no one begrudged Sri Lanka its hopes of peace .
Yet the government , its reputation already tarnished by the manner of its final victory , risks squandering the richest prize that victory offers : the chance for national reconciliation .
The biggest obstacle to that reconciliation has become the fate of some 250,000 Tamils displaced by the war and now herded into camps .
Their conditions are abject : crowded , short of drinking water and with poor sanitation .
Many have been displaced several times and have lost everything .
Tempers are running short and confrontations with guards more frequent .
Aid agencies have only limited access , and the press next to none .
There are fears of worse hardship to come , and especially of the spread of disease .
The imminent monsoon may turn a grim ordeal into a disaster .
Rain in August caused flooding , washing away tents , preventing food deliveries and flushing raw sewage around some camps .
The government is preparing for the monsoon , digging ditches and improving latrines .
But already this week , a pre-monsoon downpour leaked into hundreds of shelters .
The government blames the UN and aid groups for shoddy camp - building .
They retort that these were only ever meant as temporary shelter for people on their way home or elsewhere .
In practice , as a report for the European Union ( EU ) noted , the camps now provide the setting for “ a novel form of unacknowledged detention ” .
Two plausible - sounding reasons for their internment — weeding out Tiger remnants and demining their home villages — have worn thinner as the months have dragged on , and the monsoon provided a climatic deadline .
The government claims to be emptying the camps as fast as it can .
But with so much going its way , it seems to feel little pressure to deal with this difficult issue .
It has just triumphed in provincial elections in the south — its eighth such victory .
This has encouraged the president , Mahinda Rajapaksa , to bring forward presidential elections , due in late 2011 , to early next year .
The economy , too , is enjoying a peace dividend , with the stockmarket more than double its value at the beginning of the year , and interest among foreign investors strong enough for the central bank this week to launch a $ 500 m bond issue .
Tourist arrivals are picking up .
Still in the Tigers ' cage
The damage being done to Sri Lanka 's international image , however , may last longer .
The Tamil diaspora will keep alive the calls for investigation of alleged war - crimes by both sides in the climactic campaign .
And the EU has to decide whether to withdraw Sri Lanka 's special trade privileges on human - rights grounds .
If , as seems likely , it does , the country 's garment exporters will suffer great damage , and employment will consequently be hit .
But there is a far bigger danger , at home : that the end of the war fuels the ethnic resentments which caused it .
Occasional gestures are made to reconciliation .
More Tamil policemen are to be recruited .
The president himself this week made a speech in Tamil .
But in general , little has been done to make Tamils see the defeat of the Tigers as the liberation it should have been .
Indeed , for those still stuck in the camps , the word rings painfully hollow .

Hotspots are popping up all over the country
It is believed to be the first case of its kind in the UK , but with an estimated one million wi-fi users around the country , it is unlikely to be the last .
" There are a lot of implications and this could open the floodgates to many more such cases , " said Phil Cracknell , chief technology officer of security firm NetSurity .
Details in this particular case are sketchy , although it is known that Gregory Straszkiewicz had " piggybacked " on a wireless broadband network of a local Ealing resident , using a laptop while sitting in his car .
He had been seen in the area on several previous occasions over the past three months and is believed to have been reported to police by a neighbour concerned that he was acting suspiciously .
The case is some way away from that of Brian Salcedo , who was sentenced to nine years in a US jail last year for the far more serious crime of siphoning credit card numbers over the wireless network of hardware store Lowes .
Unauthorised access
The criminal aspect of the case of Salcedo is obvious and is clearly reflected in the sentence dished out .
Wireless networks at home give people freedom to move about
Not to Simon Janes , a former head of the Computer Crime Unit and now operations manager for computer forensics firm Ibas .
" Gaining unauthorised access to someone else 's network is an offence and people have to take responsibility for their actions .
Some people might argue that taking a joy - ride in someone else 's car is not an offence either , " he said .
Gaining unauthorised access to a computer is an offence covered by the Computer Misuse Act .
In Straszkiewcz 's case , he was prosecuted under the Communications Act and found guilty of dishonestly obtaining an electronic communications service .
" I guess , and it is a guess , that they could n't prove he accessed the actual computer and that is why they used another legal avenue , " said Mr Janes .
But whatever route the case took , the outcome proves that borrowing someone else 's network is not as harmless as the hobbyist wi-fi user might think .
Lax security
It is not just those people driving around in search of a " free " network who have to worry .
The perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user
Simon Janes , Ibas
" There have been incidences where paedophiles deliberately leave their wireless networks open so that , if caught , they can say that is was n't them that used the network for illegal purposes , " said NetSurity 's Mr Cracknell .
Such a defence would hold little water as the person installing the network , be they a home user or a business , has ultimate responsibility for any criminal activity that takes place on that network , whether it be launching a hack attack or downloading illegal pornography .
Despite this , businesses and residential users continue to fail to take that responsibility seriously by securing their networks , said Mr Cracknell .
A joint survey by RSA Security and NetSurity , conducted in March of this year , found that more than a third of wireless networks in London and Frankfurt had the basic security features turned off .
Many had failed to turn on the encryption that scrambles the data traffic between users and the access point .
Freebie wi-fi
" The perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user , " said Mr Janes .
Mr Cracknell called for an awareness campaign , similar to the one recently run on TV highlighting the threats of identity theft .
The perception in the past has been that borrowing a bit of bandwidth is cheeky but not really criminal behaviour .
With wi - fi operating at speeds of up to 20 times faster than broadband it is unlikely to slow the system down noticeably unless the borrower is downloading huge files and , unless the owner of the network has intrusion detection software , he or she is unlikely to notice the squatters .
The fact that Straszkiewicz narrowly escaped a harsher sentence , had to pay a £ 500 fine and had his laptop and wireless card confiscated indicates such squatting might not be worthwhile .
Detective Constable Stephone Rothwell from Ealing CID was involved in the case and said future cases would be treated in the same way .
" This case is the first of its type in the United Kingdom and it sets an example to people who use increased computer technology to try and avoid paying for the internet , " he said .
It could be that the days of freebie wi-fi are coming to an end .
