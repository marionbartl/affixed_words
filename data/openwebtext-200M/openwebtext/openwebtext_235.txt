Ben Curtis has moved on from his Dell Dude days .
But ca n’t you just hear him shout that slogan ?
haha
Next time you ’re at Tortilla Flats and you find yourself wondering aloud to your dinner companion , “ What ever happened to the guy who did the ‘ Dude , you ’re getting a Dell ’ commercials ? ” do n’t be surprised when Ben Curtis , the man himself , approaches your table and explains the tequila list .
While guest - starring on Law & Order and acting in films like the upcoming Proud Iva , Curtis has been a waiter and bartender at the Tex - Mex spot for the past year and a half , and though he dressed up as the Dell Dude for the Halloween party , he ’s not about to repeat the slogan for you .
He might , however , give you a free shot .
“ All you have to do , ” he says , “ is come and have a good time . ”
How often do people recognize you as the Dell Dude ?
Every day .
It ’s really difficult , but it ’s a humbling experience .
There were times when I made boatloads of money as an actor , but here I can be myself .
What ’s the most extreme reaction you ’ve gotten ?
There was a group of women in their early forties , one of whom was bawling .
I walk over and they said , “ Our friend just passed away .
We thought you might be able to cheer [ us ] up , we know who you are and you ’re an incredible human and you ’ve been through a lot and you ’re an incredible actor .
We ’re all DEA agents , and we think you should smoke as much pot as you want to .
And we love you . ”
Do people ask you to repeat the catchphrase ?
I ’ve had tables of young girls who think they recognize me , and when they ask me , I say “ yes ” and then they do n’t believe me and they start arguing and ask me to do the catchphrase and I ’ll laugh and say , “ It ’s been four years , but I ’m glad you ’re a fan . ”
Do people quote it to you ?
They get really drunk , and they ’ll start yelling things at me .
I either ignore them , or if it ’s way out of hand , I go up and say , “ I appreciate your support , but my name is Ben . ”
That usually does n’t work so I smile and ignore them .
Have you met any girlfriends on the job ?
I had one when I first started working there , but now I ’m single for the first time in a while .
I ’ve met a couple people there I ’ve gotten to be really good friends with or dated for a while .
You ’re also in a band ?
My band is Whale , made up of a bunch of former actors .
We had residency at Fat Baby .
It ’s the first band I ’ve ever fronted .
We have the green light , but we ’ve decided to take a little time off to record our EP and package ourselves properly .

When stars like our Sun run out of fuel , they die a long slow death as a white dwarf , slowing cooling down over billions of years .
But now an international team of astronomers has found an unusual form of white dwarf with a bare carbon core ; one that might suggest a new sequence of stellar evolution .
A fate for stars right on the edge of detonating as supernovae .
The majority of stars that die eventually become white dwarfs in the end .
The most massive 2 - 3 % of stars will actually detonate as supernovae when they end their lives .
But these newly discovered objects might have been right at the borderline .
If they were just a little more massive , they would have detonated as well , but instead , they did n’t quite make it .
The evidence was gathered by astronomers from the University of Arizona , UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al and Paris Observatory .
They reviewed more than 10,000 new white dwarfs found in the most recent update to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
This automated survey has turned up four times as many white dwarf stars as previously known .
As stars run out of hydrogen , they switch to helium , and as this burns off , they ’re left with a core of carbon and oxygen surrounded by an atmosphere of hydrogen or helium .
That ’s what a normal white dwarf looks like .
But a small group of these white dwarfs have a very bizarre appearance .
They ’re just a bare core of carbon , without any surrounding atmosphere of hydrogen or helium .
From the press release announcing the discovery , researcher Patrick Dufour describes the discovery , “ when I first started modeling the atmospheres of these hotter DQ stars , my first thought was that these are helium - rich stars with traces of carbon , just like the cooler ones .
But as I started analyzing the stars with the higher temperature model , I realized that even if I increased the carbon abundance , the model still did n’t agree with the SDSS data .
Out of pure desperation , I decided to try modeling a pure - carbon atmosphere .
It worked .
I found that if I calculated a pure carbon atmosphere model , it reproduces the spectra exactly as observed .
No one had calculated a pure carbon atmosphere model before .
No one believed that it existed .
We were surprised and excited . ”
The researchers believe you need to have a star with 9 - 11 solar masses to create a carbon star like this .
They ’re planning follow up observations to better pinpoint the masses of the objects they ’ve discovered so far .

A virus that has been specifically designed by scientists to be safe to normal tissue but deadly to cancer is showing early promise in a preliminary study , researchers said today at the ESMO Conference Lugano ( ECLU ) , Switzerland .
The virus , called NV1020 , is a type of herpes simplex virus modified so that it selectively replicates in virus cells , killing them in the process .
" It does n't replicate in normal , healthy cells , so our hope is that it will help fight cancers without causing side - effects in the rest of the body , " said Dr. Axel Mescheder , VP Clinical Research & Development , from the Munich - based biotech company MediGene .
The study is conducted in seven leading US - cancer centers , with Dr. Tony Reid from the University of California in San Diego , CA as Principal Investigator .
Dr. Mescheder presented preliminary safety and efficacy results and a case report from this ongoing clinical trial in patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver at the meeting .
Dr. Mescheder 's poster presentation described the case of a patient whose cancer had spread to 10 different places around the liver and four in the lungs .
He was given the virus treatment in four weekly infusions direct into blood stream , followed by two cycles of approved chemotherapy .
Six months after treatment , scans showed the liver masses had nearly disappeared .
" The reduction in the tumor masses was really impressive in this patient , " Dr. Mescheder said .
" The hepatic masses almost disappeared . "
The patient survived for 12 months after treatment .
" In the current study , the scientists are testing the treatment in patients with colorectal cancer that have not responded to chemotherapy and where the cancer has spread to the liver , " Dr. Mescheder said .
" We are hoping to extend overall survival . "
So far , the findings are looking positive .
The treatment seems very tolerable for patients and safe .
" The results are really quite encouraging at this early stage , " he said .
Almost 40 % of patients with colorectal cancer ultimately die from metastatic disease , where the cancer spreads to other parts of the body .
Most of the spreading occurs to the liver and 15 % of patients have liver metastases at the time of diagnosis .
The latest human results reported today follow testing in the lab and in animals where the virus was shown to be effective at killing colorectal cancer cells and liver cancers .
Will Rogers once said : " I do not belong to any organized political party , I am a Democrat . "
Never were such words so true .
It is too bad that the DNC leaders look into the rear view mirror for their ideas .
They are letting the country go down in order to gain an advantage in 2008 .
That wont cut it for me and others who are in the Democratic wing of the DNC .
Desperate times require desperate measures .
Today I applied to the FEC for new political party status .
I am calling it The Truth Party and I welcome all rational people to join me .
It will become effective in 2009 .

IT REPRESENTS a remarkable change of opinion .
Just two years ago the consensus view of America 's 16 intelligence agencies was tough and unambiguous : Iran was “ determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure . ”
The fact that Iran then , in 2006 , overtly restarted nuclear enrichment — the process to make nuclear fuel which can also be used to make fissile material for bombs — in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions only increased the sense of alarm .
Speculation has since grown that America might take matters into its own hands and bomb Iran .
George Bush said in a recent speech that an Iranian bomb could contribute to “ world war three ” .
Dick Cheney , the hawkish vice - president , gave warning of “ serious consequences ” if Iran did not suspend uranium enrichment .
Yet on Monday December 3rd the intelligence agencies revamped their view of Iran 's nuclear - weapons programme .
In a new official estimate released that day , the National Intelligence Council states frankly that “ We judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 , Tehran halted its weapons programme . ”
A few sentences later it states with “ moderate confidence ” that “ Tehran had not restarted its nuclear - weapons programme as of mid-2007 . ”
The weapons programme is defined as relating to weapons design , weaponisation work and covert uranium work .
It also concludes that Iran is susceptible to outside diplomatic pressure and scrutiny , which together were responsible for the halt in the weapons programme in 2003 .
The Democrats have promptly called for a “ surge of diplomacy ” towards Iran .
No explanation has been given for the agencies ' about turn .
But there is speculation aplenty .
One analyst notes that the defection to the West of an Iranian general in 2007 may have produced better intelligence from inside Iran .
The spies may also have concluded that earlier assessments were overly alarming , perhaps as a result of pressure from Mr Cheney , who may have sought an intelligence document to bolster any case for bombing Iran .
Mr Bush 's administration has been accused of stretching official intelligence on Iraq 's arms capability in making the case for invasion of that country in 2003 .
The spies , by publishing this report , have made it harder for military action in Iran .
The timing of the report 's release is intriguing .
It coincides with suggestions that China may be willing to support a third , tougher , round of UN sanctions on the Islamic Republic , after a long period of stonewalling .
( This would mean new financial sanctions and more stringent travel bans for Iranian leaders , although China remains loth to imperil its business interests in Iran . )
America has also said that the number of explosively formed projectiles used against its troops in Iraq has declined markedly in recent months .
America has stated that such sophisticated weapons are probably provided by Iran ( a charge that Iran denies ) .
Such a drop might indicate that Iran , despite its president 's bluster , is keen to avoid military confrontation , as the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) now suggests .
None of this , however , suggests that Iran 's nuclear programme is no longer a threat .
America 's national - security adviser , Stephen Hadley , argues that the new NIE only shows that “ the international community has to turn up the pressure [ on Iran ] ” .
The NIE itself says that Iran “ at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons . ”
Even if Iran is not currently working on warheads or missiles to make a nuclear weapon ( as it has been saying for years ) , it is publicly enriching uranium .
Getting the right kind of fissile material is the hardest part of making a bomb .
Iran says it has 3,000 centrifuges enriching uranium ; according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies , if they have mastered the technical challenges of making the centrifuges work together properly , this could produce material for a bomb in about a year .
The NIE seems to discount this , saying that Iran may have enough fissile material by late 2009 , but probably not until sometime between 2010 and 2015 because of technical problems .
America 's spies may think that Iran 's enrichers are having trouble doing their job , but they still expect the Iranians to get there eventually .
Iran has welcomed the new NIE , repeating claims that its nuclear programme is not intended for weapons use .
Israel , Britain and France have all called for continued pressure to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear bomb .
The NIE strongly suggests that there may be a political way out of confrontation with Iran , saying that the country 's nuclear programme is guided by “ a cost - benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political , economic and military costs . ”
Thus it may be amenable to a combination of threats , diplomatic pressure and “ opportunities for Iran to achieve its security , prestige and goals for regional influence . ”
The NIE admits that it is difficult to know what sort of grand bargain might work , but that is a matter for diplomats not intelligence agents to ponder .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
So this is what Hollywood has come to -- two producers of one of the summer ’s most keenly anticipated films are at odds over how dumb their star is .
D’oh !
It must be “ The Simpsons Movie . ”

The star , Homer Simpson , has been the father of one of the most beloved animated families on television for 18 years .
This Friday he and his wife , Marge , and their kids -- Bart , Lisa and Maggie -- all make their big - screen debut , aiming for major box - office bucks by putting their reputation for generating laughs on the line .
Part of the plot has Homer falling head - over - heels for a slop - eating pig while ignoring his family .
In Hollywood , summer movies are not known for being brainy , but it ’s rare for filmmakers to publicly impugn the intelligence of their leading man .
Then again , this is Homer .
James Brooks , the “ Simpsons ” writer / producer who has been with the Fox television series since its start , had a one - word answer when asked if Homer ’s pig obsession is the dumbest stunt Homer ’s ever pulled .
“ Absolutely , ” he told Reuters .
But “ Simpsons ” creator Matt Groening is not so sure .
Groening noted that Homer once forgot how to dial the emergency phone number 911 .
Another time , he sought help from a higher power with the plea : “ I ’m not normally a praying man , but if you ’re up there , save me , Superman . ”
Groening laughs .
“ The writers and animators compete to see who can come up with the dumbest Homer joke of all , ” he said .
To top the TV program that first aired in 1989 and now plays in more than 70 countries , “ Simpsons Movie ” makers tried to raise the stakes for Homer and his family and friends .
TV TO MOVIE
Bart goes skateboarding naked through their hometown , Springfield , and then faced with Homer ’s affection for a pig , Bart looks for fatherly advice from his hated neighbor , the sanctimonious Ned Flanders .
Bart ’s over - achieving sister Lisa falls for an Irish environmental activist who swears U2 ’s Bono is not his dad .
Her plans to clean up a polluted lake are dashed when Homer dumps pig “ leavings ” in the water , prompting U.S. officials to cap Springfield with a dome .
When Homer ’s antics threaten his family , Marge steps in to show him the error of his ways .
Along the way , “ Simpsons ” creators take jabs at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , “ green ” activists , “ President ” Arnold Schwarzenegger and all the rest of us who ever did a really stupid thing , then later learned to laugh at ourselves .
“ There is a great deal of joy in watching someone who ’s got it worse than you , ” Groening said .
Since 1987 , when the yellow - skinned family first appeared in animated shorts on “ The Tracey Ullman Show , ” the Simpsons have made millions of fans chuckle .
With more than 400 episodes in circulation , the show has garnered many awards while introducing catch - phrases like Bart ’s “ Eat my shorts ” and Homer ’s anguished half - utterance , “ D’oh ” to the pop culture lexicon .
Groening and Brooks -- a writer / director / producer whose credits also include such hits as the TV classic “ Taxi ” and acclaimed film “ As Good as It Gets ” -- risked the Simpsons ’ success by making a movie that , if it fails to please fans and flops at box offices , will be a huge disappointment for all .
“ This is so much more ( pressure ) than anything , and we care so much about the ‘ Simpsons , ’ ” Brooks said .
He noted “ The Simpsons Movie ” was not even finished until about one week ago as writers and animators continued tinkering with the jokes and gags until the last minute .
Critical reviews await Friday ’s debut , but early screenings in Los Angeles have left audiences laughing at a movie that , at the very least , should make Homer Simpson proud .
rom behind the wheel of an obscenely muscled Dodge pickup , Vincent Edward " Bo " Jackson is reminiscing about the time he took down a 300 - pound bear from point - blank range with a . 45 - caliber pistol .
This was a decade ago in Alaska , a few years after Bo retired from organized sports and a few days before the Princess of Wales died in a car crash , and if you 're wondering whether Bo was scared , , Bo was not scared .
Not even when that bear got so close
Bo and his hunting companion could see the hairs bolt upright like pine needles on the back of its neck .
Ross Dettman for ESPN.comSpecial right now in the produce aisle : the greatest athlete of his generation .
" I was n't scared , " Bo says .
" I was n't scared because I knew I could outrun my white buddy .
You 've got to think about these things , man . "
The way Bo tells it , he waited as long as he could , then he fired a slug into that bear 's skull .
The bear kept coming .
His buddy yelled , " Shoot him again ! " and Bo shot him again , firing another bullet directly into the bear 's noggin .
Bo 2 , Bear 0 .
And then
Bo skinned that bear on the spot and dragged the 70 - pound hide the half - mile back to camp .
Of course he did .
" Bring yo ' little ass on , " Bo is saying .
He is no longer speaking of the bear , nor to the reporter cowering in the passenger 's seat , nor to the photographer in the backseat who is endeavoring not to vomit , but to a small vehicle of foreign descent that has mustered the nerve to pass him on the right on a four - lane road in suburban Chicago .
Bo lives not far from here , in a pristine house in a gated community , with a long driveway where he sometimes unpacks his bow and arrows , sits in a metal folding chair and fires at a deer - shaped target set under a tree in his yard .
At the moment , Bo is on his way to a store called DGY Motorsports , where he is going to pay the balance on a four - wheeled recreational vehicle he plans to use exclusively to plow the snow from his driveway .
Ever since a snowplow broke the lights that surround his driveway , Bo prefers to plow his own snow .
It is one of those little things that , as he approaches his 45th birthday Friday , give him a disproportionate amount of pleasure .
The others include ( not necessarily in order ) golfing , cooking , hunting , motorcycle riding , and doting on his wife and three children : two sons who are already in college , and a daughter who will graduate from high school in the spring .
Ross Dettman for ESPN.com
Bo would rather talk about shooting bears than about running over the Bears .
It is a modest life , but in many ways Bo Jackson is a modest man , one who was never particularly impressed by his own achievements .
He is still intimidating , thick all over , his head shaved , his stare so pointed at times that it seems as if it could melt glass .
But he is also shockingly normal , considering that two decades ago , he was the most famous athlete in America .
Yet there are times when Bo Jackson does not come across as the least bit modest .
Some who are familiar with him say
Bo himself has been known to embellish his past .
In fact , his entire public persona was built upon a perception of omnipotence , upon a polyglottal athletic knowledge that became the basis for the most overused sports marketing catchphrase in history : Bo Knows .
That even Bo Jackson has often referred to himself as " Bo Jackson , " in the third person , as if his body were inhabited by some otherworldly force that took over when he donned a uniform , has led many to assume that both Bo Jackson and " Bo Jackson " were raving egomaniacs .
" That 's what the marketing world [ wanted ] you to believe , " Bo says .
He speaks slowly and deliberately , a cadence he adopted to neutralize perhaps the most well - documented childhood stutter in athletic history , a stutter that actually becomes more prominent in one - on - one situations than when he is speaking to groups .
Bo is perceptive enough to see through his own mythology ; the true reason he referred to himself in the third person , according to those who knew him as a young man , is that his stutter made it difficult for him to say " I . "
And yet it also became a convenient device .
That " Bo Jackson " was manufactured for public consumption , and a young man in his mid-20s who grew up in rural Alabama needed some way to separate himself from his own celebrity .
( Soon , other athletes would emulate his example . )
That " Bo Jackson " vanishes when he is at home , whether he's with his wife ( the only human in the world who refers to him as " Vince " ) or his children ( who refer to him as " Dad " ) or his childhood friends back in Bessemer , Ala .
( who , Bo jokes , often refer to him as " a - - hole " ) .
Back home , many used to mock him for his stutter until Bo -- who grew up with an iron - fisted mother and an absentee father -- discovered all he needed to erase that dark place he came from was to find some way to run hard and fast .
These days , the real - life Bo Jackson , the Bo Jackson who cooks spaghetti and washes his own dishes and watches reality TV , does n't even see a need to run around the block anymore .
Why bother when a man can play golf instead ?
Why bother when there is nothing left to prove to anyone ?
" But I also know , if I was healthy , with good hips right now , I 'd be the fastest 45 - year - old in the country , or in the world , " Bo says .
" That much I know .
That much ... I know . "
Ross Dettman for ESPN.com
In retirement ,
Bo knows his way around the kitchen .
Imagine what Nike could do with that .
THE MYTH OF BO
Of course , we willknow , and this is where every discussion of Bo Jackson most often begins and ends .
All we have are stories that , with two decades of wear , have already begun to feel like tall tales : of Bo scaling an outfield wall in pursuit of a fly ball until he is hovering sideways , seven feet off the ground ; of Bo leaving a dent in the chest of an all - pro safety named Mike Harden ; of Bo leading off the 1989 Major League Baseball All - Star Game with a home run , and then making the Pro Bowl after the 1990 NFL season .
Lonnie Major / Getty ImagesAdd
Bo's strength to his intensity and you end up with a few snapped bats .
And those are just the ones we actually have on videotape .
" We had an outdoor party at a lake after we won the county championship , " says Terry Brasseale , Bo 's baseball coach at McAdory High School .
" Bo 's just out there in water up to his waist .
All of a sudden , he jumps up , does a backflip out of the water , and lands on his feet .
I said to my girlfriend , ' Did you see that ? ' "
For those of us who came of age in the 1980s , watching Bo take on both professional baseball and professional football at the same time , the myth and the man long ago became tangled .
Bo hits a 600 - foot home run !
Bo tramples Ronnie Lott !
Bo snaps a Louisville Slugger over his knee !
Bo snaps a Louisville Slugger over his head !
Bo hits a batting - practice home run left - handed !
Bo parts a major body of water !
Bo cures lymphoma !
There have always been stories like this , passed on in a telephone game from one generation to the next -- about Babe Ruth , about Josh Gibson , about Red Grange , about Marion Motley and Jim Brown and Mickey Mantle -- and they seemed apocryphal , almost silly , in their exaggeration .
The difference , of course , was that we actually saw Bo part the Red Sea on our televisions .
We saw it with our own eyes ; even those moments that were n't televised were documented and sometimes photographed .
In 1986 , in a minor - league ballpark in Charlotte , N.C. , a young journalist named Joe Posnanski watched Jackson hit his first professional home run , and then realized Jackson had broken his bat .
" Bo 's destiny , " Posnanski would write in The Kansas City Star , more than 20 years later , " was to become a comic - book hero . "
And so it was :
Within the span of a decade , his superpowers bloomed and wilted .
He won the Heisman Trophy at Auburn , chose to play baseball instead of football , then decided he would play both football and baseball , even as every sports columnist in the country and most opposing players ( and some of his own teammates ) declared him an egomaniac with a death wish .
He was just beginning to blossom as a baseball player , and the scouts called him the greatest raw prospect since Mantle and Mays , an almost unfathomable combination of speed and power and arm strength ; although he struck out in prolific numbers , he also hit some colossal home runs and made some extraordinary plays in the outfield .
Mark Harrison / The Seattle Times and Harley Soltes / The Seattle TimesIn one of the most dominating performances in " Monday Night Football " history , Bo solidified his myth in Seattle .
His myth fully crystallized on a Monday night , on the last day of November 1987 , when Bo was a rookie running back for the Los Angeles Raiders , a two - sport athlete sharing time in the backfield with a Hall of Famer named Marcus Allen .
Bo took a handoff and Bo parted the entire Seattle defense and then Bo -- How does one even describe this method of propulsion ?
Glided ?
Propelled ?
Teleported ? -- 91 yards down the sideline , and then Bo kept on running until he disappeared into a tunnel in the bowels of Seattle 's Kingdome .
The sound of Bo running past him , former Seahawks receiver Steve Largent said , was like nothing he had ever heard before .
For a moment , Bo was gone , out of the picture entirely , prompting ABC analyst Dan Dierdorf to proclaim to a TV audience that Bo " might not stop until Tacoma . "
When
Bo emerged from that tunnel , and when he lowered his shoulder and toppled a cocky young linebacker named Brian Bosworth on a short touchdown run later that evening , and finished the night with 221 yards , nothing was ever the same .
Bo was on his way to becoming an icon , both physically and commercially , a man who could do anything he wanted on any field of play , a man who made a fortune for embodying that Nike catchphrase concocted by a copywriter in Portland , Ore. : Bo Knows .
With those two words , Bo Jackson helped usher sports into the modern age .
THE SELLING OF BO
It was a silly idea in the first place , this two - word mantra , proper noun followed by verb , and like most silly ideas , it came to Jim Riswold in the middle of the night .
But then , this was a silly business , and it was Riswold 's sense of irony that had led him here in the first place .
Already , in 1986 , working out of a rambunctious and offbeat Portland advertising firm called Wieden +
Kennedy , working for a burgeoning empire known as Nike , Riswold had brought together Michael Jordan and Spike Lee for a shoe campaign that , according to author David Halberstam , created " a figure who had the power and force and charisma of a major movie star . "
NikeThe " Bo Knows " commercial campaign turned a two - sport athlete into an icon .
Jordan was already on his way to becoming an icon in 1987 when Bo Jackson plowed over Brian Bosworth on that Monday night in Seattle .
At the same time , Nike was looking to market its new shoe , called a cross- trainer .
The company 's first choice , Riswold says , was Howie Long .
Riswold suggested there was a far better candidate on the same Raiders roster .
" I 'm always surprised by how big something as inconsequential as an advertisement can become , " Riswold says .
" People like their sports heroes , and Bo was something new .
A new shiny toy .
That was the best example of how big these things can become . "
The year before , in 1986 , Bo had been picked first in the NFL draft by Tampa Bay .
For reasons that are still not entirely clear -- a perception of racism within the Buccaneers organization , a sense of loyalty to Kansas City scout Ken Gonzales , Bo 's utter abhorrence for the conventions of football practice , Bo 's determination to accomplish what others said he could n't -- he chose to sign with the Royals instead .
Already , he was a maverick , and once he came back to football in 1987 , on his own terms , Riswold and his colleagues began toying with Bo 's image .
Bo willingly played along .
This was the ' 80s , after all , a decade suffused with vanity and objectivism , and this was a nation presided over by Ronald Reagan , a man of relentless optimism , damn the long - term consequences .
The country was " in a mood for the resurrection of old myths , " historian Haynes Johnson once wrote .
So why not , in keeping with the times , shape Bo as a modern - day Paul Bunyan ?
Beau Brummell .
Bo Derek .
Bo Schembechler .
Bo Diddley .
What an unusual name
Bo has , Riswold thought , and he began brainstorming ideas with Nike executives until that pronoun - verb combination came to him in his sleep that night .
" His career was pretty short , and it was injury - plagued , but by the time all those things changed , he was a marketing star , " sports marketing executive Nova Lanktree says .
" People were just very fond of him .
He overcame his stuttering problem .
Everything about his profile was suited to [ his becoming a cultural phenomenon ] . "
That first iconic television ad , culminating with Bo playing a horrific guitar riff and Diddley delivering the line , " Bo , you do n't know Diddley , " aired during the All - Star Game in 1989 , the game that Jackson led off with a home run ( he was later named MVP ) .
Riswold was watching in a bar in Portland , with several Nike colleagues .
When the spot came on , the entire bar fell silent .
Ross Dettman for ESPN.comWith a healthy hip ,
Bo is confident he'd have the fastest 45 - year - old legs in the country .
" I think God is a Nike fan , " Riswold muttered .
It was absurd what happened next , the way the catchphrase caught fire , the way Bo 's profile grew and mutated , until , for a short period , he was the most culturally recognizable athlete in the world , above even Jordan himself .
The ads grew more self - referential as Bo got bigger and bigger .
The '80s ended , and the '90s commenced , and Bo injured his hip , but Nike was invested in Bo by then , and America was invested in Bo as the manifestation of its outsized dreams .
Riswold began writing subversive ads that pierced the myth of Bo , and the myth of Nike ( these days , Riswold says , Nike would never permit such self - effacement ) , not to mention the commercialism and the hype and the excess of the nation itself .
In one of the last great ads , from the summer of 1991 , Bo cuts off a song - and - dance routine , declaring , " I 'm an athlete , not an actor . "
Then , in the midst of a workout , as the music cues once more , Bo breaks through the fourth wall , crying out to the Nike logo , " You know I do n't have time for this , " before George Foreman , huckster and infomercial pitchman , takes his place .
By then , of course , it was too late .
The monster Riswold had helped to create -- sports as cult of personality -- was slouching out of its cage , to be reborn over and over again .
" All the athletes today grew up with these commercials , and they want them , " Riswold says .
" But the world is more cynical , and with good reason .
It has been done before .
And the Michaels and Bos of the world do n't come around that often . "
HIDDEN BO
The woman in the produce aisle would like to know if Bo is doing autographs this afternoon .
Normally ,
Bo figures , the woman would n't have bothered to ask -- he 's almost certain he has seen her in here before , and he probably has since he comes to this same supermarket at least once a week , where today his list includes such sundries as pasta and sausage and bananas and Diet Pepsi .
But since
Bo is being trailed by a reporter and a photographer , since his private sphere is already being intruded upon anyway , he figures he will make an exception .
AP Photo / G. Paul BurnettAfter winning the 1985 Heisman Trophy , Bo reversed field and decided to pursue a pro baseball career .
Bo has never quite accepted the phenomenon of celebrity .
His private time is his private time , and he does not always take kindly to those who intrude .
Approach him at a restaurant while he is eating dinner with his family , and Bo might rebuff you with prejudice .
He has worked hard to achieve normalcy .
He has lived in the same house for 16 years , ever since he signed with the White Sox after a hip injury derailed his football career in a 1991 playoff game against Cincinnati , and the neighbors have gotten accustomed to him , even if most of them , northerners through and through , do n't comprehend his hunting fetish .
The people in the community know his family ; unlike Michael Jordan , Bo's old colleague at Nike , whose star ascended long after Bo's commercial potential was tapped , he is not compelled to live a life apart from the remainder of society .
This extended even to his family .
Bo 's daughter , Morgan , was a high school track phenomenon until she decided to quit to focus on academics ( and cheerleading ) her senior year .
Neither of his sons played college sports .
His wife , Linda , is a counseling psychologist at a local hospital , the name of which she does not want revealed here , in part , Bo says , because some of her colleagues do not know she is Bo Jackson 's spouse .
There are many people , strangers and idolaters , who have no idea Bo Jackson lives in this part of the country .
Part of him would prefer to keep it that way .
He does not hide -- if you want to find Bo , you can find Bo , and he makes occasional public appearances , such as last weekend at the Iron Bowl game between Alabama and Auburn -- but he does not keep himself on display , either .
He says he has cut off associates who have given out his cell - phone number without permission .
He was perfectly willing to allow a photographer into his house , but refused to allow the photographer to shoot any photos of his family , or even to shoot photos of the photos of his family .
His wife ,
Bo says , has not granted an interview for as long as he can remember .
He was invited at one point to be on " Dancing With the Stars , " he says , but he declined .
Bo is part owner of a food company called N'Genuity , which provides food -- mostly meat , all products
Bo has approved personally , some of which bear his name , such as the Bo Burger -- to the military and to casinos , and has provided him with a strong post - retirement income .
Recently , he partnered with another former baseball player , John Cangelosi , to break ground for a sports dome that will provide a place for young ballplayers to practice during Chicago 's frigid winters , and he has a financial interest in a local bank , as well .
" People around here , they know me , " Bo says .
" People that live here see me all the time .
I 'm quiet .
I lay low .
I think a lot of people get caught up in this celebrity world to where they have to be treated in a certain way , spoken to in a certain way , and they have to carry themselves in a certain way .
And if they do n't get their way , their world turns upside down .
With me , I 'll stop and help somebody change a car tire . "
And then Bo makes one of several statements that might be a joke .
Or , perhaps , a warning .
" If you 're my enemy , " he says , " and you 're by the side of the road with a flat tire , and it 's 20 below zero , I 'm going to stop and throw a gallon of water on you and keep going . "

Bo knows bows -- a pastime that probably keeps him from being the most approachable guy in Illinois .
YOUNG AND RECKLESS BO
Bo gets back home to Alabama a few times every year , but he does not have any great yearning to go back there for good , or to retire down South .
For every fond memory he has of Bessemer , there is a pain that lingers , because Bo Jackson grew up fatherless .
His dad , A.D. Adams , lived across town , and used to work in the steel mills , but Adams had a new wife and a new family , and rarely made an appearance except to leave a few dollars on the table .
Bo inherited his father 's enormous frame and his greatest burden ( his stutter ) , and he combatted his own insecurities by utilizing that musculature he'd been given , by lashing out at anyone who stood in his way .
He was a bully of the purest sort , " the John Gotti of my neighborhood , " he says , a character straight out of Mark Twain .
He once clubbed one of his cousins -- acousin -- with a baseball bat .
Although his mother , Florence Bond , who worked as a housekeeper at a local Ramada Inn , tried every trick she knew to tame him , whipping him with switches and extension cords , Bo would not be tamed .
John McDonough / Icon SMIBo was a comic superhero on real - life playing fields .
Bo -- his nickname is a truncation of the term , " Bo'Hog , " for a wild boar -- gained a reputation for throwing rocks with uncanny accuracy , mostly at other human beings .
He pummeled his classmates on a regular basis .
When he was a teenager , in the summer of 1976 , he and his friends began throwing rocks at pigs on their way to a local swimming hole , killing several of them .
They got caught in the act by a farmer who had hired the local barber to keep watch , and Florence Bond told the barber who caught them that she was ready to send her son to reform school .
The barber asked Bo for the names of his co-conspirators .
The way Bo tells it in his autobiography , " Bo Knows Bo , " he suddenly saw where his life was headed , and he spilled his guts .
In truth , the transformation was probably more gradual , but it seems to have begun here .
He worked all summer mowing lawns to pay back the money , and then , scared straight , he began playing organized sports , endeavoring to find his niche .
In baseball , he volunteered to be a catcher .
He wrestled at heavyweight ( " slippery as a wet catfish , " one of his coaches called him ) , and he ran track .
Later , though his mom did n't want him playing football , Bo joined the football team .
When she found out he'd done it anyway , she locked him out of the house , and left him out there all night long ;
Bo curled up in a parked car and went to sleep .
Somewhere , possibly lost by Bo's co-author on " Bo Knows Bo , " Dick Schaap , there is a videotape of Bo 's greatest hits , a videotape that includes a sequence of Bo playing lead blocker for McAdory 's other halfback :
He knocks down a defensive lineman , knocks down a linebacker , waves for his teammate to follow him , knocks down a cornerback , and escorts his teammate into the end zone .
All that was a long time ago , and most of the people of Bessemer remember
Bo fondly , as people often do when one of their own crosses the threshold of celebrity .
Some of them have been known to embellish stories about Bo , stories that do n't even need embellishing .
Given time , of course , even with the video evidence , it seems likely it will become increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction , and those who remember a healthy
Bo will remember the equivalent of his Nintendo Tecmo Super Bowl replicant , the most potent video - game running back in history , utterly unstoppable to the point of being ridiculous .
Sometimes Brasseale tells the story of when
Bo hit two towering homers in his first two at - bats in the county championship game , and then in his third at - bat , with the left fielder backed up to the fence , he hit a high fly ball to shallow left .
If he hustles , Brasseale thought , he could get a double out of this .
Soon enough , the ball dropped , and Bo was rounding third .
He scored standing up .
" I tell that to other coaches , " Brasseale says , " and they say there ai n't no way . "
Ross Dettman for ESPN.com
If you see this pickup on the roadway , you 'd better get out of the way before you get the Bosworth treatment .
UNFORGIVING BO
A few years ago , Bo made up with his father , and goes to visit him often now that A.D. is old and in ill health .
But there is something holding
Bo back from a complete reconciliation with his past .
Whenever his high school asks him for a donation , Bo declines .
All in good time , he says .
" Most of the guys I hung out with are still there , " Bo says .
" I call them institutionalized country .
That 's all they know .
I 'm not saying I 'm better than I am , but it 's not for me . "
It is not easy to let go of everything .
Bo 's entire athletic career was based upon channeling that seething childhood anger into a purpose ; his high school teammates , he wrote in " Bo Knows Bo , " did n't make it in college athletics because " they had better lives at home than I did .
It was as simple as that . "
He played games because that was his gift , because he liked to run -- he once called himself " half - human , half - deer " -- but he also hated to work at it .
Imagine if Bo had actually worked at it .
Imagine if he had actually cared about something like making the Hall of Fame , in either sport .
" Worst practice player I 've seen in my life , " Brasseale says .
" He just got bored real easily . "
Mostly ,
Bo strived to fashion an existence for himself , and for his own family , out of his gift .
He used sports , he says , to become a businessman , which might be a little bit of Bo rationalizing the sudden end to his career .
But there is truth to it , as well .
Bo 's primary goal as an adult was to exist in direct opposition to his own father .
It is nothing Bo has n't thought out before ; his wife is a psychologist , after all .
That anger remains , buried beneath the surface .
Mostly , he takes it out on the deer he kills and butchers , on the golf balls he hacks at day after day .
Brasseale says
Bo told him he would like to make a run at the senior tour when he turns 50 .
" You doubt me ? "
Bo said , when Brasseale laughed .
You want to see that anger bubble and boil ?
Go up to Bo and put your arm around him .
He hates that -- strangers touching him , strangers who want to arm - wrestle , strangers who think they know him because they saw an advertisement 20 years ago .
At one point , to demonstrate , he took my wrist in his hand and twisted , ever so gently .
It was enough .
" You 've really got to get under my skin to get me to snap , " he says .
" But if I snap , God help you . "
Ross Dettman for ESPN.comFor
Bo , contentment is spending an afternoon in the hole , working on arrows adorned in Auburn colors .
BO IN CONTROL
These days ,
Bo Jackson spends a great deal of his idle time in a room in his basement he calls " the hole . "
It is about 6 feet wide and 10 feet long , and it is adorned with hunting gear and pieces and parts , much of it unopened and hanging on hooks .
In that way , it looks like a scaled - down version of the storeroom at the Bass Pro Shop where Bo shops for arrowheads and other equipment .
Bo approaches his arrows the way an artist approaches a composition :
He paints them and pieces them together with meticulous precision , with tiny brushes and a jeweler 's touch .
An old television rests on a work table , and Bo can put his feet up and watch the Golf Channel or Animal Planet ( he says he only loosely follows the sports he once played ) , and he can work on his secret project , which is not really a secret project at all , but simply involves adding lacquer to his most recent cache of arrows .
Aggie Skirball / WireImage.com
The story of Bo Jackson will always be a tale of " what might 've been . "
But
Bo has a fanciful sense of humor , and so he tells me he 's building a time machine down here , because he would like to go back and win the lottery jackpot , ignoring the fact he has great gobs of cash on hand , and ignoring the obvious conclusion that would leap into most people 's minds -- the fact that if he built a time machine , he could go back to Jan. 13 , 1991 , to that divisional playoff game against the Bengals , when Bo took a pitch and ran right and then , instead of cutting out of bounds , cut back one last time before he was taken down from behind by a linebacker named Kevin Walker , fighting like hell all the way .
In the midst of the push and pull , Bo 's hip was yanked out of its socket .
Bo 's doctors told him if it were anyone else , his leg would have snapped like a dry twig -- the irony being that a broken leg would have healed within months .
Even after surgery , the hip would never be the same ( though it is perfectly functional today , since Bo no longer runs ) .
" ... the gods of sports decided to punish
Bo because he came too close to them , had reached the brink of being a god himself , " Schaap speculated in a postscript to " Bo Knows Bo . "
Bo has always said , and maintains today , he did n't realize the severity of his injury at the time .
Perhaps he just assumed , with the body he'd been given , that no mortal could rend it .
But there is something horrible and wrenching in Bo 's expression in the aftermath of that game , captured in a series of photos of Bo sitting on the bench afterward with his two young sons -- photos he keeps , unframed , on the floor behind a filing cabinet in his office , near an autographed picture of Chuck Yeager , the uber - test pilot who is Bo 's only hero .
Bo 's expression in the pictures reflects an emotion he is either unwilling or unable to recognize .
" Sports has never been the main focus in my life , " Bo insists , staring at those photos .
" Dreams of the Hall of Fame never entered my mind when I was playing .
The thoughts I had in my mind were of being a businessman .
When I did those Nike commercials , I was broadening my horizon , so when the day came , I could get my foot in a lot of doors that you probably could n't . "
Maybe
Bo could have avoided this hit , and maybe he could have avoided all of these What if ?
questions , if he 'd listened to the skeptics and made up his mind and chosen one path or the other .
As the myth grew , as Nike depended upon
Bo to be ambidextrous , that choice came with more weight ; still , Jackson says he had all but decided that 1991 would be his last season playing football .
By then , he was an athlete and an actor -- he would later play a prison guard in " The Chamber , " a surprisingly strong performance in an otherwise mediocre John Grisham adaptation ( he caught some of it on cable this morning , in fact ) .
Al Messerschmidt / WireImage.com
After injuring his hip in his final NFL game , Bo enjoyed a sideline moment with his two sons .
Safe within his kitchen , Bo has just prepared lunch for his guests , and now he is washing the dishes .
He does them by hand .
He did n't have a dishwasher when he was a kid ; he does n't see the need for it now .
He lives on his own terms :
He has been obsessed with flying since watching the planes take off and land from the community airport near his home in Bessemer .
The bird feeder in his backyard is almost always filled to the top , so the birds will never think Bo has abandoned them .
" I know how to feed guys like you with a long - handled spoon , " Bo says , before driving me back to my hotel .
" I never let you get too close .
I tell you what I want you to know , and I tell you what you want to hear . "
In the obscenely muscled pickup , with the hunting equipment and a nauseated photographer squeezed into the backseat , Bo flips a wave at the guard , passes through the gates and then pokes his nose out into the world .
He has been telling stories about his past for several hours now , and although he does n't seem to mind -- he appears to relish the way he has been able to condense his experiences into parables -- he ran away from that Bo Jackson long ago , ran unwittingly out of a sour childhood and into a peculiar life as a demigod , as a myth , as the last comic - book hero we will ever see .
And then he did n't stop running until he found himself a place behind those gates .
When his wife calls ,
Bo tells her he 'll be home soon enough .
He 's not staying out here any longer than he has to .

IF you ’re going to join the cult of the cocktail , then you ought to familiarize yourself with the rules .
No more than four people in a group ( this applies to celebrities too ) .
No standing .
No loud talking .
No cellphones .
Gentlemen , do n’t approach the ladies -- and do n’t forget to take off your hats .
No name - dropping -- that ’s tough in this town .
And please ( sometimes this one ’s unwritten ) do not commit the faux pas of ordering vodka , especially vodka and cranberry juice .
The age of the cocktail parlor -- the modern speak - easy -- is here , and patrons are requested , nay , required , to behave accordingly .
Bartenders are going to the trouble of making their own bitters , sourcing obscure vermouths , hand - chipping ice , precision - stirring and wearing dapper vests , and in return , they ’re asking that their customers show some manners , in appreciation of a great cocktail .
To enforce etiquette , they ’ve made rules .
And these rules , more and more common in New York , are starting to show up in Los Angeles .
Why demand the best behavior ?
Because in the midst of a coast - to - coast cocktail renaissance , the focus -- as some see it -- is not on getting drunk and rowdy but on the drinks themselves .
These bars are like civilized restaurants of drink .
You might be asked to remove your baseball hat .
Especially if you ’re about to sip an Elder Fashion cocktail ( Plymouth gin , St - Germain elderflower liqueur and a dash of orange bitters with a grapefruit twist ) or an Air Mail ( Champagne , Santa Teresa 1776 rum , honey and fresh lime juice ) at Death & Co. , in New York ’s East Village .
Or you might be told politely to keep it down at Sasha Petraske ’s New York cocktail sanctum Milk & Honey , so that someone else can contemplate her Rome With a View ( dry vermouth , Campari , fresh lime juice and a little sugar , shaken , and topped with club soda ) .
There are rules even in L.A. now , written or assumed .
Cedd Moses ’ new members - only bar , the Doheny , is set to open in December , complete with a list of house rules .
“ The house rules are inspired by the house rules in London and New York bars and private clubs , but modified for Angelenos , ” said Moses , owner of downtown watering holes such as Seven Grand and Golden Gopher .
“ It will be posted at our entrance and let people know that it is a serious cocktail spot and not a sports bar . ”
Most sports bars do n’t have a $ 2,175 initiation fee either .
Vincenzo Marianella of Providence is creating the cocktail menu ( and Neal Fraser of Grace the small - plates menu ) .
‘ I like policies ’
SOME of those rules are : “ Absolutely no cellphone / BlackBerry use inside .
Please use our porte cochere .
. . .
No brown - nosing .
. . . Red Bull ?
Do n’t even think of ordering it here .
. . .
No screaming -- unless Lakers win the finals . ”
“ I like policies , ” said Sang Yoon , who is opening a second Father ’s Office , in Culver City , planned for December .
“ It gives us choices ; ‘ that place is for me , that place is n’t . ’ ” And for bar owners , it ’s saying , ‘ Here ’s who we are , and here ’s who we want our customers to be . ’
You ca n’t say , ‘ No schmucks . ’ ”
At SBE Entertainment Group ’s new Philippe Starck - designed S - Bar in Hollywood , there are n’t any rules per se , but the “ schmucks ” might be discouraged not only by the doorman and velvet ropes but also by the price of a cocktail -- $ 20 for an Imperial Prince of Wales ( Cognac , Benedictine , angostura bitters and brut Champagne ) or $ 19 for a horseradish and pomegranate margarita .
“ You ca n’t do it with pricing , ” Yoon said .
“ You get rich schmucks . ”
Yoon has rules , but they ’re not written anywhere .
“ The way I set rules is by not offering certain choices , ” he said .
“ You rid yourself of pitchers of beer , or light beer .
No beer from a bottle . ”
And no vodka .
You wo n’t find any on his cocktail menu at the new Father ’s Office , where you ’ll drink what Yoon wants you to drink .
You ’ll have a choice , but only among four classic cocktails ( Manhattan , Sidecar , classic gin martini , Negroni ) plus a seasonal cocktail ( say , white grapefruit juice with gin , rimmed with fleur de sel ) -- and a couple of secret ones .
“ I do n’t like vodka , ” Yoon said .
“ It has little to no character , and most people abuse it by covering up what little character there is . ”
“ But we ’re a bar ; there ’s no kids , ” he said .
“ I ’m not going to tell them not to pass notes , or no chewing gum . ”
If he wo n’t , others will .
“ We ’ve been known to ask people to spit out their chewing gum , ” said Death & Co. co-founder David Kaplan .
Chewing gum “ is like a slap in the face after all the hard work ” on the part of the bartender .
The written rules are no baseball hats , no cellphones and no flash photography .
And just as at Milk & Honey and PDT , there ’s no standing .
“ I do n’t know why more bars do n’t do this , ” Kaplan said .
“ We do n’t overcrowd the place , it really enhances the experience for people , and the bottom line does n’t suffer . ”
“ The key thing to note in the ‘ rules ’ going round is that they typically stem from one of two thoughts , ” Kaplan said .
“ Rules for rules ’ sake because speak - easies had them and speak - easies are in vogue or simple guidelines of etiquette to ensure that everyone has a great experience and leaves their worries and woes behind them -- or at least outside . ”
‘ No hooting , hollering ’
THE rules at cocktail lounge Angel ’s Share in New York ’s East Village used to be something of a novelty .
But the sign next to the door was no joke : “ Attention !
No more than 4 people .
No standing .
No screaming no shouting .
Thank you for your cooperation .
Enjoy your quality time . ”
The list of rules was short , but strictly enforced by Japanese bartenders with accurate , pomade - enhanced haircuts who rarely cracked a smile and had a way with a shaker .
Then Petraske opened renowned reservations - only Milk & Honey , where the house rules posted in the restroom are twice as long and include : “ No name - dropping .
No hooting , hollering , shouting or other loud behaviour .
Gentlemen will remove their hats .
Gentlemen will not introduce themselves to ladies . ”
The rules are the same at the New York and London locations , and they ’re similar at Petraske ’s Little Branch in the West Village .
Others followed suit , with a sort of formula : Sophisticated cocktails plus intimate setting plus semi -" secret ” location plus a sense of decorum bolstered by house rules equal “ an experience that brings people into a separate world , ” as described by Kaplan of Death & Co. , which opened in January .
Nearby PDT ( as in Please Don’t Tell ) opened in the spring .
The current PDT cocktail menu is four pages long .
On it , you ’ll find smart cocktails such as the Vieux Mot ( Plymouth gin , St - Germain , lemon juice and a little simple syrup ) or a classic Martinez ( Beefeater gin , sweet vermouth , Luxardo maraschino liqueur and orange bitters ) .
The “ Tavern Etiquette ” includes : “ Keep the volume of your conversations to a reasonable level .
Smoking and cell phones are prohibited in the bar ; kindly use the back patio to use the phone or smoke .
No game playing ( yes , that means you ca n’t play Scrabble while you ’re drinking or shoot craps on the patio ) .
Do not interrupt other guests ; if you came here to hit on strangers , you ’re in the wrong place . ”
Those who have been steeped in the ways of Milk & Honey are spreading the cult - of - the - cocktail attitude .
“ Everything we do is a throwback to the early 20th century , ” said bartender Sam Ross of Milk & Honey and Little Branch in New York , who was in L.A. recently to set up the bar program at new restaurant Comme Ça in West Hollywood ( priority No. 1 was to use as little vodka as possible ) .
“ The bartenders are inspired to bar - tend at a different level , ” Ross said .
“ It ’s not pulling beers and getting tips .
We ’re seen as a draw for the place .
We expect you to share the same opinion about drinking as we do .
We do n’t drink to get drunk , we drink to enjoy alcohol . ”
The drinks at Comme Ça are pretty rarefied -- there are four house cocktails , some with hunks of crystal - clear , hand - cracked ice , others sprayed with Scotch vapor -- along with a “ dealer ’s choice ” ( you choose the spirit , they come up with a cocktail ) .
Comme Ça may be a restaurant , but it ’s so noisy and packed , it feels like a raucous bar .
It ’s a little hard to give your Penicillin your full attention .
( Maybe they could use some rules ? )
Cocktail consultant Ryan Magarian of Liquid Relations created the cocktail menu at S - Bar ; he happens to employ two Milk & Honey veterans .
“ I aspire to that level of precision and attention to detail , ” Magarian said .
“ You ’re engaged by the server .
Your drink is stingingly cold and perfectly balanced .
You ’re pondering over this drink .
. . . ”
Does it feel like a shrine to the perfect cocktail ?
Maybe not .
“ On a Friday night in Hollywood , ” he said , “ it ’s going to be what it is .
People are there to drink . ”
The rules have some entertainment value , and most are common sense , said PDT bar manager John Deragon .
“ Unfortunately , sometimes you have to relay what common sense is to some people . ”
“ It ’s great to be sitting at a table in a bar and not have somebody ’s butt in your face , ” said Rosalie Knox , who recently was sipping on a frothy Pisco sour served in a coupe at PDT .
“ But I take issue with all the oxford shirts in here , ” said one of her companions , Patterson Beckwith , who was wearing an oxford shirt but , notably , not khaki pants .
No exceptions
AND do n’t expect special treatment even if you ’re a celebrity .
Some rules are n’t meant to be broken , and Bill Murray recently found out the hard way .
On a Friday night last month at Angel ’s Share , a sweater - vested , slightly rumpled Murray entered the bar with five others .
He looked at the framed list of rules ( “ No more than 4 people ” ) and was skeptical about getting a seat .
But a woman from his party asked a bartender for a table anyway ; she was turned down .
Murray himself approached the bartender .
No luck .
“ We do n’t make special exceptions for anyone , ” said Shingo Gokan , bartender / venenciador ( as his card says ) .
“ Our rule is no more than four people . ”
But people seem to love the rules , at least as souvenirs , so much so that the framed “ Tavern Etiquette ” in the restroom at PDT recently was pulled off the wall .
At Milk & Honey and Little Branch , copies of the rules are available upon request , to discourage the same thing from happening .
Maybe that should be a new rule -- no removing the rules .

The following paragraphs give an informal description of lambda calculus — a formal description of lambda calculus is also available .
A function in lambda calculus is wriiten in the form λx.E , where x is the function ’s parameter and E is a lambda expression constituting the function body .
A lambda expression is either a variable ( like the x in the above expression ) , a function in the form above , or an application E 1 E 2 .
In the expression λx.E , any occurance of x in E is bound , while any other variable is free ( unless bound by another lambda expression , like the y in λx.λy.xy ) .
A pure lambda expression has no free variables .
Three things can be done with lambda expressions :
α conversion Alpha conversion renames a bound variable — λx.x can be alpha converted to λy.y. β reduction Beta reduction allows applications to be reduced — ( λx.E 1 ) E 2 can be beta reduced to E 1 with all occurances of x replaced with E 2 .
If there are name clashes ( for example in ( λx.λy.xy ) y ) , alpha conversion may be required first .
η conversion Eta conversion allows us to say that f and λx.fx are equivalent .
A lambda expression is in normal form if no sub-expression can be reduced .
A lambda expression is in head normal form if the outermost application cannot be reduced .
Some expressions do not have a normal form as reduction never terminates .
Lambda calculus has the Church - Rosser property , so that if two methods of reduction lead to two normal forms , they can differ only by alpha conversion .
Two lambda expressions are equivalent if they can be beta reduced to the same expresion , subject to alpha conversion .
Two lambda expressions are extensionally equivalent if they can be beta reduced and eta converted to the same expression , subject to alpha conversion .
Two shorthand notations are used :

TRY this next time you are strolling on a cliff .
Toss a rock ( the size of a blood orange is good ) over the edge and begin to count .
It falls at the speed of a tumbling human so will reach 200 km per hour after nine seconds , roughly the acceleration of a supercar .
Keep counting .
If the cliff is sheer and tall , like the more dramatic ones above a Norwegian fjord , you should be able to tick off many seconds before hearing a distant crack .
That is how long you might fly , unaided , before your soft flesh is mangled on the granite below .
Next , get ready to hop off .
You will probably be terrified , which is a shame , for fear interferes with perception .
Tunnel vision blocks the smell of moss on the cliffside , the tinkling of a waterfall halfway down .
But the adrenalin rush , legs hollow and wobbly , ensures it is a memorable experience .
“ That second before you step off is the best .
Everything is quiet , you step into emptiness , ” says Karina Hollekim who , after more than 400 flying leaps , is emerging as a star of increasingly popular films about falling off high objects .
Now go over .
A Superman pose ( keep your stomach in ) is the standard method , some 45° forward , so that in the first five or six seconds you become horizontal .
The more daring go head first to get up speed .
At first you hardly feel the motion .
There is no sound ( screams aside ) ; not even the rustling of wind in your clothes .
You may feel you are hanging , frozen , in mid-air .
“ When I first jumped it seemed I would n't move , or fly , at all .
For those first seconds I thought it was not working , ” recalls Stein Edvardsen , a pioneering Norwegian jumper who has been at it for more than a decade .
“ It felt like an eternity as Mother Earth was pulling me down , ” he says .
Butterflies are unlikely — it is not like hitting turbulence in a plane — because your stomach falls at the same speed as the rest of you , but you feel weightless and time slows .
Then , after six seconds , there is friction .
“ To get an idea of what it feels like , put your hand out of the window of the car when you are driving at 150 km per hour , ” suggests Mr Edvardsen .
So far you have been falling ; now you are ready to fly .
Being close to the wall makes it especially satisfying .
Ms Hollekim likes spotting startled birds that nest in cracks in the rock or , jumping from skyscrapers , to study roofs of smaller buildings as they rise up .
At this speed the human body may curve away from the cliff .
At a popular spot in Norway , Kjerag near Stavanger in the west , you have 16 seconds of freefall in which to swoop around , some of it just ten metres from the rock face .
In Trollveggen ( Troll Wall ) , an even more dramatic drop in the middle of the country , you may plummet for a long half minute , allowing time for backflips , somersaults , or hurtling side by side with a friend .
Then , sometimes as late as a second or two before impact , you should find the cord to deploy your parachute .
You need both time and speed for the chute to prove useful , however .
Pulling the cord too late is one of the easier ways to kill yourself .
Falling too slowly — if you have made the mistake of leaping from something near the ground , like a church tower — could be fatal , too , as the parachute may fail to open fully .
Panos
To prolong the flight some have turned to fancy dress .
Wingsuits , which have flaps between the limbs , look ridiculous but allow cliff - jumpers to float in the air for minutes at a time , changing direction at will .
Oyvind Lokerberg in Trondheim is one of a group of ten local men who test the dynamics of flying from mountains in wingsuits .
The goal is to get up as much speed as possible , giving the flyer more control .
“ Today you can reach 350 km per hour in almost a head - on dive , then when you pull up into the horizontal you can be moving at about 230 km per hour , ” he says .
The perfect suit covers the smallest area possible while still giving decent lift ( the worst are about as effective as clinging to a mattress ) .
The current fashion seems to be a suit that looks like a bat or a flying fox ( see left ) .
Mr Lokerberg and his colleagues refine their designs in wind tunnels then try them out on mountains .
Eventually , thinks Ms Hollekim , someone will try to land in a wingsuit , without using a parachute .
Mr Lokerberg , laughing , is sceptical : “ Remember one day Newton [ or rather his law of gravity ] is going to come and get you . ”
A flight in a wingsuit alone would demand an extremely soft spot — a hillside covered in deep powdered snow , for instance — to land in .
Until then enthusiasts seek new thrills by finding new places to fall from —
“ You get tired of jumping off the same cliff every day , ” says Mr Edvardsen — or by trying more convoluted acrobatics on the way down .
Ms Hollekim grew fond of throwing herself off mountains while on skis .
The weight of the equipment makes it much harder to keep upright in the air and skis stop you looking over the edge before you leap .
Now , after 25 efforts , she thinks ski-basing is a bit too risky .
Gripping videos on YouTube show others sledging off mountain tops , cartwheeling over the edge and dancing their way into the abyss .
This weird sport is known as base - jumping : the name refers to the four things that can be leapt from — buildings , antennae , spans ( bridges ) and earth ( cliffs ) .
It is increasingly popular .
In America enthusiasts make an annual pilgrimage to El Capitan , a cliff in Yosemite National Park which was the site of the first such jump , in 1966 .
Those keen on leaping from tall buildings flock to cities in Asia .
Kuala Lumpur hosts an annual world championship .
But Norway , well - supplied with fjords and cliffs , remains the sport 's spiritual home .
Carl Boenish , the American who named it , died jumping off Trollveggen in 1984 ; Thor Axel Kappfjell ( pictured top ) , another base - jumping hero , died jumping off Kjerag in 1999 .
Parachutes open too late or squalls of wind send a jumper into a cliff .
The unluckiest have crashed onto a ledge and died slowly from exposure
Norwegians are an outdoors sort of people , and all that nature “ invites you to use it ” says Ms Hollekim .
Jumpers are supposed to be experienced sky - divers before leaping from land .
In practice not everyone is .
The kit ( an appropriate parachute and a good pair of boots ) is about $ 2,500 new , and some jumpers cut costs by buying second - hand .
Malfunctions are often deadly .
As there is no time to deploy a second parachute nobody carries a spare .
Organised events seem pretty safe : this summer at Kjerag , for example , saw 2,500 jumps completed with only a broken ankle to show for it .
But fatal accidents are hardly uncommon .
Jumping off Trollveggen was banned after 11 accidents and four deaths in the space of 280 jumps in the early 1980s .
An experienced Australian was killed in August in north - west Norway when his parachute failed .
A list online details 120 jumpers killed at the latest count .
The cause of death is usually described as “ impact ” , although drowning has claimed a few lives .
Parachutes open too late or squalls of wind send a jumper into a cliff .
The unluckiest crash onto a ledge and die slowly from exposure .
But without the risk , it would n't be fun .
Despite appearances it does not seem to attract the mad or suicidal .
Jumpers have to be meticulous about their gear , and many seem as attracted by the outdoor life as by the adrenalin .
The enthusiastic Ms Hollekim is thrilled to be alive and walking .
She limps off to her latest movie premiere in London after describing how an entangled parachute nearly killed her in 2006 .
She hit rocks at more than 100 km per hour .
Her legs were pulped , fractured in 25 places , and she lost 3.5 litres of blood .
She spent four months in hospital , underwent 15 operations , narrowly avoided amputation , and endured nine months in rehabilitation .
The pain , she says , was unbelievable .
But jumping off cliffs has been the most powerful experience of her life and she regrets none of it .
“ It forces you to feel .
Extreme fear , then relief , then happiness .
In my everyday life I do n't feel that much .
But , in the air , it 's like being in love . ”
Jammie Thomas , who owes record labels $ 222 K after being found guilty of sharing 24 songs over the Kazaa file sharing network , says she had nothing to do with the decision to replace her hard drive , which could not be admitted as evidence , having fallen out of her possession .
Some speculated during the trial that she had disposed of the hard drive intentionally , in order to foil part of the RIAA 's investigation .
Apparently , though , her child broke the computer in frustration after a videogame froze up .
She says Best Buy replaced its hard drive ( under warranty ) on its own recognizance , and not , as some suggested , because she was trying to hide something .
Thomas claims to have purchased over 240 CDs in her life – mostly while she herself worked at Best Buy during college – so itstands to reason that she would understand the store 's repair policy .
From her accountof the lawsuit on p2pnet ,
I brought my computer into Best Buy for repairs on March 7 , 2005 .
Remember , I brought it in for repairs under the extended warranty , notto have the hard drive replaced .
And if anyone who has used a largechain electronic store to repair their electrical equipment knows ,
these companies do not replace hard drives on the whim of the customer if they have to pay for the hard drive replacement covered underwarranty .
They try to do whatever is cheaper for the company , whichnormally means fixing the issues with the hard drive .
With my harddrive , the issues could n't be fixed so Best Buy , not me but Best Buy ,
made the decision to replace the hard drive .
Thomas also said she wishes she 'd used a " spoofing " defense ( claimingthat someone else using Kazaa had been faking her IP address ) , andregrets not having been able to afford to pay the expert witness who inspected her computer ; as a result , he never testified .
Considering hindsight is always 20 / 20 , I can look back now and seemany things I could have or should have done differently .
I could havesettled before I was even sued .
I could have settled many times beforethe case went to trial .
I could have worked harder to find a way toafford the things I needed at trial .
But I refuse to live liferegretting could haves or would have or should haves .
The one piece of advice I can give to anyone who finds themselvesbeing sued or threatened to be sued by the RIAA is to fight back .
The more people fight back against these cases , the more expensive itwill be for the RIAA to bring these suits and the less resources theRIAA will have to use against others .
As things stand now , Thomas owes the labels $ 222 K , but her lawyer hasfiled a motion to have the verdict thrown out or the judgmentreduced .

A Pale Blue Dot
Preface :
On October 13 , 1994 , the famous astronomer Carl Sagan was delivering a public lecture at his own university of Cornell .
During that lecture , he presented this photo :
The photo above was taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as it sailed away from Earth , more than 4 billion miles in the distance .
Having completed its primary mission , Voyager at that time was on its way out of the Solar System , on a trajectory of approximately 32 degrees above the plane of the Solar System .
Ground Control issued a command that directed the distant space craft to turn around and , looking back , take photos of each of the planets it had visited .
From Voyager 's vast distance , the Earth was captured as a infinitesimal point of light ( between the two white tick marks in the image above ) , actually smaller than a single pixel of the photo .
The image was taken with a narrow angle camera lens , with the Sun quite close to the field of view .
Quite by accident , the Earth was captured in one of the scattered light rays caused by taking the image at an angle so close to the Sun.
Dr. Sagan was quite moved by this image of our tiny world .
Here is an enlargement of the area around our Pale Blue Dot and an excerpt from the late Dr. Sagan 's talk :
" We succeeded in taking that picture [ from deep space ] , and , if you look at it , you see a dot .
That 's here .
That 's home .
That 's us .
On it , everyone you ever heard of , every human being who ever lived , lived out their lives .
The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings , thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilizations , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every hopeful child , every mother and father , every inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam .
The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena .
Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot .
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot .
How frequent their misunderstandings , how eager they are to kill one another , how fervent their hatreds .
Our posturings , our imagined self - importance , the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe , are challenged by this point of pale light .
Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark .
In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves .
It is up to us .
It 's been said that astronomy is a humbling , and I might add , a character - building experience .
To my mind , there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world .
To me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot , the only home we 've ever known . "

The trial in July was held at Cardiff Crown Court in July
The victim , now aged 17 , suffered burns to more than 20 % of his body .
He told Cardiff Crown Court his mother called him to the kitchen and said " I 'm sorry I 've got to do this " .
The 36 - year - old woman insisted the incident was an accident and admitted lying at the time because she feared her son would be taken into care .
The judge at Cardiff Crown Court told the 36 - year - old , who cannot be named , that she had " failed her first and greatest responsibility as a parent " .
Judge Phillip Richards added the mother had become " the danger " to her son .
" The first and greatest responsibility of a parent is to protect his or her child from danger , " he said .
" You not only failed to do that but you became the danger and you caused your son horrific injuries . "
You entirely lost your patience with your son and carried out this appalling act of pouring boiling water over him
Judge Phillip Richards
The victim had told the court that he was still full of rage over his mother 's actions and wanted to make her pay .
He said he did not tell anybody about the incident until the autumn of 2004 , because she had told him she would kill herself if he did .
The teenager said that on the day he was injured his mother had told him his father did not want to see him and did not love him .
" She called me out the kitchen and said ' Sorry I 've got to do this ' and tips the kettle over my chest , " he told the court .
' Appalling act '
" She said , ' now your effing father will come and see you ' . "
Before sentencing , Judge Richards was told that the mother , from Cardiff , had been before the court on five previous occasion for a total of 13 offences involving dishonesty .
He told her : " There is no punishment that I can impose which will be as dreadful as the punishment you gave to your young son .
" You built up a resentment for your position as being left as a single parent .
" Your son 's father did not turn up that day as intended and over the course of the day your resentment drove you to behave in a way in a way no mother should .
" You entirely lost your patience with your son and carried out this appalling act of pouring boiling water over him .
" You punished your child for wrongs you believed have been done to you by your former partner . "
The mother claimed she had boiled the kettle to pour on an ants ' nest at her kitchen door and had spilled the water after bumping into him .
She told the court she would never hurt her son to get back at his father .
The pain was constant , all day , every day sitting there , crying because of the pain , it would never go away
name here
But the jury rejected the explanation and delivered a unanimous guilty verdict of grievous bodily harm with intent in July .
After the verdict , an impact statement was read out in court by prosecuting barrister Michael Mather - Lees .
It explained how the incident had affected the victim 's life and how he had even contemplated suicide .
" I can't even begin to explain the pain I felt when this happened to me as a young innocent child , " the statement said .
" My memories are of the burning feeling , the pain on a scale of 10 was 10 .
" The pain was constant , all day , every day sitting there , crying because of the pain , it would never go away .
" I have memories of my mother telling me she would kill herself if I ever told the truth and this made me feel scared that if she did kill herself it would be my fault .
" My mother made me feel like a bad person .
She would batter me and I would be too scared to say , " it added .
The teenager also described how unwilling he was to was to show his body and wore clothes to hide his scars .
" I got my burns for nothing .
I do n't deserve to have these scars - I have been punished for nothing - because one woman never loved her son , " he said .
Erik Naggum is of course famous for his strong views about the Right Way™ to do things .
In this post , he waxes lyrical on object orientation as seen through CLOS ( via Raganwald ) .
Reading the post I can smell dogma , and if there 's one thing I dislike in any discussion about programming technique it is dogma .
Let 's look at just one point he makes .
There are two real approaches to object - orientation .
The first is known as message - passing . …
The second approach is generic functions .
The discontinuous mind strikes again .
This is a good way to characterise the opposite poles of two ways of looking at object oriented systems .
They 're not good places to try to shoehorn all sorts of different OO systems into .
Poles are useful because they illuminate our understanding by showing extremes that we can use to measure other things by .
They are not useful if we insist of thinking of everything we encounter as being at one or the other extreme .
Clearly Erik 's preference is for generic functions , for which he describes many details whilst completely forgetting to describe the most important one :
The search algorithm used to order the generic function implementations so that the right bit of code gets executed .
Let 's look at where thinking about it leads us .
CLOS has a pretty clever algorithm that looks up the dynamic type of all of the arguments within the context of a given identifier ( the function name ) .
All of this executes at run time , although the concept of “ run time ” in an image based system might not be what you expect .
C++ and Java do things a little differently .
They search based on the called function identifier , the dynamic type of the first argument , the static type of the other arguments and , maybe surprisingly , the static type of the object variable .
This allows a large part of the search algorithm to be run by the compiler before the program is ever executed .
Maybe this will make it easier to follow .
The search uses StaticTypeOfVariable , StaticTypeOfArgument1 , StaticTypeOfArgument2 and function_identifier at compile time and DynamicTypeOfVariable at run time :
StaticTypeOfVariable my_var = new DynamicTypeOfVariable ( ) ; StaticTypeOfArgument1 argument_1 = ... StaticTypeOfArgument2 argument_2 = ... my_var.function_identifier ( argument_1 , argument_2 ) ;
Smalltalk takes things in a different direction .
Functions do n't have names , but the arguments do .
The identifier name that is to be searched for is the concatenation of all the argument names and what is searched is the dynamic type of the receiver ( actually its class definition and that of all of its super - classes ) .
This has to execute in its entirety during run time , except for the case where there is only a single definition of a method when an optimisation could be made .
This uses searches for namePart1 :namePart2 : within the type of the object returned by MetaObjectInstance new :
object := MetaObjectInstance new . object namePart1 : arg1 namePart2 : arg2 .
In JavaScript there are n't even classes .
The identifier that is searched on is only the function name and the receiver itself is searched ( because although it has a type , it does n't have a class ) .
So in JavaScript my_object is searched for a_function , but as the object is just an associative array a number of odd things are also true :
var my_object = new Something ( ) ; my_object.a_function ( literally , anything , it , doesnt , matter ) ; my_object [ " a_function " ] ( strangely , executes , the , same , code ) ;
Erlang has a different twist .
There is no search algorithm at all !
At least not at the language level .
The message receiver is itself responsible for what it does and has a very clever switch syntax through which it can examine various parts of the message to decide what to do .
an_object ( ) -> receive message1 -> ... message2 -> ... end
So , the differences between generic functions and message passing can all be explained by differences in the search functions used to go from a name and some arguments to a bit of code to execute .
Once you understand that it all hinges on just this search algorithm it opens up the understanding and possibility that we can write our own to match what we want a system to do .
I think this is a far more mind blowing than any single thing to do with generic functions .
P.S. I presume that the Peter Seibel he is replying to is this one .

Death and What Comes Next A Discworld short story
By Terry Pratchett Copyright © Terry Pratchett 2002
When Death met the philosopher , the philosopher said , rather excitedly : " At this point , you realise , I 'm both dead and not dead . "
There was a sigh from Death .
Oh dear , one of those , he thought .
This is going to be about quantum again .
He hated dealing with philosophers .
They always tried to wriggle out of it .
" You see , " said the philosopher , while Death , motionless , watched the sands of his life drain through the hourglass , " everything is made of tiny particles , which have the strange property of being in many places at one time .
But things made of tiny particles tend to stay in one place at one time , which does not seem right according to quantum theory .
May I continue ? "
YES , BUT NOT INDEFINITELY , said Death , EVERYTHING IS TRANSIENT .
He did not take his gaze away from the tumbling sand .
" Well , then , if we agreed that there are an infinite number of universes , then the problem is solved !
If there are an unlimited number of universes , this bed can be in millions of them , all at the same time ! "
DOES IT MOVE ?
" What ?
Death nodded at the bed .
CAN YOU FEEL IT MOVING ?
he said .
" No , because there are a million versions of me , too , And ... here is the good bit ... in some of them I am not about to pass away !
Anything is possible ! "
Death tapped the handle of his scythe as he considered this .
AND YOUR POINT IS ...?
" Well , I 'm not exactly dying , correct ?
You are no longer such a certainty . "
There was a sigh from Death .
Space he thought .
That was the trouble .
It was never like this on worlds with everlastingly cloudy skies .
But once humans saw all that space , their brains expanded to try and fill it up .
" No answer , eh ? " said the dying philosopher .
" Feel a bit old - fashioned , do we ? "
THIS IS A CONUNDRUM CERTAINLY , said Death .
Once they prayed , he thought .
Mind you , he'd never been sure that prayer worked , either .
He thought for a while .
AND I SHALL ANSWER IT IN THIS MANNER , he added .
YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE ?
" What ? "
THE LADY WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING AFTER YOU .
YOU LOVE HER ?
" Yes .
Of course . "
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE , WITHOUT YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY CHANGING IN ANY WAY YOU WOULD AT THIS MOMENT PICK UP A KNIFE AND STAB HER ? said Death .
FOR EXAMPLE ?
" Certainly not ! "
BUT YOUR THEORY SAYS THAT YOU MUST .
IT IS EASILY POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PHYSICAL LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE , AND THEREFORE MUST HAPPEN , AND HAPPEN MANY TIMES .
EVERY MOMENT IS A BILLION , BILLION MOMENTS , AND IN THOSE MOMENTS ALL THINGS THAT ARE POSSIBLE ARE INEVITABLE .
ALL TIME SOONER OR LATER , BOILS DOWN TO A MOMENT .
" But of course we can make choices between - "
ARE THERE CHOICES ?
EVERYTHING THAT CAN HAPPEN , MUST HAPPEN .
YOUR THEORY SAYS THAT FOR EVERY UNIVERSE THAT'S FORMED TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR 'NO ' , THERE MUST BE ONE TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR ' YES ' .
BUT YOU SAID YOU WOULD NEVER COMMIT MURDER .
THE FABRIC OF THE COSMOS TREMBLES BEFORE YOUR TERRIBLE CERTAINTY .
YOUR MORALITY BECOMES A FORCE AS STRONG AS GRAVITY .
And , thought Death , space certainly has a lot to answer for .
" Was that sarcasm ? "
ACTUALLY , NO .
I AM IMPRESSED AND INTRIGUED , said Death .
THE CONCEPT YOU PUT BEFORE ME PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF TWO HITHERTO MYTHICAL PLACES .
SOMEWHERE , THERE IS A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE , THE MORAL CHOICE , THE CHOICE THAT MAXIMISED THE HAPPINESS OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES , OF COURSE , THAT ALSO MEANS THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE IS THE SMOKING REMNANT OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY DID NOT ...
" Oh , come on !
I know what you 're implying , and I 've never believed in any of that Heaven and Hell nonsense ! "
The room was growing darker .
The blue gleam along the edge of the reaper 's scythe was becoming more obvious .
ASTONISHING , said Death .
REALLY ASTONISHING .
LET ME PUT FORWARD ANOTHER SUGGESTION : THAT YOU ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A LUCKY SPECIES OF APE THAT IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF CREATION VIA A LANGUAGE THAT EVOLVED IN ORDER TO TELL ONE ANOTHER WHERE THE RIPE FRUIT WAS ?
Fighting for breath , the philosopher managed to say : " Do n't be silly . "
THE REMARK WAS NOT INTENDED AS DEROGATORY , said Death .
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES , YOU HAVE ACHIEVED A GREAT DEAL .
" We 've certainly escaped from outmoded superstitions ! "
WELL DONE , said Death .
THAT'S THE SPIRIT .
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK .
He leaned forward .
AND ARE YOU AWARE OF THE THEORY THAT THE STATE OF SOME TINY PARTICLES IS INDETERMINATE UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY ARE OBSERVED ?
A CAT IN A BOX IS OFTEN MENTIONED .
" Oh , yes , " said the philosopher .
GOOD , said Death .
He got to his feet as the last of the light died , and smiled .
I SEE YOU ...

Last month in an item about working with crime data I asked :
Will there be a role for IronPython ( or IronRuby ) here , someday , such that you could use these languages inside Excel ?
That ’d be very cool .
Several folks suggested that I should take a look at Resolver , an IronPython - based spreadsheet that deeply unifies Pythonic object - oriented programming with the sort of direct manipulation that makes the spreadsheet so useful .
Resolver was and still is in private beta , but today ’s screencast ( Flash , Silverlight ) will give you a good sense of what it ’s all about .
The presenters are Giles Thomas , managing director and CTO of Resolver Systems ( and creator of his own Resolver screencast ) , and Michael Foord , who blogs about Python , contributes to the IronPython cookbook , and is also working on the forthcoming book IronPython in Action .
If you are ( or would like to be ) using Python to wrangle business data , Resolver will make sense immediately .
You ’ll love the idea of wielding Python ’s powerful data manipulation features in that context .
You ’ll appreciate what it would mean to harness not only the Python standard libraries but , because Resolver is IronPython - based , also the .NET Framework and the universe of third - party .NET assemblies .
And you ’ll be intrigued by the way in which the IronPython code that represents and animates a Resolver spreadsheet can be reused elsewhere — for example , in web applications .
But there ’s more to the story .
Because a cell in a Resolver spreadsheet can contain a reference to any .NET object , Resolver creates , as Giles Thomas says , “ a somewhat pathological but entirely new way of programming using a spreadsheet . ”
You can , for example , define an anonymous function — say , a function that returns the square of its argument — and store it in cell B4 .
Then you can place a value — say , 5 — in cell A2 .
Then you can store this formula in cell B6 :
= B4 ( A2 )
That says : “ Apply the squaring function in B4 to the value in A2 . ”
The result in B6 will be 25 .
I ’ve long argued that the interactive and exploratory style of dynamic object - oriented languages is an important but underappreciated benefit .
As I may have mentioned before , IronPython ’s creator Jim Hugunin told me that when he first showed IronPython to folks at Microsoft , he was surprised by their reaction .
He thought the big wow would be IronPython ’s ability to streamline and accelerate use of the .NET Framework .
But while people did appreciate that , they were truly wowed by something that ’s second nature to every Python programmer — the read / eval / print loop which traces all the way back to the earliest Lisp systems .
It is a magical and powerful thing to be able to explore and modify a running program ’s code and data .
From those early Lisp systems to today ’s Python and Ruby implementations , we have been doing that exploration and modification using a command line .
1
We can trick it out with recall , name completion , and search , but it ’s still a command line with all the limitations that entails .
If I ’ve defined an object A and stored some code or data there , my definition and invocations of A will scroll out of view as I continue to work .
They wo n’t be visually persistent .
In a Resolver spreadsheet , these objects are visually persistent .
I have n’t yet got my hands on Resolver , but here ’s an example of what I think that will mean .
Suppose that I have a data set I want to transform , against which I ’m testing five different versions of a transformation function .
I ’d put the data in cell A1 , the functions in cells B1.. B5 , and the results in C1..C5 .
Now I ’ll see everything at a glance .
The spreadsheet that would conventionally have been the results viewer at the end of a series of tests becomes the environment in which the tests are written , performed , and evaluated .
The spreadsheet is also an important bridge between programmers and their business sponsors .
It ’s no accident that Ward Cunningham ’s FIT ( Framework for Integrated Test ) was originally inspired by Ward ’s experience of inviting business analysts to write test cases in spreadsheets .
In its current form , FIT uses HTML tables in a wiki as the bridge between analysts who write tests and developers who write the code that must pass those tests .
I think Resolver and FIT may prove to be a marriage made in heaven .
While Resolver will initially appeal to business programmers who appreciate Python as a language , and IronPython as a way of leveraging the .NET Framework and .NET - based business logic , the ideas it embodies transcend Python and .
NET .
I ’ll be fascinated to see how this “ pathological but entirely new way of programming using a spreadsheet ” will evolve .
1 Smalltalkers will note that they have been using a three - pane browser all along , and that ’s true .
However the spreadsheet metaphor , in this context , is something else again .

Duncan Hunter : No time to ' experiment ' with gays in military David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday December 17 , 2007

The US military does too much hard fighting to " experiment " with allowing gays to openly serve in uniform , according to dark horse GOP presidential contender Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - CA ) .
Appearing in a 60 Minutes segment focused on the apparently waning enforcement of the US military 's 15 - year - old " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy as it struggles to retain service personnel , Hunter said that the American armed services could n't afford to mimic the fighting forces of European nations , which let gays serve .
" We are n't the Brits , we 're not the Europeans , we 're not the Swedes , " said Hunter , citing other forces that permit gays in uniform .
" The Fallujahs of the world , the Ramadis of the world that require heavy combat and lots of firefighting capability -- those are the places the Americans go . "
As for the other nations , Hunter suggested their forces had it a bit easier .
" The other countries tend to go to the so - called peacekeeper zones , where they have fewer firefights and less contact with the enemy , " he said .
" And the European nations show little will to send large contingents of their military people into dangerous places . "
But , on the contrary , Admiral Sir Alan West , the former head of the British Royal Navy , said that the 2000 decision to let gays serve openly actually improved the effectiveness of England 's forces .
" I do n't believe for a second it 's affected the fighting capability of our forces , " said West .
" I think it is better .
Because people feel they can be open about who they are , and they can really throw themselves totally into what they want to achieve with your force . "
He went on to say that American and British definitions of machismo differed .
" I think American troops are very brave and I think British troops are very brave , but we do it in a little bit of probably a quieter way generally , " he said .
" We do n't know have to ... shave our heads off and shake hands very hard .
You can still kill someone without having to do that ... you read about the Spartans , they were all homosexuals , the whole lot of them -- and I do n't think anyone would suggest for a second that the 500 Spartans fighting against the Persian army were not pretty macho . "
Hunter , however , warned that with the US military only recently beginning to meet recruitment goals , it was no time to adopt new policy .
" When we risk doing away with this system that works , where American families sit around the dinner table and they make a decision that their young men or young woman is going to go into this military because they share the values of that military ? " asked Hunter .
" Or should we experiment at a time when our military is totally volunteer , when it 's extremely capable , and perhaps lose that capability or perhaps lose those numbers , perhaps lose those reenlistments , and perhaps lose that effectiveness ? "

Art Olivier , the 2000 candidate for Vice President for the Libertarian Party , registered to vote as a Republican and asked fellow Libertarians and other voters to do the same to help Ron Paul win the Republican primary .
" It is time to put partisan politics to the side and elect a leader that will restore the Constitution and the rule of law , " said Olivier , the former Mayor of Bellflower , California at a Ron Paul Meetup in Long Beach .
" Not only do we need Libertarians to vote for Ron Paul , it is imperative that Greens , Democrats , American Independents and Decline - to - State voters that are concerned with our diminishing liberties unite to elect the Champion of the Constitution . "
In California , the American Independent Party is an affiliate of the Constitution Party and Decline - to - State voters are independents and must re-register by January 22nd to vote in the Republican Primary .
Olivier sees the Ron Paul campaign as a benefit to America and the Libertarian Party .
" Millions of Americans are learning the benefits of liberty from Dr. Paul . "
Olivier attributes the success of the Ron Paul campaign in part to the major political paradigm shift toward liberty that David Nolan , the founder of the Libertarian Party , predicted America would experience in the first decade of the 21st century .
" The Ron Paul Revolution is real and it has changed American politics for good . " said Olivier .
Art Olivier has been active in the Libertarian Party since he ran for State Assembly in 1990 through his campaign for California Governor in 2006 .

The title of yesterday ’s Economic Commentary from Merrill Lynch : “ Housing deflation could be a multi- year process . ”
And the executive summary :
Both the near - term and longer - run outlooks for the housing market remain clouded in what is a severe downturn in starts , sales and prices that has become national in scope .
As we saw in the November housing starts data , the builders are now frantically cutting production .
But with the sales backdrop still softening , they may have to slice their construction plans by another 30 % before we hit bottom on a cyclical basis .
And , that bottom could be as long as a year away .
Beyond that , weak demographic fundamentals point to years of sluggish real estate activity , particularly in terms of the “ price ” .
The looming dominance of the “ move down ” buyer suggests that home values will continue to soften long after the building industry mops up the current excess supply .
In fact , real estate pricing in general can be expected to be in the doldrums through 2012 .
The need to save for retirement will have to increasingly come “ organically ” in the form of setting aside an extra nickel or dime from every dollar earned in after - tax wages and salaries as opposed to what we as a society have been doing for the better part of the past decade , in essence , blurring the distinction between real estate as a “ consumption good ” ( place to live ) and real estate as part of the “ portfolio ” ( investment ) that was going to experience sustained double - digit appreciation and emerge as a fountain of cash - flow in the future .
Expectations are already in the process of being deflated and we are at the early stages of a savings revival in the traditional sense of the word , and this will ( i ) be deflationary for the aggregate demand curve ; ( ii ) be bullish for Treasury bonds ; ( iii ) act as an underpinning for the dollar insofar as this process continues to foster an improvement in the current account deficit ( which , excluding energy , is down to a six - year low ) .
See the chart [ above ] – at the height of the bubble , almost one in four households who were contemplating a move into real estate based their decisions on future price appreciation .
This “ investor class ” that dominated the housing market for so long has now seen its share dwindle to a record low of 4 % .
This is a very big deal as it illustrates just how far the speculation has been expunged , and it also heralds a major ( and healthy ) shift in how the public now perceives real estate .
And while the report is national by nature , there are obviously themes that might resonate right here at home .
And of course , there ’s the punch line :
Last week , John McCain was confronted in New Hampshire by a police officer about the War on Drugs .
His colossal display of stunning ignorance was captured on YouTube :
10 . LIBYA
It 's on and off ( and on again ) for Libya .
Four years after the United States government lifted a ban on American travel , this socialist North African nation is going green .
The eldest son of Col. Muammar el - Qaddafi , the leader of Libya , is developing a carbon - neutral resort along the country 's pristine Mediterranean coastline , home to stellar Greek and Roman ruins and endangered seals .
Luxury hotels and golf courses are planned , as well as a new airport in Tripoli .
But red tape remains .
Tour operators have canceled trips because of visa holdups , and last month planeloads of European tourists were turned away under an odd rule that requires foreign passports to be translated into Arabic .
11 . HVAR
As Croatia 's Dalmatian Coast has become a new Riviera , Hvar has become its St. - Tropez : a tiny village that fills with yachts and international partyers over the summer .
While the waterfront Carpe Diem ( www.carpe-diem-hvar.com) remains the island 's night - life center , narrow stone alleys are lined with chic cocktail lounges and hotel terraces , including the rooftop pool at the new Adriana hotel , Croatia 's first Leading Small Hotels of the World member ( www.suncanihvar.com/adriana).
12 . PUERTO VALLARTA
Maybe it is the lasting memory of the gay icon Elizabeth Taylor 's scandalous affair with Richard Burton during his filming of “ Night of the Iguana ” in the early 60's , but Puerto Vallarta is becoming gayer by the year and is now poised to overtake Acapulco as Mexico 's leading gay beach .
There are now some dozen gay - friendly hotels ( www.gayguidevallarta.com/Lodging/gay.html) and a glut of bars and clubs clustered along the aptly named Zona Romantica .
13 . SYLT
With a nickname like the “ Hamptons of Germany , ” it 's only a matter of time before jet - setters discover the North Sea island of Sylt .
Known for its nudist beaches , reed - thatched houses and designer stores , the T - shaped island has long been popular with German celebrities , particularly television stars and sports figures .
But now getting there is a simple hop from London and a dozen other European cities , thanks to the low - cost carrier Air Berlin .
14 . PRAGUE
The verdict is in .
The Next Prague is ... Prague .
Stag parties have moved on , bohemians have left for cheaper rents , and youth hostels are being squeezed by luxe hotels .
Joining a new Mandarin Oriental next year is the Augustine , converted from a monastery and other buildings into a Rocco Forte hotel ( prague.roccofortecollection.com ) , and the just - refurbished Hilton Prague Old Town ( www.prague-oldtown.hilton.com), with a buzzing restaurant opened by Gordon Ramsay .
15 . QUITO
If you 've been to Quito , Ecuador , there 's a good chance you were heading to the Galápagos .
But Quito , the colonial capital perched 9,200 feet up in the Andes , is no longer just a whistle stop .
The city 's crumbling historic center , one of Latin America 's least altered , has been reborn after a seven - year , $ 200 million renovation .
And a crop of upscale hotels has arrived , including a JW Marriott ( www.marriott.com), making Quito a glorious new center in the so - called Middle of the World .
16 . LIVERPOOL
There 's more to Liverpool than just the Beatles .
Next year , this industrial city celebrates its 800th birthday ( and its designation as European Capital of Culture ) , as it trots out everything and everyone , from Turner Prize artists to young emerging bands like the Zutons .
But make no mistake :
The headliner is Paul McCartney , who is returning to play the “ Liverpool Sound ” concert at Anfield Stadium on June 1 ( www.liverpool08.com).
Located in Zadar , Croatia , the “ Sea Organ ” is the world ’s largest pipe organ , measuring 75 m ( length ) .
All 35 - pipes were carved into stone , which are then played by sea waves .

Many bloggers have been touting the benefits of publishing your full blog or site ’s full RSS feed .
In fact , they have been talking about it for a long time .
But did you know that most likely even if you are publishing your full RSS feed you are not taking advantages of its link building benefits ?
Here is why you should publish your full RSS feed .
When you post items on your blog or your site , and your blog has an RSS feed , your post (s ) can appear on many other sites .
In fact , on this blog , I encourage others to use my blog ’s RSS feed and re-use it as you see fit .
In fact , there are lots of other sites that use my feed as their site ’s content .
Not only do I encourage it , it actually helps me out in the long run–here ’s why :
If another site uses my site ’s RSS feed as their content , it is their responsibility to make sure that the pages are not seen as duplicate pages .
Since my blog gets spidered first by the search engines , I ’m the original–and others are duplicates .
Furthermore , as I link to other pages on my site in posts , those links will appear in my RSS feed .
And whenever my RSS feed is used as content on another domain ( web site ) , there is a good chance that the link might count as a backlink to my site .
So , as you continue to post on your blog or site , do n’t forget to link liberally to other pages on your site–those links will potentially count as backlinks to your site , not only as internal links but external links to your site ’s pages .
Sure , someone reading your blog or web site may read the post and stay on your site ( which is a good thing ) , but what if they ’re on another site that ’s syndicated your RSS feed ?
Before you post , you might want to create a list of important pages on your web site or perhaps your favorite blog posts .
I keep a list of my “ important ” pages ( pages that I might want to rank well in a search engine ) for future use .
And when I finish a blog post I quickly scan my list of “ important ” pages and add a few internal links .
I also record the anchor text that I used to point to the page so I do n’t use it again too often .
Initial Blog Syndication
Promoting your blog or web site ’s RSS feed is important–it ’s part of the link building process .
First , you will most likely want to use a list like this and a list like this to make sure your RSS feed is promoted properly .
There are also sites in your topic area that encourage RSS site syndication .
For example , there are places like this that do a great job of syndicating content .
Once you get your RSS feed listed and syndicated , you will notice that other sites will tend to pick it up .
This is a good thing .
Really .
When your RSS feed gets noticed ( or you use sites like this and this and this to syndicate your feed , you might notice that there are other networks and other sites like Plugim.com and Bumpzee.com what automatically will publish your RSS feed .
Again , as your RSS feed appears on other sites , it will include links to pages on your site .
Here ’s a Cool Trick
Want even a better trick ?
Rather than use “ plugins ” and scripts to automatically figure out related posts , do it manually .
At the end of your blog post , include a few links to related posts .
But , put those links in your post so they get into your site ’s RSS feed .
That ’s much more powerful than using a “ related posts ” plugin .
As an example of this , I ’ve included “ favorite posts ” at the end of this blog post .
The bottom line this : if you publish your full RSS feed do n’t forget about linking to your internal pages on your site using the appropriate anchor text –not only could those links be counted as internal links , those links could be counted as external links , as well .

November 16 , 2014 .
Mr. McCain ’s lingering reputation as a maverick straight talker comes largely from his opposition to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , which he said at the time were too big and too skewed to the rich .
Those objections would seem to have even more force now , with America facing the costs of an expensive war  which Mr. McCain fervently supports  and with income inequality reaching new heights .
But Mr. McCain now says that he supports making the Bush tax cuts permanent .
Not only that : he ’s become a convert to crude supply - side economics , claiming that cutting taxes actually increases revenues .
That ’s an assertion even Bush administration officials concede is false .
Oh , and what about his earlier opposition to tax cuts ?
Mr. McCain now says he opposed the Bush tax cuts only because they were n’t offset by spending cuts .
Aside from the logical problem here  if tax cuts increase revenue , why do they need to be offset ?
 even a cursory look at what Mr. McCain said at the time shows that he ’s trying to rewrite history : he actually attacked the Bush tax cuts from the left , not the right .
But he has clearly decided that it ’s better to fib about his record than admit that he was n’t always a rock - solid economic conservative .
So what does the conversion of Mr. McCain into an avowed believer in voodoo economics  and the comparable conversions of Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani  tell us ?
That bitter partisanship and political polarization are n’t going away anytime soon .
There ’s a fantasy , widely held inside the Beltway , that men and women of good will from both parties can be brought together to hammer out bipartisan solutions to the nation ’s problems .
If such a thing were possible , Mr. McCain , Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani  a self - proclaimed maverick , the former governor of a liberal state and the former mayor of an equally liberal city  would seem like the kind of men Democrats could deal with .
( O.K. , maybe not Mr. Giuliani . )
In fact , however , it ’s not possible , not given the nature of today ’s Republican Party , which has turned men like Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney into hard - line ideologues .
On economics , and on much else , there is no common ground between the parties .
Prince Saud said the plan was meant to stop a nuclear arms race
Prince Saud al - Faisal told the Middle East Economic Digest ( MEED ) the plan could defuse Tehran 's stand - off with the West over its nuclear programme .
The prince was quoted as saying that Iran was considering the Gulf states ' offer , but the US was not involved .
The BBC's Paul Reynolds says it is doubtful the plan will go anywhere .
It is similar to one proposed by Russia in December 2005 , which led to initially positive talks between Moscow and Tehran , but in the end led nowhere , says our world affairs correspondent .
' An interesting idea '
Prince Saud said the offer came from the six states that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) - Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
" We have proposed a solution , which is to create a consortium for all users of enriched uranium in the Middle East , " he was quoted as saying .
The US claims Iran is developing nuclear weapons
" [ We will ] do it in a collective manner through a consortium that will distribute according to needs , give each plant its own necessary amount , and ensure no use of this enriched uranium for atomic weapons . "
He outlined the plan in an interview for the MEED during Saudi King Abdullah 's state visit to London .
Prince Saud said the GCC had developed the proposal to stave off a nuclear arms race in the Gulf .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for civilian energy purposes , but the US claims Tehran is developing nuclear weapons .
Prince Saud is reported to have said : " They [ the Iranians ] have responded that it is an interesting idea and they will come back to us .
" The US is not involved , but I do n't think it would be hostile to this , and it would resolve a main area of tension between the West and Iran . "
The UK foreign office said the five permanent UN Security Council members - the US , China , Russia , France and Britain - along with Germany would meet on Friday in London to discuss the next step on Iran 's nuclear programme .
As you might imagine , given my inability to relate to the rest of the human race on even the most cursory level , I 'm somewhat socially inept .
Slide me between two strangers at any light - hearted jamboree and I 'll either rock awkwardly and silently on my heels , or come out with a stone - cold conversation - killer like , " This room 's quite rectangular , is n't it ? "
I glide through the social whirl with all the elegance of a dog in high heels .
A friend once tried help by coaching me in small talk .
Step one : take note of what day it is .
On a Monday or Tuesday , ask what they got up to at the weekend .
Thursday or Friday , ask if they 've got any plans for the coming weekend .
" What about Wednesdays ? " I asked , wide - eyed .
" Or what if I meet them at the weekend ?
What the hell happens then ? "
" Oh , for Christ 's sake .
Just ask what they do for a living . "
That Friday , I attended a reasonably sized get - together and boldly stood in the corner , trying to avoid everyone and everything .
When this plan failed , I tried out my newfound small - talk skills .
But having dealt my opening gambit , I drifted off , gazing at eternity as their stupid wobbling faces outlined their weekend plans in punishing detail .
I did n't care what they were doing at the weekend - nor , indeed , whether they lived or died .
Afterwards my friend asked how the party had gone .
I complained that the key to small talk had merely opened a door on a world of tedium .
" Well , duh , " they said .
" No one really cares what anyone else is getting up to .
Why do you think it 's called small talk ?
It 's just shit you say to make things less awkward . "
What , just a pointless noise you make with your mouth ?
" Precisely , " they said .
" Cows moo .
People small - talk . "
And I thought : I hate this world .
This stinking , unbearable world .
Fast - forward several years until you hit now .
Then rewind a few weeks .
Some of my friends tell me they 've signed up to Facebook .
It 's a bit of silly fun , they say .
So I sign up too .
Even misanthropes hate feeling left out .
Facebook , for the uninitiated , is " a social utility that connects you with the people around you " .
It 's like a streamlined , refined take on MySpace .
No gaudy backgrounds and hideous customised cursors , just crisp whites and pale blues .
You create a profile for yourself , locate other people you know , and add them as " friends " .
You can then swap messages , share photos , invite one another for drinks , and so on .
There 's also a status window you can easily update , so if your friend Dave is feeling pensive , he types " feeling pensive " in and you see a little bulletin saying , " Dave is feeling pensive . "
For some reason , this is endlessly amusing .
My friends were right : it was a bit of silly fun .
There was one drawback .
Being on Facebook involves submitting yourself to cheerful , yet merciless surveillance .
Your friends can automatically see more or less everything you 're doing - who else you 're making friends with , which groups you 've joined , and so on - and vice versa .
So when a girl I 'd once been semi-involved with but oh - dear - that - ended - badly added me as a friend , I found myself confronted with an unrelenting , unfolding , up - to - the - minute news feed of her fantastic new life and her fantastic new man , replete with photos .
It does n't yet treat me to an automatic update each time they have sex , although that feature can't be far off .
Anyway , last week I mentioned my burgeoning Facebook obsession in print .
This was my first mistake .
By the end of the day I had received several hundred " friend requests " , mainly from students so desperate to escape the tedium of revision they 'd idly befriend literally anyone , including me .
Probably out of pity .
When someone sends you a friend request , you 're confronted with three options : " confirm " , " reject " , or " send message " .
Confirming all of them would make it hard for me to find my real friends among the influx of strangers .
Coldly hitting " reject " , however , seemed far too mean .
Most of them were smiling .
Instead , I chose " send message " , and invited them to join a group I 'd set up for people I did n't really know , but who had been kind or bored enough to send a request .
This was my second mistake .
After sending about 30 such cut - and - pasted invites in quick succession , my account was blocked for 24 hours : Facebook thought I was a spammer .
Worse , people who signed up wondered what my plan was ( I did n't have one ) , while others refused , and instead sent me messages pointing out how pathetic it is to smugly fish for new Facebook friends , then arrogantly shove anyone who applies into a custom - made holding pen .
Besides , in Facebook terms , several hundred people is n't that many .
Ian Huntley could generate more friends in an hour .
" You 're not exactly Joan Bakewell or John O'Farrell , " rasped one irritated ex-admirer .
So , for the sake of a bit of silly fun , I 've generated a roster of wannabe friends I can't reply to , organised a small group of people baffled by my motives , and convinced several perfect strangers that I 'm a conceited , desperate prick .
In other words , it 's comforting to know my crashing social ineptitude adapts in line with technology .
I can be awkward and useless anytime , anywhere .
Even when pixellated , there 's no bloody stopping me .
· This week Charlie learned how to use the " reject " button on Facebook .
He failed to write an Ignopedia entry for the third week running .
He was scared by Katie Hopkins on The Apprentice : " Wet red lips , like she 's been biting the heads off mice .
Horrible .
There 's some
Thatcher genes in there too , if I 'm not mistaken . "

Pat Buchanan 's recent attempt to diagnose the sinking dollar demonstrates that ignorance of basic economics is not limited to the Left .
Buchanan points out the plummeting value of the dollar relative to other currencies and major commodities such as gold ( up 24 % this year ) and oil ( up over 50 % in 12 months ) .
He then declares that " the prime suspect in the death of the dollar is the massive trade deficits America has run up " to " maintain her standard of living and to sustain the American Imperium . "
This diagnosis offers a tantalizing glimpse of the truth , yet shatters it with protectionist bromides .
First , let 's deflate the protectionist rhetoric .
What are trade deficits and surpluses ?
A trade deficit means that in sum , American dollars are going abroad in exchange for foreign goods .
Consider what this means .
If foreigners never cashed in those dollars , Americans would essentially be getting foreign goods free of charge .
Protectionists like Buchanan condemn this as " borrowing , " but this is actually a form of investment — both in US industry and in US dollars .
Foreigners have been investing in the United States for decades for two primary reasons : the superior returns due to the growth potential of American capitalism , and the dominance and ( relative ) stability of the US dollar , which made them useful as a means of exchange apart from their purchasing power of US goods .
Americans are not living " beyond our means , " as Buchanan claims ; we are simply a more profitable investment , with a more stable currency , than the foreign investors ' own countries .
A trade surplus on the other hand , means that in sum , US goods are being sent abroad in exchange for foreign currency .
A trade surplus is a form of investing in other countries , since ( fiat ) foreign currency is only worth the foreign capital it can purchase .
This happened after World War II , when the United States sent capital to shattered foreign economies and reaped returns as the value of their economies — and thus their currencies — grew .
So are trade deficits preferable to trade surpluses ?
In a narrow sense , yes .
A nation that has strong economic prospects will attract foreign investment and therefore experience trade deficits .
Conversely , when the domestic economy is stifled by regulations and monetary manipulations , investors will send their savings abroad and their country will run a trade surplus .
( This explains why the US deficit has consistently fallen during recessions and grown during periods of expansion . )
However , the broader lesson is that trade inequalities indicate the net flow of foreign investment , and the benefit of the inequality is ultimately validated by the profitability of those investments .
Profitable foreign investment results in GDP growth and positive currency valuations , whereas unprofitable foreign investment erodes economic growth and devalues the currency of the investment 's recipient .
Could a sufficiently large and wasteful investment be responsible for the current dollar crisis ?
A large part of the US trade deficit comes from the bonds ( treasury securities ) the US government has been selling to foreigners to finance the growing federal budget deficit .
The value of these bonds depends on both the strength of the US economy and the loss of value caused by expansion of the money supply .
When the US Treasury sells bonds to individuals , it diverts savings from private investments ; this diversion is a form of taxation .
When it sells bonds to the Federal Reserve , it exchanges bonds for newly created dollars , which is a form of monetary expansion ( inflation ) .
Additionally , when the government sells debt to foreigners , it creates a liability against the US economy .
Foreigners buying deficit debt are in essence betting on the ability of the government to provide a return on the investment in the form of positive economic growth .
What happens when the investment fails to turn a profit ?
The primary reason for the $ 9 trillion federal deficit is the so - called " War on Terror , " including the spending on Homeland Security , Afghanistan , and Iraq .
Unless you believe these funds averted an economic meltdown due to terrorism , these funds represent a near - total loss .
Tanks , bombs , and bureaucratic paper pushers consume vast funds , yet they contribute nothing to the economy , aside from benefiting military contractors .
This economic destruction is one of the biggest reasons for the declining dollar .
( Perhaps the major reason is the credit bubble created by the inflationary policy of the Fed since the early 2000s , which is now collapsing and making the economy less attractive as an investment target . )
The falling dollar will make it increasingly expensive for the US government to accumulate more debt .
Eventually , it will be forced to either cut spending , explicitly shift costs to US citizens by increasing taxes directly , or ( most likely ) increase taxes through higher inflation .
Investors have already anticipated this and flocked to other currencies and to gold as a refuge .
The slide will likely continue until some kind of budget reconciliation is evident .
The overwhelming response to the problems created by the government 's financial irresponsibility has been to call for more protectionism , as Mr. Buchanan is doing .
Because it creates barriers to trade and investment , protectionism makes the US dollar less valuable to both foreign consumers and investors , thus accelerating the fall of the dollar .
Investors have certainly anticipated this as well — but do n't blame them for betting on the gullibility of Americans to the protectionist rhetoric of economic ignoramuses like Paul Krugman and Pat Buchanan .
If we can avoid the protectionist trap and reconcile the budget , the falling value of the dollar will eventually attract investors and stimulate exports .
As the developing world becomes richer and freer , the US dollar is unlikely to enjoy the unchallenged superiority it once had , but maturing foreign markets will attract products and services designed in America , and we will once again become a recipient of foreign investment .
Free markets and American ingenuity made the United States the greatest economy in the world .
They are the only way we will keep it that way .

BBC News Magazine
Bernard Cook is still receiving post .
But he has not passed over the threshold of his home and reached down to pick it up since 16 November 2005 .
Some time around the middle of that day Mr Cook , estates director for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company and due at an important meeting , took a van from his work and disappeared .
Now when the phone goes you do n't expect it to be news
Bernadette Cook
Whose husband , above , is missing
In the two years and 18 days that have passed there has only been one sighting , at a church in Coventry , that has given his family any hope .
It would be understandable to fear he had killed himself , but despite extensive police efforts no body has been found .
He has not tried to access his bank accounts and there was no evidence of preparations for disappearance .
When we think of missing people we tend to assume vulnerable women , troubled teenagers and children running away .
But there is a category of missing person that receives less coverage in the national news : men over the age of 30 .
Across the UK , there are as many as 210,000 missing persons reports every year , although with one person often being counted several times for numerous disappearances , the total number of people involved is only a fraction of that .
Media coverage
A 2004 random sample of 1,000 missing cases in London found that more than three - quarters were resolved within 48 hours , while 99 % were resolved within a year .
The figures suggest that while the teenage missing are more likely to be girls , of all those over the age of 24 who disappear , 73 % are male .
Of those missing for more than a year , the longer they are missing the more likely they are to be older men .
Missing People , formerly the National Missing Persons Helpline ( NMPH ) , works to get these men the same attention as others who have disappeared and whose cases are more readily picked up by the media .
Some missing people assume new identities
" We will publicise all cases where they meet our criteria , " says Geoff Newiss , at the charity .
" That has nothing to do with age or being photogenic .
We hear every day how hard it is for families . "
Bernard Cook 's wife Bernadette slips between past and present tenses when speaking about her husband .
The mental burden on her and their children has been immense .
" What has happened is so awful you just can't imagine what it would be like .
You are not aware , you go on autopilot . "
Emotional pain is exacerbated by practical difficulties .
Accessing bank accounts or settling other financial affairs is a problem .
The efforts of supportive friends and family have been vital .
And the efforts - by both the police and his family - to find Mr Cook continue .
With the missing man a keen climber and a Catholic , posters are in climbing huts and churches across the country .
Immense workload
" After three to four months you realise this could be a long , long time and you prepare yourself .
Now when the phone goes you do n't expect it to be news , " Mrs Cook says .
Mr Cook 's workload had been immense .
But despite regularly working until two or three in the morning , the estates director had showed no signs he was about to be overwhelmed .
" He was the least likely person for this to happen to .
I knew he was overloaded with work but that had been the case for about the last eight months .
We are all under pressure but this was excessive .
There is a small group of people who go missing for a week or two and then reappear not being able to remember what happened
Malcolm Payne
Researcher
" It must have been a massive breakdown to do anything like this .
He was not a man who avoided situations , he was a man who adored his children . "
Of those who have vanished , many have decided to go missing , Newiss says , for reasons including relationship breakdown , family , financial , emotional , and mental health problems .
And there can be a degree of ambiguity , especially in the case of men , over what it means to be missing .
As Newiss explains , some of those who are the subject of reports " never were missing in any meaningful sense " .
Malcolm
Payne studied records of missing persons prior to the setting up of the NMPH , and recognises the difficulty .
He has defined being missing as an absence " interfering with the performance by that person of expected social responsibilities " .
Psychological stress
" They are not missing to themselves .
It is only the people who are left behind who see them as missing " , he says .
" There is a small group of people who go missing for a week or two and then reappear not being able to remember what happened .
That 's often because of work stress . "
Even for those who are missing for months or years , it can be suggested , as it has in the case of the canoeist , that they are suffering from some kind of dissociative amnesia or fugue , a condition sparked by psychological stress .
The US medical encyclopaedia , the Merck Manual , describes dissociative fugue as " a disorder in which one or more episodes of sudden , unexpected , and purposeful travel from home ( fugue ) occur , during which a person cannot remember some or all of his past life " .
Most often found in those who have suffered in wars , accidents , or natural disasters , the condition typically lasts only hours or days , before the sufferer recovers all or part of his original identity .
Isolated cases
Forensic psychiatrist Cosmo Hallstrom says cases of long - term dissociative fugue are extremely rare .
" In the isolated numbers of cases I 've found , it has been convenient to escape .
It is very hard to decide what part is dissociative and what part is conscious .
You are highly reliant on what the person tells you . "
Some cases can perhaps be explained with an answer that is somewhere between a dissociative condition and a conscious decision to adopt a new identity to avoid severe stresses , Dr Hallstrom says .
" People who are under pressure in a difficult situation who stop and walk out and live a different existence and decide they want to refind themselves have to come up with a plausible explanation . "
While fugues may be rare , it is clear that for most missing men the pressure on them has been immense .
And for Mrs Cook , the agony of waiting goes on .
" If he has had a complete breakdown and then he regains some sort of normal mental thinking he will be horrified at what he has done and the effect it has had on us .
He is the most selfless man I have ever met , " she says .
I am a middle aged woman who went missing for four months .
I do n't think anyone knew how much pressure I had been under for a very long time .
So I took some of my money and my dog and checked into a motel that catered to people who were ' under the radar ' .
Prostitutes , men who were recently divorced , really , a huge variety of people .
I had no idea that people were so concerned about me and the police had been called .
However , it was the best thing I have ever done .
I now put on my calendar regular scheduled vacations ( one week every 4 months ) no matter what .
Maggie , San Francisco , USA
With respect to Alan from Trowbridge , and his statement that no one needs to work until 2 am etc , well , sorry to say this but lots and lots of people do this on a regular basis .
I work 14 hours a day as an average , seven days a week as an average , and have done so for the past 9 years .
And the reason is that sometimes there is just no other option , it 's called expectation and pressure .
I have no idea what a holiday is , maybe the odd weekend every few months .
The pressure of my responsibilities is immense and sometimes I want to sleep forever just to escape it .
The dissapearing part is something that I have contemplated , and longed for at times , but i have n't done it so far because of my family .
But , the thought , and the longing is always there .

Stress can creep up on you .
I thought I was immune until pushing myself too hard for too long finally caught up with me a couple of months ago .
I found myself behaving out of character and only realising what I 'd done after the event .
Sadly I lost a good friend through my sometimes bizarre behaviour .
I did n't " disappear " but did spend most of the time I did n't have to mix with people , work , shopping etc indoors on my own .
I realised the consequences of my behaviour and have made lifestyle changes to ease the problem .
I never thought I 'd suffer from anything remotely like stress , never thought I 'd seek medical advice for anything psychiatric either but when I did it was a real help to be told I was " a textbook case " and not some kind of lunatic , and also to get advice that was just common sense but my mind was n't doing a lot of that at the time .
Do n't think it wo n't happen to you , like I did , and if you even think there 's something wrong talk to someone straight away , even if it 's only NHS Direct , preferably your GP , no - one else has to know unless you tell them .

You and your family might find it helpful to go to Al - Anon meetings .
Al - Anon is for people who , like you , have found living with an alcoholic to be incredibly harmful to their own well - being .
They are very welcoming and supportive , and help the families and friends of alcoholics by sharing their experience , strength and hope .

I can understand perfectly why people do it .
I am only 23 and sometimes I feel like just jumping on a plane to somewhere else where I would n't be known to anyone .
Occasionally the pressure from families as well as work gets unbearable .
Everybody , especially parents and / or partners expect you to choose between them and somebody or something else and it just is not fair .

For nearly two years now I have been working steadily for the rights of my son to have an education .
I have gone extended periods with no sleep at all , but usually I get about five hours of sleep .
On top of fighting for his right to continue his public education , I have to deal with therapists who work with him in my home about six days a week .
I also have two daughters .
I do n't have a husband .
I do n't have a family to support me emotionally .
And I am still not missing .
In fact , I am unable to hold down a job or have time for myself and I do not receive child support from his father , and that is a massive financial burden .
I am still not missing ... although I do worry that one day it will all become too much .
Two years of constant pressure , constant court battles and constant advocacy and less - than - ideal results has not caused me to " snap " and become a different person .
I hope that never happens to me and I do wish there could be more tangible evidence that this " just happens " .

I can relate to this , working until 11 pm , working weekends was the norm .
I had a sick partner so could not quit my job as I was the bread winner , talking to my employer always resulted in empty promises , but the thought of losing my job kept me from complaining .
Leaving my life seemed like the only possible way to end the stress .
Even the doctor sent me back to work and told me to " talk it through with my boss " .
After repeatedly visiting the GP she prescribed anti-depressants , NOT really what I was after .

After her father died , my wife , already stressed out with work and other problems , developed severe amnesia and for a number of months effectively disappeared .
After she recovered , she described her then mental state as being like a distant observer of her own life -- she felt completely disconnected from her own self .
Peter , Bangkok , Thailand
I understand the stresses that a person can be under and it does n't surprise me that people can just disappear .
The amount of pressure society puts on individuals to " perform " at work and to conform to the accepted norm is unfair and naive .
We are not supposed to withstand so much stress without a physical outlet .
If people want to disappear and start a new life it is up to them .
I know that they are often leaving a family behind who will suffer for it but that is a product of the society we live in .
Caging an animal does not make it happy and we are all " caged " in some way by the constraints of modern culture .
It is not the fault of the individual but the fault of us all .

In the quest for ever more profits , companies are increasingly ' rationalising ' their workforce , putting increased pressure on the ' lucky ' ones who remain .
Some companies even demand a 10 % year on year reduction in costs & 10 % increase in profits .
For some the only way out is escape .
With no easy way back .
Martin Elton , Thornbury - Sth Glos
Apparently this is becoming increasingly common in countries such as Japan where the pressure of work and family responsibilities becomes just too much .
I feel so sorry for the families left behind , but also for the individual who does this sort of thing as they obviously needed help and were too afraid or ashamed to ask for it .
With the pressures of modern society , will we be seeing an increase in this sort of thing ?

My brother has been missing since late May .
He is 43 with a drink problem .
He split up with his girlfriend a year ago this month , tried to kill himself in January , moved in with my sister in February and was one of the main reasons that her and her husband ended up splitting up because of his unreasonable behaviour and constant alcohol abuse .
He found out in March that his ex wife was going to jail and that he would be ' lumbered with the kid ' and then in May disappeared .
His daughter managed to get a hold of his mobile phone number from a drinking buddy and when he answered and heard her voice he hung up .
That was the last time any of my family has had contact with him .
My mum takes it personally because he blamed her along with everybody else for his problems and it is having a detrimental effect on her health .
Honestly I hope he turns up one day for her sake but if I do n't see him before she passes away I hope he stays missing forever .
No matter how bad your life is you need to realise that your actions affect others around you .
You can't run away from your problems .

What do you do in the meantime though , while ' missing ' ?
How do they keep themselves , find somewhere to live etc .
Even living under the arches - as it were - takes benefits and claiming benefits needs an identity .
It is very strange how they manage to survive either living off the grid or stealing an identity , especially if they are mentally ill .

My son walked out of our home 18 years ago having argued with his father over the ' poll tax ' we had no idea were he was although there were several sightings .
It was four months before he appeared again , havng got himself a small flat .
He had no idea of the stress this caused and even now it upsets me to think of those missing months .
It rates as one of the worst times of my life .

Working regularly until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning ?
That 's ridiculous - no one can keep that up - no wonder the man went Awol .
No one should be required to work those sort of hours .

As George W. Bush staggers toward the conclusion of his second term , he can point to at least one major and enduring project that has gone according to plan : the transformation of the Supreme Court .
In the next week or so , the justices will begin their summer recess .
The first full term in which Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr. , and Justice Samuel A. Alito , Jr. , have served together will thus be completed , and the changes on the Court , and their implications for the nation , have been profound .
The careers of Roberts and Alito have been emblematic of the conservative ascendancy in American law .
Both men , shortly after graduating from law school , joined the Reagan Administration , where Edwin Meese III , who was for a time the Attorney General , and others were building a comprehensive critique of the Supreme Court under Chief Justices Earl Warren and Warren E. Burger .
The conservative agenda has remained largely unchanged in the decades since : Expand executive power .
End racial preferences intended to assist African - Americans .
Speed executions .
Welcome religion into the public sphere .
And , above all , reverse Roe v. Wade , and allow states to ban abortion .
As Alito wrote in an application for a Justice Department promotion in 1985 , his work on abortion and race cases , among other Reagan Administration priorities , had given him the chance “ to advance legal positions in which I personally believe very strongly . ”
Moving with great swiftness , by the stately standards of the Court , Roberts , Alito , and their allies have already made progress on that agenda .
In Alito ’s first major opinion as a justice , earlier this year , he sharply restricted the ability of victims of employment discrimination to file lawsuits .
The Court said that plaintiffs in such cases must bring their suits within a hundred and eighty days of , say , an unfair raise .
But , because it generally takes employees longer than that to establish that they have been cheated , the effect of the ruling will be to foreclose many lawsuits .
In a similar vein , the Court upheld a death sentence in Washington by lessening the scrutiny applied to jury selection in such cases .
Last week , the justices rejected an appeal by a prisoner who had filed his case before a deadline set by a federal district judge .
Because the judge had misread the law and given the prisoner too much time — three extra days — the Court said that the case had to be thrown out .
Most notoriously , the Court , for the first time in its history , upheld a categorical ban on an abortion procedure .
The case dealt with so - called partial - birth abortion — a procedure performed rarely , often when there are extraordinary risks to the mother , the fetus , or both .
But more important than the ruling were the implications of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ’s opinion .
The Court all but abandoned the reasoning of Roe v. Wade ( and its reaffirmation in the 1992 Casey decision ) and adopted instead the assumptions and the rhetoric of the anti-abortion movement .
To the Court , it was the partial - birth - abortion procedure , not the risks posed to the women who seek it , that was “ laden with the power to devalue human life . ”
In the most startling passage in the opinion , Kennedy wrote , “ While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon , it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained . ”
Small wonder that Kennedy ’s search for such data was unavailing ; notwithstanding the claims of the anti-abortion movement , no intellectually respectable support exists for this patronizing notion .
The decision to have an abortion is never a simple one , but until this year the Court has said that the women affected , not the state , had the last word .
All these conservative victories were decided by votes of five to four , with Kennedy joining Roberts , Alito , Antonin Scalia , and Clarence Thomas to form the majority .
( The last big case outstanding this term is a challenge to school - desegregation plans in Louisville and Seattle .
Based on the oral argument , Kennedy appears likely to join the same quartet in striking down the plans . )
Kennedy holds the balance of power in the Roberts Court , much the way Sandra Day O’Connor did in the Rehnquist years .
Kennedy is more conservative than O’Connor , so the Court is , too .
He sided with the liberals in only one important case this year , when the Court ruled that the gases that cause global warming are pollutants under the Clean Air Act , a ruling that repudiated the Bush Administration ’s narrow view of the law .
The Rehnquist Court had its share of divided rulings , of course — most notably , Bush v. Gore — but the new conservative ascendancy has prompted a striking reaction from the dissenting liberals , John Paul Stevens , David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , and Stephen Breyer .
It has been the custom at the Court for dissenters to explain their views individually or in small groups ; but this group , led by Stevens , the senior member of the Court , has taken to uniting around a single opinion , as if to emphasize a collective view that the majority is taking the law in dangerous directions .
In the case about the missed appeal deadline , the dissenting opinion , by the usually mild - mannered Souter ( who was joined by Stevens , Ginsburg , and Breyer ) , reflected true anguish : “ It is intolerable for the judicial system to treat people this way , and there is not even a technical justification for condoning this bait and switch . ”
Ginsburg , who prides herself on her collegiality , has taken to reading her dissenting opinions aloud from the bench — a vigorous protest in the genteel world of the justices .
In her dissent ( also joined by the others ) in the abortion case , she observed that in 2000 five justices rejected a Nebraska ban on partial - birth abortions that was nearly identical to the one the Court upheld this year .
O’Connor was still on the Court and in the majority in the Nebraska case , so the only meaningful difference between then and now , as Ginsburg noted , is that the Court is “ differently composed than it was when we last considered a restrictive abortion regulation . ”
And that , ultimately , is the point .
When it comes to the incendiary political issues that end up in the Supreme Court , what matters is not the quality of the arguments but the identity of the justices .
Presidents pick justices to extend their legacies ; by this standard , Bush chose wisely .
The days when justices surprised the Presidents who appointed them are over — the last two purported surprises , Souter and Kennedy , were anything but .
Souter ’s record pegged him as a moderate ; Kennedy was nominated because the more conservative Robert Bork was rejected by the Senate .
All the subsequently appointed justices — Thomas , Ginsburg , Breyer , Roberts , and Alito — have turned out precisely as might have been expected by the Presidents who appointed them .
At this moment , the liberals face not only jurisprudential but actuarial peril .
Stevens is eighty - seven and Ginsburg seventy - four ; Roberts , Thomas , and Alito are in their fifties .
The Court , no less than the Presidency , will be on the ballot next November , and a wise electorate will vote accordingly . ♦
PHNOM PENH ( Reuters ) - A Cambodian court charged former Khmer Rouge president Khieu Samphan on Monday with crimes against humanity , the latest member of Pol Pot ’s inner circle to face a trial expected next year .
The French - educated guerrilla leader , who has denied knowledge of any atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge during its 1975 - 79 reign of terror , also stands accused of war crimes , court spokesman Reach Sambath said .
The 78 - year - old was arrested by armed police after his release from a Phnom Penh hospital earlier on Monday , and whisked to the court where he faced Cambodian and foreign judges probing one of the 20th century ’s darkest chapters .
“ The court has formally charged Khieu Samphan with crimes against humanity and war crimes , ” the court spokesman said .
Khieu Samphan , the fifth senior Khmer Rouge cadre to be arrested since the $ 56 million court got under way in earnest this year , was put under provisional detention for one year .
His lawyers planned to appeal the detention order .
A close adviser of Pol Pot , Khieu Samphan has previously portrayed himself as a virtual prisoner of the regime and denied knowledge of any atrocities as Pol Pot drove his dream of creating an agrarian peasant utopia .

About 1.7 million people were executed or died of torture , disease or starvation under the ultra-Maoist revolution .
In a new book published last week , Khieu Samphan defended Pol Pot and blamed rogue regional commanders for betraying the regime by treating people badly .
“ They were stupid , brutal , and looked down on the life of human beings .
They were the source of all kinds of violations , ” he wrote in “ Considering Cambodia ’s History - From the Beginning to Democratic Kampuchea ” , the country ’s name under Pol Pot .
Khieu Samphan was flown to the capital after suffering a fall last week at his home in the former Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin on the Thai border .
The long - awaited tribunal started work a few months ago after nearly a decade of delays caused by wrangling over jurisdiction and cash .
Full trials are expected to begin next year .
Former foreign minister Ieng Sary and his wife -- both life - long friends of “ Brother Number One ” Pol Pot -- were arrested and charged last week with crimes against humanity .

“ Brother Number Two ” Nuon Chea , who had also lived in Pailin , is in the custody of the court on similar charges , as is the Beijing - backed regime ’s chief jailer , Duch , who ran Phnom Penh ’s “ S - 21 ” torture and interrogation centre .
While Nuon Chea has proclaimed his innocence , Duch , in interviews with Western reporters , has confessed to his role in the mass killings and is expected to be a key witness against other senior regime figures .
Duch will be the first to make a public appearance at the tribunal when he appears for a bail hearing on Tuesday .
Khieu Samphan will be co-defended by the controversial French lawyer Jacques Verges , who knew Pol Pot in Paris in the early 1950s and flew into Phnom Penh on Monday , and Say Bory , a former president of Cambodia ’s lawyers ’ association .
Verges , known as the “ Terror Advocate ” whose previous clients include international guerrilla Carlos the Jackal and Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie , said in 2004 that Khieu Samphan had no blood on his hands and was just a young idealist embroiled in the politics of the Cold War .
Khieu Samphan was the leading intellectual among the small group of Cambodian students in 1950s Paris who became imbued with communism and returned home to the southeast Asian nation to form the core of the guerrilla movement that became the Khmer Rouge .
Pol Pot died in 1998 in the final Khmer Rouge redoubt of Anlong Veng .
Dr Rice said freed inmates could go on to jeopardize countries ' security US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has urged countries that have nationals who are inmates at Guantanamo Bay to help the US close the detention centre .
She told the BBC that such countries could guarantee the " bad people " held there would not be a danger if freed .
Ms Rice repeated the expressed wish of US President George W Bush 's administration to shut the camp .
But she said it must not be done at the expense of the safety of Americans and other people around the world .
She said the detention centre contained dangerous men who had been caught on the battlefield in Afghanistan and had been plotting against capitals in the US , Europe and South East Asia .
' Unsuspecting population ' BBC Washington correspondent Jonathan Beale asked Dr Rice if the US had plans to close the detention centre .
She replied : " Of course we would like to see Guantanamo close - there 's only one problem : what are you going to do with the bad people who are there ?
She added : " What are we going to do with them ?
Release them again on an unsuspecting population ?
I do n't think so .
About 300 prisoners are still held at Guantanamo Bay " One of the things that would help a lot is , in the discussions that we have with the states of which they are nationals , if we could get some of those countries to take them back ... and take them with constraints that ensure that they are not going to be a danger to society again .
" So we need some help in closing Guantanamo .
" Of course we 'd like to do it , but we 're not going to do it at the expense of the safety of Americans and other citizens . "
About 300 prisoners are held at Guantanamo Bay , which was set up at a US naval base in Cuba in early 2002 after the invasion of Afghanistan .

( CNN ) --
The husband of a Saudi rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison said his wife is " a crushed human being , " but blamed a judge -- not the Saudi judicial system -- for treating her as a criminal .
Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim .
Saudi society is respectful of women , he said , adding that he had faith his wife would get justice .
The ruling relates to an incident in March 2006 when the woman , then 18 and engaged to be married , and an unrelated man were abducted from a mall in Qatif , Saudi Arabia , by a group of seven men .
She was later raped .
In October , the men were convicted and sentenced to two to nine years in prison for the assault .
She was convicted of violating the kingdom 's strict Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her at the mall .
" From the outset , my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime , " said her 24 - year - old husband .
" She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes . "
The husband , who asked to remain unnamed , spoke to CNN senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr .
His wife , who he said is " a quiet , simple person who does not bother anyone , " is ill and too fragile to speak about the case , he said .
As her guardian under Saudi law , he is standing up for her publicly .
Watch the victim 's husband speak out »
The attack , trial and sentencing have taken a heavy toll on his wife 's already - poor health , he said .
She suffers from anemia , a blood disorder and asthma , and will have surgery next month to remove her gallbladder , he said .
" Since the attack , she 's been suffering from severe depression . "
The events ended her pursuit of an education past high school , he said .
" Her situation keeps changing from bad to worse , " he said .
" You could say she 's a crushed human being . "
" The court proceedings were like a spectacle at times , " he said .
" The criminals were allowed in the same room as my wife .
They were allowed to make all kinds of offensive gestures and give her dirty and threatening looks . "
Of the three judges at the trial , one of them " was mean and from the beginning dealt with my wife as guilty person who had done something wrong , " he said .
" Even when he pronounced the sentence , he said to her , ' You were involved in a suspicious relationship , and you deserve 200 lashes for that , ' " he said .
The judge dismissed her lawyer , Abdulrahman al - Lahim , after the two clashed in court , he said .
" The judge took things personally and was reacting to our lawyer , who 's a known human rights activist , " the husband said .
" The judge undermined the lawyer , decreased his role and then dismissed him from the case altogether .
The judge simply could n't work with our lawyer . "
The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes .
But when she appealed , the court more than doubled her sentence .
The husband said the judge was pursuing " a personal vendetta . "
" We were shocked when the judgment changed and her sentence was doubled , " the husband said .
" We were looking for pardon ; instead , she got double the whipping and more jail time . "
A court source told Arab News , an English - language Middle Eastern daily newspaper , that the woman 's sentence was increased after the woman spoke to the media about the case .
But a Saudi Justice Ministry statement said the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence .
" If this sentence is based on the law , then I would 've welcomed it , " the husband said .
" But it is harsh , and the Saudi society I know and belong to is more sympathetic than that .
I do not expect such harshness from Saudis , but rather compassion and support of the victim and her rights . "
Saudi society is very respectful to women in general , he said .
The case , which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system , has drawn a strong international reaction .
Human Rights
Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah " to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer . "
Under law in Saudi Arabia , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition on driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery .
Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man , and they are not allowed to vote .
The Saudi government recently has taken steps to better the situation of women in the kingdom , including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases , adoption of a new labor law and the creation of a human rights commission .

Washington More entering Army with criminal records WASHINGTON -- Nearly 12 percent of Army recruits who entered basic training this year needed a special waiver for those with criminal records , a dramatic increase over last year and 2 1 / 2 times the percentage four years ago , according to new Army statistics obtained by the Globe .
With less than three months left in the fiscal year , 11.6 percent of new active - duty and Army Reserve troops in 2007 have received a so - called " moral waiver , " up from 7.9 percent in fiscal year 2006 , according to figures from the US Army Recruiting Command .
In fiscal 2003 and 2004 , soldiers granted waivers accounted for 4.6 percent of new recruits ; in 2005 , it was 6.2 percent .
Army officials acknowledge privately that the increase in moral waivers reflects the difficulty of signing up sufficient numbers of recruits to sustain an increasingly unpopular war in Iraq ; the Army fell short of its monthly recruiting goals in May and June .
Since Oct. 1 , 2006 , when the fiscal year began , more than 8,000 of the roughly 69,000 recruits have been granted waivers for offenses ranging in seriousness from misdemeanors such as vandalism to felonies such as burglary and aggravated assault .
Army officials say the majority of such recruits committed relatively minor offenses and have not been in prison .
They point out that waivers are granted only after a careful review of each soldier 's history -- and only when the applicant has shown remorse or changed behavior .
But former military officials and defense specialists said they fear that enlisting more soldiers with criminal backgrounds will increase the risk of disciplinary problems and criminal activity among soldiers in uniform .
" Somebody who has demonstrated themselves to be guilty of misbehavior in civilian life has a good chance of behaving in the same way in the military , " said John Hutson , judge advocate general of the Navy until 2000 and now dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center at the University of New Hampshire .
Hutson said he witnessed the consequences of allowing former criminal offenders to join the ranks in the 1970s , the last time the military enlisted high numbers of soldiers with criminal histories .
The numbers of recruits with criminal pasts who were allowed to join in the 1970s is not available , according to the Army .
But Hutson said such soldiers often showed up in military court for committing new offenses .
" There were all kinds of what I call ' frustration offenses , ' " he said , citing drug use , burglary , and violent behavior .
" Some people are incapable of coping with the regimen of military life so they act out in all kinds of ways . "
Moral waivers must be approved by an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel or higher and are required when an Army applicant has been found guilty of committing four or more minor offenses such as littering or disorderly conduct -- or two to four misdemeanors such as larcency , trespassing , or vandalism .
Applicants who have committed a single felony such as arson , burglary , aggravated assault , breaking and entering , or marijuana possession must also receive a moral waiver to join .
Applicants with more than one felony -- or with a single conviction for a more serious crime such as homicide , sexual violence , or drug trafficking -- are not eligible .
" In most cases we see , the charges were from a period of time when the applicant was young and immature , " said a two - page statement from the Army Recruiting Command , based in Fort Knox , Ky. , provided in response to queries from the Globe .
" We look at the recent history such as employment , schooling , references , and signs of remorse and changed behavior since the incident occurred as part of the waiver process , " the statement said .
" The Army does not rehabilitate enlistees who receive waivers ; they have already overcome their mistakes . "
Allowing former criminals to fight for their country " is the right thing to do for those Americans who want to answer the call of duty , " the statement said .
But other Defense Department officials maintain that the rise in criminal waivers is also a direct result of the Army 's struggle to meet recruiting targets .
" There is terrific pressure put on the recruiters , " said Alan Gropman , a professor at the Pentagon 's National Defense University .
" They have to meet their mission so they request more waivers .
In order to make the numbers they have to lower the standards . "
Since 2003 the Pentagon has taken unprecedented steps to try to meet its recruiting goals , including lowering education standards , raising the maximum age , and steadily increasing the amount of bonuses for new volunteers .
But granting more waivers for criminals , specialists said , could end up backfiring .
One former senior Defense official , who remains a consultant to the Pentagon , said there is growing concern in the ranks that members of street gangs have been joining the military and then engaging in criminal activity .
A spokesman for the Army 's Criminal Investigative Division said he was not aware of any formal investigation into gang activity in the Army .
But David Isenberg , a senior analyst at the British American Security Information Council , a nonpartisan Washington think tank , said studies from past decades indicate that soldiers with criminal histories were more likely to violate military regulations .
" The worse . . . moral background you came from , the lousier job you did , not only in terms of your personal performance but in dragging down unit cohesion , " said Isenberg , a Navy veteran .
Even some of the staunchest supporters of the Iraq war believe the Army is signing up too many people with criminal histories .
" The military depends on good order and discipline and we should be seeking the type of recruits most likely to fill that profile , " said Elaine Donnelly , president of the Center for Military Readiness , a conservative advocacy group in Washington .

State - Driven Game Agent Design
Note : the text for this tutorial comprises part of the second chapter of the book Programming Game AI by Example .
Its appearance online is a cunningly disguised attempt to tempt you into purchasing said book .
I have no shame .
Buy the book , you ’ll enjoy it .
J
Finite state machines , or FSMs as they are usually referred to , have for many years been the AI coder ’s instrument of choice to imbue a game agent with the illusion of intelligence .
You will find FSMs of one kind or another in just about every game to hit the shelves since the early days of video games , and despite the increasing popularity of more esoteric agent architectures , they are going to be around for a long time to come .
Here are just some of the reasons why :
· They are quick and simple to code .
There are many ways of programming a finite state machine and almost all of them are reasonably simple to implement .
You ’ll see several alternatives described in this article together with the pros and cons of using them .
· They are easy to debug .
Because a game agent ’s behavior is broken down into easily manageable chunks , if an agent starts acting strangely , it can be debugged by adding tracer code to each state .
In this way , the AI programmer can easily follow the sequence of events that precedes the buggy behavior and take action accordingly .
· They have little computational overhead .
Finite state machines use hardly any precious processor time because they essentially follow hard - coded rules .
There is no real “ thinking ” involved beyond the if - this - then - that sort of thought process .
· They are intuitive .
It ’s human nature to think about things as being in one state or another and we often refer to ourselves as being in such and such a state .
How many times have you “ got yourself into a state ” or found yourself in “ the right state of mind ” ?
Humans do n’t really work like finite state machines of course , but sometimes we find it useful to think of our behavior in this way .
Similarly , it is fairly easy to break down a game agent ’s behavior into a number of states and to create the rules required for manipulating them .
For the same reason , finite state machines also make it easy for you to discuss the design of your AI with non-programmers ( with game producers and level designers for example ) , providing improved communication and exchange of ideas .
· They are flexible .
A game agent ’s finite state machine can easily be adjusted and tweaked by the programmer to provide the behavior required by the game designer .
It ’s also a simple matter to expand the scope of an agent ’s behavior by adding new states and rules .
In addition , as your AI skills grow you ’ll find that finite state machines provide a solid backbone with which you can combine other techniques such as fuzzy logic or neural networks .
What Exactly Is a Finite State Machine ?
Historically , a finite state machine is a rigidly formalized device used by mathematicians to solve problems .
The most famous finite state machine is probably Alan Turing ’s hypothetical device : the Turing machine , which he wrote about in his 1936 paper , “ On Computable Numbers . ”
This was a machine presaging modern - day programmable computers that could perform any logical operation by reading , writing , and erasing symbols on an infinitely long strip of tape .
Fortunately , as AI programmers , we can forgo the formal mathematical definition of a finite state machine ; a descriptive one will suffice :
A finite state machine is a device , or a model of a device , which has a finite number of states it can be in at any given time and can operate on input to either make transitions from one state to another or to cause an output or action to take place .
A finite state machine can only be in one state at any moment in time .
The idea behind a finite state machine , therefore , is to decompose an object ’s behavior into easily manageable “ chunks ” or states .
The light switch on your wall , for example , is a very simple finite state machine .
It has two states : on and off .
Transitions between states are made by the input of your finger .
By flicking the switch up it makes the transition from off to on , and by flicking the switch down it makes the transition from on to off .
There is no output or action associated with the off state ( unless you consider the bulb being off as an action ) , but when it is in the on state electricity is allowed to flow through the switch and light up your room via the filament in a lightbulb .
See Figure 2.1 .
Figure 2.1 .
A light switch is a finite state machine .
( Note that the switches are reversed in Europe and many other parts of the world . )
Of course , the behavior of a game agent is usually much more complex than a lightbulb ( thank goodness ! ) .
Here are some examples of how finite state machines have been used in games .
· The ghosts ’ behavior in Pac - Man is implemented as a finite state machine .
There is one Evade state , which is the same for all ghosts , and then each ghost has its own Chase state , the actions of which are implemented differently for each ghost .
The input of the player eating one of the power pills is the condition for the transition from Chase to Evade .
The input of a timer running down is the condition for the transition from Evade to Chase .
· Quake - style bots are implemented as finite state machines .
They have states such as FindArmor , FindHealth , SeekCover , and RunAway .
Even the weapons in Quake implement their own mini finite state machines .
For example , a rocket may implement states such as Move , TouchObject , and Die .
· Players in sports simulations such as the soccer game FIFA2002 are implemented as state machines .
They have states such as Strike , Dribble , ChaseBall , and MarkPlayer .
In addition , the teams themselves are often implemented as FSMs and can have states such as KickOff , Defend , or WalkOutOn Field .
· The NPCs ( non-player characters ) in RTSs ( real - time strategy games ) such as Warcraft make use of finite state machines .
They have states such as MoveToPosition , Patrol , and FollowPath .
Implementing a Finite State Machine
There are a number of ways of implementing finite state machines .
A naive approach is to use a series of if - then statements or the slightly tidier mechanism of a switch statement .
Using a switch with an enumerated type to represent the states looks something like this :
enum StateType{state_RunAway , state_Patrol , state_Attack} ; void Agent :: UpdateState ( StateType CurrentState ) { switch ( CurrentState ) { case state_RunAway : EvadeEnemy ( ) ; if ( Safe ( ) ) { ChangeState( state_Patrol ) ; } break ; case state_Patrol : FollowPatrolPath ( ) ; if ( Threatened ( ) ) { if ( StrongerThanEnemy ( ) ) { ChangeState( state_Attack ) ; } else { ChangeState( state_RunAway ) ; } } break ; case state_Attack : if ( WeakerThanEnemy ( ) ) { ChangeState( state_RunAway ) ; } else { BashEnemyOverHead( ) ; } break ; }//end switch }
Although at first glance this approach seems reasonable , when applied practically to anything more complicated than the simplest of game objects , the switch / if - then solution becomes a monster lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce .
As more states and conditions are added , this sort of structure ends up looking like spaghetti very quickly , making the program flow difficult to understand and creating a debugging nightmare .
In addition , it ’s inflexible and difficult to extend beyond the scope of its original design , should that be desirable … and as we all know , it most often is .
Unless you are designing a state machine to implement very simple behavior ( or you are a genius ) , you will almost certainly find yourself first tweaking the agent to cope with unplanned - for circumstances before honing the behavior to get the results you thought you were going to get when you first planned out the state machine !
Additionally , as an AI coder , you will often require that a state perform a specific action ( or actions ) when it ’s initially entered or when the state is exited .
For example , when an agent enters the state RunAway you may want it to wave its arms in the air and scream “ Arghhhhhhh ! ”
When it finally escapes and changes state to Patrol , you may want it to emit a sigh , wipe its forehead , and say “ Phew ! ”
These are actions that only occur when the RunAway state is entered or exited and not during the usual update step .
Consequently , this additional functionality must ideally be built into your state machine architecture .
To do this within the framework of a switch or if - then architecture would be accompanied by lots of teeth grinding and waves of nausea , and produce very ugly code indeed .
State Transition Tables
A better mechanism for organizing states and affecting state transitions is a state transition table .
This is just what it says it is : a table of conditions and the states those conditions lead to .
Table 2.1 shows an example of the mapping for the states and conditions shown in the previous example .
Table 2.1 .
A simple state transition table
Current State Condition State Transition Runaway Safe Patrol Attack WeakerThanEnemy RunAway Patrol Threatened AND StrongerThanEnemy Attack Patrol Threatened AND WeakerThanEnemy RunAway
This table can be queried by an agent at regular intervals , enabling it to make any necessary state transitions based on the stimulus it receives from the game environment .
Each state can be modeled as a separate object or function existing external to the agent , providing a clean and flexible architecture .
One that is much less prone to spaghettification than the if - then / switch approach discussed in the previous section .
Someone once told me a vivid and silly visualization can help people to understand an abstract concept .
Let ’s see if it works …
Imagine a robot kitten .
It ’s shiny yet cute , has wire for whiskers and a slot in its stomach where cartridges — analogous to its states — can be plugged in .
Each of these cartridges is programmed with logic , enabling the kitten to perform a specific set of actions .
Each set of actions encodes a different behavior ; for example , play_with_string , eat_fish , or poo_on_carpet .
Without a cartridge stuffed inside its belly the kitten is an inanimate metallic sculpture , only able to sit there and look cute … in a Metal Mickey kind of way .
The kitten is very dexterous and has the ability to autonomously exchange its cartridge for another if instructed to do so .
By providing the rules that dictate when a cartridge should be switched , it ’s possible to string together sequences of cartridge insertions permitting the creation of all sorts of interesting and complicated behavior .
These rules are programmed onto a tiny chip situated inside the kitten ’s head , which is analogous to the state transition table we discussed earlier .
The chip communicates with the kitten ’s internal functions to retrieve the information necessary to process the rules ( such as how hungry Kitty is or how playful it ’s feeling ) .
As a result , the state transition chip can be programmed with rules like :
IF Kitty_Hungry AND NOT Kitty_Playful SWITCH_CARTRIDGE
eat_fish
All the rules in the table are tested each time step and instructions are sent to Kitty to switch cartridges accordingly .
This type of architecture is very flexible , making it easy to expand the kitten ’s repertoire by adding new cartridges .
Each time a new cartridge is added , the owner is only required to take a screwdriver to the kitten ’s head in order to remove and reprogram the state transition rule chip .
It is not necessary to interfere with any other internal circuitry .
Embedded Rules
An alternative approach is to embed the rules for the state transitions within the states themselves .
Applying this concept to Robo - Kitty , the state transition chip can be dispensed with and the rules moved directly into the cartridges .
For instance , the cartridge for play_with_string can monitor the kitty ’s level of hunger and instruct it to switch cartridges for the eat_fish cartridge when it senses hunger rising .
In turn the eat_fish cartridge can monitor the kitten ’s bowel and instruct it to switch to the poo_on_carpet cartridge when it senses poo levels are running dangerously high .
Although each cartridge may be aware of the existence of any of the other cartridges , each is a self - contained unit and not reliant on any external logic to decide whether or not it should allow itself to be swapped for an alternative .
As a consequence , it ’s a straightforward matter to add states or even to swap the whole set of cartridges for a completely new set ( maybe ones that make little Kitty behave like a raptor ) .
There ’s no need to take a screwdriver to the kitten ’s head , only to a few of the cartridges themselves .
Let ’s take a look at how this approach is implemented within the context of a video game .
Just like Kitty ’s cartridges , states are encapsulated as objects and contain the logic required to facilitate state transitions .
In addition , all state objects share a common interface : a pure virtual class named State .
Here ’s a version that provides a simple interface :
class State { public : virtual void Execute ( Troll * troll ) = 0 ; } ;
Now imagine a Troll class that has member variables for attributes such as health , anger , stamina , etc. , and an interface allowing a client to query and adjust those values .
A Troll can be given the functionality of a finite state machine by adding a pointer to an instance of a derived object of the State class , and a method permitting a client to change the instance the pointer is pointing to .
class Troll {
/* ATTRIBUTES OMITTED */ State * m_pCurrentState ; public : /* INTERFACE TO ATTRIBUTES OMITTED */ void Update ( ) { m_pCurrentState -> Execute ( this ) ; } void ChangeState ( const State * pNewState ) { delete m_pCurrentState ; m_pCurrentState = pNewState ; } } ;
When the Update method of a Troll is called , it in turn calls the Execute method of the current state type with the this pointer .
The current state may then use the Troll interface to query its owner , to adjust its owner ’s attributes , or to effect a state transition .
In other words , how a Troll behaves when updated can be made completely dependent on the logic in its current state .
This is best illustrated with an example , so let ’s create a couple of states to enable a troll to run away from enemies when it feels threatened and to sleep when it feels safe .
//----------------------------------State_Runaway class State_RunAway : public State { public : void Execute ( Troll* troll ) { if ( troll -> isSafe ( ) ) { troll -> ChangeState ( new State_Sleep ( ) ) ; } else { troll -> MoveAwayFromEnemy ( ) ; } } } ; //----------------------------------State_Sleep class State_Sleep : public State { public : void Execute ( Troll* troll ) { if ( troll -> isThreatened ( ) ) { troll -> ChangeState ( new State_RunAway ( ) ) } else { troll -> Snore ( ) ; } } } ;
As you can see , when updated , a troll will behave differently depending on which of the states m_pCurrentState points to .
Both states are encapsulated as objects and both provide the rules effecting state transition .
All very neat and tidy .
This architecture is known as the state design pattern and provides an elegant way of implementing state - driven behavior .
Although this is a departure from the mathematical formalization of an FSM , it is intuitive , simple to code , and easily extensible .
It also makes it extremely easy to add enter and exit actions to each state ; all you have to do is create Enter and Exit methods and adjust the agent ’s ChangeState method accordingly .
You ’ll see the code that does exactly this very shortly .
Chris Matthews : Democratic establishment will ' kill the fire of insurgency ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This Chris Matthews appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe on the morning of the New Hampshire primary to describe how he expects the Democratic Party establishment to destroy Barack Obama 's candidacy and ensure the nomination for Hillary Clinton .
" There 's a battle in the Democratic Party between the idealists and the interest groups , " Matthews began .
" And in the beginning of every Democratic campaign for president , there 's an idealist who comes forward ... and they do very well in the first offing .
...
And then the interest groups get all called in , the meal tickets , all the people that get something out of the party are bussed in , trucked in from out of town ... and they blow away the idealist . "
" It has been done so many times , " he continued .
" Kill the fire of insurgency .
And when that 's killed , then you go back to the same old interest group politics . "
" Once in a while , someone comes along and shakes things up , " Matthews acknowledged .
" It 's a phenomenal thing .
And it 's going on now .
It 'll go on through tonight .
But at some time , it 's going to be really challenged by the forces of the establishment , by the status quo , by the interest groups and the big - money contributors , and they 're going to try to put this fire out . "
" They will find some way to counter this power .
You watch it .
It 's scorched earth , but the establishment in American politics almost always wins .
...
All the people around the Clintons ... are getting together to try to figure out how to stop this .
These are pros , who win year after year .
" They are under threat right now , because if Obama wins , they lose , " Matthews went on , turning aside Scarborough 's suggestions that this year the dynamics might be different .
" If you think it 's going to happen , then you are definitely a dreamer .
Maybe I am too .
But I 've seen this dream die so many times . "
" They 'll play on every heartstring .
They 'll make Hillary a more sympathetic figure , " Matthews predicted , saying that between now and Super Tuesday on February 5 , the newspapers will fall over themselves to give us " the new Hillary , the softer Hillary , the humble Hillary . "
" The fawning journalism is yet to come , " concluded Matthews .
" It 's absolutely predictable .

Oh , it 's coming ! "

Data Parallel Haskell
Searching for Parallel Haskell ?
DPH is a fantastic effort , but it 's not the only way to do parallelism in Haskell .
Try the Parallel Haskell portal for a more general view .
Data Parallel
Haskell is the codename for an extension to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and its libraries to support nested data parallelism with a focus to utilise multicore CPUs .
Nested data parallelism extends the programming model of flat data parallelism , as known from parallel Fortran dialects , to irregular parallel computations ( such as divide - and - conquer algorithms ) and irregular data structures ( such as sparse matrices and tree structures ) .
An introduction to nested data parallelism in Haskell , including some examples , can be found in the paper Nepal – Nested Data - Parallelism in Haskell .
This is the performance of a dot product of two vectors of 10 million doubles each using Data Parallel Haskell .
Both machines have 8 cores .
Each core of the T2 has 8 hardware thread contexts .
Project status
Data Parallel Haskell ( DPH ) is available as an add - on for GHC 7.4 in the form of a few separate cabal package .
All major components of DPH are implemented , including code vectorisation and parallel execution on multicore systems .
However , the implementation has many limitations and probably also many bugs .
Major limitations include the inability to mix vectorised and non-vectorised code in a single Haskell module , the need to use a feature - deprived , special - purpose Prelude for vectorised code , and a lack of optimisations ( leading to poor performance in some cases ) .
The current implementation should work well for code with nested parallelism , where the depth of nesting is statically fixed or no user - defined nested - parallel datatypes are used .
Support for user - defined nested - parallel datatypes is still rather experimental and will likely result in inefficient code .
DPH focuses on irregular data parallelism .
For regular data parallel code in Haskell , please consider using the companion library Repa , which builds on the parallel array infrastructure of DPH .
Note :
This page describes version 0.6.* of the DPH libraries .
We only support this version of DPH as well as the current development version .
Disclaimer : Data Parallel
Haskell is very much work in progress .
Some components are already usable , and we explain here how to use them .
However , please be aware that APIs are still in flux and functionality may change during development .
Where to get it
To get DPH , install GHC 7.4 and then install the DPH libraries with cabal install as follows :
$ cabal update
$ cabal install dph-examples
This will install all DPH packages , including a set of simple examples , see dph-examples .
( The package dph-examples does depend on OpenGL and Gloss as both are used in a visualiser for the nobody example . )
WARNING : The vanilla GHC distribution does not include cabal install .
This is in contrast to the Haskell Platform , which does include cabal install .
If you want to avoid installing the cabal - intstall package and its dependencies explicitly , simply install GHC 7.4.1 in addition to your current Haskell Platform installation .
( How to do that depends on your platform and personal preferences .
One option is to install a bindist into your home directory with symbolic links to the binaries including the version number . )
Then , install DPH with the following command :
cabal install -- with-compiler=`which ghc - 7.4.1` -- with-hc-pkg=`which ghc-pkg-7.4.1` dph-examples
Overview
From a user 's point of view , Data Parallel Haskell adds a new data type to Haskell –namely , parallel arrays– as well as operations on parallel arrays .
Syntactically , parallel arrays are like lists , only that instead of square brackets [ and ] , parallel arrays use square brackets with a colon [ : and :] .
In particular , [ :e : ] is the type of parallel arrays with elements of type e ; the expression [ :x , y , z : ] denotes a three element parallel array with elements x , y , and z ; and [ :x + 1 | x <- xs : ] represents a simple array comprehension .
More sophisticated array comprehensions ( including the equivalent of parallel list comprehensions ) as well as enumerations and pattern matching proceed in an analog manner .
Moreover , the array library of DPH defines variants of most list operations from the Haskell Prelude and the standard List library ( e.g. , we have lengthP , sumP , mapP , and so on ) .
The two main differences between lists and parallel arrays are that ( 1 ) parallel arrays are a strict data structure and ( 2 ) that they are not inductively defined .
Parallel arrays are strict in that by using a single element , all elements of an array are demanded .
Hence , all elements of a parallel array might be evaluated in parallel .
To facilitate such parallel evaluation , operations on parallel arrays should treat arrays as aggregate structures that are manipulated in their entirety ( instead of the inductive , element - wise processing that is the foundation of all Haskell list functions . )
As a consequence , parallel arrays are always finite , and standard functions that yield infinite lists , such as enumFrom and repeat , have no corresponding array operation .
Moreover , parallel arrays only have an undirected fold function foldP that requires an associative function as an argument – such a fold function has a parallel step complexity of O ( log n ) for arrays of length n.
Parallel arrays also come with some aggregate operations that are absent from the standard list library , such as permuteP .
A simple example
As a simple example of a DPH program , consider the following code that computes the dot product of two vectors given as parallel arrays :
dotp :: Num a => [ : a : ] -> [ : a : ] -> a dotp xs ys = sumP [ : x * y | x <- xs | y <- ys : ]
This code uses an array variant of parallel list comprehensions , which could alternatively be written as [ :x * y | ( x , y ) <- zipP xs ys : ] , but should otherwise be self - explanatory to any Haskell programmer .
Running DPH programs
Unfortunately , we cannot use the above implementation of dotp directly in the current preliminary implementation of DPH .
In the following , we will discuss how the code needs to be modified and how it needs to be compiled and run for parallel execution .
GHC applies an elaborate transformation to DPH code , called vectorisation , that turns nested into flat data parallelism .
This transformation is only useful for code that is executed in parallel ( i.e. , code that manipulates parallel arrays ) , but for parallel code it dramatically simplifies load balancing .
No type classes
Unfortunately , vectorisation does not handle type classes at the moment .
Hence , we currently need to avoid overloaded operations in parallel code .
To account for that limitation , we specialise dotp on doubles .
dotp_double :: [ : Double : ] -> [ : Double : ] ->
Double dotp_double xs ys = sumP [ : x * y | x <- xs | y <- ys : ]
Special Prelude
As the current implementation of vectorisation cannot handle some language constructs , we cannot use it to vectorise those parts of the standard Prelude that might be used in parallel code ( such as arithmetic operations ) .
Instead , DPH comes with its own ( rather limited ) Prelude in Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude plus three extra modules to support one numeric type each Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Float , Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Double , Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Int , and Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Word8 .
These four modules support the same functions ( on different types ) and if a program needs to use more than one , they need to be imported qualified ( as we can not use type classes in vectorised code in the current version ) .
Moreover , we have Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Bool .
If your code needs any other numeric types or functions that are not implemented in these Prelude modules , you currently need to implement and vectorise that functionality yourself .
To compile dotp_double , we add the following import statements :
import qualified Prelude import Data .
Array .
Parallel import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Double
Impedance matching
Special care is needed at the interface between vectorised and non-vectorised code .
Currently , only simple types can be passed between these different kinds of code .
In particular , parallel arrays ( which might be nested ) cannot be passed .
Instead , we need to pass flat arrays of type PArray .
This type is exported by our special - purpose Prelude together with a conversion function from PArrayP ( which is specific to the element type due to the lack of type classes in vectorised code ) .
Using this conversion function , we define a wrapper function for dotp_double that we export and use from non-vectorised code .
dotp_wrapper :: PArray Double -> PArray Double -> Double {-# NOINLINE dotp_wrapper #-} dotp_wrapper v w = dotp_double ( fromPArrayP v ) ( fromPArrayP w )
It is important to mark this function as NOINLINE as we do n't want it to be inlined into non-vectorised code .
Compiling vectorised code
The syntax for parallel arrays is an extension to Haskell 2010 that needs to be enabled with the language option ParallelArrays .
Furthermore , we need to explicitly tell GHC if we want to vectorise a module by using the - fvectorise option .
Currently , GHC either vectorises all code in a module or none .
This can be inconvenient as some parts of a program cannot be vectorised – for example , code in the IO monad ( the radical re-ordering of computations performed by the vectorisation transformation is only valid for pure code ) .
As a consequence , the programmer currently needs to partition vectorised and non-vectorised code carefully over different modules .
Overall , we get the following complete module definition for the dot - product code :
{-# LANGUAGE ParallelArrays #-} {-# OPTIONS_GHC - fvectorise #-} module DotP ( dotp_wrapper ) where import qualified Prelude import Data .
Array .
Parallel import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Double dotp_double :: [ : Double : ] -> [ : Double : ] ->
Double dotp_double xs ys = sumP [ : x * y | x <- xs | y <- ys : ] dotp_wrapper :: PArray Double -> PArray Double -> Double {-# NOINLINE dotp_wrapper #-} dotp_wrapper v w = dotp_double ( fromPArrayP v ) ( fromPArrayP w )
Assuming the module is in a file DotP.hs , we compile it as follows :
ghc -c - Odph - fdph- par DotP.hs
The option - Odph enables a predefined set of GHC optimisation options that works best for DPH code and - fdph - par selects the standard parallel DPH backend library .
( This is currently the only relevant backend , but there may be others in the future . )
Using vectorised code
Finally , we need a main module that calls the vectorised code , but is itself not vectorised , so that it may contain I/O .
In this simple example , we convert two simple lists to parallel arrays , compute their dot product , and print the result :
import Data .
Array .
Parallel import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
PArray ( PArray , fromList ) import DotP ( dotp_wrapper ) -- import vectorised code main :: IO ( ) main = let v = fromList [ 1 .. 10 ] -- convert lists ... w = fromList [ 1 , 2 .. 20 ] -- ... to parallel arrays result = dotp_wrapper v w -- invoke vectorised code in print result -- print the result
We compile this module with
ghc -c - Odph - fdph- par Main.hs
and finally link the two modules into an executable dotp with
ghc -o dotp - threaded - fdph- par - rtsopts DotP. o Main.o
We need the - threaded option to link with GHC 's multi- threaded runtime and - fdph - par to link with the standard parallel DPH backend .
We include - rtsopts to be able to explicitly determine the number of OS threads used to execute our code .
Generating input data
To see any benefit from parallel execution , a data - parallel program needs to operate on a sufficiently large data set .
Hence , instead of two small constant vectors , we might want to generate some larger input data :
import System .
Random ( newStdGen ) import Data .
Array .
Parallel import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
PArray ( PArray , randomRs ) import DotP ( dotp_wrapper ) -- import vectorised code main :: IO ( ) main = do gen1 <- newStdGen gen2 <- newStdGen let v = randomRs n range gen1 w = randomRs n range gen2 print $ dotp_wrapper v w -- invoke vectorised code and print the result where n = 10000 -- vector length range = ( - 100 , 100 ) -- range of vector elements
We compile and link the program as described above .
NOTE : The code as presented is unsuitable for benchmarking as we would n't want to measure the purely sequential random number generation ( that dominates this simple program ) .
For benchmarking , we would want to guarantee that the generated vectors are fully evaluated before taking the time .
The module Data .
Array .
Parallel .
PArray exports the function nf for this purpose .
For a variant of the dot - product example code that determines the CPU time consumed by dotp_wrapper , see timed dot product .
Parallel execution
By default , a Haskell program uses only one OS thread , and hence , also only one CPU core for execution .
To use multiple cores , we need to invoke the executable with an explicit RTS command line option — e.g. , ./ dotp +RTS - N2 uses two cores .
( Strictly speaking , it uses two OS threads , which will be scheduled on two separate cores if available . )
To determine the runtime of parallel code , measuring CPU time , as demonstrated in the timed variant of the dot product example , is not sufficient anymore .
We need to measure wall clock times instead .
For proper benchmarking , it is advisable to use a library , such as criterion .
A beautiful property of DPH is that the number of threads used to execute a program only affects its performance , but not the result .
So , it is fine to do all debugging concerning correctness with just one core and to move to multiple cores only for performance debugging .
Data Parallel
Haskell –and more generally , GHC 's multi- threading support– currently only aims at multicore processors or uniform memory access ( UMA ) multi-processors .
Performance on non-uniform memory access ( NUMA ) machines is often bad as GHC 's runtime makes no effort at optimising placement .
Further examples and documentation
Further examples are available in the examples directory of the package dph source .
This code also includes reference implementations for some of the example that are useful for benchmarking .
The interfaces of the various components of the DPH library are in the library documentation on Hackage .
Designing parallel programs
Data Parallel
Haskell is a high - level language to code parallel algorithms .
Like plain Haskell , DPH frees the programmer from many low - level operational considerations ( such as thread creation , thread synchronisation , critical sections , and deadlock avoidance ) .
Nevertheless , the full responsibility for parallel algorithm design and many performance considerations ( such as when does a computation have sufficient parallelism to make it worthwhile to exploit that parallelism ) are still with the programmer .
DPH encourages a data - driven style of parallel programming and , in good Haskell tradition , puts the choice of data types first .
Specifically , the choice between using lists or parallel arrays for a data structure determines whether operations on the structure will be executed sequentially or in parallel .
In addition to suitably combining standard lists and parallel arrays , it is often also useful to embed parallel arrays in a user - defined inductive structure , such as the following definition of parallel rose trees :
data RTree a = RNode [ : RTree a : ]
The tree is inductively defined ; hence , tree traversals will proceed sequentially , level by level .
However , the children of each node are held in parallel arrays , and hence , may be traversed in parallel .
This structure is , for example , useful in parallel adaptive algorithms based on a hierarchical decomposition , such as the Barnes - Hut algorithm for solving the N - body problem as discussed in more detail in the paper Harnessing the Multicores : Nested Data Parallelism in Haskell .
For a general introduction to nested data parallelism and its cost model , see Blelloch 's Programming Parallel Algorithms .
Further reading and information on the implementation
DPH has two major components : ( 1 ) the vectorisation transformation and ( 2 ) the generic DPH library for flat parallel arrays .
The vectorisation transformation turns nested into flat data - parallelism and is described in detail in the paper Harnessing the Multicores : Nested Data Parallelism in Haskell .
The generic array library maps flat data - parallelism to GHC 's multi- threaded multicore support and is described in the paper Data Parallel Haskell : a status report .
The same topics are also covered in the slides for the two talks Nested data parallelism in Haskell and Compiling nested data parallelism by program transformation .
For further reading , consult this collection of background papers , and pointers to other people 's work .
If you are really curious and like to know implementation details and the internals of the Data Parallel Haskell project , much of it is described on the GHC developer wiki on the pages covering data parallelism and type families .

Please file bug reports at GHC 's bug tracker .
Moreover , comments and suggestions are very welcome .

_ そういえば、某ロードバランサ箱の中をのぞいてみたら、タダで勝手に使えるけど自由ではないライセンスの deamontools のかわりに、同じような使い勝手で BSD ライセンス類似の runit が動いててニヤリとしたな。この LB 箱が将来バージョンアップしたら、しれっと PDS 版の daemontools に置きかわってたりして。ちなみに、runit は使ったことないけど、この人が作ってる tcpserver の類似ブツ は本家より使い勝手がよくて機能も豊富 。
_ これまで頑として修正版の配布を拒否してきた djb がまるっきり方向転換したのはなんでなんだろ。obsolete になったコードだから公開するという理由ではなく、将来にわたってそうするということなので、なんか思うところがあるんだと思うんだけど。djb の発言をぜんぶ追ってはいないんだけど、そのへんについて言及はあるのかしらん。
_ ダメだと思うけどね 。
_ /.j のコメントでなぜかわしの 日記が触れられてたけど、そこで指摘したのは主に以下の点。
機能が足りな い
パッチ地獄で安全性の検証が不十分
まともなログが取れない
_ が、それでもやっぱりダメ。よく知られているように、qmail って1通のメールに複数の受信者がいた場合、別々のメールに宛先をバラして送ってしまうわけだ。この戦略は、以前は帯域の問題で嫌がられたけど、今はウィルスやら spam やらのコンテンツフィルタのために困るんだ。巨大な添付ファイルを取引先の関係者全員で
Cc するなんてのは日常茶飯事なわけで、そんなのが宛先アドレスごとに分割されて同じメールを何度も処理させるなんてのはほとんど
DoS 攻撃だ。そういう送り方が禁止されているわけじゃないけど、できるだけ避けるべきだ。最近はマシンの性能も上がってるけど、フィルタが複雑なことをやってるし spam はどんどん増える一方なので、大量メールへの耐性がそれほど上がってるとはいえない。だいたい、性能が上がってるからうんぬんなんてのは、送り手が勝手に決めていい問題じゃないよね。帯域消費は送信側も影響あるけど、コンテンツフィルタの負荷は受信側だけで送る方にはペナルティがないのだ。相手を死にそうにさせてるのに自分では気がつかんのだからタチが悪い。
_ フィルタ負荷は受信側だけだけど、分割配送が送信側にデメリットになることもある。分割配送ってのはつまり大量の
SMTP コネクションを張る配送方法なわけだが、最近では大手の
ISP や携帯キャリアのほとんどが、押しよせる spam への対抗策として MTA への同時接続数や時間あたりの接続数に制限をかけている。つまり、qmail は 4xx で蹴られまくるわけだ 。4xx で蹴られるならまだマシで 、TCP 的に応答しなくなるような制限をかけるところもある。こういうところに大量に送ろうとすると並列配送数の上限いっぱいのプロセスがぜんぶタイムアウト待ちになって、それ以外の宛先へのメール配送までブロックされるという欠陥まで抱えている。今後接続レート制御は大手
ISP だけでなく小さなところでも導入は進むと思われるので、qmail が当初設計されていたころよりもこの配送方式の効率は悪化していくだろう。
_ で、 この送信戦略は qmail の設計の根本部分なので改造でどうにかなるってものじゃない。新しい
MTA を作り直すのと手間は大して変わらん。個別配送のメリットはコードの単純性以外にはなく、パフォーマンスその他のメリットはないんだから、それを作り変えるというのはそもそもの設計思想自体の修正を意味する。要するに、qmail がパブリックドメインになったとしても、それを発展させる意義は薄いのだ。今度の措置で一時的に qmail が強化されて便利になることは十分ありうるけど、でもそのうちライセンスとは別の問題でどん詰まりになって衰退することになると思う。少なくとも、小規模なサイトでしか使いものにならん代物になるだろう(まあ、今でも大規模サイトでは使いものにならんが ) 。
_ ちなみに、上の議論はそのまますべて ML やメルマガにおける VERP にもあてはまる 。ML はともかくメルマガでは巨大な添付ファイルは送らんだろうからコンテンツフィルタ負荷の問題はそれほど大きくはならないと思うけれども。
This is happening because the entrenched interests put wealth over work .
That 's going to change with President Edwards :
As President , John Edwards will put American workers and jobs first , not last as it has been for so many years :
" Today , the Economic Policy Institute issued a report that should come as a clarion call to everyone concerned about the impact of unfair trade agreements and practices on America ’s working families .
In their report , the EPI concludes that between 25 to 30 million American jobs -- about one in five American jobs -- in states all across the nation , are at risk for being offshored over the next decade .
And it ’s not just manufacturing jobs – the report shows those jobs that require at least a four - year college degree are actually the most at risk .
" This report makes clear what the labor community has known for far too long : bad trade deals , cheap foreign labor , illegal foreign subsidies and foreign currency manipulation are having a devastating effect on American workers .
These practices are stealing the American Dream from the middle class and the broken system in Washington is allowing it to happen .
Given this reality , I find it alarming that Senator Clinton and Senator Obama have chosen to support a flawed Peru Trade deal that will only further expand the NAFTA - model that has already cost us well over a million jobs .
" As Democrats , we can and must do better .
It ’s time for us to show a little backbone and stand up for America ’s working families .
As president , the first and last question I will ask before signing any trade deal is , ‘ Is this good for American workers and American jobs ? ’
" When I am president , I will put American workers and jobs first , and make sure we invest in the American workforce by putting more resources toward education and innovation and building a new energy economy with over a million new green - collar jobs .
And I will help American businesses do right by their workers by finally passing universal health care to cut health care costs , which is the single most pressing business problem in the country today .
" Working together we must do everything we can to minimize the unfair offshoring of American jobs and do right by America ’s working families . "
Edwards Statement On EPI Report Citing 25 T0 30 Million American Jobs At Risk To Offshoring
Under Bush , the United States has lost 3.3 million manufacturing jobs and since 1999 , more than 40,000 U.S. manufacturing facilities have closed their doors .
At the United Auto Workers Region 4 Presidential Candidates Forum today , John Edwards unveiled his plan to rebuild American manufacturing for the 21st century .
John Edwards will rebuild the manufacturing sector with :
smart trade and training policies ;
creating new opportunities for manufacturing ;
cutting health care and energy costs ;
helping workers and communities recover from plant closings and
eliminating tax breaks for offshoring .
More details here : Rebuilding the American Middle Class : A Plan for 21st Century Manufacturing
" I grew up in Carolina mill towns and I 've seen firsthand how people 's lives are devastated when factories close down and these manufacturing jobs are lost , " said Edwards .
" Manufacturing has suffered more than any other sector of our economy because of currency manipulation , illegal foreign subsidies , bad trade deals and rising energy and health care costs .
But instead of taking steps to reverse this unprecedented loss of manufacturing jobs , the politicians in Washington have favored profits on Wall Street over the people on Main Street .
" Our economy depends on a successful middle class , but our middle class depends on manufacturing .
I am running for president on behalf of the men and women who worked in the mill with my father and lost their jobs when that mill closed .
They need a president who will stand up for them , not big corporate interests .
As president , I will take action to strengthen and grow our middle class by rebuilding American manufacturing for the 21st century . "
Edwards Highlights Proposals To Rebuild The Middle Class Through 21st Century Manufacturing
John Edwards will fight these entrenched interests who have been destroying the American middle class :
John Edwards - " Give ' Em Hell "
In Plymouth , NH on November 12th John spoke about how , as president he plans on giving the American people hope , and the big corporations and lobbyists , hell .
John Edwards : Giving us hope and them hell !

Giraffe populations have dropped by 30 % over the past decade
A report in BMC Biology uses genetic evidence to show that there may be at least six species of giraffe in Africa .
Currently giraffes are considered to represent a single species classified into multiple subspecies .
The study shows geographic variation in hair coat colour is evident across the giraffe 's range in sub-Saharan Africa , suggesting reproductive isolation .
" Using molecular techniques we found that giraffes can be classified into six groups that are reproductively isolated and not interbreeding , " David Brown , the lead author of the study and a geneticist at the University of California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , told BBC News .
" The results were a surprise because although the giraffes look different , if you put them in zoos , they breed freely . "
Spots and maple leaves
The study also found that the two giraffe subspecies that live closest to each other - the reticulated giraffe ( Currently : Giraffa camelopardalis reticulate ) in North Kenya , which has reddish round spots ; and the Maasai giraffe ( Currently : Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi ) in South Kenya - separated 0.5 to 1.5 million years ago .
SOME GIRAFFE FACTS
The familiar animals can grow up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) in height Their remarkable tongues grow up to 45 cm ( 18 in ) long Adult giraffes can weigh in excess of 1,000kg ( 2,200lbs )
Long legs enable speeds of up to 35 miles / hour ( 55 km / h )
Mr Brown added : " There are no rivers or forests to prevent breeding , but some evolutionary process is keeping the two groups reproductively separated . "
The researchers have suggested these processes may be ecological differences , such as differences in vegetation at a macro - level , which are keeping the populations separate or sexual selection .
" The female Maasai giraffe may be looking at the male reticulated giraffe and thinking , ' I do n't look like you ; I do n't want to mate with you ' , " Mr Brown explained .
Need for conservation
Mr Brown also highlighted the conservation implications of this study : " Lumping all giraffes into one species obscures the reality that some kinds of giraffe are on the brink .
" Some of these populations number only a few hundred individuals and need immediate protection . "
Over the past decade there has been a 30 % drop in giraffe numbers , with total numbers under 100,000 .
It is hoped that classifying current subspecies as fully fledged species will help inform conservation plans to save the most threatened populations .
These include :
The Nigerian giraffe ( Currently : Giraffa camelopardalis peralta ) .
The last 160 individuals are found in West and Central Africa .
The Rothschild giraffe ( Currently : Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi ) .
The last few hundred can only be found in a few protected areas in Kenya and in Murchison Falls National Park , Uganda .
The animals ' status is currently under review by an International Giraffe Working Group ( IGWG ) .
Its evidence will inform the IUCN Red List of threatened and endangered species .
The genetic research was supported by the US - based Wildlife Conservation Society .
I got a ton of email this week about the Radiohead rollout .
The short version : Radiohead ( a million - selling rock band ) launched their new album as a pay - what - you - want MP3 combined with an expensive boxed set .
This is the sort thing I ’ve been talking about for seven years and many unknown bands have been doing for at least that long .
A lot of pundits have jumped in and talked about how this is the next big thing .
That the music industry is finally waking up and realizing that they can’t change the world … that the world is changing them .
But that ’s not the really useful insight here .
The question is : why did it take so long , and why did we see it from Prince ( CD in the newspaper ) , Madonna ( $ 120 mm to leave her label and go to a concert promoter ) and Radiohead ?
Most industries innovate from both ends :
The outsiders go first because they have nothing to lose .
The winners go next because they can afford to and they want to stay winners .
It ’s the mediocre middle that sits and waits and watches .
The mediocre record companies , mediocre A&R guys and the mediocre acts are struggling to stay in place .
They ’re nervous that it all might fall apart .
So they wait .
They wait for ‘ proof ’ that this new idea is going to work , or at least wo n’t prove fatal .
( It ’s the impulse to wait that made them mediocre in the first place , of course ) .
So , in every industry , the middle waits .
And watches .
And then , once they realize they can survive the switch ( or once they ’re persuaded that their current model is truly fading away ) , they jump in .
The irony , of course , is that by jumping in last , they ’re condemning themselves to more mediocrity .
We posted this story yesterday with an update to the heartbreaking result .
While battling CIGNA for a new liver , her family and friends fought and protested until CIGNA finally gave in , but it was too late --- the seventeen - year - old Nataline Sarkisyan died .

ABC has the video of the story as it unfolded .
And the only mention of health care that we get from the GOP presidential candidates is to use the word " socialized " medicine , as if it 's something scary .
What 's scary is what happened to Nataline .
I 'm sure her family is so very happy we do n't have socialized medicine today .
Let 's see some Iowa residents bring this case up to Huck , Rudy / McC and Williard .
They had a liver for her last week .
We know the media is incapable of doing some basic reporting .
Check out guaranteedhealthcare ... CNS released this statement :
But what I found more disappointing is that their concerns were then mirrored by Washington Post media columnist Howard Kurtz , who was apparently far less concerned by the lobbyists ' ability to manipulate public and political opinion than by my use of undercover journalism .
" No matter how good the story , " he wrote , " lying to get it raises as many questions about journalists as their subjects . "
Kurtz was , indeed , troubled .
he fretted that the poor lobbyists were " Stung by Harper 's In a Web Of Deceit . "
Silverstein wastes no time in firing right back .
The decline of undercover reporting — and of investigative reporting in general — also reflects , in part , the increasing conservatism and cautiousness of the media , especially the smug , high - end Washington press corps .
As reporters have grown more socially prominent during the last several decades , they 've become part of the very power structure that they 're supposed to be tracking and scrutinizing .
These days , Silverstein points out , we rarely see such undercover reporting pieces -- fallout from the 1997 Food Lion case in which ABC News was found liable for a story that exposed gross food safety violations , not because the story was n't true but because the reporters lied on their applications to get jobs there .
He also mentions one of the greatest undercover operations ever conducted by an American newspaper -- the Mirage Tavern , where " bribes flowed like beer . "
The aptly named Mirage was a tavern purchased by the Chicago Sun-Times , whose reporters in 1978 ( before Murdoch bought the paper ) then filmed city inspectors soliciting bribes .
In those days the Sun -Times , having just added columnist Mike Royko , was a kick - ass paper .
But those days are long gone -- and not just in Chicago .
Today the press worries about deceiving sleazy lobbyists , with nary a word about how such lobbyists are able to so easily corrupt that same media .
In exchange for fees of up to $ 1.5 million a year , they offered to send congressional delegations to Turkmenistan and write and plant opinion pieces in newspapers under the names of academics and think - tank experts they would recruit .
They even offered to set up supposedly " independent " media events in Washington that would promote Turkmenistan ( the agenda and speakers would actually be determined by the lobbyists ) .
Silverstein's story gets at the heart of how things really work in Washington -- and how the role of the press corps is to ride shotgun .
I 'm willing to debate the merits of my piece , but the carping from the Washington press corps is hard to stomach .
This is the group that attended the White House correspondents dinner and clapped for a rapping Karl Rove .
As a class , they honor politeness over honesty and believe that being " balanced " means giving the same weight to a lie as you give to the truth .
This week , Silverstein has a blog entry at the Harper 's website , about the reaction he has gotten to the LA Times op - ed he wrote .
I knew that there was a fair amount of hostility towards the high - end Washington press corps , but until Saturday , when the Los Angeles Times ran my op - ed , I had no idea how deep that hostility ran , and how many people shared it .
He also cites some of the hysterical reaction he got from the " high - end " press corps , notably from CBS ' Matthew Felling , who apparently thinks that stories about how lobbyists work are old news .
Ho hum .
When you ’re going to take the risky step into " Gotcha Journalism , " you need to " Get " something .
You need to uncover something that either ca n’t be found out in any other way , expose hidden political corruption or a potential health threat .
When you indulge in subterfuge to merely provide the conventional wisdom with a concrete example , that ’s when the cost – to the journalist , to the media outlet , to the media at large – is n’t worth the benefit .
This is deficit reporting – when the payback is far smaller than the cost .
Felling thinks posing as a client is a far greater sin than a lobbying firm corrupting the media and elected officials to prop up a vicious dictatorship .
And then there is this from Shawn Wertz at Legal Times , which was incensed that Silverstein did n't give lobbying firm APCO a chance to lie some more :
Ironically , for a journalist concerned with the ethics of lobbying firms , Silverstein never told the lobbying firms who he really was , and he never contacted the firms for comment before the story appeared .
" They never called us to say , ' You got punked , ' " APCO spokesman B. Jay Cooper told Kurtz .
Boo hoo .
Howard Kurtz asked Silverstein about that point .
Says Silverstein , noting the magazine 's long lead time : " These guys are professional spinners , and I did n't feel like giving them six weeks to lie their way out of the story . "
He says his piece exposed how lobbying firms try to manipulate public opinion .
Actually , Silverstein should have given the sleazy spinmeisters their chance to lie some more .
That 's standard journalistic practice .
But not doing so was a small sin and does n't detract from the truth of the article or what it says about the incestuous relationship between lobbyists , politicians and the media .
Lobbyists and Howard Kurtz whining about how Silverstein did n't call to tell them he had " punked " them is the journalistic equivalent of Disrespecting the Bing .
Silverstein gave Wertz a call :
I called Wertz and politely but pointedly told him that he was entitled to his views about my ethics , but I resented that he wrote that I had been " exposed " by Kurtz .
I explained that if he had read my piece ( and Wertz acknowledged he had not ) he would have known that I had freely revealed everything about my " investigatory techniques . "
Neither Kurtz or anyone else had " exposed " me , as Wertz had clearly suggested .
Wertz was very sympathetic and said he would correct the story .
And he did — he rewrote the copy and never acknowledged his mistake or that the premise of his original story was entirely false .
And that strikes me — even if I did commit the terrible sin of going undercover — as a notable lapse of journalistic ethics .
That 's the way it goes these days in Washington .
It 's all just a Mirage .

Introduction
One of my favorite features of Ruby is the ability to evaluate a string or a block of code .
Ruby provides a few different types of evaluation options ; however , the evals I use most often are : eval , instance_eval , and class_eval
Module.class_eval
The class_eval ( and the aliased module_eval ) method of Module allows you to evaluate a string or block in the context of a class or module .
Common usages for class_eval include adding methods to a class and including other modules in a class .
Related Sponsored Content 3 Common Pitfalls in Microservice Integration – And How to Avoid Them
klass = Class.new
klass.class_eval do
include ERB :: Util
def encoded_hello
htnl_escape " Hello World "
end
end
klass.new.encoded_hello #=> < b> Hello World </b>
The above behavior can be achieved without using class_eval ; however , a fair amount of readability must be traded .
klass = Class.new
klass.send :include , ERB :: Util
klass.send : define_method , :encoded_hello do
html_escape " Hello World "
end
klass.send :public , :encoded_hello
klass.new.encoded_hello #=> < b> Hello World </b>
Object.instance_eval
The instance_eval method of Object allows you to evaluate a string or block in the context of an instance of a class .
This powerful concept allows you to create a block of code in any context and evaulate it later in the context of an individual instance .
In order to set the context , the variable self is set to the instance while the code is executing , giving the code access to the instance 's variables .
class Navigator
def initialize
@page_index = 0
end
def next
@page_index += 1
end
end
navigator = Navigator.new
navigator.next
navigator.next
navigator.instance_eval " @page_index " #=> 2
navigator.instance_eval { @page_index } #=> 2
Similar to the class_eval example , the value of an instance variable can be gotten in other ways ; however , using instance_eval is a very straightforward way to accomplish the above task .
Kernel.eval
The eval method of Kernel allows you to evaluate a string in the current context .
The eval method also allows you to optionally specify a binding .
If a binding is given , the evaluation will be performed in the context of the binding .
hello = " hello world "
puts eval ( " hello " ) # => " hello world "
proc = lambda { hello = " goodbye world " ; binding }
eval ( " hello " , proc.call ) # => " goodbye world "
Expanding the context of eval
My first usage of eval was when I created the attr_init class method .
I found that I was often repeating the following pattern in the code .
def some_attribute
@some_attribute || = SomeClass.new
end
I decided to create a class method that would encapsulate the above behavior .
class << Object
def attr_init ( name , klass )
define_method ( name ) { eval " @#{name} ||= #{klass}.new " }
end
end
I remember feeling like the call to eval was ugly , but at the time I could n't think of another way to complete the task .
I posted the code on my blog for all to criticize , and they quickly did .
It was not obvious at first to me , but the following solution is far superior since it only requires one call to eval instead of a new eval with each call to the defined method .
class << Object
def attr_init ( name , klass )
eval " define_method ( name ) { @#{name} ||= #{klass}.new } "
end
end
This optimization is interesting in that it requires increasing what is evaluated for better performance .
From that point forward I used eval when necessary ; however , I was careful to keep an eye toward using it as efficiently as possible .
Using instance_eval in multiple contexts
It can often be valuable to evaluate blocks ( or code as strings ) in various contexts .
This is a very common technique used when designing a Domain Specific Langauges ( DSL ) .
In fact , one key to using a DSL is the ability to evaluate in various contexts .
Take this code for example :
class SqlGenerator
class << self
def evaluate ( &script )
self.new.instance_eval( &script )
end
end
def multiply ( arg )
" select #{arg} "
end
def two ( arg=nil )
" 2#{arg} "
end
def times ( arg )
" * #{arg} "
end
end
The above code allows you to generate a SQL statement by calling the SqlGenerator .
evaluate method with a block :
SqlGenerator.evaluate { multiply two times two }
=> " select 2 * 2 "
However , you could also execute the same code in the context of a calculator class to receive a result :
class Calculator
class << self
def evaluate ( &script )
self.new.instance_eval( &script )
end
end
def multiply ( arg )
eval arg
end
def two ( arg=nil )
" 2#{arg} "
end
def times ( arg )
" * #{arg} "
end
end
Which executes as :
Calculator .evaluate { multiply two times two }
=> 4
The above code demonstrates how to use instance_eval to specify the scope in which a block executes .
As I previously documented , the instance_eval method evaluates either a string or block within the context of the receiver .
The receivers in my examples were a new instance of SqlGenerator and a new instance of Calculator .
Also , be sure to note that I call self .new.instance_eval .
If I do n't call the new method of self , the block will be evaluated by the class and not an instance of the class .
The above code also shows the first few steps towards defining a DSL .
Creating an DSL is challenging , but it does provide many advantages .
One advantage to expressing your business rules in a DSL is the ability to execute them in various contexts .
As the above example shows , by executing the DSL in various contexts you can generate multiple behaviors from the same business rule .
When the rule changes over time , all parts of the system that reference the rule will also be changed .
The key to achieving this success is taking advantage of Ruby 's evaluation methods .
The Casino Poker Table example
if the ' $ 5 - $ 10 Limit ' list is more than 12 then notify the floor to open
if the $ 1 - $ 2 No Limit ' list is more than 15 then notify the floor to open
if the ' $ 5 - $ 10 Limit ' list is more than 8 then notify the brush to announce
if the ' $ 1 - $ 2 No Limit ' list is more than 10 then notify the brush to announce
Using the evaluation options it is easy to execute in various contexts .
For example , assume you work for a casino and you have been tasked with designing a system that will notify the poker room employees when a new poker table needs to be opened or when you are looking to open a new poker table .
The rules for opening a poker table vary based on the stakes of the table and the length of the waiting list .
For example , you need more people waiting for a no - limit game because people are more likely to lose all their money on one hand and you do n't want to open the table and need to close it shortly after because there are n't enough players .
The rules would be expressed in your DSL like this :
The first context in which I will execute the DSL is the context that notifies the employees .
class ContextOne < DslContext
bubble : than , : is , : list , : the , : to
def more ( value )
'> ' + value.to_s
end
def method_missing ( sym , * args )
@stakes = sym
eval " List.size_for(sym ) #{args.
first} "
end
def floor ( value )
__position ( value , : floor )
end
def brush ( value )
__position ( value , : brush )
end
def open
__action ( : open )
end
def announce
__action ( : announce )
end
def __action ( to )
{ :action => to }
end
def __position ( value , title )
value [ : position ] = title
value
end
def notify ( value )
[ @stakes , value ]
end
end
ContextOne is executed by the following code .
script = << - eos if the ' $ 5 - $ 10 Limit ' list is more than 12 then notify the floor to open
if the ' $ 1 - $ 2 No Limit ' list is more than 15 then notify the floor to open
if the ' $ 5 - $ 10 Limit ' list is more than 8 then notify the brush to announce
if the ' $ 1 - $ 2 No Limit ' list is more than 10 then notify the brush to announce eos
class Broadcast
def self .notify ( stakes , options )
puts DslContext.sym_to_stakes ( stakes )
options .each_pair do |name , value|
puts " # {name} #{value} "
end
end
end
ContextOne.execute( script ) do |notification |
Broadcast.notify ( * notification )
end
ContextOne inherits from DslContext .
The definition of DslContext can be found below .
class DslContext
def self.execute( text )
rules = polish_text ( text )
rules .each do |rule |
result = self.new.instance_eval ( rule )
yield result if block_given ?
end
end
def self .
bubble ( * methods )
methods .each do |method|
define_method ( method ) { |args| args }
end
end
def self.polish_text ( text )
rules = text.split ( "
" )
rules .collect do |rule|
rule.gsub !(/'.+'/,extract_stakes ( rule ) )
rule << " end "
end
end
def self.extract_stakes ( rule )
stakes = rule.scan (/'.+'/) .
first
stakes.delete ! ( " ' " ) .gsub !( %q{$} , 'dollar ' ) .gsub !('-' , ' dash ' ) .gsub !(' ' , ' space ' )
end
def self.sym_to_stakes(sym )
sym.to_s.gsub !( ' dollar ' , %q{$}).gsub !( ' dash ' , '-' ) .gsub !( ' space ' , ' ')
end
end
The method_missing method of ContextOne also expects the following List class to be defined .
class List
def self.size_for( stakes )
20
end
end
ContextOne uses the DSL to check the List for the size per stakes and sends notifications when necessary .
This is of course sample code and my List object is just a stub to verify that everything works correctly .
The important thing to note is that the execute method is delegating to instance_eval to evaluate the code in the context of ContextOne .
Based on this same script you could execute a second context that returns a list of the different games that are currently being spread .
class ContextTwo < DslContext
bubble : than , : is , : list , : the , : to , : more , : notify , : floor , : open , : brush
def announce
@stakes
end
alias open announce
def method_missing ( sym , * args )
@stakes = sym
end
end
As you can see , adding additional contexts is very easy .
Since the execute method of DslContext uses the instance_eval method the above code can be executed with the code below .
ContextTwo.execute( script ) do |stakes |
puts ContextTwo.sym_to_stakes ( stakes )
end
To drive the example home we will create another example to display all positions that are set up to receive notices .
class ContextThree < DslContext
bubble : than , : is , : list , : the , : to , :more , :notify , : announce , :open , :open
def announce ; end
def open ; end
def brush ( value )
: brush
end
def floor ( value )
: floor
end
def method_missing ( sym , * args )
true
end
end
Again , the context inherits from DslContext , which uses instance_eval , so the only code necessary to execute is the following code .
ContextThree.execute( script ) do |positions |
puts positions
end
Being able to evaluate a DSL script in multiple contexts begins to blur the line between code and data .
The script ' code ' can also be evaluated to do things such as generate reports ( i.e. A report of which employees are contacted by the system ) .
The script could also be evaluated in a context that will show how long before a table will be opened ( i.e. the rule states that 15 are needed , the system knows 10 are on the list so it displays the message ' 5 more people needed before the game can start ' ) .
Using instance_eval allows us to evaluate the same code in any way necessary for our systems .
Eval is magic also
The above examples show how to evaluate blocks in different scopes by using instance_eval .
But , eval also allows you to evaluate in more than one context .
Next I 'll show how you can evaluate a string of ruby code in the scope of a block .
At the beginning we started with a simple example , but lets revist a simple case where we use eval with the binding of a block .
For this example we will need a class that can create a block for us .
class ProcFactory
def create
Proc.new {}
end
end
In the example , the ProcFactory class has a method , create , that simply creates and returns a proc .
Despite the fact that this does n't look very interesting , it actually provides you with the ability to evaluate any string of ruby code in the scope of the proc .
This gives you the power to evaluate ruby code in the context of an object without directly having to reference it .
proc = ProcFactory.new.create
eval " self.class " , proc.binding #=> ProcFactory
When would you ever actually use such a thing ?
I recently used it while developing a DSL to represent SQL .
I started with the following syntax .
Select [ :column1 , :column2 ].from [ : table1 , :table2 ] . where do
equal table1.id , table2.table1_id
end
When the above code is evaluated the [ ] instance method ( following from ) saves each table name in an array .
Then , when the where method is executed it yields the block given to where .
When the block is yielded the method_missing method is called twice , once with : table1 and then with : table2 .
When method_missing is called we check that table name array ( which was created in the previously mentioned [ ] method ) includes the symbol argument ( : table1 and : table2 ) to verify it is a valid table name .
If the table name is included in the table name array we return an object that knows how to react to column names .
However , if the table name is invalid we call super and raise NameError .
All of this works perfectly , until you start using sub-queries .
For example , the following code will not work with the current implementation .
Delete.from [ : table1 ] . where do
exists ( Select [ : colum n2 ] .from [ : table2 ] . where do
equal table1.column1 , table2.column2
end )
end
Unfortunately , this needed to work , and using eval and specifying a binding was how we made it work .
The trick is getting the table names array from the outer block into the inner block without explicitly passing it in somehow ( which would have made the DSL ugly ) .
To solve this problem , within the where method of the Select class we used the binding of the block to get the tables collection from the Delete instance .
This is possible because the where method of the Delete instance is the context aka the binding of the block being passed to the where method of the select instance .
The binding ( or context ) is the scope in which the block is created .
The following code is the full implementation of the where method .
def where ( &block )
@text += " where "
tables.concat( eval ( " respond_to ? ( : tables ) ?
tables : [ ] " ,
block.binding ) ) .
inspect
instance_eval &block
end
Let 's break the eval statement apart and see what it 's doing .
The first thing it 's going to do is
eval " respond_to ? ( : tables ) ?
tables : [ ] " , block .
binding
Which simply means " eval that statement within the scope of the block " .
In this case the scope of that block is :
Delete.from [ : table1 ] . where do .. end
This scope is a Delete instance , which does have a tables method that exposes the tables array ( tables # = > [ : table1 ] ) .
Therefore , the statement will evaluate and return the tables array , and the rest of the statement could be pictured as this :
tables.concat ( [ : table1 ] )
This is simply going to concatenate all the table names into the tables array available in the inner block .
After this one line change , the statement now produces expected results .
delete from table1 where exists ( select column2 from table2 where table1.column1 = table2.column2 )
The following code can be used to generate the above result and can be used as a reference for using a binding with eval .
class Delete
def self .
from
Delete.new
end
def [ ] ( * args )
@text = " delete from "
@text += args.join " , "
@tables = args
self
end
attr_reader : tables
def where ( &block )
@text += " where "
instance_eval &block
end
def exists ( statement )
@text += " exists "
@text += statement
end
end
class Select
def self . [] ( * args )
self.new ( * args )
end
def initialize ( * columns )
@text = " select "
@text += columns.join " , "
end
def from
@text += " from "
self
end
def [ ] ( * args )
@text += args.join " , "
@tables = args
self
end
def tables
@tables
end
def where ( &block )
@text += " where "
tables.concat( eval ( " respond_to ? ( : tables ) ?
tables : [ ] " , block.binding ) ) .
inspect
instance_eval &block
end
def method_missing ( sym , * args )
super unless @tables .include ?
sym
klass = Class.new
klass.class_eval do
def initialize ( table )
@table = table
end
def method_missing ( sym , * args )
@table.to_s + " . " + sym.to_s
end
end
klass.new(sym )
end
def equal ( * args )
@text += args.join " = "
end
end
Conclusion
As you can see the evaluation methods of Ruby provide very good options for creating concise , readable code .
The evaluation methods also provide the ability to easily create very powerful tools such as Domain Specific Languages .

Watch this clip from CNBC and you ’ll have a better idea .
Citi has more bad news , with rumors of 5 - 10 % of the workforce being cut ( 10 % is roughly 32,000 jobs ! ) and Bank of America wo n’t deny reports of trimming the budget by removing soup , yes soup , from the cafeteria .
They also have not denied the report that says they are no longer providing soap in their bathrooms .
Yeesh .
As if you did n’t have to be cautious enough when shaking their hands , now this .
Equally shocking is CNBC ’s comments about how these moves only hurt the little guy .
If true , this means that the greedy fools who took BoA into the can will be OK ( no cuts there ! ) but the regular workers are all being asked to sacrifice .
Nice .
It ’s interesting to note that only a short time ago it was US companies looking to buy into China and today , it ’s China buying into the US .

If you watch TV or read the news , you know sexual predators hang out on the Internet , looking for underage victims .
Dateline NBC's " To Catch a Predator " features men being lured by the promise of meeting underage girls .
Several state attorneys general recently have called on social - networking sites MySpace and Facebook to ban registered sex offenders and make their sites safer .
Newspapers have been filled with stories about the dangers children face when they post too much personal information .
And victims have testified recently at congressional hearings .
Some worry that parents are falling victim to " predator panic " and overreacting to unlikely dangers , unintentionally turning children off to safety messages altogether .
" One of the misunderstandings that we think is widespread is that what sex offenders are doing is picking out kids ( online ) and stalking them and deceiving them and abducting them and raping them , " says David Finkelhor , director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire .
" That 's not what 's going on . "
Abductions by strangers are so rare that many experts can't name a single case in which a predator attacked after only seeing a child 's profile online .
' Grooming ' their victims
In most cases , predators seek out vulnerable teens — those who post sexually suggestive pictures of themselves , talk about sex online or frequent places where hook - ups are made , Finkelhor says .
They spend weeks , even months , forging a relationship and gaining the teens ' trust .
Usually , those who become victims eventually agree to meet the perpetrator face to face ; often they know that the person they 're meeting is older .
But by the time they meet him ( usually it 's a man ) , they often think they are in love .
It 's a process called " grooming , " Finkelhor says .
" It 's the kids who respond to somebody and start talking about sex that puts them at risk — or kids who use sites to communicate with lots of people they do n't know , or put very sexualized images online , " he says .
The Internet allows predators " to form supportive relationships with emotionally vulnerable teens , " says Nancy Willard , author of Cyber - Safe Kids , Cyber - Savvy Teens : Helping Young People Learn to Use the Internet Safely and Responsibly .
Though there are no comprehensive national annual figures on Internet crimes against children , Finkelhor says , overall sex crimes against children are down , with the notable exception of child pornography .
Sexual abuse cases were down 51 % from 1990 to 2005 — from 22.8 per 10,000 to 11.3 per 10,000 children , he says .
Feeling safe does n't make it so Studies show that most teens feel relatively safe online .
A Pew Internet & American Life Project report last month showed that though children , especially girls , who posted pictures of themselves on social networks were more likely to be contacted by strangers , only 7 % of online teens said they had ever had an interaction with a stranger that made them feel scared or uncomfortable .
And a report out last year by Finkelhor 's center found that from 2000 through 2005 , the number of children ages 10 to 17 who received unwanted solicitations online declined from 19 % to 13 % .
But calls to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children 's hotline have been on the rise , says president Ernie Allen .
In 2005 , there were 2,660 reports of online enticement of children ; in 2006 , there were 6,374 .
In the first eight months of 2007 , there were 9,533 .
Some of the increase can be attributed to greater Internet use and increased awareness of the hotline , Allen says .
He agrees that education is a key to Internet safety .
But he says the Internet does make it easier to prey on children .
" Just like in the physical world , those people who seek to prey upon kids go to where the kids are , " Allen says .
" We do n't think the sky is falling , but there ( are ) adults hiding behind the relative anonymity of the Internet to try to achieve what they either can't achieve or can only achieve with great risk in the physical world .
America 's moms and dads really need to catch up . "
Though it 's good to educate children and parents about dangers , some experts worry that the message may backfire .
" If you are petrified of predators but are not worrying about cyber - bullies , loss of reputation , spending too much time online and the other less frightening but more likely dangers of online use , then you are misplacing your energy , " says Larry Magid , co-director of ConnectSafely.org .
" You 're petrified of something that 's probably not going to happen and failing to pay attention to the dangers that are far more likely . "
Allen says messages should be balanced , but parents do need to stay aware of the problems .
" The good news is that the vast majority of America 's kids are much smarter and much more aware . …
" But the bad news is , there are a lot of ( predators ) out there who are still seeking , overwhelmingly for grooming and seduction .
This remains a significant problem . "

I must give you high marks for the excellent selection of above - average foodstuffs in our cafeteria .
The portions are sensible , the service is wonderful , and the prices generally reasonable , except when it comes to snacky bits .
$ 1.25 is not market rate for a bag of M&Ms .
A brace of PopTarts at $ 1.29 is overpriced by almost 40 % .
This sort of madness drives me to our building 's vending machine emporia ... which in turn are driving me to madness , and to authorship of this screed .
Who is the crack - smoking numbnuts incapable of competent repetition in the maintenance of a vending machine ?
I 'm not talking about keeping the damn things online ( although the snack vendy just around the corner from the cafeteria is suspiciously " out of service " frequently ) .
I 'm also not complaining about the slings and arrows of outrageous Fort. : the bag of chips stuck against the glass , the HoHos clinging , mockingly , to the wire spool exp'lled them .
These are merely the manifestations of bad karma which we all experience , the dark cloud which only reveals its silver lining when additional coins are inserted to knock free said HoHos with the resounding thunk of a descending MilkyWay bar .
Satisfaction , and twice the snacks .
No , my complaint , thunderous , and my indignation , righteous , is aimed at the methadone sampler whose job is simply to restock the machine with snacky bits and change .
Let us start with the change , for as everyone knows , change is good .
If it were me , which it is not , I would value every snack in multiples of 25 cents .
Acknowledging that candy prices have risen ridiculously since I was a lad* , surely chips could be 50 cents , candy bars 75 , and the Big Hangover Cures ( PopTarts , Pound Cake , Danish ) a dollar .
This sort of price management would mean Quarters - only change .
The US Quarter - Dollar being the only reasonably sized and weighted coin o' th' realm , it makes sense to only stock the change mechanism thusly .
But no .
This being The Big Fancy City , you will have your premium , wo n't you ?
85 - cent candy bars .
Now you have to involve dimes and nickels ... hell , why not just invite the pennies ?
Or do you have a problem with coins of color ?
Having all this Numismatic Affirmative Action going on just results in a bloated system * filled with jams and errors .
Many times I have found the vendy on the second floor demanding exact change .
Many times I have been so craving a Twix that I have crammed in a dollar bill , here , And been denied .
Then there 's the fifth floor vendy , which simply lets the dimes fall through , like a hot lesbian sitting alone in a bar .
" Nope , " says fifth floor vendy , " you can go .
My candy is not even for sale .
" And that 's even assuming the stupid labels are right .
I 've noticed they 're on a little wheel ... so that your Depleted Uranium Cranium simply has to turn the price to match the price programmed into the machine .
Why then , do the vending machines take on a slot machine air when I buy my Butterfingers ?
Why is the price 85 cents on one day , and 95 cents on another ?
Sure , one day it was 45 cents , but that was the day I helped the old lady cross the street AND I think someone else just forgot their change .
Probably because they were injured bashing their skull into the glass in frustration .
While I 'm discussing labels , why is the burden on me to determine the row and number of my selection ?
The cafeteria machine , you know , the one that rarely works ?
Several of the labels are missing ... specifically E3 , F5 , and H0 .
And why is there a " zero " column , anyway ?
Are you planning a Vending Expansion that will jeopardize your supply of positive whole numbers ?
Or are you just showing off your integers , but think negatives would be audacious ?
The fifth floor vendy even has some labels misapplied .
Yes , I should be able to deduce F3 's position between F2 and F4 , but it has a E3 sticker on it and goddamn it , I eat out of vending machines ...
I 'm probably hungover and need coffee .
Throw me a fucking bone !
There is nothing less savage than spending your last 85 (? ) cents on a 3 Musketeers , only to be rewarded with Good N Plenty .
Why does bottled water cost more than soda ?
Is n't water a component of soda ?
Does n't it cost more to process that water , add cancerous qualities and caramel color to it , and bottle it under pressure ?
Whither the price of sugar ?
Doth it not be high ?* Hey , you vendy stocker that puts the " GED " in " Moron " , does it occur to you that the reason the Reese 's PB Cups sold out so fast is because Did they not teach you that in the late - night infomercial ?
Replacing them with Nature 's Own Laxative Bar will , in fact , mean you have less stock work to do , but it rather defeats the purpose .
Show a little initiative !
Get on the five - year plan !
Cripes !
Finally , O Ye Who Vend , I verily say WTF about the four ( four ! ) " chilled candy machines " on various floors and in various hidey - spots .
First of all , those machines use double the energy , 24/7 , of the old - school glass - windowed pinball - machine vendors , just to keep it chill , yo .
Second of all , there is n't a window , so I can't see for myself what you 're out of ...
I have to wait for you to dis me with " MAKE ANOTHER SELECTION " .
Third of all , now all of a sudden you want a full dollar for those M&Ms ... that 's like 3 cents an M !
And fourth of all , chilling candy bars makes them taste nasty , asshat .
It 's probably the nougatty chemicals or the separating cocoa butter or whatever , but it 's serious desperation time when I cough up a dollar for crappy crap food .
And do n't just advise me to eat the chilled Skittles instead .
Skittles were never meant to be jawbreakers .
I could load those things into my Colt and pop a Skittle in yo ass .
Ladies and Gentlemen , this is the Headquarters Building .
There is a bar to be met here , and I 'm not talking about the one in the management lounge .
Let 's get it in gear and raise efficacy in unattended snack deployment to acceptable levels .
Someone could get hurt .*
A problem that will no doubt be solved when Ron Paul becomes president and we return to the gold standard .
Britain , the country with the world 's biggest network of surveillance cameras , has the worst record in Europe for the protection of privacy , according to a report from a London - based international watchdog .
The UK is billed as " an endemic surveillance society " alongside Russia , the US , Singapore and China in the survey of 47 countries by Privacy International ( PI ) .
Britain is bottom in Europe because of its cameras , ID card plans and lack of government accountability .
Rankings are given for the UK as a whole as well as for its individual nations .
" For the first time , Scotland has been given its own ranking score and performed significantly better than England and Wales , " says the report .
Simon Davies , director of PI , said the loss this year of computer discs containing personal and bank details of 25 million UK families claiming child benefit highlighted the risks of storing information on huge government databases .
The report concludes that the 2007 rankings " show an increasing trend among governments to archive data on the geographic , communications and financial records of all their citizens and residents .
This trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion .
" The impact was worst in the US and across the EU as governments boosted surveillance and information gathering in the name of security and protecting borders . "
The US performed worst among democratic countries in terms of " statutory protections and privacy enforcement " .
In the European league table Germany fell from first to seventh , replaced at the top by Greece with its green ranking , indicating " significant protections and safeguards " for privacy .
Romania , Hungary and Slovenia take the next three places .
Surveillance measures initiated by Brussels have caused a substantial decline in privacy across the EU , says the report .
Canada heads the international table , with Argentina , Iceland and Switzerland close behind .
Malaysia is bottom , with a score marginally lower than Britain's .
The PI report says immigration and border control concerns in 2007 have prompted countries to " implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems , often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens " .
The World Wide Web Consortium , or W3C , a group devoted to publishing web standards , recently moved to approve the Ogg video and audio formats for inclusion into the forthcoming HTML5 standard .
Nokia , maker of mobile phones and mobile multimedia services , has taken exception to this proposal , writing a position paper ( PDF ) and raising a formal issue at the W3's web site , claiming that Ogg support should be " deleted " from the spec in order to " avoid any patent issues . "
Most people , if they recognize Ogg at all , would consider it to be an open - source counterpart to proprietary multimedia technology , so what exactly is going on here ?
An Ogg by any other name
Like most things pertaining to multimedia technology , the issue is n't quite so simple .
" Ogg " is a term for a container , a file with a specific extension ( in this case , .OGG ) and a defined internal structure .
Just as with Microsoft's .AVI and .ASF and Apple 's .
MOV , the content inside these files can be encoded with different types of codecs .
Quicktime movies used to be encoded with the Sorenson codec , for example , but now they typically use the H.264 codec instead .
The Ogg that most people think about when they hear the name is actually Ogg Vorbis , a patent - and royalty - free replacement for the MP3 audio codec .
However , video
Ogg files are typically encoded with Theora , a codec that originally was developed as a proprietary solution called VP3 by a company called On2 .
The Xiph.org foundation ( are you keeping all these names straight ? ) was then given an irrevocable and free license to the VP3 codec by On2 .
The Theora codec is virtually identical to VP3 but Xiph.org continues to develop it as an open codec for use in the Ogg container .
The open - source foundation in charge of Ogg .
According to the Theora FAQ , " some portions of the VP3 codec are covered by patents , " which could be what Nokia is referring to when they talk about " avoiding any patent issues . "
Unfortunately , virtually every other video codec is also protected by patents .
What Nokia wants
The position paper that Nokia submitted to the W3C touches on a variety of topics and mentions Ogg only briefly .
The paper 's arguments can be summarized as follows :
W3C should n't make any standards relating to codecs .
Leave that to other standards bodies like ITU - T and ISO / IEC .
There are over a billion PCs in the world today , many connected to the web , but these numbers are tiny compared to traditional video playback devices like DVD players .
This industry is used to paying license fees and royalties for video codecs like MPEG - 2 .
This industry is used to making money , and it does n't care about keeping things free .
Web codec standards should be either free or low - cost to implement .
Web codec standards should support DRM to placate Hollywood , but DRM implementations should be optional .
H.264 for video and AAC for audio would be Nokia 's recommendations for codecs .
Some of these statements seem to contradict each other , and indeed the entire paper is full of questionable material : there are spelling errors ( distriubuted ? ) , emoticons ( " dare we mentoned Flash :-) " , and the author constantly puts " free " in quotation marks , as if to raise doubt about whether something that is available for free is actually free .
A legitimate criticism of Ogg would be that as a standard , it is barely on the radar for most people : few people ( even dedicated open - source fans ) have .OGG files as a major part of their music or movie library .
The major commercial users of Ogg Vorbis are video game companies , who often use the format as a method for compressing audio without having to pay royalties .
Convicted rapist Michael A. Dodele had been free just 35 days when sheriff ’s deputies found him dead last month in his aging , tan mobile home , his chest and left side punctured with stab wounds .
Officers quickly arrested Dodele ’s neighbor , 29 - year - old construction worker Ivan Garcia Oliver , who made “ incriminating comments , essentially admitting to his attacking Dodele , ” the Lake County Sheriff ’s Department said in a statement .
Prosecutors said they have investigated the possibility that the slaying of Dodele , 67 , stemmed from his having been listed on the state ’s Megan ’s Law database of sex offenders .
If so , his death may be the first in the state to result from such a listing , experts said .
Oliver pleaded not guilty to charges of first - degree murder , burglary and elder abuse when he was arraigned Nov. 30 .

In a jailhouse interview Wednesday night , Oliver said he has a son who was molested in the past , and he took action to protect the child .
“ Society may see the action I took as unacceptable in the eyes of ‘ normal ’ people , ” Oliver said .
“ I felt that by not taking evasive action as a father in the right direction , I might as well have taken my child to some swamp filled with alligators and had them tear him to pieces .
It ’s no different . ”
Although Oliver did not say he killed Dodele , he said that “ any father in my position , with moral , home , family values , would n’t have done any different .
At the end of the day , what are we as parents ?
Protectors , caregivers , nurturers . ”
In fact , Dodele was not a child molester .
But a listing on the Megan ’s Law website could have left Oliver with the impression that he had abused children because of the way it was written .
Advertisement
Although Dodele ’s listing has been taken down since his death , a spokesman for the state attorney general said the site described the man ’s offenses as “ rape by force ” and “ oral copulation with a person under 14 or by force . ”
“ He was convicted of other bad things , but nothing involving a minor , ” said Richard F. Hinchcliff , chief deputy district attorney for Lake County .
But “ it would be easy to understand why someone might think so looking at the website . ”
Dodele ’s crimes involved sexual assaults on adult women , records show .
A neighbor at the Western Hills Resort & Trailer Park , a tattered collection of mobile homes and bungalows , said that two days before the killing , Oliver “ told every house ” in the park that he ’d found Dodele listed on the website of convicted sexual offenders and was uncomfortable living near him .

“ He looked it up on the computer . . . , ” the neighbor said .
“ He said [ Dodele ] ca n’t be around here . ”
The park resident requested anonymity because of a fear of reprisal , but reported Oliver ’s visit and statements to sheriff ’s deputies after the slaying .
“ A lot of people told them ” about Oliver ’s claims , the person said .
Officials in Lake County -- a patchwork of wealth and poverty , vineyards and mobile home parks just north of Napa Valley -- would not offer a motive for the killing .
Hinchcliff acknowledged , however , that one possible motive investigated by the district attorney ’s office was that Oliver knew Dodele was on the Megan ’s Law list and did not want him as a neighbor .

According to court documents , Dodele committed his first offenses at age 15 and spent the last two decades either in prison or at Atascadero State Hospital receiving treatment .
His last attack was the 1987 knife - point rape of a 37 - year - old woman on a Sonoma County beach .
Those were the charges that were listed on the Megan ’s Law website .
“ I think [ Oliver and Dodele ] are both victims of the Internet , ” said Charlene Steen , a psychologist who examined Dodele on behalf of the defense in two 2007 trials about whether he should be recommitted to Atascadero .

Both ended in hung juries .
Dodele was freed Oct. 16 and was hoping to start over in the crowded little mobile home park , where neighbors described him as open and friendly .
“ The family is just sick , ” Steen said .
“ They finally got him back .
They all thought he had made such great progress , and then this happened .
It ’s pretty bad . ”
At 10:14 a.m. Nov. 20 , an anonymous woman called 911 to report that a man was bleeding from his hands and directed medical personnel to Dodele ’s space at the mobile home park , according to a written statement from the Sheriff ’s Department .
When deputies arrived , they found Dodele ’s body .

The dead man ’s “ immediate neighbors and other residents ” sent the deputies to Oliver ’s home , the statement said , because “ he had been seen recently leaving Dodele ’s residence with what appeared to be blood on his hands and clothing . ”
There was blood on a car in front of Oliver ’s house and at the front door of the concrete - block duplex .
Inside , deputies reportedly found Oliver with blood on his hands and clothing and “ injuries to his hands , consistent with having been in a physical altercation . ”
Authorities will not divulge exactly what Oliver said when he was arrested .
Steen wrote a letter to a local paper decrying Dodele ’s death “ simply because he was a sex offender whose name and picture were on the registry . ”

Shortly after the letter was published , Steen said , a woman describing herself as Oliver ’s wife called to complain .
“ She said , ‘ We have a child who was molested , and my husband is very upset to have a child molester living nearby ’ , ” Steen recounted , noting the irony that Dodele ’s crimes all involved adult women .
Steen said she had not talked to police about the phone call .
Oliver said that the woman with whom he lived in the trailer park was his girlfriend , and the two were not married .
Attempts to reach the woman failed .
One neighbor said she had moved away after the slaying .

Oliver is being held without bail , a police statement said , because he was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in San Diego and was on parole when Dodele was killed .
Speaking from behind a thick glass divider in the visiting area of the Lake County Correctional Facility , Oliver said his son had been molested , but he declined to give the details of his son ’s assault or to give the child ’s name .
Although he spoke of “ the action I took , ” he would not describe what happened in the aging mobile home the Tuesday morning before Thanksgiving .
Oliver would not comment on whether Dodele had ever approached his son .

But Oliver said he saw the older man looking at the boy .
“ It was more than watching , ” Oliver said .
“ You could see his eyes .
He was fantasizing , plotting .
Later on down the line , who knows how many other children he could have hurt . ”
Research indicates that , in general , the older rapists get , the lower their risk of re-offending , said L.C. Miccio - Fonseca , chairwoman of the California Coalition on Sex Offenders , a group of treatment providers , probation and parole officers .
In addition , she said , sex offenders who target grown women over the course of many years are unlikely to victimize children .

But when told that Dodele ’s victims were women and not children , Oliver seemed unfazed .
“ There is no curing the people that do it , ” he said .
Oliver ’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Jan . 7 .
Asked about what he thinks will happen to him , he said , “ It ’s hard to tell at this point .
There ’s no doubt I ’m looking at a numerous amount of years .
I ’m not a lawyer .
We have n’t gone over the evidence . ”
But he also said that he “ would never change who I am or what I do because of what society thinks is right or not right .
I have always been who I am and always will be . ”

The British army says violence in Basra has fallen by 90 % since it withdrew from the southern Iraqi city earlier this year .
Around 500 British soldiers left one of Saddam Hussein 's palaces in the heart of the city in early September and stopped conducting regular foot patrols .
A spokesman says the Iraqi security forces still come under attack from militants in Basra , but the overall level of violence is down 90 % since the British troops left .
Britain is scheduled to return control of Basra province to Iraqi officials next month , officially ending Britain 's combat role in Iraq .
Ford has ended months of falling sales
The carmaker sold 182,951 vehicles in the US in November - slightly more than the 182,259 it sold a year earlier .
Its Japanese rivals also saw sales rise - Nissan , Honda and Toyota clocked gains of 6.1 % , 4.7 % and 0.3 % .
High oil prices , falling house prices and the credit crunch have meant consumers have little cash for cars and General Motors saw sales tumble by 11 % .
Chrysler also saw its US sales fall , dipping 2 % to 161,088 vehicles in November .
" Ford 's increase shows the influence new products can have on sales , " said Rebecca Lindland , an analyst with Global Insight .
" We still think they are going to trend downward next year , but not at nearly the same rate as this year . "
Ford said car sales fell 2 % but truck sales rose 2 % - helped by sales of the Ford Escape small sport utility vehicle and the Ford Edge .
Shares in Ford fell 3.5 % to $ 7.25 while shares in General Motors fell 4.1 % to $ 28.61 .
Economic fallout
The wider economic picture in the US - shaken by the fallout from the sub - prime lending crisis - is influencing people 's purchasing decisions , carmakers said .
Ford 's F - series pick - up trucks suffered falling sales
US car and light industry sales may be their lowest this year since 1998 , analysts said .
Even though Toyota saw sales rise slightly overall , sales of its luxury Lexus brand fell 7 % .
" Rising fuel prices and sliding home values delivered a one - two punch this month , " Jim Lentz , executive vice president of Toyota 's US sales arm , said in a statement .
" But the industry 's not down for the count .
Demand for fresh , more fuel efficient products continues to show strength . "
A weaker housing market in California and Florida dragged on sales , Nissan said .
Both Ford and General Motors - who have been losing market share to their foreign rivals - cut first - quarter production plans when they announced their November sales figures .
Ford economist Emily Kolinski Morris told reporters : " Clearly , we 're concerned about the credit market turmoil and the softer economy so we 're taking a cautious approach to planning our business . "
SimpleDB simply sucks
I mean , I really like the idea of Amazon 's SimpleDB .
Auto - indexing is great .
Scalable is great .
The price is great .
Forget that their REST API is a joke that will have to change as soon as people start losing or corrupting their data .
Why the fuck are they throwing out relational theory ?
The database barely even supports 1st normal form !
You can't do any kind of aggregate operation -- no count , min , max , avg , grouping !
There are no integrity constraints anywhere !
Take a look at the example they give :
ID Category Subcat .
Name Color Size Make Model Item_01 Clothes Sweater Cathair Sweater Siamese Small , Medium , Large Item_02 Clothes Pants Designer Jeans Paisley Acid Wash 30x32 , 32x32 , 32x34 Item_03 Clothes Pants Sweatpants Blue , Yellow , Pink Large Item_04 Car Parts Engine Turbos Audi S4 Item_05 Car Parts Emissions 02 Sensor Audi S4 Item_06 Motorcycle Parts Bodywork Fender Eliminator Blue Yamaha R1 Item_07 Motorcycle Parts , Clothing Clothing Leather Pants Small , Medium , Large Black
Let 's ignore that item_07 has the Color & Size backwards .
You 'll note that Color and Size are multi-valued attributes .
If you look up Multi - Valued Attributes in any relational textbook , they 'll usually say something like : " Abandon all hope , ye who enter here . "
Lately , however , even the diehards are allowing for nested relations & complex types inside domains , so this in and of itself is n't a bad thing if you treat them as nested relations .
With that interpretation , this table is intended to manage " names & options for a particular item " .
It is interpretable in ( at least ) 1NF .
I can retrieve " item_01 " , for example , I know that this Cathair Sweater comes in Siamese and Small , Medium , and Large .
But , the danger is if you treat this as a table for , oh , say , ordering items !
One needs to know if this is a Small or a Large sweater .
The only way to get to 1NF is to treat { ID , Color , Size} as a compound primary key .
All of your multi-valued attributes become implicitly a part of your primary key !
But there are no integrity constraints , so you better make sure your code and gateway API understands that in the above ITEMs table the primary key for item_01 through item_03 and item_06 through item_07 is { ID , Color , Size} and for item_04 & item_05 it is just { ID} -- for now !
So , while it is possible to treat SimpleDB with some level of logic , beware that it 's not necessarily designed to be logical .
I also am looking forward to the nightly SimpleDB extracts to MS Excel or SQLite , or Oracle or MySQL so I can , you know , query my data for trends & business analysis .
On the bright side , maybe this is Amazon 's way of convincing you to build your data warehouse early .

LOS ANGELES , Dec 7 ( Reuters ) - CompUSA , the computer and gadget retailer controlled by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim , has been sold to a restructuring and investment firm that will close stores and sell some company assets .
The new owner is Boston - based Gordon Brothers Group , which recently helped CompUSA sell under- performing stores .
The terms of the deal were not not disclosed .
Dallas - based CompUSA said on Friday that active discussions are underway to sell its technical services business , CompUSA Tech Pro , its online sales operation , CompUSA.com , and select stores in key markets .
The chain ’s 103 retail stores will remain open and staffed during the holiday season , offering discounts on computer and electronics ahead of the planned store closures .
“ An orderly and expedited wind - down and asset sale process is the best option for CompUSA and its creditors at this juncture , ” said Bill Weinstein , a Gordon Brothers principal who will be running CompUSA as its interim president .
“ We worked long and hard with Gordon Brothers Group to achieve a business solution that maximizes CompUSA ’s assets , ” said Roman Ross , CompUSA ’s current chief executive , who will continue to serve the company in an advisory capacity .
Earlier this year , the company closed more than half of its U.S. retail stores in a bid to streamline operations and bolster margins at top - performing stores .
Friday ’s sale did not come as a complete surprise to industry watchers .
News reports have suggested that Slim -- who is among the world ’s wealthiest individuals -- was seeking to unload more of his interest in the company .
A spokesman for Circuit City Stores Inc CC.N told Reuters on Friday that representatives from CompUSA approached his company about possibly taking over properties .
Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said prior to the announcement of the sale that the closure of more CompUSA stores would be a positive development for rivals Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N , Circuit City , Office Depot Inc ODP.N , OfficeMax Inc OMX.N and Staples Inc SPLS.O .
Consolidation in the electronic retailing sector has resulted in intense competition as large companies such a Best Buy Inc and Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N undercut smaller rivals such as CompUSA and Circuit City .

The Commodore 64 is arguably one of the best - designed computers ever .
It 's boxy enough to remind you it 's from the 1980s , but it 's got enough curves in just the right places that its look is almost timeless .
Unfortunately , the external Commodore 1541 disk drive coming with it was pretty much a slab of plastic that was bulkier and heavier than the computer it was supporting .
It was noisier too , making gronk sounds during ordinary operation and clacking when it encountered read or write errors .
The drive also ran hot , which led to many drives being adorned with fans on the rear vents .
The only thing less appealing than one of these monsters on your desk ?
Two of them .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The European Commission ruled Wednesday that charges MasterCard imposes on retailers are illegal , though the commission stopped short of imposing an immediate fine and gave the company six months to find a new arrangement .
The E.C. , which rules on antitrust policy throughout European Union member countries , said MasterCard 's MA , - 0.63 % " interchange fees " are illegal .
Visa has an exemption that runs through the end of the year .
MasterCard charges merchants a payment -- 5 euro cents plus between 0.4 % and 1.05 % of the transaction value for debit cards , and between 0.8 % and 1.2 % for credit card payments .
The fee applies on virtually all cross - border payments in Europe , as well to domestic payments in Belgium , Ireland , Italy , the Czech Republic , Latvia , Luxembourg , Malta and Greece .
Such fees are n't inherently illegal , the commission said , but they are when they do n't contribute " to technical and economic progress " and benefit consumers .
The E.C. will fine MasterCard 3.5 % of daily global revenue in six months if the fees are n't withdrawn .
MasterCard recorded $ 3.3 billion of revenue last year .
MasterCard said even though it does n't receive the interchange fees - issuers get them -- it would challenge the ruling .
" Market forces , not regulation , should drive key decisions such as the setting of interchange fees and retailers ' choices over which forms of payment to accept , " it said .
MasterCard insisted the fees are necessary to share costs for all participants in a payment system .
" Europe wants to reduce reliance on cash in favor of electronic payments , which are safer , cheaper , more secure and more convenient for consumers and merchants alike , " it said .
Retailers did n't share that view .
Retailers argue that MasterCard should charge per transaction and not take a cut of the overall sale .
" The sooner MasterCard accepts this ruling the sooner customers will benefit from these cost reductions .
We are now urging the Commission to ensure card companies do not try to wriggle round the effect of the decision by pushing up other charges or introducing new ones , " said Kevin Hawkins , director general of the British Retail Consortium , a trade body representing U.K. retailers .
MasterCard shares rose over $ 6 , or 3 % , in early trading .
Analysts said a similar ruling in Australia showed that card issuers , rather than credit - card firms , took a greater hit .
" In Australia , American Express was a significant beneficiary of mandated interchange reductions as its market share and profits rose significantly , " said David Hochstim , a Bear Stearns analyst .

For most people , Post - it Notes are disposable , ordinary office papers used for note - taking and reminders .
But for 19 - year - old David Alvarez of Leavenworth , Washington , they were the perfect medium for a 10 - foot - tall mosaic depicting Ray Charles .
David Alvarez , right , made this 10 - foot - tall mosaic of Ray Charles using Post - it Notes .
more photos »
Using more than 2,000 of those ubiquitous brightly - colored sticky scraps , Alvarez composed a three - dimensional representation of the famous musician .
The piece has just gone on display at Wenatchee Valley College in Wenatchee , Washington , where Alvarez is in his second year of studies .
" It 's something so simple .
You can still see the flaps sticking out on some of them , " he said .
" Naturally the Post - it Note just sort of flaps out . "
While learning new techniques in Adobe Photoshop in a class , he experimented with taking a photograph of Ray Charles and making it look like a mosaic on the computer screen .
He then translated this idea into the Post - it work .
He spent three months constructing the mosaic , sometimes sacrificing schoolwork for his art .
At least one of his papers for his summer English courses suffered , but he persevered so that he could participate in an art show July 28 at the Stanley Civic Center in Wenatchee .
Originally , the Post - it Notes stayed in this unique format only by virtue of their manufactured stickiness , which does not hold up as well as glue , Alvarez found .
When he displayed his work at the show , he monitored the project for 14 hours , continuously replacing notes that were falling off .
The aspiring art teacher now uses glue to hold the notes in place .
Do n't Miss
Got something to share ?
Send us your I - Report .
For his next project , he is considering a mosaic using 4 - inch x 4 - inch notes , up from the 3 - inch x 3 - inch size used in the Ray Charles piece .
" Part of me wants to , part of me does n't , " he said .
" It was so hard to align .
It took a lot of time and patience . "
E-mail to a friend
Presidential hopeful Ron Paul has n't been doing very well with the print media , and offline , his name recognition is n't that high .
But online , the libertarian candidate seems to have an almost cult - like following .
But how much of that is real ?
Much of Ron Paul 's online support may be at least partially manufactured by overenthusiastic supporters , as some researchers say that spammers have recently stepped up their efforts to gain support for their favorite candidate .
The University of Alabama - Birmingham 's computer forensics research department , which collects spam messages as part of its Spam Data Mining for Law Enforcement Applications project , analyzes hundreds of thousands of e-mail messages per month .
When it began getting bombarded with e-mails about Ron Paul immediately following a Republican debate on TV , the lab began to examine their origin and saw consistent patterns that it described as " disturbing . "
The e-mails originated from IPs all over the world , but researchers ' suspicions were aroused when they found that the e-mails purported to come from different countries than their IPs indicated .
Messages claiming to come from the US were actually coming from Korea , for example , and messages claiming to come from Italy were actually coming from the US .
The pattern showed that the messages were clearly not coming from Ron Paul 's official campaign , but rather illegitimate spam operations and botnets .
" We 've seen many previous e-mails reported as spam from other campaigns or parties , but when we 've investigated them , they all were sent from the legitimate parties , " department director Gary Warner said in a statement .
In contrast , the Ron Paul messages clearly came from a number of other parties attempting to spoof where they came from .
Paul 's campaign may run afoul of the authorities as a result of these e-mails .
Warner believes that the messages may violate the CAN - SPAM
Act due to their deceptive sending practices .
The Ron Paul camp , however , wants to make sure the world knows it 's not involved in the spam .
" This is the first I 've heard about this situation , " Ron Paul spokesman Jesse Benton told Wired .
" If it is true , it could be done by a well - intentioned yet misguided supporter or someone with bad intentions trying to embarrass the campaign .
Either way , this is independent work , and we have no connection . "
From Patriots for Corporate Rights , a pro-Bush organization —
We gathered again publicly in support of our beloved President George W. Bush !
About a dozen loyal Bushies gathered in Uptown Minneapolis in front of the Walker Library from 11:30 am to around 3 in the afternoon .
Here ’s video of our pro-war , pro-torture , anti-U.S. Constitution rally , chanting such things as :
“ Give up your rights ! , Abolish Congress , abolish the Courts , the Unitary Executive is all we need , TRUST BUSH ! , TRUST BUSH ! , TRUST BUSH ! ” and “ Two , Four , Six , Eight , We Want a Police State ! ” .
Moonbats like the people at ImpeachForPeace.org ( home of the Commie Pinko “ Do - It - Yourself Impeachment “ ) are trying to impeach this great man .
They do n’t understand that our President needs to be able to arrest , detain indefinitely , and torture Americans and members of other less worthy nations .
They fail to grasp that our Commander in Chief must be allowed to preemptively invade any country
He decides may be a threat to our own – or just have resources that can benefit the multi-national corporations he represents !
In short , they doubt that our Chief Executive is above the law !
Our first rally in February and was so succesfull ( http://corporaterights.org/blog/?p=3), Patriots for Corporate Rights came together again in support of this wonderful Administration !
We ’re also attempting to stop the impeachment resolution currently in the House Judiciary that is threatening to impeach Cheney .
We succesfully expressed our outrage at those who would dare to enforce laws that our President has decided are not important !

The Asus Eee PC 701 4G is the new affordable ultraportable notebook that ’s bound to be on many consumers ’
Christmas wishlists this year .
Retailing for somewhere between $ 299 and $ 399 , the Eee PC is n’t exactly a workhorse , but it will do just about every basic task you ’d need from a laptop .
Our initial hands - on actually proves it does more than we expected .
First , the specs for the review unit we have on hand , which is the Eee PC 701 4G :
Processor : Intel Celeron M ULV 900MHz
Storage : 4GB of Flash based storage ( SSD )
Memory : 512MB of RAM
OS : Linux ( Asus customized )
Screen : 7 - inch screen with 800 x 480 resolution
Ports : 3 USB , 1 monitor , headphone jack , microphone input , SD card reader ( SDHC compatible ) , Kensington lock slot , Ethernet 10 / 100
Webcam ( 0.3 MP )
Battery : 4 - cell 5200 mA ( rated at 3.5 hours )
Wireless : 802.11b/g Atheros
Input : Keyboard and Touchpad
We ’ve only had the Asus Eee PC for a few hours at the time of this writing , but wanted to share a few thoughts and some video before we do a more complete review next week .
Looks
The Asus Eee PC is n’t half bad looking .
It ’s all white , which in the long term might not do so well with showing dirt , but while it ’s pristine and clean in the first few hours , it sure looks nice :

Size Comparison
The Asus Eee PC is small , very small .
It weighs only 2lbs , if you include the power adapter then it still weighs under 2.5 lbs .
That ’s great for travelling .
If you ’re on the go and want a cheap device to take with you but still do some work or have some fun , this could be it :
Screen :
The screen is 7 - inches diagonally and has a resolution of 800 x 480 .
For the sake of a reference , here ’s what you can see when you pull up the homepage of the site you are on right now :
( view large image )
As you ’ll see from some of the videos in this article , it ’s no Sony XBrite display that offers jump off the screen contrast , but for your web surfing ( Firefox is pre-loaded ) and Open Office ( also pre-installed ) work needs you wo n’t really care .
We even found the colors serviceable for You Tube video watching needs ( more on that soon ) .
Below is a screenshot we took on the Asus Eee PC of the YouTube.com homepage , this is a good example of what you 'll see using the Eee PC screen resolution and size :
( view large image )
Keyboard and Input :
Okay , so the keyboard is far from being a ThinkPad keyboard , but it ’s not ( quite ) the worst keyboard we ’ve ever experienced on a notebook .
That said , we have to be honest and say it ’s a real challenge to get used to this keyboard if what you want to do is fast touch type input .
Some of the keys are a little wobbly , most of them are undersized and your fingers will most definitely strike the wrong keys as you get used to the weird size and positioning of the keys .

The Asus Eee PC likes the Apple iPod
Pleasant surprise number one .
We plugged in an iPod to the Eee PC and braced ourselves for nothing to happen .
But it did .
Upon plugging in the iPod the Eee PC launched the built - in music playing application .
It took about a minute for this to happen , but once the application was open we could see all of our playlists on the iPod and could play them through the Eee PC .
That called for playing some AC DC " Back in Black " to celebrate :
The Asus Eee PC works with USB devices flawlessly
We were concerned that all of the normal devices we use with Windows would flake out and not work on the Eee PC .
We were wrong again .
We plugged in a Logitech wireless mouse and it right away worked with the Eee PC .
Even the scroll wheel worked without issue , scrolling through FireFox was a breeze .
An external keyboard worked along with any thumb drive we plugged in .
Now do n’t go expecting your USB based TV card tuner to work out of the box with the Asus Eee PC , but it seems that most common peripherals will instantly have a happy relationship .
Voice prompt capability
One little fun thing about the Eee PC is that it has a built - in microphone and basic voice recognition software .
A built - in application that you can enable makes it so you call out to the Eee PC to open applications .
For instance , say " Computer Web " and it will chirp back " Web " and open FireFox .
Or say " Computer Clock " and it repeats back " Clock " and then pops up the time .
While neat , we found that after a while it started being a bit too good .
Jerry said " Sony " out loud in the room and the Asus Eee PC decided to open the " Movie " player .
Well , here ’s an example of when it works how it should :
Outputting to a larger monitor
We tested outputting to a monitor at 1280 x 1024 resolution .
The output was fine , but for video playback things began to choke a bit .
When opening up other applications at the same time as playing a video the sound and audio went out of synch and things got choppy .
The good news is that the built - in game PlanetPenguin Racer ( based on Tux Racer ) worked at a whopping 5 frames per second on the large monitor at max resolution .
It worked at 15 fps on the regular old 7 - inch screen .
Video playback
Again we were pleasantly surprised .
It seems that any MPEG4 based video will play back on the Eee PC .
DivX and xVid videos play without issue .
And yes , if you want to watch You Tube within your Fire Fox browser on the Eee PC that ’s completely doable .
In fact , here ’s a You Tube video of a You Tube video playing on the Eee PC to prove it ( that hurts to think about ) :
Web cam
The Asus Eee PC comes with a built - in 0.3 megapixel web camera that works quite well .
Once you enable it that is .
For whatever reason the camera was by default turned off in the BIOS and we had to go in and enable it for the camera to work .
For something that dubs itself as " Easy to work , Easy to play , Easy to learn " that ’s not exactly something you ’d expect .
We do n’t think grandma will figure that part out on her own .
Below is an example shot we took using the Eee PC webcam , it ’s a picture of the box it came in .
Not the greatest , but certainly not bad .
Updating the OS and Software
It turns out that all updates are done internally , including everything from Skype to the BIOS .
All you have to do is click on " Add Remove Programs " in the Settings area and it will check to see if any updates are needed to the system .
It will download any updates , apply them and restart itself .
So far this has worked flawlessly in our testing .
So far , so good
While this is in no way a comprehensive review , we just wanted to get some of this video out there and some first real hands on thoughts .
We 'll have a more honest and in depth formal review in the days ahead once the Asus Eee PC has stood the test of time for more than just a few hours with us .
A note on Availability
The caveat we have to throw out there is that we know the Eee PC is going to be hard to get for some time .
Supplies are short at the moment ( for various reasons ) and because of the price and expected high demand the Asus Eee PC is going to be another one of those gadgets that gets sold for a much higher price on eBay than it does at Best Buy .
Asus tells us the Eee PC should hit U.S. store shelves within weeks .
Keep your eyes open , because even if you blink it might be gone not long after it has touched those shelves .
The loss of deep - sea species poses a severe threat to the future of the oceans , suggests a new report publishing early online on December 27th and in the January 8th issue of Current Biology , a publication of Cell Press .
In a global - scale study , the researchers found some of the first evidence that the health of the deep sea , as measured by the rate of critical ecosystem processes , increases exponentially with the diversity of species living there .
" For the first time , we have demonstrated that deep - sea ecosystem functioning is closely dependent upon the number of species inhabiting the ocean floor , " said Roberto Danovaro of the Polytechnic University of Marche , in Italy .
" This shows that we need to preserve biodiversity , and especially deep - sea biodiversity , because otherwise the negative consequences could be unprecedented .
We must care about species that are far from us and [ essentially ] invisible . "
Ecosystem functioning involves several processes , which can be summarized as the production , consumption , and transfer of organic matter to higher levels of the food chain , the decomposition of organic matter , and the regeneration of nutrients , he explained .
Recent investigations on land have suggested that biodiversity loss might impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems , Danovaro said .
However , the data needed to evaluate the consequences of biodiversity loss on the ocean floor had been completely lacking , despite the fact that the deep sea covers 65 % of the Earth and is " by far the most important ecosystem for the cycling of carbon , nitrogen , and phosphorus of the biosphere . "
The deep sea also supports the largest " biomass " of living things , including a large proportion of undiscovered species .
In the new study , Danovaro 's team examined the biodiversity of nematode worms and several independent indicators of ecosystem functioning and efficiency at 116 deep - sea sites .
Nematodes are the most abundant animals on earth and account for more than 90 % of all life at the bottom of the sea .
Earlier studies have also suggested that nematode diversity is a good proxy for the diversity of other deep - sea species .
They found that sites with a higher diversity of nematodes support exponentially higher rates of ecosystem processes and an increased efficiency with which those processes are performed .
Efficiency reflects the ability of an ecosystem to exploit the available energy in the form of food sources , the researchers said .
Overall , they added , " our results suggest that a higher biodiversity can enhance the ability of deep - sea benthic systems to perform the key biological and biogeochemical processes that are crucial for their sustainable functioning . "
The sharp increase in ecosystem functioning as species numbers rise further suggests that individual species in the deep sea make way for more species or facilitate one another , Danovaro said .
That 's in contrast to terrestrial - system findings , which have generally shown a linear relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning , he noted , suggesting complementary relationships among species .
" Deep - sea ecosystems provide goods ( including biomass , bioactive molecules , oil , gas , and minerals ) and services ( climate regulation , nutrient regeneration and supply to the [ upper ocean ] , and food ) and , for their profound involvement in global biogeochemical and ecological processes , are essential for the sustainable functioning of our biosphere and for human wellbeing , " the researchers concluded .
" Our results suggest that the conservation of deep - sea biodiversity can be crucial for the sustainability of the functions of the largest ecosystem " on the planet .

Had it happened at Wimbledon , the sight of Tamira Paszek lunging around in a flimsy vest and straining sports bra would have left many venerable members of the All - England Club choking on their strawberries .
The 17 - year - old Austrian nearly pulled off the shock of the day at the Australian Open but it was more for her choice of tennis attire that she 'll live long in the memories of those present .
In the baking Australian heat , Paszek revealed a skimpy outift that was almost as stunning as her backhand .
Scroll down for more ...
Her third seed opponent , Serbian Jelena Jankovic , had to saved three match points to edge Paszek 2 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 12-10 in an opening - day marathon in the first Grand Slam tournament of the year .
The deciding set included 15 breaks of serve and took 1 hour , 56 minutes .
As a junior , Paszek , was a two - time finalist in the 2005 Girl 's Singles Championship at Wimbledon and at the US Open - Girls ' Singles in 2006 .
Powerful and strong , Paszek is known for her vicious two - handed backhand - and now her low - cut tops .
In 1938 , William Dodd , ambassador to Germany , sent President Franklin Delano Roosevelt the following message :
" A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell - bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy .
I have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime ....
A prominent executive of one of the largest corporations , told me point blank that he would be ready to take definite action to bring fascism into America if President Roosevelt continued his progressive policies .
Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy .
They extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power , and they are helping to keep it there .
Propagandists for fascist groups try to dismiss the fascist scare .
We should be aware of the symptoms .
When industrialists ignore laws designed for social and economic progress they will seek recourse to a fascist state when the institutions of our government compel them to comply with the provisions . "
In 1933 , Marine Corp Major General Smedley Butler was approached by a cabal of influential American bankers and industrialists working under the umbrella of the front group , American Liberty League .
Their request of Butler : that he lead a 500,000 strong force of rogue veterans in a coup against FDR and the legal American government .
The intent of this cabal , already supporting the efforts of Hitler and Mussolini in Europe , was to instill a government not unlike that of Hitler and Mussolini in the United States .
Butler went along with the scheme until he was able to ascertain who the participants were .
He then blew the whistle on this group before the House Committee on un-American Activities .
For his efforts , Butler was ostracized and black - balled by the mainstream media ; his testimony before the House Committee on un-American Activities was omitted from the record .
The cabal was never brought to justice , but the coup was foiled .
Who were the American bankers and industrialists involved in this plot to overthrow the legal government of the United States ?
According to Wikipedia , while most of the funding came from the Du Pont family , participants included U.S. Steel , General Motors , General Foods , Standard Oil , Birdseye , Colgate , Heinz Foods , Chase National Bank , and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company .
And among the participants in this coup attempt was one Prescott Bush , father of George Herbert Walker Bush , 41st president of the United States , grandfather of George W Bush , current president of the United States .
Prescott Bush was not only instrumental in bringing Hitler to power in Germany , Mussolini to power in Italy , but was also plotting to overthrow the legal government of the United States and establish a fascist state here .
Prescott Bush served as a Senator from Connecticut and was a partner in the prominent investment banking firm Brown Brothers Harriman .
It was from the lips of George Herbert Walker Bush that the American people heard the phrase , “ New World Order . ”
And America watched as GHW Bush passed the reins of power to his “ good friend who is like a member of the family , ” William Jefferson Clinton , who then passed the reins on to George Walker Bush in what can only be termed a fraud - ridden election , re-elected for a second term in the same manner .
Under the reign of George Walker Bush , we have watched him wage war on America , the American people , and American sovereignty ; we have watched him institute executive order after executive order in his pursuit of absolute power , labeling himself “ the decider ” while the American legislative branch does absolutely nothing to curtail his abuse of power .
His actions mirror those of Hitler in his quest for power in Germany .
And just like Hitler , Bush is using fear to keep the American people supporting his un-American activities , starting with the events of September 11 , 2001 .
And every time Bush wants something more , another threat emerges and Congress and the American people , with few exceptions , fall in step .
Yet the greatest threat to the American people , American sovereignty , the American way of life sits in the White House , not in Iraq , not in Afghanistan , not in the Middle East .
And if the reins of power are passed from George Walker Bush , which many at this point have serious doubts will happen , given Bush ’s ability to wage war on the American people through terrorism and the American people ’s willingness to blame the same on foreign born terrorists , that power will be passed , by corrupted balloting if necessary , to Hillary Rodham Clinton , protégé of self - avowed Marxist Saul Alinsky , who , in his book , Rules for Radicals , paid homage to Lucifer as “ the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom . ”
( 1971 ; Vintage Books ; dedication page ) Prophetic , indeed !
This past week we saw the collapse of the 35W bridge in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
Those in the know are ware that this bridge is part of the I - 35 NAFTA Super Highway Corridor , bisecting the United States ; providing transport on Mexican trucks of foreign cargo from the NAFTA port in Mexico through the United States to Canada and points east and west along that corridor .
Later this month , Bush will meet with his Security and Prosperity Partnership counterparts from Mexico and Canada , President Felipe Calderon and Prime Minister Steven Harper , to further the dissolution of the United States , Canada and Mexico into the European Union style regional world government entity , the North American Union .
Unlike the quick disposal of the Murrah Building and the WTC complex in New York , both the targets of “ terrorist activity ” , the 35W bridge still lies in the water with the National Transportation Safety Board , the FBI , state and local officials mulling over the scene and promising that the reason for the failure will be found .
Remember , this is the same NTSB that did the flight simulation of the plane supposedly inbound to the Pentagon on September 11 , 2001 , for the FBI ; the simulation that when studied by pilotsfor911 truth.com using the flight data recorder information provided by NTSB , found that the plane in question actually over flew the Pentagon by 300 to 400 feet !
Not only this , but that the simulator as provided by NTSB showed the plane on a different inbound trajectory than the path that supposedly sheered five light poles .
When questioned about these obvious anomalies , the NTSB had “ no comment . ” Imagine that !
In the case of the 35W bridge , government officials knew the bridge was structurally deficient ; that the bridge needed work ; but did nothing to correct the problems .
The government can lose 2.3 trillion dollars into a black hole in the Pentagon budget , money that has never been accounted for in the six years since September 10 , 2001 ; the government can spend trillions on an illegal and unconstitutional false flag invasion of Iraq ; but the government ca n’t fix bridges that provide access for the average American worker until after those bridges collapse and the resulting deaths become political fodder for talking heads such as George Walker Bush .
It took the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate all of 48 hours following the collapse of the 35W bridge to write , introduce and pass HR 3311 , providing $ 250 million to rebuild the 35W bridge .
What is the worth of the lives lost because of government negligence ?
Will the American people ever be told the truth about why the 35W bridge collapsed or will the government , in a CYA move so typical when wrong - doing is apparent , move to cover its tracks , obfuscate the issue , and provide no real answers ?
One has to wonder when people like W. Gene Corley , senior vice president of CTL Group , an engineering firm , who helped investigate both the Murrah Building and the WTC , are involved .
Both sights were scrubbed as quickly as possible , with no criminal investigation , leading any reasoning individual to the conclusion that the government definitely had something to hide .
Adding insult to injury in the collapse of the 35W bridge , George W Bush , on August 4 , 2007 , before the microphones in Minneapolis , Minnesota , quipped , “ God Bless the people of this part of the world . ”
True to form , King George .
Or has “ the decider ” now become World Emperor George ?
George W Bush is obviously a chip off the old block !

At the last Republican presidential debate , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , who had surged into the lead in the Iowa polls , pitched himself as the potential president who could unite a nation divided .
“ I think the first priority of the next president is to be a president of all the United States , ” he said .
“ We are right now a very polarized country , and that polarized country has led to a paralyzed government .
We ’ve got Democrats who fight Republicans , liberals fighting conservatives , the left fights the right .
Who ’s fighting for this country again ?
… We ’ve got to be the united people of the United States . ”
In the days before this debate , Huckabee , a former Baptist minister , was hit with questions regarding his past remarks and positions on religion ( in 1998 he said , “ I hope we …take this nation back for Christ ” ) , on AIDS ( in 1992 he proposed that people with the disease be quarantined ) , and on the role of women in society ( in 1998 he endorsed an ad affirming the Baptist teaching that a “ wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband ” ) .
And Huckabee was obviously trying to come across as a friendly and reasonable fundamentalist who eschewed the politics of division .
But not too long ago , Huckabee was quite willing to be divisive .
In a 1998 book decrying American culture , Huckabee was no seeker of common ground .
He drew stark lines , equating environmentalists with pornographers and homosexuality with pedophilia and necrophilia .
He also declared that people who do not believe in God tend to be immoral and to engage in “ destructive behavior . ”
He drew a rather harsh picture of an American society starkly split between people of faith and those of a secular bent , with the latter being a direct and immediate threat to the nation .
The book , Kids Who Kill : Confronting Our Culture of Violence , was hardly a call to come together .
Huckabee wrote it with George Grant in response to the March 24 , 1998 , school shooting in Jonesboro , Arkansas .
The book was published in early June of that year , its cover featuring a blurry photograph of a young boy pointing a gun at the reader .
In Kids Who Kill , Huckabee argued that school shootings were the product of a society in decline , a decline marked ( and caused ) by abortion , pornography , media violence , out - of - wedlock sex , divorce , drug use , and , of course , homosexuality .
Huckabee and his coauthor bemoaned the “ demoralization of America , ” observing , “ Despite all our prosperity , pomp , and power , the vaunted American experiment in liberty seems to be disintegrating before our very eyes . ”
Huckabee , who was governor at the time and a well - known social conservative , blasted away at those whom he held responsible for America ’s ills , and he took a rather tough stand against government social programs and their advocates .
In lamenting the “ cultural conflicts ” besetting the country , he wrote ,
Abortion , environmentalism , AIDS , pornography , drug abuse , and homosexual activism have fragmented and polarized our communities .
Why was he lumping environmentalism with activities he considered sinful ?
He did not explain further .
A few pages later , Huckabee complained ,
It is now difficult to keep track of the vast array of publicly endorsed and institutionally supported aberrations — from homosexuality and pedophilia to sadomasochism and necrophilia .
Huckabee did not say what public endorsement of pedophilia or necrophilia he had in mind .
But he did seem to be equating homosexuality with both .
Throughout the book , Huckabee warned of going soft on immorality .
He slammed those Christians who accept a “ misguided version of ‘ tolerance ' ” and do not voice outrage at cultural deterioration .
Mocking such Christians , he huffed , “ We do n’t want to offend anyone . ”
He denounced what he termed “ radical ideological secularism , ” and he declared , “ in the name of civil liberties , cultural diversity , and political correctness , a radical agenda of willy - nilly moral corruption and ethical degeneration has pressed forward . ”
Without identifying any secularists by name , he wailed ,
The legal commitment of ideological secularism to any and all of the fanatically twisted fringes of American culture — pornographers , gay activists , abortionists , and other professional liberationists — is a pathetically self - defeating crusade that has confused liberty with license .
This is not the rhetoric of a fellow looking to heal divisions within American society .
And Huckabee approvingly quoted a “ pastor - patriot ” of the early 1800s who said , “ Every considerate friend of civil liberty , in order to be consistent with himself , must be the friend of the Bible . ”
That ’s a rather fundamentalist definition of a civil libertarian .
In Kids Who Kill , Huckabee addressed the decline of manners and civil discourse in American life .
He favorably cited the trenchant analysis of the modern media culture that Neil Postman , a liberal critic , presented in his book Amusing Ourselves to Death .
Huckabee argued that the entertainment industry “ is conditioning kids to kill . ”
But he also groused about unnamed “ modern government - sponsored social engineers , ” claiming that “ virtually every dollar poured into ” government social programs “ has only made matters worse . ”
With such a remark , he was planting himself firmly in the government - is - the - enemy camp .
Elsewhere in the book , Huckabee denounced no - fault divorce and claimed that “ equality in the workplace has ironically worked against women in innumerable ways . ”
Looking for an expert on this matter , he pointed to a 19th - century author named Peyton Moore , who once noted , “ Whenever we attempt to muddy the distinctions — the God - given distinctions — between men and women , it is always the women who ultimately lose . ”
He did n’t say that women should stay at home .
But he heaped scorn on those who advocate workplace equality for women .
So what to do about a culture that breeds kid killers ?
Faith is more important than policy or politics , Huckabee argued .
The “ Judeo - Christian religion , ” he wrote , states “ that faith counteracts the destructive effects of sinful actions and activities . ”
That ’s what you would expect a religious - minded person to believe .
But Huckabee went further and declared that nonbelievers tend to be evildoers :
Men who have rejected God and do not walk in faith are more often than not immoral , impure , and improvident ( Gal. 5:19 - 21 ) .
They are prone to extreme and destructive behavior , indulging in perverse vices and dissipating sensuality ( 1 Cor. 6:9-10 ) .
And they — along with their families and loved ones — are thus driven over the brink of destruction ( Prov. 23:21 ) .
Huckabee is certainly entitled to his religious beliefs and his own view of human nature .
He is free to think that nonbelievers cannot be trusted .
But should Huckabee be allowed to play both sides of the pulpit ?
Kids Who Kill presented a black - and - white perspective : environmentalists , homosexuals , civil libertarians , supporters of social programs , advocates of workplace equality , and nonbelievers are on the dark side and allied with the forces of decline ; people who believe in the Bible are the decent Americans .
In 1998 , Huckabee was claiming a religion - oriented cultural war was under way in the United States and he was happy to be a warrior for his side .
Now he says he wants to bring together a “ polarized ” society .
His 1998 book — full of unforgiving rhetoric — indicates that Huckabee is more comfortable creating divides than bridging them .

Friday 's Worst Person in the World segment was preceded by a correction and apology to Rudy Giuliani for inaccurately reporting a quote of his from an AP story .
Keith Olbermann then promptly awarded Giuliani the Bronze for the corrected quote as it was equally offensive .
In fact , Rudy was the recipient of the Silver and Gold awards for his own inaccuracies , in statements made about the last Democratic presidential debate and prostate cancer survival rates in the U.S. versus Great Britain -- the statistics he used , as it turns out , happen to be seven years old and completely bogus .
Ok , Rudy , Keith made his correction and apology ... now it 's your turn .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The total economic impact of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is estimated at $ 1.6 trillion by 2009 , a congressional committee said in a report released Tuesday .
A soldier with the 101st Airborne Division guards an oil refinery near Baiji , Iraq .
That is nearly double the $ 804 billion in direct war costs the White House requested so far from Congress , the Democratic - led Joint Economic Committee said .
The committee estimated $ 1.3 trillion in war costs by the end of 2008 for Iraq , and the remainder for Afghanistan .
The total war costs could grow to $ 3.5 trillion by 2017 , the committee estimated .
The higher total economic impact comes from , among other things , the cost of borrowing money to pay for the war , lost productivity , higher oil prices and the cost of health care for veterans , the committee said .
The committee calculated the average cost of both wars for a family of four would be $ 20,900 from 2002 to 2008 .
The cost for a family of four would go up to $ 46,400 from 2002 to 2017 , the committee said .
The estimate was released as Democrats launch a new effort to force a withdrawal from the widely unpopular conflict .
Senate Republicans dismissed the report as a political document , arguing that Democrats have " hyped " the war 's impact on oil prices .
Watch how costs differ from pre-war projections , nonpartisan report »
" For every dollar we spend directly in Iraq , we 're going to pay another dollar for the indirect , but immediate , costs of the war , " Sen .
Charles Schumer , D - New York , said .
" We of the baby boom generation and our children and grandchildren will be paying for this war for a very long time to come . "
" We cannot afford this war -- $ 12 billion dollars a month ? " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said .
" We just can 't .
We can't continue . "
Schumer said finances will become a significant factor in the ongoing debate regarding the course of the conflicts .
" The cost of the war is becoming the $ 800 billion gorilla in the room when it comes to opposition in the war , " he said .
" It is becoming the first thing that people mention after the loss of life when they 're opposed to this war . "
" And the people who mention it , many of them , are not people who were against the war in the past , " Schumer added .
Office of Budget and Management Director Jim Nussle dismissed the report , saying " the Congressional leadership is attempting to manipulate economic data for public relations purposes . "
" There are several ... distortions within the report , such as attempting to tie war costs to overall business investment and the price of oil . "
Republicans , who said they were not included in the preparation of the report , also said the country has little choice but continue to bear the costs of the war .
" We have been protected from attack here at home , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky said .
" There 's progress that is obviously being made in Iraq . "
" We need to finish the job , and finish the job is to leave Iraq in a condition that it can defend itself and be an ally in the war on terror , " he said .
" What 's their alternative ? " Don Stewart , a McConnell spokesman , asked of the Democrats .
" Should we not fund veterans ?
Should we not send MRAPs [ armored personal carriers ] to Iraq ?
Not fund the GI Bill ?
" And how much will oil cost if the progress in Iraq is reversed and al Qaeda shuts down the oil deliveries ?
What will that do to the markets ? "
Stewart asked .
Stewart called the report " a Democrat report , prepared by the head of the Democrat campaign committee " -- a reference to Schumer , the head of the party 's effort to add Senate seats in 2008 .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino accused the Democrats of releasing the report for partisan reasons and to " muddy the waters " after a series of positive reports from Iraq -- including a reduction in violence , increased economic capacity of the country , and signs of continued political reconciliation " from the bottom up . "
" It 's positive and we hope it is a trend that will take hold , " Perino said .

Holiday lights give Selectmen pause
Posted Thursday , December 20 , 2007 1:51 pm
The board ultimately approved the request with a few caveats and after some discussion during its regularly scheduled meeting last night .
Times have changed
Dlugosz and fellow Selectmen Peter Fish and Alan Inglis all noted that , in this era of conservation and with the town trying to be more ecologically friendly , the concept of stringing electric lights across the streets for six or seven weeks during the holiday season appeared to go against that idea .
The town , said Dlugosz , supports green initiatives and conservation .
Leaving electric lights on at night is not necessarily in line with that , he said .
" I do n't get as much joy out of ( Christmas lights ) as I used to , " agreed Fish .
" At a minimum , I 'd like to ask the Chamber for a judicious use of the lights . "

Fish suggested that the board could work with the Chamber of Commerce to seek another way to observe Christmas as a community .
Town Manager Burke E. LaClair pointed out that the town does not pay for the lights .
Rather , a private fund set up by the Chamber covers the cost .

LaClair said the Chamber strings one set of lights across Main Street and a second set across Railroad Street .
He said he did not know exactly how many lights are used .
Dlugosz said that energy conservation  not cost  was really the issue .
Keeping with the theme

" The argument in favor of this , " said Selectmen Chairman Anthony Blair , " is that as an economy based on tourism , the town is making an attempt to look festive .
And that looking festive is a benefit to the merchants here , who derive a large portion of their income from the holiday season . "
That said , Blair admitted that he did not disagree with the comments of his fellow board members .
" Many communities have found other ways to decorate their town for the holidays , " he said .
Blair said he found Dlugosz 's argument " principled , but I think it 's unfair to turn ( the Chamber ) down at this late date . "
Dlugosz agreed .
He made a motion to approve the installation of the lights and to put the Chamber on notice to find a more energy - efficient way of celebrating the holidays next year .
In addition , the lights are to be turned off by 10 every night .
The motion passed 4 - 0 .
A statement to Sassoon 's commanding officer declining to return to duty , prepared with the assistance of Bertrand Russell and John Middleton Murry .
Copies were printed and distributed to influential people and to the press .
It was published inon July 27 , read to the British House of Commons on July 30 , and was then printed in the London Times the following day .
Sassoon 's friend and fellow - officer Robert Graves successfully persuaded the authorities that he was mentally ill , and so unfit to face a court - martial .
Instead , he was sent to Craiglockhart Hospital and treated for shell shock under the care of W. H. R. Rivers
​ Lt. Siegfried Sassoon .
3rd Batt : Royal Welsh Fusiliers .
July , 1917 .
I am making this statement as an act of wilful defiance of military authority because I believe that the war is being deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it .
I am a soldier , convinced that I am acting on behalf of soldiers .
I believe that the war upon which I entered as a war of defence and liberation has now become a war of agression and conquest .
I believe that the purposes for which I and my fellow soldiers entered upon this war should have been so clearly stated as to have made it impossible to change them and that had this been done the objects which actuated us would now be attainable by negotiation .
I have seen and endured the sufferings of the troops and I can no longer be a party to prolong these sufferings for ends which I believe to be evil and unjust .
I am not protesting against the conduct of the war , but against the political errors and insincerities for which the fighting men are being sacrificed .
On behalf of those who are suffering now , I make this protest against the deception which is being practised upon them ; also I believe it may help to destroy the callous complacency with which the majority of those at home regard the continuance of agonies which they do not share and which they have not enough imagination to realise .
The results of a paternity test , unlike some of the medical tests , are pretty easy to understand .
The box contains three sets of cotton swabs to collect cheek samples from the child , the alleged father and the mother .
( The mother is optional but helps strengthen the results , the company says . )
The swabs are put into separate packets and mailed to Sorenson ’s laboratory in Salt Lake City .
Results are provided by mail , fax or on a password - protected Web site within five days of the laboratory receiving the samples .
Sorenson said the test was for peace of mind and that the results would probably not stand up in court because questions could be raised about whose samples were submitted .
The kit advises people wanting to test for legal purposes to call the company and set up a chain of custody for the samples , which would cost an additional $ 200 .
At least one other genetic test is sold in a drugstore .
Sciona sells a $ 269 service that provides dietary advice based on genetic analysis through Pharmaca Integrative Pharmacy , a chain of 19 stores mainly in California and Colorado .
Rosalynn Gill , chief science officer of Sciona , said that Pharmaca , unlike most pharmacies , had dietitians on staff to help explain the purpose of the test to customers .
“ It ’s far too early to expect people to walk into a store and buy a genetic test directly off the shelf without some guidance or counsel , ” she said .
Still , Sciona gets most of its sales from the Internet and from multilevel marketing .
Mr. Fogg of Sorenson said the company now sold about 1,500 to 2,000 paternity tests a month through the Internet and hoped to increase that greatly through sales at drugstores .
It hopes to expand to all Rite Aid stores and possibly other chains , he said .
It also plans to begin advertising the test in stores , on the radio and possibly on television .
Ashley Flower , a spokeswoman for Rite Aid , would not comment other than to confirm that the kit was being sold in the three West Coast states .
Sorenson , which is bankrolled by a medical device entrepreneur , James LeVoy Sorenson , also offers ancestry testing .
Mr. Fogg said he did not know if that test would be offered through drugstores .

BBC News , Delhi
This is the first time India has done such a survey on child abuse
Commissioned by the Ministry of Women and Child Development , the study says 53 % of the surveyed children reported one or more forms of sexual abuse .
This is the first time the government has done such an exhaustive survey on the controversial issue of child abuse .
Abuse of children , particularly sexual abuse , is rarely admitted in India and activists have welcomed the study .
Releasing the report at a press conference in the capital , Delhi , Minister for Women and Child Development Renuka Chowdhury said : " In India there 's a tradition of denying child abuse .
It does n't happen here is what we normally say .
" But by remaining silent , we have aided and abetted the abuse of children . "
Thousands quizzed
Describing the findings of the study as " disturbing " , Ms Chowdhury called for an end to the " conspiracy of silence " .
The issue of child abuse has been raised in the past by non-governmental organisations , but this is the first time an attempt has been made by the government to document the scale of the problem .
The study took two years to complete , and covered 13 states where 12,247 children ( between five and 12 ) and 2,324 young adults ( over the age of 12 ) were quizzed .
Dr Loveleen Kacker , the official in charge of child welfare in the ministry , compiled the report .
She said the study had revealed that contrary to the general belief that only girls were abused , boys were equally at risk , if not more .
She said a substantial number of the abusers were " persons in trust and care - givers " who included parents , relatives and school teachers .
Ms Chowdhury said the findings of the study were disturbing
Dr Kacker said a disturbing finding of the study had been that 70 % had not reported the abuse to anyone .
Besides surveying physical and sexual abuse , the study also collected statistics on emotional abuse and neglect of girls .
The study called for efforts to make society aware of the rights of children and officials say the data will help them formulate better policies to protect children .
' One too many '
The report has been welcomed by child rights activists who say such a study was sorely needed in India .
Roland Angerer , country director of Plan International , told BBC News it was " very important that the government has finally taken up the issue " .
" It does n't matter what statistics say .
Whether the percentage of abused children is 75 or whether it is 58 is unimportant .
Each child that is abused is one too many , " he said .
" It 's important that parents and adults must learn that children are not property , that they have rights too . "
In India , parents are often reluctant to admit child abuse and sexual abuse of children involving family members is almost always hushed up .
The study also collected data on how girls are neglected
Perhaps that is why - as the study shows - more than 50 % of the young adults surveyed wanted the matter of abuse to remain within the family .
Only 17 % of the abused young adults wanted harsh punishment for the abusers .
Officials and activists say the biggest challenge for the authorities and society is to ensure that children are encouraged to report abuse .
India is home to almost 19 % of the world 's children .
More than one - third of the country 's population - 440 m people - is made up of children below 18 years of age .
According to one study , at least 40 % of these children are in need of care and protection .
The country has millions of child workers .
Many are employed in hazardous industries and also in homes and small restaurants , which makes them vulnerable to violence and exploitation .
Last year the government banned children under 14 from being employed in homes and at restaurants to avoid their exploitation and abuse , but millions of children continue to work in these sectors .
India is a signatory to various international laws on the protection of children , but implementation of these laws is often lax .
Principle Over Politics – The Case For Impeachment

Principles over Politics :
The Case for Supporting Impeachment
A Proposal from the Central Florida ACLU to all Florida Chapters
Dear Colleagues ,
As you know , on November 20 , 2007 , the ACLU Board of Central Florida approved a Resolution in support of impeachment proceedings against President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
The language of the Resolution is as follows :
The ACLU Board of Central Florida urges the Florida State ACLU Board to encourage the ACLU National Board to lobby the House of Representatives to file , without delay , articles of impeachment against George Bush , President , and Richard Cheney , Vice President , for grave and repeated violations of the U.S. Constitution .
We urge the Florida State Board to persuasively communicate this vote to the ACLU National Board .
The vote in favor of the Resolution was not taken lightly .
The board discussed the litany of constitutional violations committed by Bush and Cheney since 2000 .
In addition , the board discussed the decision by the ACLU of Southern California on November 14 , 2007 to support impeachment hearings against Bush and Cheney .
Finally , the board discussed Jeanne Baker and Howard Simon ’s comments regarding impeachment in their e-mail of November 20 , 2007 .
After considering the above , and with only three board members absent from the meeting , the Resolution was approved by all the board members present .
The Central Florida Board would like to take this opportunity to explain why we made this decision .
Furthermore , we would like to address the concerns and positions raised by Jeanne and Howard in their e-mail , which has already been circulated around the state in anticipation of this proposal .
Most importantly , the Central Florida Board urges all of the Florida Chapters to consider our Case for Supporting Impeachment and to sign on to the above Resolution .
Why Impeachment ?
“ We seek to provide you a means by which to effect the peaceful overthrow of a tyranny .
There should be no mistake about it , a usurper has acquired power in America .
He seeks to make it absolute .
He and his aides lie to us on television and berate us for our disbelief .
He speaks to us flanked by a photograph of family and our flag which he wears on his lapel .
Beside him stares a bust of Abraham Lincoln .
He confesses to crimes against the Constitution and believes he speaks of exoneration … ”
The words above are the opening lines of an ACLU pamphlet written by Charles J. Morgan , Jr. , the National Legislative Director of the ACLU in 1973 , concerning the impeachment of Richard Nixon .
Coincidentally , a few months after the publication of this pamphlet , the House Judiciary Committee rapidly recommended three Articles of Impeachment against Nixon for obstruction of justice , abuse of power , and contempt of Congress .
Confronted with probable impeachment and removal by Congress , President Nixon resigned shortly thereafter .
In retrospect , the violations committed by the Nixon Administration seem quaint in comparison to the graver violations committed by the Bush Administration .
A casual glance at our ACLU national website provides ample documentation of the Bush Administration ’s evisceration of our Nation ’s Charter : torture and abuse of prisoners , extraordinary rendition , warrantless surveillance , the elimination of habeas corpus , the politicization of the Department of Justice , and more than a dozen unanswered congressional subpoenas issued on these and other topics .
Articles of Impeachment for obstruction of justice , abuse of power , contempt of Congress , and on other grounds are certainly in order on these violations alone .
However , it is important to add that the above list of abuses are violations of law within the traditional sphere of concern of the ACLU .
In other words , there are many other grounds for impeachment that should be mentioned although they lie outside that sphere , including lying to Congress and the American People about Iraq , committing the crime of aggression by initiating war against Iraq , committing crimes against humanity in the conduct of the occupation of Iraq , the leaking of classified information , and threatening a war of aggression against Iran .
The documentation on our national website concerning the abovementioned impeachable offenses is such that it requires no further elaboration here .
Consequently , the question should not be , “ Why Impeachment ? ” Instead , the proper question should be , “ Why Not Impeachment ? ”
Principles over Politics
“ It can not be stressed strongly enough or often enough that Representatives who do not move to impeach , and who thereby fail to bring President Nixon to trial , are accomplices to a cover - up . ” – Charles J. Morgan , Jr. , the National Legislative Director of the ACLU , October 1973 .
A few national pundits have amused their readers by attempting to imagine under what conditions President Bush and Vice President Cheney could be impeached .
It is difficult to imagine , after all , since they have nearly exhausted the gamut of major constitutional offenses and have yet to face a serious impeachment threat .
Even a tacit policy of ethnic cleansing , which has been adopted by the Bush Administration for the Sunni - Shia civil war in Iraq , has been accepted in our country with hardly a whimper , let alone with the outrage that such a criminal policy deserves .
Perhaps only a full - blown act of genocide committed by Bush and Cheney would merit serious consideration for impeachment .
However , given the cynicism that characterizes much of our nation ’s current political climate , even an act of genocide could go unpunished .
The ACLU ’s stated mission is to preserve the protections and guarantees provided by the Bill of Rights plus the three post - Civil War amendments and the 19 th Amendment .
When faced with serious abuses of these protections and guarantees in the 1970s , the ACLU acted to correct these violations by , among other things , aggressively supporting the impeachment of Nixon .
This decisive action won the ACLU a great deal of credibility as well as many new members dedicated to defending the Constitution .
In stark contrast to the ACLU ’s decisiveness and commitment to principles in the 1970s , today ’s national leadership has been infused with a large dose of political cynicism .
Our national organization recognizes that grave and impeachable crimes have been committed , but refuses to endorse impeachment since this course of action is not considered politically expedient .
In our opinion , the ACLU ’s support or lack of support for impeachment should not be based on political calculations that are suspiciously similar to the calculations delineated by the dominant wing of the Democratic Party .
Instead , we believe that our support or lack thereof for this crucial topic should depend on the answer to a single question of principle : have George Bush and Richard Cheney committed and do they continue to commit several grave constitutional offenses that merit impeachment ?
The November 20 , 2007 e-mail sent by Jeanne Baker and Howard Simon urges Florida Chapters to ask an altogether different question from the question above .
The e-mail summarizes the national ACLU ’s opposition to taking an organizational stance on impeachment .
The e-mail raises several important arguments that we have first summarized and then addressed below :
1. Bush and Cheney are indeed guilty of constitutional crimes , but Congress has also aided and abetted in the commission of these crimes .
There is no question that Congress is complicit in these constitutional violations .
We do not believe , however , that congressional complicity exonerates the Executive Branch from impeachment for crimes against the constitution as this argument suggests .
In fact , congressional complicity only means that in addition to seeking the impeachment of the renegade Executive , we should also develop a strategy for holding congressional “ enablers ” responsible .
For example , we could encourage a campaign to vote out such Congressmembers as was the implicit policy ( see the quote of Charles J. Morgan , Jr. above ) of the ACLU during the Nixon impeachment .
2. Pursuing impeachment will let Congress divert attention away from its complicity in permitting these impeachable offenses .
The fact is that with today ’s well - behaved national ACLU , Congress is not suffering any adverse consequences as an accomplice to Bush and Cheney crimes .
In reality , little or no serious attention is being paid to congressional enabling .
The ACLU ’s current policy is , for all practical purposes , impunity for both the White House and the Congress .
An aggressive strategy targeting both the Executive and the Legislative Branches would allow us to pursue impeachment of the former while pursuing the “ roll - back ” of unconstitutional legislation in the latter .
3 . Impeachment is largely a symbolic act since Congress refuses to take up the issue and “ the votes are not there . ”
The issue of impeachment is yet to be sponsored by a major organization like the ACLU , so it remains to be seen whether or not such a policy would be symbolic .
However , it does appear that the ACLU ’s current “ Safe and Free ” Campaign has turned out to be a less - than - symbolic act .
Under the “ Safe and Free ” Campaign , Congress has retroactively legitimized many Bush and Cheney ’s offenses against the Constitution , which of course has made all of us much less safe and free .
The terrible results of this campaign merit revisiting our national strategy and considering a more principled , if not more audacious , approach such as impeachment .
4. Focus on impeachment would divert attention away from the national ACLU ’s approach of removing unconstitutional policies piecemeal .
Please refer to the comments above .
It is also important to mention that we are not proposing an “ either / or ” approach .
We are free to work on a new and improved “ Safe and Free ” Campaign targeting Congress while simultaneously working on impeachment .
5 . Even if impeachment were successful , the unconstitutional policies would remain in place ;
Many of the safeguards undone by the Bush Administration were safeguards passed by Congress in the wake of Watergate , which marked our country ’s last major constitutional crisis .
At that time , the impeachment drive led to a substantial number of secondary initiatives designed to safeguard our rights and liberties .
A successful impeachment drive today would have the desired effect of turning all Bush and Cheney initiatives into substances so toxic and radioactive that nobody would support them .
This effect , in turn , would facilitate the rollback in unconstitutional policies that we would be pursuing simultaneously with the impeachment initiative .
6 . The ACLU ’s current strategy to fix unconstitutional policies has largely failed ( “ Over the past ten months the organization has poured resources into this fight , believing that a new Democratic majority would be willing to address these issues .
Thus far we have been sorely disappointed . ” )
We could n’t agree more , but we are also sorely disappointed that the decision has been made to continue with the failed “ Safe and Free ” Campaign without considering more vigorous alternatives like impeachment .
Let ’s Practice What We Preach “ “ and Vote to Impeach
Once again , we believe that the ACLU ’s support or lack thereof for this crucial topic should depend on the answer to a single question of principle : have George Bush and Richard Cheney committed and do they continue to commit several grave constitutional offenses that merit impeachment ?
Our purpose in this proposal has been to persuade you , our fellow chapter colleagues , that this is the predominant question to be asked when considering support for impeachment .
We sincerely hope that you will join us in persuading our state organization that we must convince our national organization to make a vigorous call for the House of Representatives to support impeachment proceedings .
Sincerely ,
The Central Florida State Board
“ CALLING all Roys or Troys or Leroys , ” began an ad posted to Craigslist in October .
A photo of a heart - shaped tattoo with “ Roy ” inside accompanied the ad , which continued : “ I was with a Roy before but it did n’t last as long as my tattoo .
Getting the tattoo removed is not something I want to do , plus I ’m so accustomed to bellowing it ( Roy ) out in bed . ”
The writer said she was seeking a new Roy , or anyone whose name could be inked around the word , Scrabble - style .
It was signed Dynah , but actually written by Johnna Gattinella , a 31 - year - old writer in Santa Rosa , Calif .
Ms. Gattinella is working on a book called “ My Year on Craigslist ” that will include her fake ads and the often earnest responses .
“ A lot of men took the photo of the tattoo and put it in Photoshop and then altered it with their names or different variations and e-mailed it back , ” said Ms. Gattinella , who has n’t shopped the book to publishers yet .
The tattoo , by the way , is real , as is her husband , Roy .
Across the country , aspiring writers are using Craigslist not just as a place to offload their futons , but as a pixeled writing workshop where they test their stabs at social satire on some of the more than 30 million visitors that the site draws each month .
Their personal ads ostensibly seek a soul mate , but what they ’re really looking for is an audience .
How I scored a Nintendo Wii / I did it .
Lined up .
Waited in the cold at dawn .
For a video game .
What 's wrong with me ?
The sky was still inky and dark when I pulled into the Best Buy parking lot over on Geary at 6:00 am on that flat , cold Sunday morning , cold even for San Francisco , colder than Dick Cheney 's pitiless glare , colder than Rudolph 's darkest revenge fantasies , completely unsure as to what I 'd find there and completely unsure if I would be far too late or far too early because there was simply no way to tell .
This was the deal :
Two weeks prior , the uber - jaded Best Buy sales dudes told me that each Bay Area store was only getting about 100 units ( absolutely the final Wii shipment before Christmas , dude ) and they would sell them all when the doors opened at 8:00 am on Dec. 16 and it was first - come , first - served and hence there was no way to know just how insane or depressing or frightening it all might be .
I did n't know what to expect .
After all , I 'd seen the vulgar YouTube videos .
I 'd read the stories .
Hell , I even wrote some of them .
I know all too well the bizarre and depressing scenes of mayhem and destruction when mindless shoppers go on a rampage to save $ 19 on a Chinese - made plasma television at Wal - Mart , or when armies of unhinged , apple - shaped housewives scream and yank each others ' hair just to get their hands on a crazy - popular robotic talking dog for their 8 - year - old nephew .
And , like you , I 've always looked on those scenes with one part revulsion and one part fascination and all parts absolute conviction : Never .
Never will that be me , not in a million years .
No way in hell .
And yet , there I was .
Still , I made the vow early on :
If the line was at all crazy , if there some sort of simmering domestic gangland mentality hovering over the joint , I was outta there and my intended giftee would get a nice gift certificate for a Wii sometime in January .
Ah yes , the Wii .
For two years running the most unexpectedly and insanely popular video game console of the season , and Nintendo has apparently once again far underestimated demand .
Despite how their happy sweatshop factories in China are cranking out 1.8 million units per week ( can you hear that ?
That 's the sound of the planet 's landfills , groaning ) , it 's still not nearly enough to meet global demand .
Word has it that Nintendo could 've easily sold twice as many units as they manufactured this year , and hence lost well over $ 1 billion in sales as a result .
Strangely , I feel zero pity .
But now there 's a Wii shortage , and the Net is positively rife with tales of people going to ridiculous lengths to score one , waiting months and driving all over the city and haranguing wary toy store salespeople and paying way too much and becoming frantic and desperate and miserable .
And this is back in , like , August .
Then again , equally common are tales of effortless acquisition , people who just happened to be at the right place at the right time when a store got a shipment in , or who actually paid attention and asked around , or who live in a small town and the local toy shop had plenty in stock and it was no problem at all .
Me , I did a bit of searching around the Net , quickly summed up the situation ( two basic choices : eBay / Craigslist for a cool $ 150 - 250 markup , or keep hunting the retail stores and get your timing right , and pray ) .
Bottom line : it was bad , but not that bad .
Not Tickle - Me-Elmo , Cabbage - Patch - Kid , scratch - your - eyes - out bad .
Far from it , actually .
Either way , when I pulled into that lot , I was ready for anything .
Here 's what I found : Absolute calm .
Ease and laughter and lots of chilly bodies and very little stress .
At 6:00 a.m. there were already about 60 people waiting in line ahead of me , and I quickly learned that the first couple had arrived at midnight ( there 's always a few really crazy ones ) with the rest arriving in waves at 4 , 5 , 6 and beyond .
I was number 63 .
I was essentially guaranteed a Wii , if I could hold out and not freeze or become completely bored to death ( too dark to read my magazines , and while God bless the iPhone 's lovely Web surfing abilities , its touch screen is not at all fond of gloves ) .
Indeed , nearly everyone was thoroughly polite and many were completely bemused by the whole thing and I overheard many bouts of casual laughter , people chatting about how they 've never done anything like this before , this crazy silly standing - in - line - for - a - toy thing , but oh , it will be worth it , because their nephew / niece / son / daughter will sure love to see that Wii on Christmas morning .
Which made me smile , and sigh , and feel a little strange indeed .
Because it is very possible I was the only one in line who was buying a Wii , not for a child , not to flip for quick profit on eBay , but for an adult .
For my sister .
My 47 - year - old sister , the brilliant naturopathic doctor up in Seattle .
What can you do ?
She wants it for the exercise , the entertainment , the sheer goofy never - done - this - before fun of it all .
Specifically , she wants to try " Dance Dance Revolution " ( samples here , here , and , most famously / disturbingly , here ) in her living room and stomp around to hyper - remixed ' 80s hits and wave her arms around like a maniac and maybe break a sweat and have a blast .
Given her workload and aside from walking her dogs , she does n't have the time to go to a gym or a yoga joint or shoot heroin into her eyeballs .
She saw a Wii demo at a toy store , and was hooked .
Plus , unlike the other game consoles that emphasize raging ultraviolence and insane graphics and are essentially aimed at paroxysmal 11 - year - old boys , the Wii , with its interactive remotes and cute , non-slaughteriffic games , is catching on big with families , the elderly , Mormon shut -ins , just about everyone .
It 's nothing short of a phenomenon .
An environmentally devastating , happily wasteful , ultimately brain - numbing phenomenon , but a phenomenon nonetheless .
Then again , it 's my older sister .
She is n't exactly a glutton for stupid , excessive gizmos .
Thoughtless consumeristic waste is n't exactly a family pastime .
Besides , how often do I get a chance to be one of those people who wait in line at dawn for a hunk of Chinese - made hype ?
To contribute heartily to the end of the world and the imminent apocalypse of man ?
This is the American dream , baby .
The doors opened promptly at 8:00 .
I had my numbered wristband and we all marched , calmly and dutifully , into the store and passed by the various mountains of shiny tantalizing toxic plastic crap and one by one we were handed our precious Wiis and everyone happily paid their $ 250 plus accessories ( well over 25 grand in sales in one fell swoop ) , and , as it turned out , only a handful of people were turned away at the end .
And I have to say , it was all worth it , if only to imagine my sister dancing like a lunatic in her living room as her dogs bark and jump and stare at her like she 's lost her mind .
Hell , I might even do something like that again someday .
After all , she 's a pretty good sister .

WASHINGTON , Pa. -- Barry Bonds has a public offer on the free - agent market -- from the independent Washington Wild Things , who play not far from where Bonds began his major - league career in Pittsburgh .
Of course , a pay cut is involved .
Bonds , who made about $ 16 million last season for the San Francisco Giants , would have to settle for the independent Frontier League 's maximum salary of $ 1,200 per month .
There are extras , though : The Wild Things are offering a 50 - 50 share on merchandise sales and a pledge to find a host family for Bonds so he does n't have to rent an apartment in this southwestern Pennsylvania city .
On the road , Bonds would get a king - sized single room , a major perk on the minor - league level .
" Many of the great ones eventually return to where their careers began , " general manager Ross Vecchio said Tuesday .
" Babe Ruth began his career with the Red Sox and then finished it with the Boston Braves .
Willie Mays started with the New York Giants and finished with the Mets. Hank Aaron began and ended his career in Milwaukee . "
Bonds can make more money by reaching incentives for breaking the Frontier League 's single - season records for home runs ( 35 ) , RBIs ( 100 ) and walks ( 85 ) .
Washington offers Bonds a route back to the majors , Vecchio said , with 17 former Wild Things players moving on to affiliated minor - league teams since the franchise began play in 2002 .
" This contract gives Barry the opportunity to play once again in western Pennsylvania as he continues his career , " Vecchio said .
The Triple - A Toledo Mud Hens recently sent Alex Rodriguez a contract offer that included incentives if he hits 75 home runs for them next season .
baghdad --
Child fighters , once a rare presence on Iraq ’s battlefields , are playing a significant and growing role in kidnappings , killings and roadside bombings in the country , U.S. military officials say .
Boys , some as young as 11 , now outnumber foreign fighters at U.S. detention camps in Iraq .
Since March , their numbers have risen to 800 from 100 , said Maj.
Gen. Douglas Stone , the commander of detainee operations .
The Times reported last month that only 130 non -Iraqi fighters were in U.S. custody in Iraq .
Stone attributes the rise in child fighters in the country , in part , to the pressure that the U.S. buildup of troops has placed on the flow of foreign fighters .
Fewer of them are making it into the country , he said , and the militant group Al Qaeda in Iraq is having a difficult time recruiting adults locally .
Thus , it has turned to children .

“ As our operations have increased , Al Qaeda [ in Iraq ] and others have used more minors in the fight against us , and in the process we have detained more and more juveniles , ” Stone said .
He said the children make effective fighters because they are easily influenced , do n’t experience fear in the same way as adults and do n’t draw as much scrutiny from U.S. forces .
Other causes for the increase in detentions may be that U.S. forces are simply coming into contact with more children because of the troop buildup , and that financial pressures may have pushed some Iraqi families toward the militants .
Stone said some children have told interrogators that their parents encouraged them to do the militants ’ dirty work because the extremists have deep pockets .

Insurgents typically pay the boys $ 200 to $ 300 to plant a bomb , enough to support a family for two or three months , say their Iraqi instructors at a U.S. rehabilitation center .
About 85 % of the child detainees are Sunni and the majority live in Sunni Arab - dominated regions in the country ’s west and north .
In these deeply impoverished , violence - torn communities , the men with money and influence are the ones with the most powerful arsenals .
These are the children ’s role models .
The rise of child fighters will eventually make the Iraq conflict more gruesome , said Peter W. Singer , a Brookings Institution expert on child fighters .
He said militant leaders often treat children as a cheap commodity , and peace will be less attainable because “ conflict entrepreneurs ” now have an established and pliable fighting force in their communities .

Websites feature stories of child martyrs as an inspiration , and on the other side of the sectarian divide , radical Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada Sadr ’s Mahdi Army also boasts of youngsters ’ involvement .
“ This shows that the Mahdi are a popular resistance movement against the occupiers .
The old men and the young men are on the same field of battle , ” Sadr spokesman Sheik Ahmad Shebani told the London Daily Telegraph .
The boys are arrested under a wide range of circumstances , and their commitment to insurgents is believed to vary greatly .
Although some of their alleged offenses include kidnappings and killings , the vast majority are held for allegedly planting bombs in the road in exchange for money , authorities said .

The rise in young fighters compounds the savagery that has already shuttered many schools , left children wounded and hungry , and killed parents before children ’s eyes .
For their American captors , the apparent surge of child fighters confuses enemy and friend on the battlefield even further , and it causes renewed scrutiny of the military ’s detention policies and lack of judicial access for juvenile detainees in custody .
To accommodate the influx of boys , and to break the hold of the militants , a new education facility opened here Aug. 13 .
It sits a bus ride away from Camp Cropper , the U.S. detention area where the boys , between the ages of 11 and 17 , live segregated from many others of the estimated 24,000 suspected insurgents in American custody in Iraq .

The new education center replaces Camp Cropper ’s one - room schoolhouse and accommodates all but 100 who are ineligible for school because they are severely developmentally disabled , ill or too militant .
The students , a quarter of whom are illiterate , study basic Arabic , English , math , geography and science in air - conditioned tent classrooms .
Dubbed the House of Wisdom , the classrooms are surrounded by concrete walls topped with razor wire .
In daily civics lessons , the boys study Iraqi history and new government institutions .
A team of psychiatrists will provide regular counseling .
A large library will hold 4,000 volumes and already has English textbooks , computer manuals and a set of Harry Potter books translated into Arabic .
“ We have quickly realized , ” Stone said during an interview at the new site , “ that most of these young men are victims not only of Al Qaeda [ in Iraq ] , but also of their own illiteracy .
Because they could n’t read or write , they also could n’t work , and unemployed young men are also angry young men , susceptible to the cunning arguments of extremists . ”

In classroom A5 , a Times reporter was allowed to observe the children , but not ask them questions .
An Iraqi teacher with khaki trousers and sunglasses perched over his baseball cap led an Arabic lesson for about 30 boys .
“ Who wants to read ? ” he asked .
Hands rose across the room .
The teacher chose a boy in the back row with his hair slicked back and asked him to choose a story .
The boy thumbed through the book carefully , settling finally on a story about a narrator who finds a captive , abused cat and decides to feed , water and release it .

“ It ’s about freedom , ” the boy said .
The boys sat in a classroom decorated with their crayon drawings of houses , flowers and palm trees .
An Iraqi flag was pinned to the plywood wall , and a pile of prayer rugs was neatly stacked on a white plastic chair .
The facility expands rehabilitation efforts at previous detention sites for children at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad , where the Red Cross complained that children suffered improperly harsh treatment , and Camp Iguana at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where only children 16 and younger typically have been segregated from adults .
Abu Ghraib has since been handed over to the Iraqi government , and the detainees have been transferred to Camp Cropper .
“ Establishing this type of facility , ” Singer said , “ sends a message to the American people and the world that we are not doing evil deeds to these children .
. . .
But telling these detainees that we are going to treat you well and you will read Harry Potter still does n’t resonate with someone who says , ‘ I want to die killing you . ’ ”

Some of the boys write the name of a militant leader across their prison uniforms , telling the guards it is the name of a parent or loved one , said Kareem , an Iraqi American who acts as a counselor to the boys and asked that his surname not be used .
Adult detainees try to instigate the minors by wrapping notes around stones and tossing them over the wall at their sleeping quarters or by calling out to them .
The message they send is that the teachers and guards are infidels who will try to convert them to Christianity , Kareem said .
Clashes between sects led to segregation of Sunni and Shiite detainees in their sleeping quarters , but they still study , play and eat together .
In December , guards at Camp Cropper put down a riot when about 240 boys ripped toilets from the floor and hurled stones and concrete , said 1st Lt. Rob Glenn , the juvenile education administrator .

Stone acknowledged that the child detainees at Camp Cropper include a growing number of hardened Islamic extremists , and he said he worried about the influence they have over other youth , some of whom say they committed their alleged crimes under coercion .
Last month , for instance , soldiers stopped a 13 - year - old boy carrying a homemade bomb on his bicycle .
The boy told his interrogators that Al Qaeda in Iraq militants had kidnapped his mother and sister and forced him to do the job , said Col.
Paul Funk , commander of the U.S. Army ’s 1st Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division .
In such cases , the military often asks the boy ’s tribal leader whether he believes the child had been coerced and whether the leader will assume responsibility for his future actions .
In this case , the sheik said the boy was a criminal , so he was detained , Funk said .
Hicham Hassan , spokesman for the Red Cross and monitor for American detention facilities , said his agency has filed a formal complaint with the military regarding the denial of access to an attorney and the courts .
The military holds the boys for up to a year before they are released or forwarded to the Iraqi judicial system for trial .

The use of children by the militants has some precedent in the regime of Saddam Hussein , who used the organization Ashbal Saddam -- Saddam ’s Lion Cubs -- as a paramilitary force of boys between 10 and 15 that fed the fedayeen units led by his son Uday .
The remnants of the fedayeen make up one of the insurgent forces fighting today , and in at least three Iraqi cities , children reportedly took aim at U.S. troops during the 2003 invasion .
Stone believes that just as boys can be trained to become militants , they can be rehabilitated .
A Christian , the major general reads the Koran daily to help his efforts to give the boys the tools to question the militancy they have been taught .
Some signs indicate that by isolating the boys from extremists , progress can be made .

Early drawings by some of the boys showed pictures of masked gunmen defeating Iraqi soldiers .
In later drawings , the masked gunmen were the losers .

GRASSE , France —
The delicate hybrids thriving in the balmy climes of Provence , southern France ’s traditional perfume region , include sweet jasmine , May roses — and fresh layers of artificial human skin .
Scientists here are working feverishly to develop new technologies to test cosmetics before a European Union ban on animal testing begins in March 2009 .
These advanced materials — including reconstructed eye tissue and tiny circles of skin developed from donor cells harvested from cosmetic operations — are a vital part of the industry ’s future as it faces rapidly tightening European regulations , rules that apply to any company wishing to sell in the 27 - nation European Union .
The looming European ban is not only forcing multinational companies to adopt new practices .
It is also bringing together regulators in Brussels with agencies from the world ’s other large cosmetics markets — the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the Ministry of Health in Japan — to harmonize regulation .
Bill Moyers recently interviewed Benjamin Barber , a renowned political theorist and a distinguished senior fellow at Demos — a public policy think tank here in New York City .
Barber ’s most recent book is Consumed : How Markets Corrupt Children , Infantilize Adults , and Swallow Citizens Whole ( 2007 ) .
What ’s the focus of this book ?
[ T ]he global economy produces too many goods we do n’t need , too few of those we do need , and , to keep the racket going , targets children as consumers in a market where shopping is a twenty - four hour business .
Capitalism , he says , “ seems quite literally to be consuming itself , leaving democracy in peril and the fate of citizens uncertain . ”
Barber argues that we now have “ push capitalism ” :
They ’ve got to sell all this stuff , and they have to figure out how to get us to want it .
So they take adults and they infantilize them .
They dumb them down .
They get us to want things .
And then they start targeting children .
Because it ’s not enough just to sell to the adults .
One prominent example is bottled water , which is often actually bottled tap water .
Was there ever really a demand for expensive bottled tap water ?
Yet so many of us demand it and claim to need it .
Barber argues that American adults are , indeed , infantilized .
What I mean is that grownups , part of being grown up is getting a hold of yourself and saying , “ I do n’t need this .
I ’ve got to be a gatekeeper for my kid .
I want to live in a pluralistic world where , yes , I shop , but I also pray and play and do art and make love and make artwork and do lots of different things .
And shopping ’s one part of that . ”
As an adult , we know that .
But if you live in a capitalist– society that needs to sell us all the time , they ’ve got to turn that prudent , thoughtful adult back into a child who says , “ Gimme , gimme , gimme .
I want , I want , I want . ”
Just like the kid in the candy store .
And is grasping and reaching .
Barber argues that push capitalism is threatening democracy .
It seduces us into thinking that being a consumer is being a citizen .
That a citizen is nothing more than a consumer .
That voting means spending your dollars spreading around your private prejudices , your private preferences .
Not reaching public judgments .
Not finding common ground .
Not making decisions about the social consequences of private judgments , but just making the private judgments .
And letting it fall where it will .
How do we combat this threat of the hyper - consumption of un-needed goods and services that is driving us deeply into debt ?
Barber makes three suggestions .
First of all we , as consumers , have to be tougher .
We are the gatekeepers for our kids and our families .
We have to be tougher .
I mean , I ask anyone out there who needs to go out at 2:00 AM to go shopping ?
For God sakes , wait ’til Monday afternoon .
Second thing is capitalism has to begin to earn the profits to which it has a right , when it takes real risks .
Inventing something that is needed .
Folks working in alternative energy , some of them are going to make real money .
Barber ’s third approach is a slap at those who disparage government and naively tell us that we should look to the “ free market ” to solve our problems .
What 's in a name ?
Plenty , if it happens to be your name .
And on Sept. 5 , the name in question belonged to Mets reliever Willie Collazo , who took the mound at Shea Stadium with his moniker misspelled on the back of his jersey .
Collazo thus joined the small but growing fraternity of players who 've been victimized by that most unseemly yet highly entertaining phenomenon : the uniform typo .
Uni Watch has always loved jersey - borne misspellings , because they function like passive blooper reels .
In a sports world in which almost everything feels premeditated and calculated , typos provide a welcome dose of spontaneity .
And in an industry that thrives on mythmaking , typos also offer a much - needed reminder the even most perfectly conceived image can be shattered by a simple misplaced vowel , and that a multijillion - dollar industry is only as strong as its most underpaid seamstress ' spelling skills .
Best of all , uni typos offer equal opportunity .
Everyone is vulnerable , from journeymen to superstars , from the trickiest names ( it should be " Francoeur " ) to the simplest ones .
Not even fans are immune .
Happily , we may now be living in the most typo - prone period in uni history -- an era of error , if you will -- because most people now think of spelling as something their computer automatically fixes for them .
Since nobody has figured out how to load a spell - check function onto a sewing machine or a heat press , uni typos are sure to continue .
Toss in our increasingly " Gotcha ! " obsessed culture , a media climate in which everything is documented in excruciating detail ( Uni Watch happily pleads guilty ) , and the increasing barrage of alternate and throwback uniforms ( each of which provides more opportunities for additional typos ) and you start to realize that working in a uniform sewing shop is probably a lot more stressful than it might initially seem .
" A misspelling is your biggest fear , " says Joe Hilseberg , who spent seven years working in the Baltimore shop that does lettering for the Orioles ' and Ravens ' jerseys .
" It 's something that should never happen .
When I see a mistake like that , I think , ' How many people did that go through and none of them caught it ? '
Fortunately , no mistake of mine ever got to the seamstress .
A couple of times I might have done something like mixing up the ' E ' and the ' I ' in ' Palmeiro ' when I was setting up the letters , but I 'd switch them back before they got sewn on . "
Fortunately for those of us who enjoy life 's little glitches , not everyone in the uniform industry is quite as attentive as Hilseberg .
And unless these kids end up in the uni biz , typos will no doubt continue to be a fixture on the uniform landscape .
Here are some of Uni Watch 's favorites ( and no , none of them were Photoshopped ) :
1. Joe Carter , July 14 , 1994 .
This one , legendary among uni-philes , is an all - time classic : a city 's proud name , besmirched for all to see .
The big question is why it took until the sixth inning for Carter to notice the mistake and change jerseys .
2. Adam Riggs , Aug. 16 , 2003 .
What 's worse than having your city name misspelled ?
Having your team name misspelled .
( Further details on this instant classic are available here . )
3. Matthew Harmon , Sept. 16 , 2006 .
And what 's worse than having your team name misspelled ?
Try having your school name misspelled .
And it 's one of the U.S. service academies .
And it 's only four letters long .
( It could 've been worse : According to the fourth item in this article , the entire Western Illinois basketball team wore " Illinios " on their chests for the first six home games of the 2001 - 02 season .
Unfortunately , photos have so far been elusive .
Stay tuned . )
4. Ted Kluszewski , May 8 , 1960 .
The typo scene really opened up in 1960 , when the White Sox became the first major sports team to put player names on the backs of uniforms ( for details , including some recollections of long - ago typos , look here ) .
Unfortunately for the team 's seamstress , the ChiSox roster that year included Big Klu , whose name was basically a typo waiting to happen .
And happen it did , during a road trip to New York , where Kluszewski appeared as " Kluszewsxi " -- with a backwards " z " for good measure ( all of which prompted The New York Times to engage in a bit of proto- uni- watching ) .
5. Wayne Gretzky , Oct. 30 , 1997 .
You 're the greatest player in the history of the sport , you 're playing for the league 's marquee franchise , and your name is synonymous with hockey , so you 'd think they could at least spell it correctly .
But you -- and whomever lettered your jersey -- would be wrong .
6. Ryan Jorgensen , Aug. 26 , 2007 .
As Uni Watch has documented in the past , athletes can be a superstitious bunch .
So consider the dilemma Jorgensen recently faced :
He hit a first - inning grand slam , but then one of his teammates pointed out that his name was misspelled on his jersey ( it should end in " sen , " not " son " ) .
So in that situation , do you keep wearing the inaccurate moniker , or do you forsake the jersey that helped you hit a salami ?
Seems like a tough choice , but not for Jorgensen , who switched to a properly lettered jersey within two innings .
7. Aaron Harang , April 12 , 2005 .
Admit it , you 've probably misspelled " Cincinnati " at some point in your life .
But probably not like this .
8. Eliezer Alfonzo , June 3 , 2006 .
This would be just a routine typo if not for its backstory , which lends a certain poignancy to the proceedings .
Check it out : Alfonzo was a journeyman who'd toiled in the minors for more than a decade before finally getting his call to the bigs .
He was supposed to meet the Giants in New York for a game against the Mets , but his flight was canceled because of a thunderstorm .
So he took a three - and - a - half - hour limo ride through the downpour and made it to Shea Stadium just in time to learn that the game had been rained out .
The next day he showed up to find his name had been penciled into the starting lineup -- and that he'd be making his big league debut with his name misspelled on his jersey ( it should end in " zo , " not " so " ) .
Undaunted by this slight , he hit a game - winning homer .
And his reward ?
His name was still misspelled the next day .
( A's pitcher Joe Slusarski suffered a similar indignity when making his major league debut in 1991 .
After taking a red - eye flight to make an emergency start , he found his jersey lettered with " Sluzarski . "
Details here . )
9. Bill Belichick , Sept. 30 , 2007 .
Uniform typos are n't limited to players .
And it 's somehow fitting that the NFL 's resident homeless - looking man would fall victim to sloppy spelling .
Here 's the deal : Belichick 's omnipresent gray sweatshirt is usually emblazoned with " New England Patriots Equipment . "
But during the Pats ' recent Monday night game against the Bengals , the first " E " was missing .
Yet another reason for coaches to dress like Mike Nolan .
10 . Joakim Noah , Oct. 9 , 2007 .
Here 's one Uni Watch has n't seen before : an intentional typo .
No photo , unfortunately , but according to this article , Bulls equipment manager John Ligmanowski recently decided to put a unique spin on rookie hazing by putting " Noha " on the back of Noah 's jersey .
Good thing nobody thought of this when Robert Fick was a rookie .
Honorable Mention : Fred Robbins of the Giants was saddled with a backwards letter two seasons ago .
...
When Jim Fregosi began managing the White Sox in the middle of the 1986 season , his jersey initially read , " Fergosi . "
Details here .
... David McClure has most likely been dealing with this misspelling his entire life .
...
The same probably can't be said , however , for Paul McAnulty .
...
When Steve Garvey joined the Padres in 1983 , the team 's uni supplier initially provided jerseys with " Gravey " on the back , although none of the misspellings ever made it onto the field .
Details here .
... Mark Brunell sported a very strange double - typo of sorts back on Sept. 11 , 2005 , when he wore " Redskin " -- singular instead of plural -- on his jersey and on his rear helmet liner .
Despite Uni Watch 's dogged inquiries , no explanation has ever emerged .
...
Typos happen on equipment , too .
... A surprisingly rich source of typos : the Stanley Cup .
For a good breakdown , scroll down to the middle of this page .
...
In a related item , when the Oilers won the Cup in 1983 , Ken Linseman 's name was misspelled as " Linesman " on his championship ring .
...
And let 's not forget West Virginia 's NIT championship T - shirts from earlier this year .
...
According to this article , LaDainian Tomlinson has a tattoo of his mother 's face on his right arm , accompanied by the words " My Insperation . "
It 's worth noting , incidentally , that there 's at least one team that 's never had a uniform misspelling : the Yankees .
With a simple logo on the front and no player names on the back , they 're typo - proof .
And that seems somehow appropriate , because uniform typos are fun , playful and human -- all things that the Yanks refuse to allow themselves to be .

Iraq 's oil infrastructure appears to be getting back on track
The IEA said Iraqi crude production is now running at 2.3 million barrels per day , compared with 1.9 million barrels at the start of this year .
It puts the rise down to the improving security situation in Iraq , especially in the north of the country .
But the IEA warned that attacks on Iraqi oil facilities remain a threat .
In southern Iraq , more than 85 % of the residents of Basra believe British troops have had a negative effect on the Iraqi province since 2003 , according to a BBC poll .
The survey for BBC Newsnight of nearly 1,000 people also suggests that 56 % believe their presence has increased the overall level of militia violence .
Sabotage attacks
In its latest monthly Oil Market Report , the IEA puts the Iraqi increase in production down to improved security on the main oil pipeline from Iraq 's northern oilfields to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey .
The [ BBC ] survey 's results suggest that only 2 % of Basra residents believe that British troops have had a positive effect on the province since they helped the US overthrow Saddam Hussein in March 2003
BBC poll : UK troops blamed New era , new fears
In recent years this pipeline has been out of action for long periods due to sabotage attacks .
Since the summer there has been a marked downturn in all forms of violence in Iraq .
Analysts point to a number of reasons for this , ranging from the big increase or " surge " in American troop numbers in Baghdad , to Sunni militant groups turning against former al - Qaeda allies .
British forces are due to hand control of security in Basra province to Iraqi forces on Sunday .
The security improvements in Iraq are leading to all sorts of dividends in the country , some of which could be enormously lucrative , said BBC correspondent Crispin Thorold in Baghdad .
Threat remains
While the level of violence has reduced , the threat has certainly not gone away .
Earlier this week , three car bombs exploded in the southern Iraqi city of Amara , killing at least 39 people and injuring more than 100 , according to local police .
Iraq has the third - largest proven oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Iran , but exports plummeted in the face of the insurgency that flared up following the US - led invasion .
Separately , the IEA said world oil demand would grow faster in 2008 than had previously been expected .
Saying markets were proving resilient to near record - high prices due to continuing strong global demand , the IEA now expects oil demand to increase by 2.1 million barrels per day , 200,000 bpd higher than the previous forecast .
The Paris - based IEA represents the world 's largest oil consuming nations .
Would You Bet $ 100,000,000 on Your Pet Programming Language ?
Here 's my proposition : I need an application developed and if you can deliver it on time I 'll pay you $ 100,000,000 ( USD ) .
It does n't involve solving impossible problems , but difficult and messy problems : yes .
What language can you use to write it ?
Does n't matter to me .
It 's perfectly fine to use multiple languages ; I 've got no hangups about that .
All that matters is that it gets done and works .
As with any big project , the specs will undoubtedly change along the way .
I promise not to completely confuse the direction of things with random requests .
Could you add an image editor with all the features of Photoshop , plus a couple of enhancements ?
What about automatic translation between Korean and Polish ?
3D fuzzy llamas you can ride around if network transfers take a long while ?
None of that .
But there are some more realistic things I could see happening :
You need to handle data sets five times larger than anticipated .
I also want this to run on some custom ARM - based hardware , so be sure you can port to it .
Intel announced a 20 core chip , so the code needs to scale up to that level of processing power .
And also ... hang on , phone call .
Sadly , I just found out that Google is no longer interested in buying my weblog , so I 'm rescinding my $ 100,000,000 offer .
Sigh .
But imagine if the offer were true ?
Would you bet a hundred million dollars on your pet language being up to the task ?
And how would it change your criteria for judging programming languages ?
Here 's my view :
Libraries are much more important than core language features .
Cayenne may have dependent types ( cool ! ) , but are there bindings for Flash file creation and a native - look GUI ?
Is there a Rich Text Format parsing library for D ?
What about fetching files via ftp from Mercury ?
Do you really want to write an SVG decoder for Clean ?
Reliability and proven tools are even more important than libraries .
Has anyone ever attempted a similar problem in Dolphin Smalltalk or Chicken Scheme or Wallaby Haskell ...er , I mean Haskell ?
Has anyone ever attempted a problem of this scope at all in that language ?
Do you know that the compiler wo n't get exponentially slower when fed large programs ?
Can the profiler handle such large programs ?
Do you know how to track down why small variations in how a function is written result in bizarre spikes in memory usage ?
Have some of the useful but still experimental features been banged on by people working in a production environment ?
Are the Windows versions of the tools actually used by some of the core developers or is it viewed as a second rate platform ?
Will native compilation of a big project result in so much code that there 's a global slowdown ( something actually true of mid-1990s Erlang to C translators ) ?
You 're more dependent on the decisions made by the language implementers than you think .
Sure , toy textbook problems and tutorial examples always seem to work out beautifully .
But at some point you 'll find yourself dependent on some of the obscure corners of the compiler or run-time system , some odd case that did n't matter at all for the problem domain the language was created for , but has a very large impact on what you 're trying to do .
Say you 've got a program that operates on a large set of floating point values .
Hundreds of megabytes of floating point values .
And then one day , your Objective Caml program runs out of memory and dies .
You were smart of course , and knew that floating point numbers are boxed most of the time in OCaml , causing them to be larger than necessary .
But arrays of floats are always unboxed , so that 's what you used for the big data structures .
And you 're still out of memory .
The problem is that " float " in OCaml means " double . "
In C it would be a snap to switch from the 64 - bit double type to single precision 32 - bit floats , instantly saving hundreds of megabytes .
Unfortunately , this is something that was never considered important by the OCaml implementers , so you 've got to go in and mess with the compiler to change it .
I 'm not picking on OCaml here ; the same issue applies to many languages with floating point types .
A similar , but harder to fix , example is if you discover that at a certain data set size , garbage collection crosses the line from " only noticeable if you 're paying attention " to " bug report of the program going catatonic for a several seconds . "
The garbage collector has already been carefully optimized , and it uses multiple generations , but there 's always that point when the oldest generation needs to be scavenged and you sit helplessly while half a gigabyte of complex structures are traversed and copied .
Can you fix this ?
That a theoretically better garbage collection methodology exists on paper somewhere is n't going to make this problem vanish .
By now fans of all sorts of underdog programming languages are lighting torches and collecting rotten fruit .
And , really , I 'm not trying to put down specific languages .
When I 'm on trial I can easily be accused of showing some favor to Forth and having spent time tinkering with J ( which honestly does look like line noise in a way that would blow the minds of critics who level that charge against Perl ) .
Yes , I 'm a recovering language dilettante .
Real projects with tangible rewards do change my perceptions , however .
With a $ 100,000,000 carrot hanging in front of me , I 'd be looking solely at the real issues involved with the problem .
Purely academic research projects immediately look ridiculous and scary .
I 'd become very open to writing key parts of an application in C , because that puts the final say on overall data sizes back in my control , instead finding out much later that the language system designer made choices about tagging and alignment and garbage collection that are at odds with my end goals .
Python and Erlang get immediate boosts for having been used in large commercial projects , though each clearly has different strengths and weaknesses ; I 'd be worried about both of them if I needed to support some odd , non-UNIXy embedded hardware .
What would you do ?
And if a hundred million dollars changes your approach to getting things done in a quick and reliable fashion , then why is n't it your standard approach ?

Police last night accused the government of attempting to ban 10,000 officers from marching through Westminster in a mass protest over their pay award .
The demonstration would be the force 's biggest since 1919 .
Relations between the Home Office and the force have fallen to a new low , with the Police Federation of England and Wales , the body that represents 124,000 rank - and - file officers , claiming the government is ' interfering behind the scenes ' over plans for the march to Parliament on 23 January .
The high - profile demonstration , intended to highlight the force 's anger over its recent below - inflation , 1.9 per cent pay rise , is threatening to become a major political flashpoint in the new year .
The police claim their preferred route for their march is set to be banned under archaic ' sessional orders ' , laws drawn up in the early 19th century to combat large - scale radical protests that threatened a disturbance of the peace .
The orders are renewed by Parliament each year and invoked by the Metropolitan Police if the force believes a protest will prevent MPs from going about their daily business .
Critics of the orders claim they are a heavy - handed response designed to stifle peaceful protest .
Last night the federation claimed that parliamentary officials were in talks with the Met with a view to banning the march outside Parliament and said the government had no intention of lifting the orders so that the protest could go ahead .
' There appears to be some behind - the - scenes government interference , ' said Alan Gordon , vice - chairman of the federation .
' There is pressure being brought on the Metropolitan Police to either postpone the march altogether or to reroute it in such a way that it will disappear into side streets where it will be out of the public gaze . '
The latest skirmish between the thin blue line and the government follows months of bitter wrangling over pay .
Earlier this year there was widespread outrage among police officers in England and Wales after they discovered that a 2.5 per cent pay rise was not going to be backdated .
It meant their real pay rise was 1.9 per cent .
Rank - and - file officers will shortly be balloted on whether they should have the right to take industrial action , which is currently illegal .
Any move to ban or reroute the march would heighten tensions between the two sides in the run-up to the ballot .
' The government is extremely embarrassed by this whole affair , ' Gordon said .
' They realise they have made a crass decision by not backdating this pay and I think they were hoping that the whole problem would disappear over the Christmas break . '
The government denied it was attempting to block the protest .
A Home Office spokesman said any decision on the march was not up to the government .
' The decision is a matter for the Metropolitan Police , ' the spokesman said .
The Met confirmed it was in talks with the federation over whether the march would go ahead .
' We are in discussions with the Police Federation regarding the planned demonstration on 23 January , ' a Met spokeswoman said .
Gordon said using archaic orders to ban or reroute the march on law - and - order grounds would widen the rift between the police and government .
' To think there is a likelihood of public disorder from 10,000 police officers marching through central London is a nonsense , ' he said .
' I can only assume they are doing this because they do not want the embarrassment .
It will just raise the police 's anger and mistrust of this government . '
Media , politicians maintain silence on flight of US nuclear bomber
By Bill Van Auken
14 September 2007
When analyzing the US corporate - controlled media , it is often more important to take note of what is not reported than what is .
Such is clearly the case with the revelation earlier this month that a US B - 52 Stratofortress bomber flew nearly 1,500 miles over the length of the United States with six nuclear - tipped cruise missiles fixed to its wings .
The flight took place August 30 between Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana .
The story was broken by Military Times , the web site of the weekly papers published by the Gannett Corporation for the different branches of the American military .
It evinced only minimal interest from the major media outlets , which relegated it to news items buried deep in the inside pages of major dailies like the New York Times and the Washington Post , both of which uncritically regurgitated the official line of the Air Force that the flight represented a “ mistake ” that never represented any serious danger .
Since then , there has been only silence .
No major newspaper or broadcast network has made any attempt to carry the story forward .
No background pieces have been published analyzing the present state of the US nuclear war machine .
And there is no evidence of any attempt to obtain more information from the Air Force officers who leaked the story to the Military Times .
The media blackout cannot be explained by any objective standard of the newsworthiness of this story .
According to what is publicly known , it marked the first time that an American bomber armed with nuclear weapons has taken to the air in nearly 40 years .
Each of the missiles mounted on the pylons of the aircraft ’s wings carried warheads that are 10 times as destructive as the first American atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima six decades ago .
Given the death toll inflicted upon the Japanese city in 1945 , a rough mathematical extrapolation would suggest that the plane was carrying weapons of mass destruction capable of killing five to six million people in a nuclear holocaust that would eclipse any single atrocity in the history of the planet .
The silence of the press has the earmarks of self - censorship in the face of what was in all likelihood a sharp admonition from the White House and the Pentagon that any public discussion of the event could endanger national security .
There is an ample record of such suppression of news , including , for example , the admission by the New York Times last year that it had bowed to White House pressure to hold back a story on the National Security Agency ’s illegal domestic spying program in the run-up to the 2004 elections .
It appears that the Bush administration ’s ostensible political opponents in the Democratic Party are keeping their mouths shut for the similar reasons .
In the immediate aftermath of the revelations concerning the flight , several lawmakers issued statements expressing shock over the flight and acknowledging that the event was something that they had consistently been told could never happen .
Typical was that of Congressman Ike Skelton , the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , who declared the development “ deeply disturbing . ”
“ There is no more serious issue than the security and proper handling of nuclear weapons , ” he said , adding , “ This committee will continue to pursue answers on this classified matter to ensure that the Air Force and the Department of Defense address this particular incident and strengthen controls more generally . ”
Yet , when contacted on September 13 , more than a week after this statement , a spokesperson for Skelton ’s committee said that no hearings have been scheduled on the nuclear flight .
“ No decisions about that have been made , ” she said .
“ We ’ve been pretty busy the past week . ”
The Senate Armed Services Committee likewise confirmed that it has called no hearings on the matter .
Skelton ’s reference to his supposed intention to “ pursue answers on this classified matter ” strongly suggests that to the extent the Democratic Congress does receive any information , it will be kept secret from the public .
For its part , the Pentagon , as a matter of policy , refuses to confirm or deny that the plane was carrying nuclear warheads .
The Air Force is continuing an investigation into the matter — reportedly including daily briefings to Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
It has scheduled a general mission “ stand - down ” for the US Air Combat Command on Friday , September 14 , in which all units — including those that do not handle nuclear weapons — will review procedures .
A report from the Air Force apparently will be issued following this review , but it is almost certain to be classified .
The real questions are from whom are these secrets being kept and to what end ?
The answer to the first question is self - evident ; it is the American people who are being kept in the dark .
Why this is being done cannot be stated with certainty , but it appears that both the silence and the initial account given by the Air Force that the nuclear - armed flight represented a “ mistake ” are aimed at covering up why this plane was really sent into the air .
One place where the event has been given extensive attention is on the readers ’ forum page of the Military Times web site , which headlines the section “ Mistake or message . ”
Some 500 items have been posted , in many cases by people identifying themselves as former Air Force personnel who were involved in the US nuclear strike force .
A substantial share of these postings sharply question the official story floated by the Pentagon .
One correspondent , identifying himself as a “ retired B - 52 crew chief , ” described the official account as “ unbelievable . ”
He wrote : “ Back in 1979 we had to sign for nuclear weapons verifying serial numbers , the security folks posted two man guards at the aircraft , the cops enforced two man maintenance crews access to the aircraft , the 781s are annotated , maintenance job control was informed , the wing command post was informed , weapons were moved in an armed convoy , etc .
How were the weapons removed from storage ?
Who was guarding the weapons , military troopers or contractors ?
How were they transported to the aircraft ?
How were the aircraft forms updated ?
How was the chain of custody broken ?
Did the flight crew and munitions maintenance OICs [ officers in charge ] verify weapons status ?
What the hell happened here ? ”
Someone self - described as a “ former cruise missile troop ” writes , “ I do not see how this could have happened .
If the ‘ missile shop ’ failed to download the heads before taking them to the flightline , the crew loading them on the plane has a checklist asking them to ‘ verify no warheads installed , ’ as do the pilots .... ”
Another correspondent questions claims that the weapons were merely being moved from one base to be decommissioned ( destroyed ) :
“ When I was in the Air Force and worked on these types of missiles we never would have sent these missiles out on a B - 52 for decommissioning .
These missiles would have had their warheads removed and boxed for shipping and the missile body itself would have been boxed up and both items would have been shipped out [ on a ] C - 5 .
This was the only way we ... could have shipped them out , not on or in a B - 52 .
This could not have happened , we are not being told the whole story , there has to be more to it ! ”
`
Another posting reads : “ I think everyone here is making an assumption that they did n’t know .
This is an absurd assumption .
As soon as those ACMs [ advanced cruise missiles ] hit the hard - mounts , the talkback between the computers instantly enabled .
The crew knew they were carrying nukes long before they finished the checklist for takeoff . ”
A correspondent who writes that he was an Air Force officer in the late 1970s describes the intricate procedures that are carried out before a nuclear weapon leaves the site where it was stored :
“ A nuclear weapon can only be removed from an igloo upon written orders originating with a very limited number of senior base command officers and signed by at lease three other senior officers .
Even then , the senior OIC of the arsenal site along with at least one junior officer will only order a weapon be retrieved and prepared for transfer after they both have verbally confirmed their written orders to do so with the base commander or his deputy .
This is done using special limited access and encrypted telephone lines or in person , and verification is accomplished only after each party has correctly read a unique sequence of letters and numbers printed on their orders .
A senior OIC along with at least one junior munitions officer will arrive at the arsenal site at the time designated in their orders to transport the weapon .
They will have already verified their written orders with a very senior base command officer .
Each pair of munitions officers can only sign and be responsible for a single weapon at a time , and they must be accompanied by a special highly trained munitions crew and by a squad of heavily armed security police officers .
After the two arsenal site officers and the two munitions officers have each visually verified the serial number of the weapon being transferred matches the serial number typed on both sets of their orders , all four must sign both sets of orders indicating the transfer has been verified and completed .
A maximum of four nuclear weapons can be transferred to the flight line in each convoy , but each weapon must have their own team of officers with verified orders , munitions specialist , and a security detail .
Also , the printed orders for the OIC of each munitions team indicate exactly which aircraft will receive that weapon and exactly where every weapon is to be mounted .
Everyone involved is trained to repeatedly triple check everything for accuracy . ”
He goes on to detail similar procedures for the flight crew , which he notes “ can easily and clearly view a weapons display that electronically verifies every weapon system installed on their aircraft .
That display also clearly identifies every weapon as being a practice , conventional or nuclear weapon . ”
The former officer concludes : “ Therefore the only conclusion I can come up with is that this event must have been concocted by someone to appear as an accident .
And , because nuclear weapons were said to be involved , orders approving such an event most certainly came from the White House . ”
The present administration in Washington has repeatedly boasted that it maintains “ all options on the table , ” including the use of nuclear weapons , in its global war on terror and its confrontations with supposed “ rogue states . ”
In 2002 , it drafted a Nuclear Posture Review that for the first time enunciated a preemptive nuclear first - strike policy against non-nuclear nations .
In 2006 , it was revealed that the Bush administration had drawn up plans for attacks on Iran , including the use of “ tactical nuclear devices ” to wipe out the country ’s fledgling nuclear program as well as its security forces and much of its infrastructure .
And , more recently , two leading British military analysts published a report on US preparations for an attack on Iran in which they note “ clear evidence that nuclear weapons use [ against Iran ] is being given serious political consideration ” in Washington .
( See “ British academics warn US is preparing ‘ shock and awe ’ attack on Iran ” )
Under these conditions , the flight of the nuclear - armed US bomber has the most ominous significance .
The silence of the media and the politicians is aimed at concealing the dire implications of this event from the people of the US and the world .

How comfy we are all in the United States , as we engage in living - room debates about the US occupation of Iraq , whether “ we ” are bringing them freedom and whether their freedom is really worth the sacrifice of so many of our men and women .
We talk about whether war aims have really been achieved , how to exit gracefully , or whether we need a hyper - surge to finish this whole business once and for all .
But there ’s one thing Americans do n’t talk about : the lives of Iraqis , or , rather , the deaths of Iraqis .
It ’s interesting because we live in an age of extreme multiculturalism and global concern .
We adore international aid workers , go on mission trips abroad , weep for the plight of those suffering from hunger and disease , volunteer in efforts to bring plumbing to Ecuador , mosquito nets to Rwanda , clean water to Malawi , human rights to Togo , and medicine to Bangladesh .
But when “ we ” cause the calamity , suddenly there is silence .
There is something odd , suspicious , even disloyal about a person who would harp on the deaths of Iraqis since the US invasion in 2003 .
Maybe a person who would weep for Iraq is really a terrorist sympathizer .
After all , most of the deaths resulted from “ sectarian violence , ” and who can stop crazed Islamic sects from killing each other .
Better each other than us , right ?
Well , it ’s about time that we think about the numbers , even though the US military has decided that body counts are not worth their time .
Opinion Research Business , a highly reputable polling firm in the UK , has just completed a detailed and rigorous survey of Iraqis .
In the past , the company ’s results have been touted by the Bush administration whenever the data looks favorable to the US cause .
But their latest report received virtually no attention in the US .
Here is the grisly bottom line : more than one million people have been murdered in Iraq since the US invasion , according to the ORB .
Yes , other estimates are lower , but you have to be impressed by what they have found .
It seems very credible .
In Baghdad , where the US presence is most pronounced , nearly half of households report having lost a family member to a killing of some sort .
Half the deaths are from gunshot wounds , one - fifth from car bombs , and one - tenth from aerial bombs .
The total number of dead exceeds the hugely well - publicized Rwandan genocide in 1994 .
You are welcome to inspect the detailed data .
Aside from the astonishing detail , what jumps out at me is the number of dead who are neither Sunni nor Shia .
It is also striking how the further geographically you move from US troop activity , the more peaceful the area is .
Americans think they are bringing freedom to Iraq , but the data indicate that we are only bringing suffering and death .
If you have ever lost a family member , you know that life is never the same again .
It causes every manner of religious , social , and marital trauma .
It ’s bad enough to lose a family member to some disease .
But to a cold - blooded killing or a car bomb or an airplane bomb ?
That instills a sense of fury and motivation to retribution .
So we are speaking of some 1.2 million people who have been killed in this way , and that does not count the numbers that were killed during the invasion itself for the crime of having attempted to oppose invading foreign troops , or the 500,000 children and old people killed by the US - UN anti-civilian sanctions in the 10 previous years .
And let ’s not flatter ourselves into thinking that these are nothing but ragheads killing each other for no good reason .
Just this past weekend , there is an example in point .
Some of the legendary contractors for the State Department were driving through the Sunni neighborhood of Mansour in Baghdad .
They were driving their SUVs when witnesses reported an explosion of fire that lasted 20 minutes .
The SUVs drove off , leaving at least nine people dead on the road .
Why ?
No one knows .
Sure there will be investigations .
There have already been apologies .
The company in question has had its license to practice occupation revoked by the Iraqi government .
For how long , no one knows .
But these are merely symbolic gestures .
There will be no justice , and no forgetting .
To the extent anyone pays attention to this stuff , they only hear the words of the State Department spokesman :
“ The bottom line is that the secretary wants to make sure that we do everything we possibly can to avoid the loss of innocent life . ”
In light of the one million plus figure , such statements come off as evil jokes .
The US has unleashed bloodshed in Iraq that is rarely known even in countries we think of as violent and torn by civil strife .
It is amazing to think that this has occurred in what was only recently a liberal and civilized country by the region ’s standards .
This was a country that had a problem with immigration , particularly among the well - educated and talented classes .
They went to Iraq because it was the closest Arab proxy to Western - style society that one could find in the area .
It was the US that turned this country into a killing field .
Why wo n’t we face this ?
Why wo n’t we take responsibility ?
The reason has to do with this mysterious thing called nationalism , which makes an ideological religion of the nation ’s wars .
We are god - like liberators .
They are devil - like terrorists .
No amount of data or contrary information seems to make a dent in this irreligious faith .
So it is in every country and in all times .
Here is the intellectual blindness that war generates .
Such blindness is always inexcusable , but perhaps more understandable in a time when information was severely restricted , when technological limits actually prohibited us from knowing the whole truth at the time .
What excuse do we have today ?
Our blindness is not technological but ideological .
We are the good guys , right ?
Every nation believes that about itself , but freedom is well served by the few who dare to think critically .
An essential postulate of the Western idea , or so we tell ourselves , is the universal and ultimate value of human life .
And indeed it is true .
No person or group of people is without value — not even those whom our own government chooses to label the enemy .

Ex -Cheney aide Libby to drop appeal in CIA leak case RAW STORY
Published : Monday December 10 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Former White House aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby is dropping his appeal in the CIA leak case , his attorney said Monday .
Libby , the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , was convicted of perjury and obstruction for lying about his conversations with reporters about outed CIA operative Valerie Plame .
" We remain firmly convinced of Mr. Libby 's innocence , " attorney Theodore Wells said .
" However , the realities were , that after five years of government service by Mr. Libby and several years of defending against this case , the burden on Mr. Libby and his young family of continuing to pursue his complete vindication are too great to ask them to bear . "
President Bush commuted Libby 's 30 - month jail sentence in July .
Libby paid a $ 250,000 fine and must serve two years ' probation .
Libby remains a convicted felon , but Bush could issue a full pardon as his administration winds down .
Wells said he has not discussed a possible pardon with the president and does not know what Bush will do .
Libby was the only person charged in the investigation into the leak of Plame 's identity .
Nobody was charged with the leak itself , which Plame alleges was politically motivated .
Her husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , was a vocal critic of the Bush administration 's war policy .
The decision to drop his appeal is also a tactical one .
Even if a federal appeals court overturned Libby 's conviction , it would only lead to a new trial .
If Libby were convicted again , a presidential commutation would n't apply , meaning he might have to serve jail time .
And by that time , President Bush likely would be out of office .
" The appeal would lead only to a retrial , " Wells said , " a process that would last even beyond the two years of supervised release , cost millions of dollars more than the fine he has already paid , and entail many more hundreds of hours preparing for an all - consuming appeal and retrial . "
Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has said the leak investigation is closed .

The transition from apes to humans may have been partially triggered by the need to stand on two legs , in order to safely carry heavier babies .
This theory of species evolution presented by Lia Amaral from the University of São Paulo in Brazil has just been published online in Springer ’s journal , Naturwissenschaften .
For safety , all nonhuman primates carry their young clinging to their fur from birth , and species survival depends on it .
The carrying pattern changes as the infant grows .
Newborns are carried clinging to their mother ’s stomach , often with additional support .
Months later , infants are carried over the adult body usually on the mother ’s back , and this carrying pattern lasts for years in apes .
However , this necessity to carry infants safely imposes limits on the weight of the infants .
Through a detailed mechanical analysis of how different types of apes - gibbons , orangutans and gorillas - carry their young , looking at the properties of ape hair , infant grip , adult hair density and carrying position , Amaral demonstrates a relationship between infant weight , hair friction and body angle which ensures ape infants are carried safely .
Amaral also shows how the usual pattern of primate carrying of heavy infants is incompatible with bipedalism .
African apes have to persist with knuckle - walking on all fours , or ‘ quadruped ’ position , in order to stop their young from slipping off their backs .
The author goes on to suggest that the fall in body hair in primates could have brought on bipedality as a necessary consequence , through the strong selective pressure of safe infant carrying , as infants were no longer able to cling to their mother ’s body hairs .
In the author ’s opinion , safe carrying of heavy infants justified the emergence of the biped form of movement .
Although an adult gorilla is much heavier than an adult human , its offspring is only half the weight of a human baby .
Amaral concludes that this evolution to bipedality has important consequences for the female of the species .
Indeed , it frees the arms and hands of males and juveniles , but females have their arms and hands occupied with their young .
This restriction of movement placed limits on food gathering for biped females carrying their infants , and may have been at the origin of group cooperation .

Why Bother Buying New Propaganda When You 've Still Got So Much Perfectly Fine Old Propaganda Lying Around ?
Which well - known Iranian leader could be described as " wild , " " erratic , " " eccentric , " " crazy , " " gangster - like , " " fanatical , " " absurd , " " dictatorial , " " demagogic , " " inflammatory , " " cunning , " " slippery , " and " unbalanced " ?
Answer below .
Actually , it 's a trick question .
According to an article by Baruch historian Ervand Abrahamian ( via All the Shah's Men ) , these terms were all used by the British government in the early fifties to describe Mohammed Mossedegh .
( In 1953 , the UK persuaded the US to help them overthrow Mossedegh 's government and install the Shah . )
Yet every single one of those thirteen terms has also been used by American and British media and politicians to describe Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
What are the odds that we'd have to deal with TWO wild , erratic , eccentric , crazy , gangster - like , fanatical , absurd , dictatorial , demagogic , inflammatory , cunning , slippery , and unbalanced Iranian leaders ?
As I 've said before , we really have the worst luck .

I doubt many of you noticed but the Ukraine recently had an election to end months of political power struggling between the EU - leaning " Orange Revolution " bloc led by Yulia Timoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko , and the Rus-leaning bloc led by Viktor Yanukovych .
Like the last election there support for the two sides was pretty much drawn according to geographical lines , Pro-EU in the west and Pro-Rus in the east .
The outcome was close , but the Orange bloc narrowly gained a majority of seats , and it looks set for Yulia Timoshenko to resume her position as Prime Minister .
Ahh , Yulia Timoshenko ... maybe it was just a side - effect of being exposed to the otherwise dreadful looking inhabitants of the political world for the entirity of my degree , but I think she may be * the* sexiest politician in the world . -
Meow - Touching moments with her Orange Revolution partner - Do n't mess with her !

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Economic fundamentals remain strong despite a drag created by the housing slump and accompanying mortgage woes , President Bush said on Tuesday .
" The basics in the economy are good , " Bush said in a White House news conference dominated by questions surrounding an intelligence report that found Iran had suspended a suspected program to develop nuclear weapons .
" Inflation 's low .
Job creation 's good .
Interest rates are low .
Productivity 's up .
Exports are up .
In other words , the basic underpinnings of the economy are strong . "

Different sports have different systems for oddsmaking and betting .
There are even different systems for the same sport , depending on what kind of game the bettor wants to play .
But to understand any of these systems , you first have to understand the jargon .
Action - Action is simply betting activity .
Phrases such as " I want in on the action " or " Show me where the action is " come from this term .
Since betting on sports is illegal in many places , you can't always look up your local bookie in the phone book .

Handicap -
In sports betting , " to handicap " is to give one team a points advantage in order to level the betting field .
Handle -
The handle is the total amount of money wagered on bets .
Super Bowl betting generates the biggest handle of the year for most bookies .
Sportsbook -
An establishment that takes bets , also known as a book .
An individual who takes bets is a bookie .
Juice -
This is the percentage of all bets taken by the bookie as profit .
The juice is also known as the vig , short for vigorish .
Sometimes bookies take a straight percentage of the handle , but more often the vig is figured into the odds .
The spread -
The point spread is used in high - scoring sports like football and basketball .
It is basically a handicap used to make all games competitive in the eyes of bettors .
The spread gives one team an advantage of a few points .
Standard notation for the point spread shows the favored team first , followed by a negative number ( the actual spread ) .
The home team is shown in capital letters .
So if Buffalo was playing against Green Bay in Green Bay , and they were favored to win by seven points , it would look like this :
If someone bets on Buffalo to win , Buffalo would actually have to win by more than seven points for the bet to pay off .
It 's as if Green Bay were given a seven - point lead at the start of the game .
The money line -
In sports like baseball , scoring is n't high enough to use a point spread .
The money line is used instead .
A money line listing might look like this :
Sometimes the decimal point is left out , so 120 is the same as 1.20 .
If you want to bet on the favored team , the White Sox , you have to bet $ 1.20 for every $ 1 you want to win .
If you want to bet on the underdog Astros , you have to bet $ 1 for every $ 1.10 you want to win .
This is known as the dime line , because ten cents separate the favorite from the underdog .
Most bookies offer a dime line , although it can increase to a 20 cent line or greater if one team is heavily favored .
If the money line seems confusing , think of it as a simple pricing system .
You want to win a certain amount of money on your bet .
Chances are greater that the favored team will win the game , so it costs more to bet on the favorite to win that amount than it costs to bet on the underdog .
Here 's an example : Imagine that using the money line above with the White Sox and the Astros , you want to win about $ 100 .
If you place your bet on the favored White Sox , you will pay the bookie $ 120 .
If you win , you get your $ 120 back , plus $ 100 in winnings .
If you lose , the bookie keeps your $ 120 ( technically , bookies collect on losing bets after the game most of the time , but for our example we 'll assume the bet is prepaid ) .
If you bet $ 100 on the Astros , you 'll get $ 110 in winnings if they win , and only lose $ 100 if they lose .
Pick 'em - Sometimes money line games will be listed as " pick " or " pick 'em . "
This means that the teams are considered equal , and the line on both teams is - 1.10 .
Betting on either team requires $ 1.10 per $ 1 in potential winnings [ ref ] .
Pools , cards , and parlays - A parlay is just a combination bet .
Instead of making five separate bets on five different games , the bettor places a single parlay bet , hoping he or she can predict the outcome of all five games .
If any one of the games is a loser , the entire parlay is a loser .
The payout is better for parlays , because the odds of successfully picking multiple winners are much tougher to beat [ ref ] .
Most people are familiar with parlays through office betting pools or football cards .
If you 've ever paid $ 5 to select your winners from a list of that week 's football games ( sometimes using the spread , sometimes using the straight scores ) in hopes of winning the weekly prize , then you have made an informal parlay bet .
Office pools do n't usually involve actual bookies beyond the person who organizes the pool , and no one takes juice from the pool .
All the money is distributed to the winner or winners .
Next , we 'll find out how oddsmakers set the line and figure out the spread .
A big rate cut by the Federal Reserve this week , or at a hint more cuts are coming , coupled with this weeks sub prime rescue plan could lift investor confidence and inspire a pre Christmas rally .
While most investors are banking on a cut of at least a quarter percentage points in the bench mark fed funds rate , many think a deeper reduction is needed to unfreeze credit markets and boost confidence .
On Thursday , President George W. Bush announced a plan to stern US home foreclosures , sending stocks surging on optimism it would keep the economy from sliding into a recession .
“ The big focus next week is on the Fed meeting ”
The market was pricing in an interest rate cut , there was still speculation about how big such a cut would be and whether the Fed would also cut the discount rate .
Encouraging data this week , including a resilient payrolls report on Friday , eased some concerns about the economy , decreasing the likelihood of an aggressive 50 - point - basis cut in the fed funds rate .
And with just a few more weeks left in the year , the Dow is up 9.3 % so far in 2007 .
The S&P 500 is up 6.9 % for the year to date and the Nasdaq is up 12 % .

The discount rate for overnight bank loans now stands at 4.5 % following the two back to back rate cuts in September and October .
While investors are primarily focusing on a potential rate cut on Tuesday , they will also be closely watching inflation data later in the week .
In addition , four blue - chip industrial heavyweights are expected to spell out their financial expectations for 2008 next week .
Manufacturers are facing economic headwinds , including the slumping US housing market , a credit crunch and high energy and commodity costs .
Retail sales are expected to have risen in November at the start of the holiday shopping season .
Other economic data scheduled for this week includes pending home sales for October on Monday , which if very weak , would add to calls for a big rate cut on Tuesday .
They are expected to fall 1 % .
60 Minutes : Boy charged with war crimes at age 15 faces life sentence in US military trial Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday November 20 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Omar Khadr is a young Canadian citizen currently imprisoned at Guantanamo and facing a military trial for war crimes he allegedly committed in Afghanistan at the age of 15 .
In July 2002 , US special forces in eastern Afghanistan got a tip that al Qaeda forces were holed up nearby .
After hours of fighting , the soldiers entered the bombed - out compound but were met by a grenade thrown over the wall that killed one man .
They then found Omar Khadr lying in the rubble , badly hurt and begging them -- in perfect English -- to kill him .
The United States has charged Omar with murder , on the grounds that there was no one else left alive in the compound who could have thrown the grenade , and he now faces a possible sentence of life in prison .
The only concession made for his youth was not to ask for the death penalty .
Omar has been held at Guantanamo Bay for the last five years , much of that time in a windowless maximum security cell .
Amnesty International has claimed that he was severely tortured and is suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder , and also that the Canadian government , rather than helping him , may have been complicit in his mistreatment .
Omar 's chief defense will be that he was raised in a radical Muslim family and was taught to follow his father 's orders without question .
The family had moved from Canada to Afghanistan in 1993 , and Omar and his siblings grew up playing with Osama bin Laden 's children .
Omar 's brother Abdurahman , who broke with the family after 9/11 and worked for the CIA , told CBS that Omar probably was in the compound simply because " he was sent there by my father , and as an obedient kid , he said ' Okay . ' "
He said he believes Omar was there as a translator , not a fighter .
In 2003 , Omar 's father was killed in cotninued fighting in Afghanistan and his younger brother Abdul shot and paralyzed .
Abdul told an interviewer in 2004 that if Omar was released he would try to " take his revenge . "
But now Omar 's mother says simply , " I pray that I see him alive standing in front of me .
... I do n't want him brought back in a plastic bag . "
When CBS asked General ( ret. ) John Alterberg , the military lawyer who recommended that Khadr be charged with war crimes , " Is there anything about his case that bothers you ? "
Alterberg replied , " Bothers me in what way ? "
Even if Omar is not convicted of murder at his military trial , the United States could refuse to release him until its self - declared War on Terror is over .

Story Highlights • Anti-terror chief : " These vehicles are clearly linked "
• Two vehicles loaded with fuel and nails safely removed
• Police hunt driver who abandoned explosives - packed car outside nightclub
• Bomb could have resulted in serious loss of life , anti-terror chief says
Adjust font size :
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A vehicle containing fuel , gas canisters and nails found early Friday near Trafalgar Square is " clearly linked " to another explosives - packed car found outside a nightclub near Piccadilly Circus , Metropolitan Police said .
A " considerable " amount of fuel and gas canisters , along with a " substantial quantity of nails , " was found in the blue Mercedes 280E , said Peter Clarke , Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner .
He called the discovery of the second bomb " troubling , " but urged the public to remain vigilant and report suspicious behavior to authorities .
The second vehicle was ticketed about 2:30 a.m. Friday ( 9:30 p.m. Thursday ET ) , Clarke said .
It was near Trafalgar Square , roughly a half - mile from where the first vehicle -- also a Mercedes -- had been found about an hour earlier .
( Watch how the second car was armed )
About 3:30 a.m. , Clarke said , the Mercedes was taken to an impound lot in Hyde Park .
Security sources earlier told CNN that workers who towed it thought the car smelled of gasoline , and became suspicious because of the reports that gasoline was among the explosive materials found in the first vehicle .
Clarke said the second device , like the first , was " potentially viable " but was rendered safe by police explosives officers .
" These vehicles are clearly linked , " he said .
The first car , a silver Mercedes - Benz sedan , was discovered about 1:30 a.m. when an ambulance crew called to treat an ill person noticed what appeared to be smoke inside the car and notified authorities , London police said .
The car was parked in front of the Tiger Tiger club , and the discovery prompted the closing of several streets until the vehicle was hauled off nine hours later .
" In the car , they found significant quantities of petrol together with a number of gas cylinders , " Clarke said .
He could not immediately say how much fuel was there .
" I can tell you it was in several large containers , " Clarke said .
" There were also a large number of nails in the vehicle . "
He said explosives officers manually disabled " a potential means of detonation for the gas and the fuel in the vehicle , " which preserved crucial forensic evidence for investigators .
A cell phone was found as part of the device in the silver car , according to security sources with knowledge of the investigation , although it was not immediately known what role the cell phone may have played in the device .
The sources said the device was apparently set up to be remotely detonated .
Metropolitan Police Counterterrorism
Command officers are reviewing closed - circuit security camera video to see if they can determine who parked the car there , Clarke said .
London has a long history of bomb attacks and alerts during decades of violence mounted by Northern Irish guerrilla groups .
Lone attackers also have previously targeted the city 's gay and immigrant communities .
( Timeline of attacks )
Friday 's incident came days ahead of the second anniversary of July 7 , 2005 , when four Islamic extremist suicide bombers killed 52 people on London 's transport system in the deadliest strike on the city since World War II .
Witness Daniel
Weir said he was walking home from work when he noticed police had cordoned off the area around the nightclub and a nearby vehicle .
He snapped several photos , including one that showed a canister labeled " patio gas . "
( See the photos )
Clarke said it was too early to determine if the smoke the ambulance crew saw was an indication that the car bomb had been activated but failed to explode .
While Clarke would not speculate that Tiger Tiger was the target , he said " some features of what 's happened resonate with previous plots . "
" In one previous case we heard talk about nightclubs potentially becoming targets .
...
We , of course , saw reference to vehicles being filled with gas or fuel in order to create an explosion , " he said .
There had been no intelligence warning of an attack , he said .
" It is obvious that if the device had detonated there could have been significant injury or loss of life , " Clarke said .
" The vehicle was parked in one of the busiest parts of central London in the early hours of Friday morning when many , many people were leaving nightclubs and other places after the evening hours . "

British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said , " We 're currently facing the most serious and sustained threat to our security from international terrorism . "
The bombs were found just two days after new Prime Minister Gordon Brown took office , and one day after he appointed members of his Cabinet .
( Full story )
" For Gordon Brown , it is a rude awakening to the realities you take on as prime minister , " CNN 's European political editor Robin Oakley said .
( Watch Oakley comment on ' rude awakening ' for Brown )
Brown , whose predecessor , Tony Blair , stoked anger among Islamic militants with his support for the Iraq war , said Britain faces " a serious and continuous threat " and the public " need to be alert " at all times .
The incident also came days ahead of the second anniversary of July 7 , 2005 , when four Islamic extremist suicide bombers killed 52 people on London 's transport system in the deadliest strike on the city since World War II .
The official in charge of fighting racial profiling for the American Civil Liberties Union says he was the victim of profiling at Logan Airport , and he has gone to federal court to challenge a screening technique that relies on suspicious behavior to identify potential terrorists .
King Downing said he was stopped and questioned by State Police in October 2003 after arriving on a flight to attend a meeting on racial profiling .
Downing sued the Massachusetts Port Authority , which operates the airport , and Massachusetts State Police , alleging they violated his constitutional right against unreasonable search .
A trial began yesterday in US District Court .
Downing , who is black and wears a short beard , said in his lawsuit that he was stopped by a state trooper and asked to show identification after he left the gate area and made a phone call in the terminal .
When he declined , Downing said , he was told to leave the airport , but was then stopped again .
He was surrounded by four state troopers and told he was under arrest for not failing to produce identification .
Downing , an attorney who serves as national coordinator of the ACLU 's Campaign Against Racial Profiling , said that after he agreed to show his driver 's license , the troopers asked to see his airline ticket .
He was then allowed to leave , and no charges were filed against him .
In his lawsuit , Downing alleges the behavioral screening system at Logan International Airport encourages racial profiling .
His lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a ruling to declare the screening system unconstitutional .
Downing was stopped " for no apparent reasons other than his appearance , " said Peter Krupp , one of his attorneys .
" He knew his rights , and he knew he had done nothing wrong . "
In 2002 , about a year after terrorists launched the Sept. 11 attacks by hijacking two planes from Logan , the airport became the first in the country to use a program called the Behavior Assessment Screening System , in which police question passengers whose behavior appears suspicious .
The Transportation Security Administration has rolled out a similar system at more than 40 of the nation 's largest airports .
Officials at Logan have previously said suspicious activity includes loitering without luggage , wearing heavy clothes on a hot day , and watching security methods .
Logan officials say race played no role in the decision to question Downing .
The first trooper to ask him for identification was black , and three of the four officers who arrived later also were black , court documents indicated .
The first trooper said he became suspicious when he saw Downing watching him .
Airport officials said behavior - pattern recognition helps strengthen security and does not involve racial profiling .
" We welcome the opportunity to defend the program in court , " said Matthew Brelis , a spokesman for Massport .

Tom , a friend of mine , commented on the recent post I made about the Million Dollar Wiki being for sale , asking me what I would do if I had the money to buy the site .
It got me thinking for a little bit , and then I realized that the Million Dollar Wiki is n’t that different from a blog , and something similar could revitalize the service .
Affiliate Program
The first thing I would do is revamp and revitalize the Affiliate Program .
I would switch gears so that people using the affiliate program made up to $ 25 a sale , and they could choose how much of that $ 25 went into their own pocket or into being a buyer ’s discount .
That way , they could sell pages at $ 80 and make $ 5 , or sell them at $ 100 and make $ 25 .
This would help breed competition , and also allow them to make a fair bit of money if they promoted the site well .
Advertise
The next thing I would do is to buy advertisements on a variety of blogs on the 45n5.com Top 100 List .
These are highly influential blogs with a user base that if correctly marketed to , would be willing to participate in the Million Dollar Wiki project , especially with the proper affiliate program in place .
I would also ask some friends to review the site , giving them free pages to use as they see fit .
Getting traffic to the site , and building up buzz is cyclical with these types of sites .
The more pages are sold , and the more buzz is created , the faster they grow .
If you let this buzz die off too much for too long , it is rare that anyone can jump start it again .
In the advertise section , I would also allow people to buy a $ 60 package for their page , to have it advertised via AdWords .
I would spend $ 50 of the $ 60 on getting some great AdWords advertising for the page , and pocket $ 10 for doing all the keyword work and setting up the advertising stuff .
This would be a small source of income , but I think a fair number of people looking to “ get rick quick ” off the site would understand the value of having paid advertising push traffic to their specific page .
Testimonials & Press
I would get a long list of popular bloggers that have purchased a page or more on the site , and try to get them to send me a testimonial on what they think of the site .
The fact that they are paying only a few dollars a year to advertise themselves , their services , etc .
I would also contact the traditional press to talk about how far the site has already come , and how it got there .
Talk about bloggers , advertisers , and the state of making money online .
Try to build up some buzz that way , and cover all of them on a press page on the site .
If none of them were willing to talk about me , I ’d make a game out of the fact that no one wants to highlight the amazing story of the Million Dollar Wiki , call it the Ignored List or something .
Make it a running joke .
Social Media Buttons
I would add the normal array of social media buttons to every single page , making it easy for them to be promoted , and hopefully drive more traffic to the page , and thus the site .
I do n’t think this part would be all that powerful , but every little bit helps , and I know a few people that bought pages have already done so without the buttons on the page , and have seen some interesting results .
Partner
The concern that some people might have had when creating their page was “ what will I put on it ? ” , and I think the answer to that should have been solved by the Million Dollar Wiki .
I would find a copywriting agency willing to partner with us , and create some simple content packages for people .
Something like , one five hundred word , SEO ready article for $ 25 .
Of which I would probably only get $ 5 of the proceeds , but that could still be a small but steady revenue source .
It would also increase the content on the site , which should increase its rankings in the major search engines .
I would also partner with someone else and create around five high quality WordPress themes to give away , with credit to the Million Dollar Wiki and the designer .
I would release it on the Million Dollar Wiki .
This would hopefully create a fair number of back links , and again , increase attention towards the site .
Contest and Giveaway
One of the best ways to build buzz is to give something away , or have a contest .
I would suggest that doing everything could help build sufficient buzz to get the MDW back on track .
First , I would give away 20 strong keyword pages to bloggers that mentioned the Million Dollar Wiki after I took ownership of it .
The mention could be positive , negative , suggestions , or even hate mail , but they ’d have to link back to the Million Dollar Wiki or one of its pages , and be willing to allow republishing rights of a large excerpt on the Million Dollar Wiki if they won .
This could generate around three or four dozen links to the site , as well as some great content for the blog , and most likely some sound business advice .
Next , I would put some 125 pixel square advertising spots on the front page of the Wiki , allowing people to buy them for a low price .
I would then take that money , and give 75 % of it away each month to a random page buyer .
Lastly , I would give away an iPod Touch to one random page buyer after every 50 pages sold .
This is an idea I had for the Million Dollar Wiki competitor , and it worked well to build up the buzz .
Blog
While the Million Dollar Wiki does have a blog , I would increase the frequency of posts , talking about traffic growth on the site , bloggers I respect .
Affiliate programs that have been useful on certain key pages , and other tips on how people can capitalize on their MDW page .
If I could n’t handle posting every week day , I would hire a weekly columnist or two .
One that was good with copy writing , and one that was good at online advertising and affiliate sales .
There should be at least twenty or so posts worth of content on the blog a month .
I would also work on integrating it into the site better , so that it did n’t seem like its own distinct entity .
( Which would of course mean creating a better design for the whole Million Dollar Wiki site , but that ’d be time consuming and expensive , not something I ’d do right at the start . )
Marketplace
One of the last things I would do would be creating a marketplace for people to sell their pages , or just parts of their pages .
This would allow owners of certain pages to sell advertising on their pages , or sell the whole page , but they should n’t have to leave the site to do so .
I would also expect a small five percent fee for any sale over $ 100 .
This money would go to reimburse me for the development costs of creating such a marketplace , and then into my pocket as profit .
Conclusion
Most of what I have mentioned here could be used for pretty much any site , but the unfortunate side effect of nearly every idea here is that it would cut into the potential profits of the site , but I would be content with making $ 25 in profit off each page purchased , rather than not selling any pages at all .
Good luck to the buyer of the Million Dollar Wiki .
If you use any of these ideas , I hope you will at least send me back the $ 100 I once spent on the service you are purchasing .
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) --
What 's the best way to motivate Americans to save , invest and prepare for retirement ?
Some behavioral finance experts suggest using the carrot .
Others suggest using the stick .
And still others suggest using a combination of carrot and stick .
As for me , I suggest the use of statistics .
Consider just a sampling of the numbers that have been released this year :
There 's $ 4.23 trillion in individual retirements accounts , but that figure hides the fact that very few Americans contribute to an IRA and even when they do the amount is small .
On average , just 10 % of eligible Americans contributed to an IRA for the years 2000 to 2002 , according to the latest issue of EBRI Notes .
And in 2004 , the median contribution to a traditional IRA was just $ 2,300 , according to the Investment Company Institute .
The maximum you could contribute to an IRA in 2004 , by the way , was $ 3,000 or $ 3,500 for those 50 and older .
Now you might say that 's not so bleak given that working Americans are presumably saving for retirement using an employer - sponsored plan , such as a 401 ( k ) , 403 ( b ) , 457 or Thrift Savings Plan .
But again , the numbers are somewhat depressing .
There are nearly 100 million Americans age 21 to 64 working full - time , full - year .
But of that number , just 60 % or 58.4 million work for an employer that sponsors a retirement plan , and only 52.7 % , or 50.8 million participate in a retirement plan .
That means roughly half of all working Americans do n't participate in a retirement plan or do n't have an employer - sponsored plan in which to participate .
It also means that a huge number of adult Americans -- by my estimate 150 million of a potential 200 million -- are n't saving for retirement in any meaningful way , if at all .
Retirement risks
According to the Society of Actuaries ' 2007 Risks and Process Retirement Survey , roughly half to 60 % of retirees worry about three things : the cost of health care , the effect of inflation on their nest eggs and not being able to maintain a reasonable standard of living for the rest of their life .
Those worries are justified given the lack of savings in America .
But what 's really bothersome is the degree to which those who are n't worried should be .
Consider , for instance , health - care costs .
Fidelity Investments estimated earlier this year that a 65 - year - old couple retiring today would need $ 215,000 set aside just to pay for medical expenses over a 20 - year span .
And if that was n't depressing enough , other estimates are even higher .
Paul Fronstin of the Employee Benefit Research Institute , for instance , said a 65 - year - old couple retiring today would need , assuming average life expectancy of 82 for men and 85 for women , more than $ 300,000 set aside to pay for health - care costs ( premiums and out - of - pocket expenses ) in retirement , and more than $ 550,000 if the couple lives to age 92 .
What 's even more depressing is that neither the EBRI nor Fidelity estimates factor in the cost of nursing homes , long - term care or assisted - living facilities , or home health aides .
And those costs are staggering .
According to the MetLife Mature Market Institute , it costs $ 69,000 per year for a semiprivate nursing - home room , $ 35,628 per year for a unit in an assisted - living facility , $ 19 an hour for a home health aide and $ 61 per day for an adult day care center .
Where 's that money going to come from ?
Retirement expenses
Retirees and would - be retirees are also right to fret about maintaining their standard of living .
Consider , for instance , these numbers :
The median household income ( half above , half below ) in America is $ 48,451 and the average is $ 65,527 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
But in retirement , income falls dramatically .
The average total income for those 65 and older in America is $ 25,610 , and the median was a meager $ 16,770 , according to EBRI Notes .
That means retirees are living on roughly one - third of their preretirement income .
And that 's a far cry from the 70 % to 80 % income replacement experts suggest Americans need to maintain their preretirement standard of living .
Besides not having the income to maintain a similar standard of living , retirees will face expenses that are certain to rise faster than the average rate of inflation .
Consider , for instance , the results of the 2002 Consumer Expenditure Survey .
On average , retirees spent 32.6 % on housing , 14 % on food , and 13 % on health care .
But that 's the average .
What 's interesting is the degree to which money spent on health care in retirement changes over time .
For instance , those 55 to 64 spend 6.8 % on health care , those 65 to 74 spend 11.2 % and those 75 and older spend 15.1 % .
That percentage rises in part because the cost of health care is rising twice as fast as the core rate of inflation ( less energy and food ) , 5 % vs. 2.3 % , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
But it also rises because older retirees tend to spend more on health care than younger retirees .
Source of retirement income
So where do retirees get their income once in retirement ?
Again , the numbers are depressing ( and deceiving ) .
On average , retirees get 39.8 % from Social Security , 23.7 % from earnings , 19.4 % from pensions and annuities , 15.4 % from assets ( IRAs and the like ) and 1.9 % from other sources , according to EBRI Notes .
But the composition of the income changes dramatically based on income .
Retirees in the bottom fifth of income , those with less than $ 8,261 in 2006 , got 87.6 % of their income from Social Security while those in the top fifth of income , those with greater than $ 34,570 , got 36.4 % from earnings , 22.6 % from pensions , 20.5 % from assets , and just 18.5 % from Social Security .
The moral of story
If you are among the 150 million who are not saving for retirement , now would be a good time to do so .
If you are among the 50 million who are saving for retirement , now would be a good time to save more .
If you are among those who are n't worried about health - care costs , inflation or maintaining a standard of living in retirement , now would be a good time to start worrying .
If you are among those who worry about retirement risks , now would be a good time to do something about it :
Set aside money for health care , for instance .
And if you are among those who do n't know what your sources and composition of retirement income will be , now would be a good time to figure that out .
After all , waiting to see how things might work out is n't the world 's best plan .
On the surface we 're not happy in the least at the prospect of being required by law to do what is an ethical imperative in the first place .
Besides , laws are already in place that require ISPs to report child pornography sightings to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
Given that the Act was rushed through under a procedure reserved for noncontroversial legislation , never voted on in committee , and was never posted ( in its modern October 10th form ) for public review , well , let 's just say our distrust of the Nanny State has peaked .
Ron Paul , care to comment on your dissenting vote before this heads to the Senate ?
SAFE
Act of 2007 ( summary )
Voter roll call
Update : Here is the SAFE Act [ H.R.3791.EH ] as it was passed .
At least it does not seem to require proactive monitoring of data or persons crossing your pipes .
Post updated to reflect new information .
With bombers once intended to fight a hot end to the Cold War now being employed to spread an ever increasing load of explosives over the " progress " in Iraq , I suppose it 's no surprise that we 're still seeing stories like this .
A US air strike north of Baghdad has killed at least 15 women and children , one of the largest losses of civilian life in a single American operation since the war began , the military said .
...
' After securing the area , the ground force assessed 15 terrorists , six women and nine children were killed , two suspects , one woman and three children were wounded , and one suspected terrorist was detained , ' it said .
Note that apparently all it take to be a terrorist is to be male and dead .
If you live , you 're merely a suspect .
It 'll probably be a day or two before we know if this suspicious gathering turns out to be a wedding , or a group of legitimate political leaders or just bystanders , but how many demonstrations do we need before we accept that large air strikes are not appropriate tactics in a dense urban environment ?
Gmail 's IMAP support roll - out this week had nerds all atwitter about the possibility of synchronized email access across devices , computers , and clients .
IMAP is far superior to regular old POP for fetching your messages and maintaining your folder list whether you 're on your iPhone , office or home computer .
If IMAP 's got you curious but you 're not sure what desktop application to use with Gmail , consider the extensible , fast , cross-platform and free Mozilla Thunderbird , our beloved Firefox 's little sibling .
Here 's how to get the full Gmail experience in Thunderbird with IMAP .
Advertisement
Internet Message Access Protocol ( Wikipedia page ) enables email programs to read messages stored on the server .
Unlike POP , with IMAP it 's as if you 're browsing a network drive of files on a remote server with an open , live connection to that server ; whenever you open a folder or view a message , it 's displayed from that server live .
IMAP maintains a constant connection with your server and updates real - time .
Advertisement
Why is IMAP better than POP ?
POP downloads and copies new messages to your local inbox .
With POP you can download once and disconnect from the server , which is its one advantage .
But you cannot download messages that have already been archived and labeled in Gmail via POP , and your client has to poll the server to get new messages .
With POP access , if you move a message to a folder or star it in your desktop client , that change is not reflected in Gmail and your messages get out of sync .
Any rules or mail filters you set up on one machine with a POP client have to be set up and reprocessed with a fresh download on all your other machines .
Think of POP as copying files from a server to your computer and working with them on your hard drive .
Think of IMAP as connecting to a remote server and working with the files saved there .
Why Thunderbird ( and not Mail or Outlook ) ?
We 're naturally biased towards open source software here at Lifehacker , but there are good reasons why Thunderbird is the best desktop client choice out there for Gmail IMAP access :

It 's extensible .
Like Firefox , a wide variety of optional Thunderbird extensions
Like Firefox , a wide variety of optional It 's free and cross-platform .
You work on a Mac? PC ?
Linux desktop ?
Unlike Mail.app or the various flavors of Outlook , Thunderbird just works everywhere .

Set up Thunderbird correctly for Gmail IMAP
First things first .
Once you 're fetching your email via IMAP with Thunderbird ( here 's Google 's tutorial on how to do that ) , there are two settings you 'll want to set manually : specifically , where Thunderbird should store sent messages and drafts .
In your IMAP account settings , the Copies & Folders area , be sure to change the default location for Sent and Drafts to [ Gmail ] / Sent Mail and [ Gmail ] / Drafts respectively , as shown .
Advertisement
Advertisement
Even after you do this , you 'll notice a few strange labels in your Gmail account : [ Imap ] / Sent , [ Imap ] / Drafts and [ Imap ] / Trash .
These are Thunderbird 's default Sent , Drafts , and Trash folders .
Once you make the change to your account settings , you can delete those labels in Gmail and they wo n't get regenerated .
( Note : except for [ Imap ] / Trash , which I can't rid myself of entirely , since T - bird seems married to it .
Bueller ?
Update : see the next section for the solution to the [ Imap ] / Trash label . )
Set Thunderbird to use Gmail 's Trash folder ( UPDATE )
Reader Vanl explains how to set T - bird 's trash folder correctly , which involves some Thunderbird configuration editing .
Here 's how :
Advertisement
From the Tools menu , choose Options .
Go to the " Advanced " Option menu and the " General " tab .
Hit the " Config Editor " button next to the " Advanced Configuration " label .
Now you need to look around in there a bit to find which server you need to modify .
Using the filter entry box at the top , type in mail .
server .server and you will see a list of keys and values .
One of those keys will be mail .
server.serverX.name , where X is a number and the value is the name of your Gmail IMAP account .
Remember X. Right - click somewhere in the box and select New -> String .
A dialog box will pop up asking for the name of your new key .
Put in mail.server.serverX.trash_folder_name , where X is the number you remember from above .
( For example , mine is mail.server.server2.trash_folder_name. )
A new box will come up asking for the value of your new key .
Put in [ Gmail ] / Trash .
Advertisement
Go to Gmail 's web interface and delete the label [ Imap ] / Trash .
Restart Thunderbird .
Thanks Vanl !
UPDATE 2 , Nov 8th : A Gmail IMAP engineer writes in with more information about the implications of the Trash tweak :
Using the [ Gmail ] / Trash as your Trash folder can lead to some unexpected issues , and the Gmail team does n't recommend it .
Our recommended client settings page does n't go far enough to explain why this can be an issue .
The problem is that gmail only keeps a single copy of a message with multiple labels .
If you apply the Trash label by placing the message in the [ Gmail ] / Trash folder , you are telling GMail to remove the message from all labels , and GMail will also delete the message in 30 days .
If for some reason you actually expect the message to be in multiple folders , and you delete it from one thinking that only removes it from that folder , if you set your Trash to [ Gmail ] / Trash , you will mistakenly remove the message from both folders .
So , suppose you have a filter set up to keep a copy of every message in another label / folder , and you normally just go through your inbox in Thunderbird deleting every message , knowing you have a copy saved in another folder , you will be actually deleting both copies .
Or maybe you think you are relying on the automatic " second copy " that Gmail has in the " [ Gmail ] / All Mail " folder : again , moving a message to the Trash will remove it from there as well .
Or , perhaps you mistakenly " copied " a message to another folder , instead of " moving " it , so you then " delete " the copy that was left behind : this will actually delete the message from both places .
Advertisement
In short :
If you 're using Gmail 's Trash folder , expect that all copies of any message you put there will be deleted , not just the one you move there .
How Thunderbird actions map to Gmail
Before we move into Thunderbird tweaks and add - ons , check out this chart of what actions in your client will do in web - based Gmail , courtesy of Google .
Advertisement
Note that Gmail labels do NOT map to Thunderbird 's tags .
Each label is represented by an old school folder in Thunderbird .
If a message has more than one label , it will appear in multiple folders , which is very cool .
To label a message in Thunderbird , move it to the appropriate folder .
To create a new label in Gmail , create a new folder in Thunderbird , and so forth .

Subfolders and Slash Labels
If you move a message into a subfolder of a folder in Thunderbird , over in web - based Gmail you 'll see a label named parent folder / child folder .
Conversely , any labels with forward slashes in them will create subfolders in T - bird .
You Folders4 Gmail users in Better Gmail may absolutely love this .
( Note : the Folders4 Gmail script has been updated to support the IMAP forward slash as well as a backslash ; Better Gmail to follow very soon .
Thanks , Sean ! )

Combine Gmail 's Spam - killer with Thunderbird 's Adaptive Junk Filter
Along the same lines as setting the Sent and Drafts folders to align above , if you enable Thunderbird 's Junk filter , make sure it moves junk mail to Gmail 's Spam folder so that Gmail marks it as spam as well .
That way the bird 's adaptive filter can teach Gmail as it learns .
Here 's that setting :

We 're thinking this MySpace thing could be big some day , if they can ever get their act together .
Fortunately for Tom and the trillion - dollar corporation backing him , we 're here to offer our advice .
5 Anti-friends
The problem :
In your everyday life , you generally have three types of people that you interact with ( who will presumably want to talk to you about last night 's American Idol ) :
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Friends ;
People you do n't feel one way or another about you ;
Enemies
So , why does MySpace set your profile to only account for the first two groups ?
MySpace claims to be a social networking site , but what is society without a well - defined list of those who stand against all you believe in , who are living off borrowed time until the day they are crushed by your vengeance ?
The solution :
If Myspace wants our business , we insist that they have no choice but to implement a feature where a person 's profile can also display a distinct list of enemies , whether sworn or not .
You could even sort your enemies out in order of how many times they have wronged you .

Too many people are forced to endure awkward and silent relationships after discovering they were removed from someone 's friend list and because the reasoning behind it was never made clear .
These two former friends will generally not talk after that , and seeing each other at social gatherings will be more uncomfortable than a backwards male thong .
A MySpace enemies list , however , will make everything abundantly clear when it comes to how you feel about each other .
As shown in the above picture , no longer will there be confusion about your pure contempt for the ex-girlfriend ( Jessica ) and the man she fucked in the bathroom at your fifth anniversary dinner ( Mike ) .
From this unmistakable statement via MySpace , you and your anti-friend can either clear the air and work toward a friendly solution , or you can both battle in an 18th century duel ( bring gloves for slapping and your best Kentucky accent ) .

We 're thinking this is just the kind of subtle helping hand confused or lonely MySpace users need to take them to the next level in their online fantasies , the first of which , of course , being the idea of them having friends that number in the hundreds .

University of East Anglia researchers gauged CO2 absorption through more than 90,000 measurements from merchant ships equipped with automatic instruments .
Results of their 10 - year study in the North Atlantic show CO2 uptake halved between the mid-90s and 2000 to 2005 .
Scientists believe global warming might get worse if the oceans soak up less of the greenhouse gas .
Researchers said the findings , published in a paper for the Journal of Geophysical Research , were surprising and worrying because there were grounds for believing that , in time , the ocean might become saturated with our emissions .
' Saturated ' ocean
BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said : " The researchers do n't know if the change is due to climate change or to natural variations .
" But they say it is a tremendous surprise and very worrying because there were grounds for believing that in time the ocean might become ' saturated ' with our emissions - unable to soak up any more . "
He said that would " leave all our emissions to warm the atmosphere " .
Of all the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere , only half of it stays there ; the rest goes into carbon sinks .
There are two major carbon sinks in the biological cycle : the oceans and the land " biosphere " , which includes plants and the soil .
ではここらへんで実際 のDATAを確認してみることにしましょう。今回は２店舗の売上DATAをサンプルとしてみていただくことにします。季節指数による影響を除くため、コミックの全国平均売上を100としたときの売上推移グラフを作成してみました。赤いラインが平均値です。
まずはX店のDATAを見てください。これはX店の2006年から2007年にかけてのコミックの売上推移DATAです。
このX店は、コミックのシュリンクをしばらくしていなかったのですが、2006年の8月からシュリンクをするようになりました。
その結果、シュリンク無しの時点の売上指数平均は、大体130あたりを横ばいで変化しなかったのですが、シュリンクを開始したあたりから急激に売上が上昇していることがわかります。わずか１年で売上が150％になっています。ちょっと極端な例ですね。普通はここまで変化することはないでしょうが、シュリンクしたら売上があがったという貴重なサンプルだと思われます。
次に見ていただきたいの はY店のグラフです。2007年5月〜11月にかけての数字です。
この店はもともと、シュリンクをしていた店だったのですが、8月からシュリンクをやめるということをおこなった店です。もともとの指数平均は210あたり。ただし売上が下降傾向にあったので、「シュリンクをはずすことによって新規顧客を獲得し、売上をあげる」というチャレンジをおこなったのでした。しかし結果は見てのとおりです。売上はシュリンクをはずした途端、指数平均185まで低下。12％ほど売上を落とすという結果になってしまいました。
つまり、21世紀のコミックシュリンク問題についての結論はこうなります。
コミックにシュリンクをしないと、売上は下がります！！
理由はいろいろ考えられるのですが、前回の客層区分で説明をすると、A層の相対的な増加というのが、最大の要因であるように思えます。
ABC のトータル数は、実は大きな変化はありません。ここ何年か書店で販売されているコミックの売上は、上がってはいないものの落ちこんでいるわけでもないからです。コミック読者人口ということで言えば、むしろ増加しているでしょう。書店というチャンネル以外で、コミックを読んだり買ったりするできる機会が21世紀にはいって大幅に増えました。マンガ喫茶でも読めるし、レンタルも出来るし、ブックオフに代表される新古書店でも読めるし買えます。書店からネット書店に乗り換えてしまった人も少なからずおります。これらの書店以外のチャンネルを使用する層を仮にDとします。ABCからDにかなり多数が流出しているにもかかわらず、ABCのトータル数が変わらないということは、ABCの中に新規に流入した人たちがおり、Dに流出した分を補っているのということになります。
実はこの人たちのA率がとても高いのではないかというのが私の仮説です。あらたにABCに流入してきた客層は、Dという選択肢があるにもかかわらず、わざわざ書店に来ている層です。新しく流入したこの客層はこう考えているのではないでしょうか。立ち読みしたければ新古書店に行けばよい。面白いかどうかは、アニメ化ドラマ化作品を見たり、ネットの評判や「この○○がスゴイ」系のガイド本で判断すればよい。確実にきれいな本を買おうと思ったら、上から３冊目を自分で手に取れる書店しかない。しかもコミックにシュリンクをしているのは、実は書店だけなのです。
流通チャンネルの選択肢が増えるにつれ、コミック読者も進化してきました。昔は読むのも買うのも情報をとるのもすべて書店であった時代がありました。しかし、それぞれのお客さんの使い分けが進んだ結果、書店に来る人は「買う」に特化した人が増えてきたのです。A層が増え、B層C層が減ったら、結果は明らかです。書店でシュリンクをやめたら売上が下がるようになってしまいます。
これを象徴しているのではないかと思う写真をご紹介しましょう。この店は、同じ屋根の下に本の中古売場と新刊書の売場が通路ひとつ隔てて隣接しているというユニークな店舗です。
まずは新刊書のほうの売場。
この店の新刊コミックおよびライトノベルはすべてシュリンクがかかっていました。売場には誰もいません。
次に中古本の売場です。こちらは立ち読みの方でいっぱいです。
これじゃ新刊のほうは売れないでしょう？と考えるのは間違いです。どっちも売れるのです。要は使い分けというスタイルが進化したということなんだと思います。書店に期待されている役割が、コミックに関しては10年前と違ってきてしまったということではないでしょうか。
長々と書いてきましたが、このエントリはこれでおしまいです。じゃあ新刊書店での理想的な陳列方法はどうすればいいんだ？という疑問もあろうかと思いますが、まあそれは、また別途機会があれば書くことにして、ここで今回は筆をおくことにしましょう。長々と読んでいただき、ありがとうございました。
For Tired Computer Users : A Headband To Tell You When To Quit
A Tufts University team wants to expand on technology that uses near - infrared spectroscopy sensors to measure the brain 's emotional state .
A high tech headband that monitors blood oxygenation levels in the brain may tell people working at PCs and terminals when they are becoming overly fatigued , distracted , or just plain stressed out .
The concept was described at this week 's ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology by a Tufts University team that has been awarded a $ 445,000 grant by the National Science Foundation .
The technology involves the use of a MRI - like headband to gain real time insight into the brain 's emotional state .
The research could produce valuable insight into a range of situations , but particularly for people peering into video screens in stressful situations like air traffic controllers , emergency workers and military personnel in combat situations .
A long - term goal of the research would be to improve user interfaces for normal computer users .
Using functional near - infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) , the team said the technology is " safe , portable , non-invasive and can be implemented wirelessly . "
The team has been directed by computer science professor Robert Jacob and biomedical engineering professor Sergio Fantini .
They have noted that while there have been some successful evaluations of workload , emotion and fatigue of computer users , it has traditionally been difficult to measure mental workload , frustration and distraction .
" One moment a user may be bored , and the next moment , the same user may be overwhelmed , " stated professor Jacob .
" Measuring mental workload , frustration and distraction is typically limited to qualitatively observing computer users or to administering surveys after completion of a task , potentially missing valuable insight into the users ' changing experiences . "
Infrared sensors on the headband are fitted with laser diodes that send near - infrared light into the forehead , enabling oxygenation to be tracked .
Stress levels from bored to overwhelmed can be measured .
In initial experiments using the fNIRS technology , the Tufts researchers were able to obtain relatively accurate depictions of subjects ' workload .
Now they want to take the technology further .
In initial experiments , subjects were asked to carry out various tasks online before they were asked to rate the difficulty of the tasks .
The subjects ' ratings coincided 83 % of the time with the date developed by the fNIRS technology .
" We do n't know how specific we can be about identifying users ' different emotional states , " said Sergio Fantini , a biomedical engineering professor at Tufts .
" However , the particular area of the brain where the blood - flow change occurs should provide indications of the brain 's metabolic changes and by extension workload , which could be a proxy for emotions like frustration . "

I love going over to DailyKos.com  a site for very partisan Democrats  and reading the passionate antiwar screeds , the outrage at the escalation of the Iraq conflict in the face of rising opposition , the often timely and interesting analysis of our disastrous foreign policy posted by Kossacks with monikers like “ antiwarrior ” and “ Cheneysucks , ” but I have to wonder : how in the name of all that ’s holy can these people support any of the Democratic “ majors ” in the race for the White House ?
After all , the leading Democratic candidates for president support keeping our troops in Iraq  for years , as the New York Times reports :
“ Even as they call for an end to the war and pledge to bring the troops home , the Democratic presidential candidates are setting out positions that could leave the United States engaged in Iraq for years .
“ John Edwards , the former North Carolina senator , would keep troops in the region to intervene in an Iraqi genocide and be prepared for military action if violence spills into other countries .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York would leave residual forces to fight terrorism and to stabilize the Kurdish region in the north .
And Senator Barack Obama of Illinois would leave a military presence of as - yet unspecified size in Iraq to provide security for American personnel , fight terrorism and train Iraqis . ”
So who does that leave us with ?
Bill Richardson ?
Dennis Kucinich ?
Mike Gravel ?
There ’s just one problem with these guys : none of them will get the Democratic presidential nomination .
Which leaves us with the Janus - faced candidacies of the Axis of Ambiguity .
Well , but is n’t this a case of making the perfect the enemy of the good ?
After all , Hillary - Obama - Edwards routinely pledge to get our troops out of Iraq  are n’t their hearts in the right places , even if their programs are lacking in reassuring details ?
To begin with , we ca n’t know what ’s in someone ’s heart .
We can only evaluate what they say and what they do .
Second , the whole point of leaving Iraq  aside from stopping the killing , the senseless American sacrifices , and the billions draining out of the Treasury  is to ensure that we do n’t get sucked into a conflict beyond that country ’s borders .
Every day brings new and more alarming claims of Iranian aid to Iraqi insurgents and militia groups , as well as accusations from the administration that our troops are being killed with weapons supplied by Tehran .
( Of course , the influx of weapons to the Iraqi insurgents has nothing to do with those 190,000 weapons we lost track of in Iraq . )
Dick Cheney has been insistently lobbying the president for air strikes at Quds bases in Iran , and Lord knows Dubya ’s hardly averse to the idea .
First , however , the administration has to engage in the elaborate kabuki dance of going the diplomatic route and pulling the rug out from under the Iranian peace party whenever it looks like negotiations might prove fruitful .
Then they step on the accelerator and get their war propaganda campaign in high gear , overemphasizing the power and influence of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  who really does n’t run Iran ’s foreign policy  and conjuring the nightmare of nuclear terrorist attacks on the U.S. sponsored by Tehran .
When the rhetoric really begins to smoke , they ’ll spark a shooting war by overblowing some border incident and framing the war question in terms of regaining America ’s “ honor . ”
Will we “ cut and run ” ?
Or stand and fight ?
It ’s an argument the War Party always wins  until it comes out that the incident in question was either completely manufactured ( as in the Gulf of Tonkin incident [ .pdf ] during the Vietnam War era ) , provoked by the Americans , or wildly exaggerated .
Unfortunately , at that late date , it ’s hard if not impossible to do anything about it : the war has already begun , the orgy of “ patriotic ” mindlessness is unleashed , and cries of “ we ’re here , we have to make the best of it ” drown out all else .
Stripped of partisan hoo - hah , rhetorical pandering to the base , and outright demagogy , that is the basic Democratic position on the war , and the core of Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s stance .
The front - running Hillary is the darling of the neocons these days , partly because of her spat with Obama over what Fred Barnes calls the “ would - you - meet - with - despots ” question .
Our future commander in chief answered “ firmly and coolly , ” says the man who coined the phrase “ big government conservatism . ”
“ She excels , ” raves National Review editor Rich Lowry , who says Clinton “ has done more than any other Democrat to show she ’s ready to be president . ”
Neocon bellwether David Brooks ’ paean to Hillary , the Warrior Goddess , heralds her as “ the perfect combination of experience and change . ”
Even Charles Krauthammer , the neocons ’ resident Cato ( the Elder ) , hailed “ the grizzled veteran ” Hillary in her alleged victory over “ the clueless rookie ” Obama in the talk - with - tyrants spat .
I long ago predicted that the neoconservatives would switch sides in the partisan divide : having drained the GOP of its vital juices and left it a dry husk , they are readying themselves for the era of “ Bush lite . ”
Sucking up to Hillary and her court wo n’t be too difficult : the neocons already have an inside line in her camp in the person of Marshall Wittmann , the former Trotskyist - turned - Christian - Coalition - director - turned - McCainiac who is now Hillary ’s Rasputin .
This ideological chameleon , whose advice to go hawkish and prove her credentials as a potential commander - in - chief she appears to be taking , is the archetypal neocon , which is not so much a doctrine as it is a history .
Wittmann ’s political odyssey from the fever swamps of Spartacism to the storied heights of Washington ’s neoconservative network is an exaggerated version of Hillary ’s own hegira , from the far Left of the Democratic Party to the DLC - Lieberman - Scoop Jackson far Right .
This presents a dilemma for self - styled “ progressive ” activists involved in the antiwar movement .
On the one hand , many of these otherwise sincere and quite dedicated opponents of our interventionist foreign policy are working to end the war , and their efforts are admirable .
On the other hand , they have a partisan bond  and , of course , a domestic agenda  that often works at cross purposes with their ostensibly antiwar views .
The Huffington Post ’s resident progressive - in- chief , David Sirota , has defended the spinelessness of the Democrats  not very convincingly  on the grounds that “ purists ” do n’t understand the alleged “ realities ” of Washington politics .
However , the more radical lefties have no strong partisan loyalties  except maybe to the Communist Party , USA  at least in theory , but in practice these “ radicals ” are just interested in building a left satellite of the DNC .
Yet they do have their limits , and these appear to have been reached with the Democrats ’ recent rollover on the war funding bill .
The ugly truth of the matter is that the Democrats ’ capitulation on the Iraq war funding issue was rationalized by the pork ladled out to compliant “ antiwar ” lefties in Congress .
Bribery , in short , in the form of tax dollars handed out to favored interest groups , enabled the party leadership to whip the “ antiwar ” faction into line .
Pork trumps principle , every time : that ’s life in the Imperial City , and it ’s part of the reason why this war is dragging on in spite of the fact that it ’s wildly unpopular .
But there ’s more to this sad story
When “ blue dog Democrats ” consistently vote for the president ’s war funding and give the War Party the margin of victory in Congress , it is laughable that the big question , these days , in antiwar circles is not how but whether to respond to this blatant betrayal .
The Hill reports :
“ Congress ’s failure to secure a timetable for withdrawing American troops from Iraq has split antiwar activists on the tactical question of whether to attack Democrats , who now control Capitol Hill .
The split has also underlined accusations among some activists that MoveOn has abandoned its credentials as an issue - based advocacy group and now instead provides cover for Democratic Party leaders . ”
The issue of MoveOn.org , the left - liberal online voter - mobilization machine conceived as an adjunct to the Democratic Party ’s Clintonian wing and its generally counterproductive role in the antiwar movement , has been dealt with here , here , and here , so I wo n’t go into elaborate detail .
Suffice to say that , along with some of their allies in the labor movement , notable the SEIU , they have created a front group known as Americans Against Escalation , which has been targeting Republican members of Congress on the war , running television ads in their districts and carrying out protest actions at their offices .
The anti-escalators would n’t dream of targeting pro-war Democrats , however , since that would get in the way of their domestic political agenda , which is ultimately more important  to them  than the slaughter of a bunch of foreigners .
It would also get in the way of their sucking up to the Democratic establishment , create obstacles in their upwardly mobile path to lucrative careers as political appointees , and pull down their stock on the D.C. cocktail party circuit .
The Hill goes on to note that “ some activist groups ” accuse MoveOn of letting Democratic leaders off very lightly , “ but MoveOn argues that burning bridges with Democrats is not an effective strategy .
Much better , the influential organization says , is to work with them to peel away Republican support for the war and thus force President Bush ’s hand . ”
This argument makes zero sense .
The problem with congressional efforts to rein in our war - crazed chief executive is that the Democrats have n’t been able to keep their own troops in line .
Is it too much to ask of the Democratic “ leadership ” that they use the whip on their recalcitrant pro-war caucus members ?
Are the Democrats really depending on the Republicans to end the war ?
“ Ultimately , the war ends because there is this cataclysmic showdown between the Republicans who are getting pinched by the public and the White House , ” babbles Tom Matzzie , Washington director for MoveOn .
Yet the partisan attacks launched by the MoveOn - SEUI lash - up are delaying that showdown by making the war a partisan issue  and setting a new world record for hypocrisy by giving pro-war Democrats a pass .
Anyone who believes the Democratic party leadership is committed to getting us out of Iraq , and out of the business of world - saving , democracy - exporting , neo - colonialist base - building , is living in a dream world .
The party Establishment is in cahoots with the War Party , and not only on the Iraq issue .
The neocons , for their part , are just as comfortable supporting Democrats as they are Republicans  and , as their newfound admiration for Hillary demonstrates , this partisan ambidexterity is n’t limited to such special cases as Joe Lieberman .
President Hillary Clinton will inherit a war that she intends to fight and win , no matter what she says to the Democratic base .
And her “ antiwar ” cheerleaders at MoveOn and the SEIU will still be “ building bridges ” to cushy jobs , choice cuts of pork , and their fair share of political perks .
Then , with sudden swiftness , we ’ll be hearing about the progress of labor unions in American - occupied Iraq , and why it ’s much better and more “ humane ” to continue a “ residual ” presence that will , like all such presences , grow of its own accord .
The criticisms of the Bush policy by such Democratic foreign policy mavens as Joe Biden and Ivo Daalder have been based around the argument that the Iraq war was wrong in its execution , not its conception .
There was insufficient planning , the decision to disband the Iraqi army was a disaster , etc. , etc. , all assuming that the Democrats could have done a better job  and even deserve a chance to “ succeed ” where the Republicans failed .
This has been the major charge by the warbots in the GOP , who are now saying that the “ surge ” is saving the day and who blame the “ defeatist ” Democrats for obstructing the war effort : Republican neocons claim congressional Democrats , and , indeed , all war critics , do n’t want America to succeed in Iraq .
The Democrats hasten to disagree , but never think to ask : what is it that we are supposed to be succeeding at ?
The neocon project is all about creating a reliable ally in the region , a base from which to wage new wars of “ liberation ”  and ensure American control over much of the world ’s dwindling oil supply .
What the Democrats are promising , therefore , is to be more successful at being imperialists than their incompetent Republican rivals .
This is a distinction without a difference , one that is certainly not worth either voting for or even passively cheering on in the name of “ change . ”
After all , it could well be a change for the worse .
I know that ’s hard to imagine , at present , but , then again , it always is .
It is not all that inconceivable that the Democrats will take up where the Republicans left off .
With Iran looming in the background as the next theater in our perpetual “ war on terrorism , ” all the major Democratic candidates are outdoing each other in appeasing the Israel lobby and pledging to confront Tehran .
As the political process becomes more restricted , with draconian limits on single - issue groups and the primary season front - loaded , the big contributors , many of them in defense - related fields , and the foreign lobbyists have a stranglehold over the electoral machinery of both parties .
With the two - party monopoly ensconced in law and custom , when it comes to foreign policy , the Democrats and Republicans can be fairly described as two wings of a single party  the War Party .
Yes , there are exceptions to this dictum  for example , Dennis Kucinich in the Democratic camp , and Ron Paul in the GOP  and yet the odds against one or another insurgent antiwar candidate breaking out into the so - called mainstream are so great that the War Party can continue to operate even in the face of overwhelming antiwar sentiment on the part of voters .
After all , when two pro-war candidates are vying for the role of commander in chief , are we really giving peace a chance ?
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
You ’ll note that our summer fundraising drive is swinging into gear starting today .
I do n’t want to rant at you  anymore than I already have  or lecture you about the absolute necessity of maintaining Antiwar.com at a time like this .
As the War Party goes full bore with a campaign to strike at Iran , and while the conflict in Iraq is still raging , information is the key to winning the battle for peace .
Citizens taking direct action , rather than entrusting their elected “ representatives ” to do the right thing , is the only way we ’re going to effect a real change in American foreign policy .
Yet we ca n’t do that if we are n’t informed  and that is the great service provided by this Web site .
Since 1995 , we ’ve been giving you the most up - to - date news and edgy analysis of all things international  and keeping watch on the ramparts as the War Party moves its battering rams to the gate .
We ’ve built up quite an audience  and quite a reputation for being fearless , and , for the most part , dead right about America ’s impossible Middle Eastern crusade .
We ’ve done our job , and , I believe , done it fairly well .
Now it ’s your turn to step up to the plate and support the sort of independent journalism that is the best antidote for the War Party ’s poisonous fantasies .
We depend on the voluntary contributions of our readers and supporters , whom we turn to four times a year ( I know it seems like more ! ) for the funding we need to continue .
Each time , I am initially pessimistic , then , at the end , surprised  and amazingly gratified  that we made it after all .
Last time , however , we barely made it , and this time  in the dog days of summer , and amid a looming economic meltdown as well as at the start of the political season and the onset of the presidential election  I fear the worst .
But , then again , that ’s just me : dour , dark , and depressed at the prospect of having to go through the ups and downs of yet another grueling week - long fund appeal .
However , as much as we hate dunning and otherwise inconveniencing our readers , it has to be done : we do n’t have the near - limitless resources available to the War Party .
We do n’t need limitless resources , in any event : we do our job with a minimum of folderol and a maximum of elbow - grease and good old - fashioned nose - to - the - grindstone penny - pinching .
I would even say we rival the Ron Paul campaign in our penuriousness .
There are no corporate perks in this cyber - office , at least none that I know about .
So give : give as much as you can as soon as you can .
Because Antiwar.com matters  and it ’s your one way of making a simple declarative statement about where you stand , and what kind of future you want for this great country of ours .
And do n’t forget : your contribution is 100 - percent tax - deductible .
First , there was the abysmal , pathetic , inexcusable and cravenly collapse on Iraq War funding .
The Democrats gave into ALL of the demands of the most unpopular president of all time .
And where were our so - called Democratic leaders ?
I understand there are a number of people on the campaign stump claiming they are going to be wonderful leaders .
Really ?
What have they led on ?
When have they ever defeated Bush ?
Did I mention their opponent is the most unpopular president in American history ?
This is not ancient history .
It 's happening right now .
So , the Democratic presidential hopefuls were MIA on the Iraq War funding fight , or lack thereof .
They went right along with yet another Democratic cave - in .
No fight , no leadership , no nothing .
Then there was the energy bill , where the Democrats tried to take back $ 13.5 billion in outrageous subsidies that the Republicans had given the oil companies in the middle of their record breaking profits .
And what happened ?
Another loss .
That provision was stripped out when the Republicans mustered up 40 votes , including Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) , to pull of yet another successful filibuster .
And we got the familiar refrain of losers - what could we do ?
Oh , you poor schmucks , did you get outmaneuvered and outvoted again ?
How about you put a world of pressure on your own senator to not betray your whole party and the American people by giving the oil companies $ 13.5 billion of our hard - earned money ?
Does this party have any leaders ?
Do they have any idea what leaders do ?
If Senator Clinton , or Obama or Biden had an ounce of leadership in them , they would have found a way to win by one vote rather than lose by one vote for the billionth time .
Please do n't tell me they were too busy worrying about their own careers on the campaign trail to actually do their job .
You know what would be a convincing argument on the campaign stump - I actually got something done !
I actually beat George Bush for once !
But right now , none of them can make that claim .
But at least one of them has been trying , and that 's why I left his name off the above list of senators .
Chris Dodd is fighting one of the most important fights - not allowing the telecoms to get immunity for their law - breaking on FISA .
If they get this , the entire Bush administration would be shielded from any accountability for their brazen violations of federal law .
So , who is fighting to make sure this victory goes to the Republicans - Harry Reid , naturally .
Glenn Greenwald has an excellent explanation of how Sen .
Reid helped the Republicans tremendously with a legislative maneuver today .
I do n't know if he knows this , but he 's supposed to be on the other side of the aisle .
And this is our leader ?
Let me not mince words , Harry Reid is a terrible majority leader .
In fact , it 's an insult to the word " leader " to use it in the same sentence as Harry Reid .
Why would you help George Bush and the Republicans break the law ?!
Actually , I know why .
It 's because so many of the Democrats are also in the pockets of the telecommunication lobby and some of the Democrats , like Jay Rockefeller , have been complicit in allowing the worst abuses of this administration .
So , they 're looking to cover their own ass .
Just like when they gave into Bush on the Iraq War and on federal spending , but kept the one thing they care most about - pork - barrel spending .
Greedy politicians have to make sure their asses are covered first .
I do n't know if Harry Reid is part and parcel of these complicit Democrats , and I do n't care .
It 's possible that he 's just too weak to stand up to them .
What a ringing defense , " I am not a greedy , law - breaker ; I 'm just too weak to stop them . "
What I do know is that results matter and his results have been hideous .
To top all of this off , Reid had to help the Republicans by burying a hatchet in the back of Chris Dodd , who has been trying to fight this immunity provision tooth and nail .
Sen .
Reid respects Republican Tom Coburn 's holds on bills because to do otherwise would be to challenge the bullies , God forbid .
But he wo n't respect his own colleagues hold on this bill .
I 'm trying to see if there is any other way Reid can hurt us .
If it can be imagined , believe me , he 'll find it and do it .
But this fight is not yet over .
The other Democratic contenders promised that they would help Dodd filibuster if it came down to that .
Then they prayed all night that their bluff would n't be called .
Well , it has .
It 's now put up or shut up time .
Will the other Democratic senators in the presidential field , come to the defense of their fellow Democrat and help to lead this filibuster fight ?
God , this is so easy .
The first one to jump on the bandwagon would gain so much credibility with primary voters .
And they would lose nothing .
Do you have any idea how many Democratic votes ( or independent votes , for that matter ) you would lose if you stood up to Bush ?
None , zero , not one .
This should be a no- brainer for Obama or Clinton .
They should be tripping over themselves to jump to Dodd 's side on Monday .
Let 's get real , as much as I respect Senator Dodd ( who I have absolutely no affiliation with ) , he is not likely to win the nomination .
So , the person who works with him can soak up all the credit for this fight .
This is the time to show us if you are truly leaders or not .
This is not theoretical ; it 's real and it's now .
On Monday , will you do as you promised and help to lead a fight against Bush 's law - breaking or will you show that you 're no leader at all ?
As frustrated as I am that none of these folks has done a damn thing to stand up to Bush all this time , I am willing to look past all that if we could just get one of them to stand up just one time .
And that time is now .
Will any of them do it ?
Is there a leader among them ?

Cash strapped consumers are increasingly turning to charge cards and home equity lines to support consumption .
Some Debt Trends Are Good .
This Is n’t One of Them .
American credit card debt is growing at the fastest rate in years , a fact that may signal coming trouble for the banks that issue them .
The Federal Reserve reported this week that the amount of revolving consumer credit that is outstanding hit $ 937.5 billion in November , seasonally adjusted , up 7.4 percent from a year earlier .
The annual growth rate has now been over 7 percent for three months running , the first such stretch since 2001 , when a recession was driving up borrowing by hard - pressed consumers .
Home equity loans typically give consumers the right to borrow up to a certain amount of money .
It seems likely that the latest increases reflect borrowing by consumers with pre-existing lines of credit that they are now tapping , rather than newly approved loans .
The holiday sales data indicated that consumers cut back in late 2007 .
But the consumer credit numbers would seem to indicate that they wound up further in debt anyway .
Those are not good signs for the economy as 2008 begins .
Grim Credit Card Facts
Credit card debt rose at an annual rate 8.5 percent October .
Credit card debt rose at an 11.3 percent annual rate in November ..
Credit card debt rose at an annual rate between 2 percent and 4 percent from 2003 to 2005 .
Grim Housing Equity Facts
The ratio of homeowners ’ equity is currently 50.4 percent
The ratio of homeowners ’ equity at the end of 2005 54.2 percent
The ratio of homeowners ’ equity at the end of 2001 57.3 percent
Credit Card Party Will Soon Be Over
Capital One Financial ( COF ) , the largest independent U.S. credit - card issuer , reduced its full - year profit forecast by nearly 20 % due to increasing loan losses .
What a difference 30 days makes .
Last time we heard from Capital One , the company was sticking to its assumptions about the pace of degradation in the housing market , and the " return to normalization " of credit performance .
As expected , those assumptions are proving a little too rosy .
The company had anticipated full - year charge - offs to stay in a range of $ 4.59 to $ 5.5 billion .
The top end of that range has now expanded to $ 5.9 bln .
The rate of loans at COF that were 30 days or more overdue in December rose to 3.87 % , the company said , compared to 3.68 % reported a month earlier .
Charge - offs in the U.S. credit - card segment rose to 5.74 % from 5.34 %
a month earlier .
a month earlier .
The stock is now back down to April 2003 levels .
Upscale Cards Go Soft
American Express ( AXP ) forecast first - quarter earnings below analysts ’ estimates on Thursday and adopted a “ cautious view ” for 2008 because of a slowing economy .
The company will take a $ 275 million fourth - quarter charge as more cardholders fail to repay their debts , the company , based in New York , said in a statement .
Its stock fell 7 percent in extended trading .
American Express said its first - quarter 2008 earnings from continuing operations would be less than the 90 cents a share in the period in 2007 , missing the 93 - cent average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg .
The Next Subprime
This past summer 's subprime meltdown involved about $ 900 billion in now - suspect securitized debt , reckless lending , and consumers who buckled under the weight of loans they could n't afford .
Now another link in the consumer debt chain - credit cards - is starting to show signs of strain .
And the fear that the $ 915 billion in U.S. credit card debt ( an uncannily similar figure ) may blow up has major financial institutions like Citigroup , American Express , and Bank of America strapping on their Kevlar vests .
" This is absolutely not the next one to blow , " says Meredith Whitney , banking analyst at CIBC .
Christopher Marshall , CFO of Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati , points out that the U.S. has a long history of credit card securitization , " so it 's fairly well understood . "
The securitization of the subprime sector , by comparison , " got blurry , and people did n't focus on what it meant . "
[ My Comment : Anyone care to revise that forecast ? ]
Credit agencies that monitor credit cards in the asset - backed securities market share that confidence .
" The performance in the core consumer [ asset - backed securities ] sectors is expected to deteriorate modestly , but not enough to cause substantial downgrades , " says Kevin Duignan , managing director at Fitch .
[ My comment : Is Fitch ever right ? ]
But credit card debt is different from subprime debt in another way :
Unlike mortgages , credit card debt is unsecured , so a default means a total loss .
And while missed payments are at a historical low , they show signs of an uptick :
The quarterly delinquency rate for Capital One , Washington Mutual , Citigroup , J.P. Morgan Chase , and Bank of America rose an average of 13 % in the third quarter , compared with a 2 % drop in the previous quarter .
If there is an international precedent the U.S. should be watching , it 's actually that of the U.K .
British consumers are just as overstretched as Americans , but since the real estate market there rose faster and fell earlier , they 're about 18 months ahead in the credit cycle .
Since the last quarter of 2005 , credit card delinquencies and charge - off rates in Britain have risen as much as 50 % , forcing banks to take huge write - offs .
It 's a sign of the times that , according to one survey last month , 6 % of British homeowners have been using their credit cards to pay their mortgages .
That 's suicidal , of course , given that credit card interest rates are more than double even the heftiest mortgage .
Keep your fingers crossed that it's not a trend that crosses the Atlantic .

MOUNT AIRY , Maryland ( CNN ) -- U.S. President George W. Bush on Friday stressed the role of faith - based groups in the fight against AIDS , calling the struggle one of conscience and morals on the eve of World AIDS Day .
Activists call for more AIDS funding in front of the White House , draped with a giant red AIDS ribbon .
Bush was speaking at Calvary United Methodist Church in Maryland after meeting with representatives of religious and community groups .
" Faith - based groups like these are the foot soldiers in the armies of compassion , " he said .
" They are helping to defeat this epidemic one soul at a time . "
More than 33 million people worldwide have HIV -- the virus that can lead to AIDS -- according to the United Nations .
That includes 2.5 million children younger than 15 .
Watch a report on living with HIV »
More than 2 million people have died of AIDS this year -- including 330,000 children .
Bush is asking Congress for an additional $ 15 billion to continue and expand the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , a program approved by Congress after he announced it in his 2003 State of the Union address .
On Friday , he announced plans to visit sub-Saharan Africa early next year to see the program at work .
He renewed his call for lawmakers to continue funding it .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
" Now the time has come for the United States Congress to act again , " he said .
" I 'm confident they will . "
The White House says the program -- which targets countries hardest - hit by the disease -- has treated more than 1.3 million people with AIDS .
Increased funding would boost that number to 2.5 million , while expanding AIDS prevention programs and offering care to millions more with AIDS .
Despite some successes , the program has been criticized for requiring that participating groups emphasize abstinence education .
At the White House , about 40 people carried signs in support of more AIDS funding .
Before speaking , the president , along with First lady Laura Bush , participated in an hourlong faith - based roundtable discussion at the church .
Among others , the president met with Martha Chilufya , founder of the Mututa Memorial Center in Zambia .
The center works with faith - based and other caregivers to serve more than 150 patients .
Laura Bush and daughter Jenna visited the center in June .
Bush said the first lady will join him on his trip next year .
A giant red ribbon -- the international symbol for AIDS awareness -- was hung from the north portico of the White House Friday morning " to represent the continued battle against HIV / AIDS and to affirm the matchless value of every life , " the White House said .

All About HIV and AIDS
Peer to Peer Lending , or P2P lending , is lending that takes place between individuals , and bypasses the traditional role of borrowing money from a bank or lending money to a bank in the form of CDs or deposits .
Why do this ?
Simple – because there is a lot of money involved and a lot of people want in on the action .
Peer to peer lending allows “ regular Joe ’s ” the opportunity to play the role of the banker and assume the same risks – and rewards .
How Does Peer to Peer Lending Work ?
Peer to peer lending involves a borrower submitting a loan application , and lenders bidding to fund the loan .
In the case of Prosper , a borrower first applies for a loan .
Then their credit risk and other factors are considered and posted for lenders to search and bid on the loans if they choose .
When there are enough lenders to fund the loan , Prosper loans the borrower the money , then sells portions of the loan to the lenders .
Lenders are actually buying a piece of the loan , not making the loan .
Since you can buy into a loan for as low as $ 50 , it is easy to mitigate risk by diversifying over several loans .
The process may vary slightly between different P2P lending companies , but the principle is similar .
Who Benefits from P2P Lending ?
Everyone benefits with peer to peer lending , as long as everything goes as advertised .
Borrowers benefit because they are able to get a loan , often at a lower rate than they would have been able to get at a bank .
Loans can often be made at better rates to borrowers because there are fewer overhead costs associated with the loan .
Lenders benefit because they will often receive higher returns on their money than had they placed their funds into a CD .
Returns of 9 - 12 % are not uncommon , however , your exact results may vary .
Peer to peer lending companies such as Prosper or Lending Club benefit because they take a small percentage of the originating loan cost .
Is Peer to Peer Lending Safe ?
The P2P lending process is safe , but as with making any loan , peer to peer lending involves a certain amount of risk .
The best way to mitigate this risk is to fully research the credit rates assigned by the P2P companies , and diversify your funds across several loans .
Since you can bid with as little as $ 50 , it is very easy to diversify your money .
If you go with a reputable company , such as Prosper or Lending Club , you are essentially assuming the same amount of risk a bank would , just on a smaller scale .
The Person to Person Lending Process
The lending process is set up just similar to a financial institution providing a personal loan to an individual .
The loan is a legal loan and is reported to the major credit bureaus and there are collection agencies in the event of a default .
Borrower ID Verification :
The borrowers provide all their financial information including SSN , date of birth , address , telephone number , and a bank account for verification .
They also provide income level and profession .
This info is used to verify the borrowers ID against anti-fraud and credit databases .
Prosper does a full credit check to determine credit scores .
On top of that , Prosper has a 100 % guarantee against identity theft to protect borrowers and lenders alike .
Defaults :
If a borrower defaults on a loan , it is reported to the major credit agencies and there are established collection agencies to go after the money for the lenders .
A loan from Prosper or Lending Club is a legal loan , just as if it originated from a brick and mortar bank .
One small difference – Lenders are n’t actually lenders .
The loan is actually made by Prosper with their own operating funds when enough “ lenders ” have agreed to fund the loan .
Once Prosper makes the loan , the “ lenders ” buy pieces of the loan .
I put the word lenders in parenthesis because they are not actually lending money , they are buying a piece of the loan that Prosper made .
At this point , you become a lien holder .
The term lender is used because it is easier to identify with .
The P2P Loan Process is Safe
The loan you are purchasing is really no different than a bank underwriting an unsecured loan to another person .
Security and verification measures are put in place , the loans are reported to and tracked by the major credit agencies , and in the event of a default , there are collections agencies to help recoup your investment .
While the process is safe , there is risk involved .
These loans are unsecured and not guaranteed .
They have the same risk that a regular financial institution takes when they make an unsecured loan to an individual .
However , the interest rates charged by the peer to peer lending companies are designed to offset the risk .
Which companies offer peer to peer lending ?
There are actually quite a few companies around the globe that offer P2P lending .
The most prominent peer to peer lenders in the US include :
Lending Club
Prosper
Funding Circle
Kiva ( Kiva offers loans to people in 3rd world countries ; lenders only receive their principal back but do not earn interest .
This is seen mostly as doing something good with your money and giving people an opportunity they may not have otherwise had ) .
Why Participate in Peer to Peer Lending ?
The reasons differ for borrowers and lenders .
Borrowing through a peer to peer company often allows borrowers to get a loan at a lower rate than through a bank , or get a loan when a bank would not give them one .
For lenders , peer to peer lending allows you to “ be the bank . ”
When you make loans or buy a portion of a preexisting loan , you are offering someone money and getting paid for taking on the risk of doing so .
Lenders also have the chance to diversify their money over many loans which creates multiple streams of income .
As the loans get repaid , the lender has the option of lending the money in new loans or withdrawing the money .
Do You Need a Lot of Money to Get Started ?
No .
In most cases , you can start lending for as little as $ 50 , which allows you to make small investments but also diversify your loans across several borrowers and risk classes .
This helps to lower the risk involved in any one loan not being repaid and destroying your entire investment .
How Much Money Can You Make with P2P Lending ?
This varies depending on the loans you purchase , the risk involved , and many other factors .
Some of the P2P lending companies offer plans that are already diversified and offer a “ target ” return .
There is no guarantee the return will actually meet the target , but it is designed to get you there .
Prosper is currently advertising average lender returns around 9 - 12 % .
Of course , your outcome may differ depending on your portfolio and what happens with each loan .
Just remember – there is no guarantee with these loans .
But that is precisely why they offer better returns than a guaranteed investment such as a CD .
Lenders are rewarded for taking the risk .
Should I Invest in Peer to Peer Lending ?
Aha !
I ca n’t answer that one for you !
I can tell you though , that just like everything else , you need to consider your total asset allocation and your ability to deal with risk .
I have Invested in Person to Person Loans
I have invested in several loans with Prosper and Lending Club .
I only invested with funds that I could afford to put at risk .
Just like any other investment , you need to do your research to determine the level of risk you are willing to assume and the percentage of your portfolio you are willing to invest .
The best way I have found to lend is to do your research to determine which borrowers might represent a low - risk loan – generally someone with a high credit score and a low debt to income ratio .
While the loan is n’t guaranteed , the returns can quite possibly be better than a CD or high - interest bank account .
There was an interesting article written the day before lift - off of the Ron Paul Blimp by Michael Duffy titled “ The GOP Race : None of the Above ” on Time.com ( in partnership with CNN ) you might have missed .
http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1694094,00.html
The reason you may have missed it is because if you were simply googling “ Ron Paul ” it would n't have shown up .
Why would n't it have shown up ?
Because the GOP 's leading 4th quarter fundraiser ( by far after Sunday 's “ Tea Party ” raised $ 6 Million in a single day taking his total for the quarter to over 18,000,000 ) did n't merit a single mention in the article .
Not one .
If you have n't clicked the link yet , you have n't noticed that there is a nice picture from the youtube debate of Mitt , Rudy , Huck , John , and Fred ( why do they all have four letters in their spoken name ? ) but Congressman Paul is like Rudolph ( not the Mayor – the red- nosed reindeer ) before that fateful foggy Christmas Eve–all left out .
At first I thought this was a typical MSM slight of Dr. Paul .
But then I read the article .
Yes , the one that does n't mention Dr. Paul once .
After reading it , I think this was actually a nod towards Paul 's campaign and an implicit acknowledgment of his Front - Runner status ( especially considering the campaign is past the “ first they ignore you ” stage ) .
Why ?
Here is a quote from the aforementioned article :
“ If somebody could run as None of the Above , ” says former McCain campaign chief John Weaver , “ he would be the front - runner . ”
If you still have n't read the article or seen the picture ( positioned directly under the article 's title ) who is the only candidate not running for VICE - President or who does n't have a last name that is a homophone of the metal things used to unlock your doors who is n't pictured ?
Golly , you are smart ; it 's not Chuck Norris - Texas Ranger ; it 's Dr. Ron Paul - Texas Congressman .
Thus making him “ None of the Above . ”
Another part of the article sounds as if Mr. Duffy watched this youtube clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTIRRThOTCQ
and then wrote the following paragraph :
Still , it is hard to overestimate the moral and intellectual power outage that now darkens the G.O.P..
Long out of step with a majority of voters on such secondary issues as outlawing abortion and narrowing stem - cell research , Republicans have more recently managed to get themselves on the wrong side of popular trends on what were once old reliables : foreign policy , economics , energy , even health care .
Iraq is still somewhat taboo in Republican debates , so fearful are the candidates that the situation in Baghdad might again deteriorate .
Thanks to Katrina and several war - contracting scandals , the party has squandered its bragging rights on running a more efficient government .
“ We 've lost , clearly , some of the moral high ground on the larger issues of taxes and spending , ” says South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford .
The one bright spot who has never lost his “ high ground on the larger issues ” during the “ moral and intellectual power outage that now darkens the G.O.P. ” is the Front Runner .
Congressman Ronald E. Paul .
That 's R.E.P. for short - as in REPutation for never sacrificing his integrity and duty to fulfill his Congressional oath of defending the Constitution when it comes to the issues listed in the paragraph above .
If the passion of his supporters does ignite another “ money - bomb ” on Sunday , and that momentum carries over to the early primaries , the Front Runner status Mr. Duffy 's article implies without specifically stating should be confirmed by Super Tuesday .
Since the problems the G.O.P. faces are spelled out beautifully in this article and Dr. Paul has actual solutions , the only way he wo n't be nominated is if enough of the rank and file Republicans do n't hear his message before the primaries ( assuming they actually show up to vote during the primaries ) .
If somehow the Front Running Paul does n't get the G.O.P. nomination , he may ultimately prove to be the perfect conduit for the Libertarian Party 's message .
If he decides to use some of his funds to do an infomercial , or if he can garner enough support to make it into the National Debates this fall , he could end up proving that the old Libertarian slogan ( Most Americans are Libertarians ; they just do n't know it yet ) is true .
In one of the most ironic twists of all time , the man the GOP did n't want could end up costing the election and give rise to a legitimate political movement that would last as long as America does since it is based on the same principles , and not based on a silly ephemeral notion like “ Reform . ”
Although he said on Wednesday that he was 99.99999 ( give or take a 9 ) percent sure that he would n't run as a third party candidate , Michael Jordan once said he was 99.9 % sure he was done with basketball .
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2001/04/10/jordan_comeback_ap/
When
When he talks about why he wo n't run as a third party candidate , he only mentions things like “ the system makes it so difficult to get onto the ballot or into the debates . ” ( hint , hint meetup groups and supporters – he 'll really need your help unless it 's foggy this Christmas and Santa , er , the GOP realizes they do need him ) .
He never says that he does n't think it would be a good idea .
And to be taken as a serious G.O.P. contender , he could never say he'd consider a third party run–the same way Romney , Huckabee , et. al. , ca n't say that in order to do the things they want to do as President they'd have to either raise taxes or continue to run major deficits .
I think it 's kinda charming that the only “ political ” answer I 've ever heard Dr. Paul give is when he answers questions about running as a third party candidate .
It 's also odd that he is shunned because he wo n't say that he 'll support his party 's nominee no matter what .
Why would he say this ?
It may make sense in Rudy 's mind that he would support his City 's arch- rival Red Sox in the World Series because they are an American League team , but this is n't a game of baseball we 're talking about .
And even if it were , Dr. Paul would only support making sure that the integrity of the game was sound so that the game could be enjoyed by future generations ( although I highly doubt he would use federal government funds–read YOUR tax money –to do it http://www.thebostonchannel.com/sports/14852691/detail.html.
If a player was violating a contract he had signed ( or gave his oath to uphold ) , there is no way he could support this person publicly .
To do so would undermine everything he stood for .
How is this a bad thing ?
To continue on with our mixed political / sports metaphors ; when Jordan eventually did return to basketball with the Wizards , he was n't as good as he once was , but he did have moments of brilliance and he did sell out arenas .
While Dr. Paul may not be as good as he once was ( grrr … Why was n't there an internet around in 1988 ?
Or why can't he just look and talk like Mitt Romney now ? ) but if he can get his message out to the general population via infomercials , interviews that actually run ( contact ABC now http://abcnews.go.com/Site/page?id=3271346&cat=20/20
and tell them to put on that amazing John Stossel interview ( or at least put it on their homepage ) , and let them know that they have nothing to worry about under the “ Equal Time ” rule because they'd have to interview him for six months in order for him to catch up ; or just have them have every other candidate on too as a series–they could even air this series as a political special ) , or being allowed to respond more fully in debates including only two other candidates , he will have moments of brilliance and sell out ( metaphorically speaking ) the voting booths next November .
Remember that while the MSM may tell you that a third party candidate has no chance , Ross “ The Constitution is a document frozen in time that wo n't hack it ” Perot was actually leading the national polls http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot at one point in June before taking time off and ruining his momentum .
Just imagine what would happen if someone with a real message had an opportunity to be heard .
In the end , hopefully the Front - Runner will have a chance to lead the Bulls , er , Elephants to another championship .
But if they wo n't sign him , it would n't be so bad to see him sell out stadiums for the Statue of Liberty 's ( By the way , the Libertarian Party needs a new mascot ; preferably an animal –I propose an Eagle ) .
No matter how it plays out , it 's going to be one helluva game .
I know I 'll be there on the front row .
And I 'm bringing friends with me .
Get your tickets now because no matter which team signs Congressman Paul in the end , they are likely to sell out fast .

When Eric Vilain began his medical school rotation two decades ago , he was assigned to France 's reference center for babies with ambiguous genitalia .
He watched as doctors at the Paris hospital would check an infant 's endowment and quickly decide : boy or girl .
Their own discomfort and social beliefs seemed to drive the choice , the young Vilain observed with shock .
" I kept asking , ' How do you know ? ' " he recalls .
After all , a baby 's genitals might not match the reproductive organs inside .
By coincidence , Vilain was also reading the journals of Herculine Barbin , a 19th - century hermaphrodite .
Her story of love and woe , edited by famed social constructionist Michel Foucault , sharpened his questions .
He set on a path to find out what sexual " normality " really meant -- and to find answers to the basic biology of sex differences .
Today the 40 - year - old French native is one of a handful of geneticists on whom parents and doctors rely to explain how and why sex determination in an infant may have taken an unusual route .
In his genetics laboratory at the University of California , Los Angeles , Vilain 's findings have pushed the field toward not only improved technical understanding but more thoughtful treatment as well .
" What really matters is what people feel they are in terms of gender , not what their family or doctors think they should be , " Vilain says .
Genital ambiguity occurs in an estimated one in 4,500 births , and problems such as undescended testes happen in one in 100 .
Altogether , hospitals across the U.S. perform about five sex- assignment surgeries every day .
Some of Vilain 's work has helped topple ancient ideas about sex determination that lingered until very recently .
Students have long learned in developmental biology that the male path of sex development is " active , " driven by the presence of a Y chromosome .
In contrast , the female pathway is passive , a default route .
French physiologist Alfred Jost seemed to prove this idea in experiments done in the 1940s , in which castrated rabbit embryos developed into females .
Terms such as " hermaphrodite " and " intersex " are vague and hurtful Vilain says .
In 1990 , while at the University of Cambridge , Peter Goodfellow discovered SRY , a gene on the Y chromosome hailed as the " master switch . "
Just one base pair change in this sequence would produce a female instead of a male .
And when researchers integrated SRY into a mouse that was otherwise chromosomally female , an XX fetus developed as a male .
But studies by Vilain and others have shaped a more complex picture .
Instead of turning on male development directly , SRY works by blocking an " antitestis " gene , he proposes .
For one , males who have SRY but two female chromosomes range in characteristics from normal male to an ambiguous mix .
In addition , test - tube studies have found that SRY can repress gene transcription , indicating that it operates through interference .
Finally , in 1994 , Vilain 's group showed that a male could develop without the gene .
Vilain offers a model in which sex emerges out of a delicate dance between a variety of promale , antimale , and possibly profemale genes .
Because researchers have long viewed the development of females as a default pathway , the study of profemale genes has taken a backseat .
Over the past few years , though , geneticists have uncovered evidence for active female determination .
DAX1 , on the X chromosome , seems to start up the female pathway while inhibiting testis formation -- unless the gene has already been blocked by SRY .
With too much DAX1 , a person with the XY complement is born a female .
Vilain 's group found that another gene , WNT4 , operates in a similar way to promote the formation of a female .
The researchers discovered that these two work together against SRY and other promale factors .
" Ovary formation may be just as coordinated as testis determination , consistent with the existence of an ovarian switch , ' " report geneticist David Schlessinger and his collaborators in a 2006 review in the journal Bioessays .
Lately Vilain has been exploring molecular determinants of sex within the brain and whether they may be linked to gender identity .
Despite classic dogma , he is certain that sex hormones do not drive neural development and behavioral differences on their own .
SRY is expressed in the brain , he points out , suggesting that genes influence brain sexual differentiation directly .
His lab has identified in mice 50 new gene candidates on multiple chromosomes for differential sex expression .
Seven of them begin operating differently in the brain before gonads form .
Vilain 's group is testing these findings using mice and is collaborating with a clinic in Australia to study expression patterns of the sex - specific genes in transsexual people .
This work , like much of Vilain 's efforts , treads on fairly touchy ground .
He copes by sticking to his findings conservatively .
" You also have to be aware of the social sensibilities , " he explains .
Accordingly , he has come to agree with some gender activists that it is time to revamp the vocabulary used to describe ambiguously sexed babies .
At the 2005 Intersex Consensus Meeting in Chicago , he stood before a group of 50 geneticists , surgeons , psychologists and other specialists and argued that terms such as " hermaphrodite , " male or female " pseudohermaphrodite " and " intersex " were vague and hurtful .
Instead of focusing on a newborn 's confusing mix of genitals and gonads , he urged his colleagues to let the explosion of new genetic findings point toward a more scientific approach .
Rather than using " hermaphrodite , " for instance , he recommended referring to a " disorder of sexual development " ( DSD ) and applying the more precise term of " ovatesticular DSD . "
Although the attendees eventually concurred , not everyone likes the new terminology .
Some who prefer " intersex " feel that a " disorder " is demeaning .
Milton Diamond , who studies sex identity at the University of Hawaii , complains that it stigmatizes people who have nothing wrong with their bodies .
But the decision to change nomenclature realizes a 15 - year dream for Cheryl Chase , executive director of the Intersex Society of North America ( ISNA ) .
Chase has fought for years against secret , rushed surgeries intended to comfort parents and adjust anatomy to match an assigned social gender .
Recalling how a doctor once called her " formerly intersex , " she hopes physicians will begin to see mixed sex characteristics as a lifelong medical condition instead of a problem to be quickly fixed .
" Now that we 've accomplished the name change , culture can accomplish a little magic for us , " she predicts .
For her , Vilain has been a valued ally in the process as a member of ISNA 's medical advisory board .
The job , he admits , forces him to listen to patients , a practice he considers unusual for the field .
He expects the new , medicalized terminology for DSD to have what he describes wryly as " an interesting side effect , " in which " medical science should apply " to clinical decisions about ambiguous sex .
Indeed , the new consensus statement on managing intersex disorders encourages physicians to see beyond a patient 's sex organs , agrees conference co-organizer Peter A. Lee .
The statement , released last fall , recommends speedy gender assignment but a more cautious approach to surgery .
The family should participate in decision making , along with a multidisciplinary team of caregivers in specialties that include psychology and ethics .
But Lee , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Penn State College of Medicine , cautions that much more work lies ahead to fill in data gaps .
For instance , physicians have not measured how their choices affect patients over a lifetime .
On one Friday afternoon Vilain 's white coat and stethoscope lay tossed amid the papers on his desk , a reminder that his discoveries have more than philosophical meaning .
He sees six to eight patients in the U.C.L.A. intersex clinic every month , and in his on - call capacity , he receives two calls about babies in the hospital within the space of a couple of hours .
Even while immersed in the workings of DNA transcription , Vilain stays grounded in what his findings mean for people 's lives .

Like most organisations the BBC has its own technical ecosystem ; the BBC's is pretty much restricted to Perl and static files .
This means that the vast majority of the BBC 's website is statically published - in other words HTML is created internally and FTP 'ed to the web servers .
There are then a range of Perl scripts that are used to provide additional functionality and interactivity .
While there are some advantages to this ecosystem there are also some obvious disadvantages .
And a couple of implication , including an effective hard limit on the number of files you can save in a single directory ( many older , but still commonly used , filesystems just scan through every file in a directory to find a particular filename so performance rapidly degrades with thousands , or tens of thousands , of files in one directory ) , the inherent complexity of keeping the links between pages up to date and valid and , the sheer number of static files that would need to be generate to deliver the sort of aggregation pages we wanted to create when we launched / programmes ; let alone our plans for / music and personalisation .
What we wanted was a dynamic publishing solution - in other words the ability to render webpages on the fly , when a user requests them .
Now obviously there are already a number of existing frameworks out there that provide the sort of functionality that we needed , however none that provided the functionality and that could be run on the BBC servers .
So we ( the Audio and Music bit of Future Media and Technology - but more specifically Paul , Duncan , Michael and Jamie ) embarked on building a Model - view - controller ( MVC ) framework in Perl .
For applications that run internally we use Ruby on Rail .
Because we enjoy using it , its fast to develop with , straight forward to use and because we use it ( i.e. to reduce knowledge transfer and training requirements ) we decided to follow the same design patterns and coding conventions used in Rails when we built our MVC framework .
Yes that 's right we 've built Perl on Rails .

Delicious to eat - but an endangered species
A three - to - five - years ban is being proposed to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( Iccat ) .
The call comes amid deep concerns that the stock may collapse if the level of overfishing continues .
The European Commission recently closed its bluefin tuna fishery for this year after quota limits had been exceeded .
Bill Hogarth , the US delegate and Iccat chairman , said : " We need a determined international effort to save this truly magnificent fish " .
The US Senate has backed Mr Hogath 's calls for a moratorium on bluefin tuna fishing at the Iccat , which is currently meeting in Turkey .
' Stock collapse '
The so - called recovery plan that was adopted by Iccat last year , is not a recovery plan - it is a collapse plan
Dr Sergi Tudela
WWF
Conservation group WWF has given its support to the US proposal .
It too has been calling for an immediate three - year ban " following a season of unprecedented illegal and uncontrolled fishing which has resulted in massive over - quota catches " .
Speaking from Turkey , Dr Sergi Tudela , the head of Fisheries Programme at WWF Mediterranean said :
" The so - called recovery plan that was adopted by Iccat last year , is not a recovery plan - it is a collapse plan , even according to the scientific committee of Iccat , " he told BBC News .
In 2006 , to stop stock decline , Iccat scientists advised that the total catches on eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin stock should not exceed 15,000 tonnes .
The adopted plan , however , set the quota at 29,000 metric tonnes for 2007 , nearly twice the scientifically recommended level .
These unsustainable management measures , along with violations of catch limits , illegal fishing and misreporting mean the US and WWF believe a moratorium is the only option to save blue fin tuna stocks from collapse .
TUNA CATCHES 2007 ( IN TONNES ) Total ICCAT quota : 29,500 EU ICCAT quota : 16,779 Illegal and unreported catch estimate : 20,500 ( Sources : WWF , Noaa , Reuters )
Time to vote
The Iccat is made up from 45 member nations , which includes the European Commission .
The vote from the Iccat will be announced at the end of the meeting on Sunday .
Dr Tudela said : " So far it looks difficult to get the minimum support required for this [ temporary moratorium ] , but we do n't know yet .
We will know very soon which countries are supporting this . "
Turkey and Japan have also made proposals .
Turkey has called for the management plan adopted by Iccat last year to be amended by reducing quotas previously enforced by 5,000 tonnes and extending the closed fishing period .
Japan wants to establish a working group of traders and farmers to determine a management plan alongside Iccat .
I am actually in the process of watching the documentary Shut Up and Sing about the Dixie Chicks .
It basically covers the controversy when King George started his stupid invasion of Iraq and during a Dixie Chicks concert one of the trio said they were ashamed he was from Texas .
Well , the redneck crowd went apoplectic .
Their reaction clearly showed the dangers of decades of inbreeding .
And it was very interesting to watch this years after the controversy .
I say that because you watch the Bush - rah - rah crowd making utter jerks out of themselves .
I grew up with with some old fashioned country singers .
But it ’s been years since I ’ve listened .
I used to listen to Loretta Lynn or Tammy Wynette .
I outgrew it but I have to say that I like the more contemporary sound they give their music .
What was so funny was seeing how all these individuals were out there predicting great success for the invasion .
And there was some really pathetic country singer named Toby Keith who sang this jingoistic song with such crappy lines as “ Cause we ’ll put a boot in your ass .
It ’s the American way . ” Rather crude and classless but certainly in keeping with the people who were out attacking the Dixie Chicks .
Maybe Mr. Keith will do a sequel about how sometimes , when you put your boot up someone ’s ass the only thing that happens is you get shit all over your shoes .

I do n't disagree that " morals " are something very personal , and you can
thus never really argue on morals * except * for * your * own * behaviour * .
So I claim that for * me * the right choice is GPL v2 ( or something similar ) .
I think the GPLv3 is overreaching .
There 's a very fundamental , and very basic rule that is often a good
guideline .
It 's " Do unto others " .
So the reason I * personally * like the GPL v2 is that it does unto others
exactly what I wish they would do unto me .
It allows everybody do make that choice that I consider to be really
important : the choice of how something _you_ designed gets used .
And it does that exactly by * limiting * the license to only that one work .
Not trying to extend it past the work .
See ?
The GPL v3 can never do that .
Quite fundamentally , whenever you extend the
" reach " of a license past just the derived work , you will * always * get
into a situation where people who designed two different things get into a
conflict when they meet .
The GPLv2 simply avoids the conflict entirely ,
and has no problem at all with the " Do unto others as you would have them
do unto you " .
In a very real sense , the GPLv3 asks people to do things that I personally
would refuse to do .
I put Linux on my kids computers , and I limit their
ability to upgrade it .
Do I have that legal right ( I sure do , I 'm their
legal guardian ) , but the point is that this is not about " legality " , this
is about " morality " .
The GPLv3 does n't match what I think is morally where
I want to be .
I think it * is* ok to control peoples hardware .
I do it
myself .
So your arguments about " potential murderes " , " thieves " , " trespassers " and
" distributors of proprietary derived works " is totally missing the point .
It 's missing the point that " morals " are about _personal_ choices .
You
cannot force others to a certain moral standpoint .
Laws ( like copyright law ) and legal issues , on the other hand , are
fundamentally * not* about " personal " things , they are about interactions
that are * not* personal .
So laws need to be fundamnetally different from
morals .
A law has to take into account that different people have
different moral background , and a law has to be _pragmatic_ .
So trying to mix up a moral argument with a legal one is a fundamental
mistake .
They have two totally different and separate areas .
The GPLv2 is a * legal * license .
It 's not a " moral license " or a " spiritual
guide " .
Its raison - d'etre is that pragmatic area where different peoples
different moral rules meet .
In contrast , a persons * choice * to use the GPLv2 is his private choice .
Totally different .
My choice of the GPL v2 does n't say anything about my
choice of laws or legal issues .
You do n't have to agree with it - but exactly because it's his private
choice , it 's a place where the persons moral rules matter , in a way that
they do * not* matter in legal issues .
So killing , thieving , and distributing proprietary derived works are about
* legal * choices .
Are they also " immoral " ?
Who knows .
Sometimes killing is
moral .
Sometimes thievery can me moral .
Sometimes distributing derived
works can be moral .
Morality != legality .
They are two totally different
things .
Only religious fanatics and totalitarian states equate " morality " with
" legality " .
There 's tons of examples of that from human history .
The ruler
is not just a king , he 's a God , so disagreeing with him is immoral , but
it 's also illegal , and you can get your head cut off .
In fact , a lot of our most well - known heroes are the ones that actually
saw the difference between morals and laws .
A German soldier who refused to follow orders was clearly the more " moral "
one , would n't you say ?
Never mind law .
Gandhi is famous for his peaceful
civil disobedience - was that " immoral " or " illegal " ?
Or Robin Hood .
A romantic tale , but one where the big fundamnetal part of
the picture is the _difference_ between morality and legality .
Think about it .
Yes , there is obviously overlap , in that a lot of laws are there to
protect things that people also consider " moral " .
But the fact that there
is correlation should * not* cause anybody to think that they are at all
about the same thing .
> To call people who draw the line in a different place than you
> hypocrites is BS .
That was * not * what I did .
I do n't think it 's hypocritical to prefer the GPLv3 .
That 's a fine choice ,
it 's just not * mine * .
What I called hypocritical was to do so in the name of " freedom " , while
you 're at the same time trying to argue that I do n't have the " freedom " to
make my own choice .
See ?
THAT is hypocritical .

Here ’s a good ( or bad , I guess ) reason you might want to pick up a Super Mario Galaxy player ’s guide this early , which is what some people have done .
This is n’t a storyline spoiler for Galaxy , but it ’s a huge revelation involving collection of all 120 stars in the game and what you get for obtaining every single star .
No , Yoshi wo n’t appear to grant you 100 lives .
No , it ’s not something lame like a slightly different ending .
Now , it ’s a given that you ’ll fight Bowser at the end of the game .
If you choose to go ahead and fight him again after collecting every single star , however , you get a VERY nice little bonus .
Pay attention to and after the credits , and you ’ll unlock exactly what you can check out after the break .
Thanks to Mark for the submission .
SPOILERS AHEAD !
When you finish the game , you ’ll be able to play through what ’s essentially Super Luigi Galaxy .
The eternal understudy is finally back and playable in a Mario game !
You play through the entirety of Super Mario Galaxy as Luigi , which might not seem like much , but it becomes a very different game .
As usual , Luigi can jump higher and farther , and he runs faster but with less traction .
The game is supposedly much harder with Luigi , so you ’re not only getting a playable platformer starring Luigi , but you ’re getting a “ hard mode ” at the same time !
Philadelphia is home to the least attractive people in the United States , a survey of visitors and residents showed .
The city of more than 1.5 million people was also found to be among the least stylish , least active , least friendly and least worldly , according to the “ America ’s Favorite Cities ” survey by Travel & Leisure magazine and CNN Headline News .
About 60,000 people responded to the online survey — at www.travelandleisure.com — which ranked 25 cities in categories including shopping , food , culture , and cityscape , said Amy Farley , senior editor at the magazine .
For unattractiveness , Philadelphia just beat out Washington DC and Dallas / Fort Worth for the bottom spot .
Miami and San Diego are home to the most attractive people , the poll found .
But Farley pointed out the results do n’t mean people in Philadelphia are ugly or the city is a bad place to visit .
“ We were asking people to vote on attractiveness , not unattractiveness .
Travel & Leisure editors believe there are a lot of attractive people in Philadelphia , ” she said .
“ The relative attractiveness of its residents is only a minuscule factor in evaluating a city ’s merit . ”
Philadelphians ’ self - esteem has been undermined by national surveys showing they are among the fattest people in the United States .
The American Obesity Association ranked the city in the top 10 for overweight people every year between 2000 and 2005 .
And sporting pride in a city known for the fierce loyalty of its fans has been hurt by not having had a national champion in any of its four main sports since the 76ers won the National Basketball Association title in 1983 .

Kirsty MacColl sang with the Pogues on the 1987 hit
The edited version
The word , sung by the late Kirsty MacColl as she trades insults with Shane MacGowan , has been dubbed out .
But MacColl 's mother , Jean , called the ban " too ridiculous " , while the Pogues said they found it " amusing " .
The BBC said : " We are playing an edited version because some members of the audience might find it offensive . "
' Gratuitous vulgarity '
A Radio 1 spokeswoman said the station 's management had met on Tuesday morning to discuss the issue .
The song is a duet between MacColl and Shane MacGowan
But the ban does not apply across the BBC .
Radio 2 said it would be playing the full version of the track .
MacColl , who was killed by a speedboat off the coast of Mexico in 2000 , brands Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan " you scumbag , you maggot , you cheap lousy faggot " in the song , which reached number two when it was first released .
She continues : " Happy Christmas your arse , I pray God it 's our last . "
Another line , where MacGowan calls MacColl " an old slut on junk " , has also been edited .
Jean MacColl told BBC Radio 5 Live 's Breakfast : " These are a couple of characters - not in the first flush of youth , I would have thought .
" This is the way they spoke .
Today we have a lot of a gratuitous vulgarity and whatever from people all over which I think is quite unnecessary .
" They are what they are .
These are characters and they speak like that . "
HAVE YOUR SAY No !
It 's a cracking tune about two people having a blazing row at Christmas .
They 're meant to be offending each other !

' Complete over - reaction '
Listeners have also been criticising the ban on the Radio 1 Newsbeat website .
Denise Venn said it was " a complete over - reaction " and Simon from Southampton called it " political correctness gone mad " .
Dean in Southampton added : " I 'm gay and it certainly does n't offend me .
" I find it more offensive that the BBC has tampered with this track which hopefully will be number one this Christmas . "
However , veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell said Radio 1's actions were right .
" The word faggot is being sung as an insult , alongside scumbag and maggot .
In this abusive context it is unacceptable , " he said .
" It is shameful that BBC Radio 2 and other radio and TV stations are continuing to play the full version with the word faggot included .
It shows that they do n't take homophobic language as seriously as racist language . "

In short , these are people who not only swallow many of the maxims for success but take them as absolutes .
At some level they know that it ’s possible to succeed after falling short ( build on your mistakes : another boilerplate rule ) .
The trouble is that falling short still reeks of mediocrity ; for them , to say otherwise is to spin the result .
Never accept second best .
Always be true to yourself .
The burden of perfectionist expectations is all too familiar to anyone who has struggled to kick a bad habit .
Break down just once — have one smoke , one single drink — and at best it ’s a “ slip . ”
At worst it ’s a relapse , and more often it ’s a fall off the wagon : failure .
And if you ’ve already fallen , well , may as well pour yourself two or three more .
This is why experts have long debated the wisdom of insisting on abstinence as necessary in treating substance abuse .
Most rehab clinics are based on this principle : Either you ’re clean or you ’re not ; there ’s no safe level of use .
This approach has unquestionably worked for millions of addicts , but if the studies of perfectionists are any guide it has undermined the efforts of many others .
Ms. Provost said those in her program at U.C. Davis often displayed symptoms of obsessive - compulsive disorder — another risk for perfectionists .
They could n’t bear a messy desk .
They found it nearly impossible to leave a job half - done , to do the next day .
Some put in ludicrously long hours redoing tasks , chasing an ideal only they could see .

As an experiment , Ms. Provost had members of the group slack off on purpose , against their every instinct .
“ This was mostly in the context of work , ” she said , “ and they seem like small things , because what some of them considered failure was what most people would consider no big deal . ”
Ed Henry is a CNN White House correspondent .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
It 's the best of times , it 's the worst of times -- a tale of two legacies as President Bush prepares to ring in the final year of his presidency .
President Bush leaves the White House on Friday to spend the Christmas holiday at Camp David , Maryland .
Sitting in the front row for Bush 's final press conference of 2007 on Thursday , I was struck by how it 's a mixed bag for the president on three key issues -- his relationship with the Democratic Congress , the state of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the health of the U.S. economy .
How Bush handles those three issues in 2008 will go a long way toward figuring out his legacy in 2009 and beyond .
His relationship with Democrats on Capitol Hill is important because it will hold the key to how Bush 's domestic agenda fares in his final year .
Usually in election years , not much gets done because each side is dug in , but 2008 may be different for one reason : Bush and Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , each have incentive to come together on at least a few issues , like maybe children 's health insurance .
Bush needs legacy items , while Pelosi & Co. need some accomplishments to take to voters next November .
Bush noted the year ended on a " high note , " with compromises on energy reform and a tax fix for middle - to upper - income families .
But he also ripped Democrats for loading up the budget with too many pork - barrel projects and not finishing terrorist surveillance legislation .
Do n't Miss Bush scolds Congress for funding pet projects
The bad news for Bush is that other than the Medicare prescription drug program he signed into law early in his presidency , his domestic legacy is thin .
Even his signature education reform law , No Child Left Behind , is under fire with some conservatives and struggling to be reauthorized .
The good news for Bush , however , is that by brandishing his veto pen , he was able to prove this year he still carries a lot of clout .
Plus , the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are very thin .
That 's a major reason why Democrats repeatedly failed to change Iraq policy -- and why Bush scored a major victory by getting $ 70 billion in new war funding with none of the strings Democrats originally wanted to attach .
But if the president wants to add some major domestic achievements to his legacy in 2008 , he will have to put down the veto pen sometimes and show a willingness to compromise .
And Democrats will have to prove they really want to meet the president halfway , too .
We 'll see -- to say this marriage is strained is an understatement .
Secondly , there 's a very mixed picture emerging from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
For Bush , 2007 may be a turning point in which his " surge " policy helped improve security on the ground in Baghdad .
But the other goal of sending an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Iraq was to give the Iraqi government breathing space for political reconciliation , an area in which little progress has been achieved .
While the president touted some modest success by the Iraqi government , he acknowledged there needs to be a lot more movement .
" Are we satisfied with the progress in Baghdad ?
No , " he said .
" But to say nothing 's happening is just simply not the case . "
Then there 's Afghanistan , sometimes known as the " Forgotten War " because it never seems to get as much media attention .
And in fact , Democrats have accused the president of taking his eye off the ball by launching the war in Iraq .
While Bush has flatly rejected that claim , his administration is conducting a top - to - bottom review of the war in Afghanistan , and he 's admitted some worry that NATO allies may not stay in the fight .
" And my biggest concern is that people say , ' Well , we 're kind of tired of Afghanistan and , therefore , we think we 're going to leave , ' " he said .
" That would be my biggest concern . "
Pay attention to Afghanistan .
Will there need to be a U.S. " surge " there ?
It may be the war that becomes much more of a front - page story in 2008 than Iraq , and ends up affecting the Bush legacy in a major way .
And finally there 's the economy , which is also a mixed bag .
Bush sounded upbeat by saying " the fundamentals are strong , that we 've had strong growth for a reason : that we 're competitive , we got flexible workplace , that we kept taxes low , exports are up . "
But the president also recently admitted there are " storm clouds " over the economy , especially the mortgage crisis .
It 's stating the obvious that more anxiety in the financial markets -- or dare I say a recession -- will be another key to the Bush legacy .
For his part , the president often says he 's not sitting around fretting his legacy .
Although the fact that Bush will be jumping aboard Air Force
One the second week of January for a trip to the Mideast -- to help push along a peace deal -- is a sign that the legacy question is in the back of his mind somewhere .

A scorpion giving birth
Thanks for the digg !
Anyway , to answer some question I noticed in the comments : the babies do not come out of the mouth of the mother , but from an opening near the pectines ( featherlike structures underneath the scorpion ) .
The first photo on Scans of Diplocentrus species shows the pectines to the left and the right of a rectangular piece with a " half - round dent " .
The dent is where the opening is located .
The mother might eat her babies , but this mostly happens when she is stressed too much .
If you 're interested in scorpions in general ( or other arachnids like tarantulas , vinegaroons , etc ) , this site has a lot of related photos , nature walks , etc .
The easiest way to find something of interest is to use google , for example : site : johnbokma.com scorpions .

Today , after Esme and I had returned from some shopping at Wal - Mart , I discovered that one scorpion was giving birth : a Diplocentrus species , probably Diplocentrus melici , which we had captured the 23rd of April , 2006 .
Later that day we captured another female .
The latter gave birth some time ago , but shortly after died .
My best guess is that it somehow got ill , and aborted the scorpions , none of which survived because the mother died before they were old enough to survive without her .
In the above photo you can see the scorpion giving live birth .
In front of her , a baby is struggling out of its embryonic sac ( not sure if it 's that ) .
Her front legs ( not the claws ) form a kind of cradle to catch the babies when they leave her body .
One tiny newly born scorpion is climbing up .
Baby scorpions ride on the back of their mother for the first week or so .
I am going to do my very best to keep as many alive as possible , probably using the same techniques as I use with the Diplocentrus bereai juveniles I keep .
And since my hobby has its limits , space wise , I have plans to return the juveniles to the same location we captured the mother from after a year or so .

WASHINGTON — We Americans like to think of ourselves as strong , rugged and supremely confident — a nation of Marlboro Men and Marlboro Women , minus the cigarettes and the lung cancer .
So why do we increasingly find ourselves hunkered behind walls , popping pills by the handful to stave off diseases we might never contract and eyeing the rest of the world with a kind of us - or - them suspicion that borders on the pathological ?
Last week , I heard some of the nation ’s leading cultural anthropologists try to explain these and other phenomena .
I came away convinced that we , as a nation , definitely should seek professional help .
The American Anthropological Association held its annual meeting here in Washington , and I was invited to an afternoon - long panel discussion titled “ The Insecure American . ”
I decided to overlook the fact that my hosts , Hugh Gusterson of George Mason University and Catherine Besteman of Colby College , had recently co-edited a book called “ Why America ’s Top Pundits Are Wrong . ”
“ The Insecure American ” turned out to be a revelation — by turns alarming , depressing and laugh - out - loud amusing — as scholar after scholar presented research showing just how unnerved this society is .
Setha Low , who teaches at the City University of New York , has spent years studying the advent and increase of gated communities .
People decide to sequester their families behind walls because they are afraid of crime , they feel isolated from their neighbors and they ’re nostalgic for a kind of idealized Norman Rockwell past , Low reported .
Nothing terribly irrational about that .
But after extensive interviews with residents of gated communities in San Antonio and on Long Island , Low discovered that there is n’t really less crime behind the walls , people do n’t really feel more secure and there was no greater sense of small - town closeness among neighbors .
Despite the gates and guard huts , people still felt they needed to set their alarm systems .
Joseph Dumit of the University of California at Davis presented his work arguing that health care has been redefined into a statistical exercise in risk reduction .
The average American fills nearly 13 prescriptions per year , Dumit said , and many of the drugs are not to make the patient well , but to reduce the statistical risk that the person will become ill .
People who are otherwise healthy are prescribed statins to lower their cholesterol , for example , or beta blockers for high blood pressure .
Dumit pointed out that this risk - driven approach assumes that every one of us is “ inherently ill . ”
It also drives health care costs by pushing doctors and drug companies to spend whatever it takes to incrementally reduce a patient ’s risk of getting sick — even though some of those patients never would have gotten sick anyway .
Susan F. Hirsch , a professor at George Mason University , gave a riveting presentation on how terrorism feeds insecurity .
Hirsch ’s husband , Abdulrahman Abdullah , was killed in the 1998 al - Qaida bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania .
When some of the alleged perpetrators faced justice in a New York courtroom in 2001 , Hirsch began attending the trial as a victim .
She ended up studying it as an anthropologist , concluding that the legal system , while imperfect , was the best way of dealing with terrorists .
Catherine Lutz of Brown University reported on her studies of what President Eisenhower called the “ military - industrial complex . ”
She noted that the immense resources this country devotes to war - making are based on assumptions that anthropologists might not accept as given — that war is embedded in human nature , for example , and therefore can never be consigned to our barbarian past as was done with slavery .
Lee Baker of Duke University , Brett Williams of American University and other presenters described their research on economic insecurity , driven by forces such as globalization , immigration and gentrification .
And Nancy Scheper - Hughes , a professor of medical anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley , had me wincing as she talked about her investigations of what she called “ vulture capitalism ” — the global trade in body parts for transplant .
The fastest - growing segment of kidney transplant recipients , Scheper - Hughes said , consists of patients over 70 ; when they ca n’t get a needed organ from the transplant registry , she said , they often ask a healthy child or grandchild to donate .
To recap :
We ’re afraid of one another , we ’re afraid of the rest of the world , we ’re afraid of getting sick , we ’re afraid of dying .
Maybe if we study our insecurities and confront them , we ’ll learn to keep them in check .
Before we turn the whole nation into one big paranoid gated community , maybe we ’ll learn that life is n’t really any better behind the walls .

Gunfire killed at least six people and wounded 80 today at a Fatah memorial rally for Yasser Arafat attended by hundreds of thousands of supporters of the defeated faction in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip .
A sea of yellow Fatah flags had filled a Gaza square for the biggest gathering held by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 's secular faction in the territory since Hamas Islamists routed its fighters there in June .
The rare Fatah rally broke up in chaos after gunfire rang out and grew into what Hamas described as battles with the rival group 's fighters , forcing even members of the crowd who had initially stood their ground to bolt for cover .
Scroll down for more ...
Dr Muawiyah Hassanein , head of Gaza 's emergency medical services , said six people , all civilians , were killed .
He said 80 people , including several Hamas security men , were wounded .
Fatah officials accused Hamas forces of opening fire from the nearby Islamic University .
Hamas said its men had come under attack from Fatah gunmen and returned fire .
The emotional memorial event for Arafat had given Fatah a rare chance to assemble its supporters in the Gaza Strip .
Abbas , preparing for a U.S. - hosted conference with Israel later this month on Palestinian statehood , has rejected new dialogue with Hamas until the group relinquishes control of the Gaza Strip .
Hamas has banned opposition rallies since its takeover of the territory but any move to prevent a remembrance ceremony for Arafat , the iconic leader who died on Nov. 11 , 2004 , would have been widely unpopular among Palestinians .
" The people came out today into the streets to say ' no ' to Hamas , " said senior Fatah official Mohammed Dahlan , a former security chief in the Gaza Strip and now based in the occupied West Bank , where his faction holds sway .
" I call on Fatah in Gaza to continue pursuing peaceful means in confronting Hamas .
I know many people in Gaza do n't like this because emotions are running high but popular means are the only way to bring the downfall of this fascist movement , " he said .
Huge murals of Arafat in his trademark Arab headdress , and a smaller picture of Abbas , had provided a backdrop for the event which organisers said was attended by more than 250,000 people .
Fatah nationalist songs blared from loudspeakers as many in the crowd expressed their longing for Arafat , regarded by Palestinians as a symbol of unity .
" Abu Mazen ( Abbas ) is not like Arafat but he is our president now and we respect him .
We urge him to end Hamas occupation , " said a teenage participant , who gave his name only as Khaled .

Midwest ( TGW ) – Green Star Products Inc. ( GSPI ) announced this week that it has signed a contract to build a 100 - acre algae to biodiesel facility .
The plant will use the CO2 emitted from the plant to feed the algae , which reduces the overall emissions of the facility .
Algae oil will be produced at the plant , and other existing facilities will convert that algae oil to biodiesel .
Biotech Research , Inc. ( BTR ) has signed the contract with GSPI , and preparation for construction will begin in March 2008 .
BTR is planning to build several 1000 - acre algae facilities .
Algae is much more efficient of a biofuel than what is used currently ( corn and sugarcane ) .
Algae absorbs CO2 , and produces 100 times more oil per acre than other biodiesel sources such as soy .

If you 're surfing the Internet at work , you may not be the only one who knows .
Watching workers has become an industry unto itself .
Admit it -- you 've used your computer at work to view non-work - related Web sites .
Heck , if you are reading this article at work , you might already be guilty as charged .
More than 70 percent of the adult online population has accessed the Internet at work for personal use at least once , according to a September 2000 eMarketer study .
Employees are sending personal e-mails , playing games , viewing pornography , shopping , checking stock prices and gambling online during working hours .
Do n't think these cyberslacking activities are going unnoticed .
With a simple software application , your boss can be tapping into your computer and see what you 're doing in real - time .
Whether you are guilty of wasting company time or not , your computer might be under surveillance .
You can be monitored without your knowledge -- employers are not required to notify you that you 're being observed .

­ At the center of the debate surrounding workplace surveillance is the question of employee privacy rights .
In this article , you 'll learn about the various kinds of software that enable employers to monitor your computer activities .
We will also discuss the legalities of this practice .
Ever since September 11th , people have wondered what it is that can cause seemingly education men like the 9/11 hijackers to fall prey to an ideology so extreme that they are willing to commit mass murder .
Some would argue that it is something inherent in the nature of Islam that causes this , but that misses the point .
Every religion , every society , has extreme ideologies that could conceivably motivate people to kill others and themselves .
The question is , what happens to cause someone to be receptive to that type of idea .
At least one Princeton economist thinks he knows the answer :
When Princeton economist Alan Krueger saw reports that seven of eight people arrested in the unsuccessful car bombings in Britain were doctors , he was n’t shocked .
He was n’t even surprised .
“ Each time we have one of these attacks and the backgrounds of the attackers are revealed , this should put to rest the myth that terrorists are attacking us because they are desperately poor , ” he says .
“ But this misconception does n’t die . ” ( …)
“ As a group , terrorists are better educated and from wealthier families than the typical person in the same age group in the societies from which they originate , ” Mr. Krueger said at the London School of Economics last year in a lecture soon to be published as a book , “ What Makes a Terrorist ? ”
“ There is no evidence of a general tendency for impoverished or uneducated people to be more likely to support terrorism or join terrorist organizations than their higher - income , better - educated countrymen , ” he said .
The Sept. 11 attackers were relatively well - off men from a rich country , Saudi Arabia .
So if it ’s not poverty , what is it then ?
So what is the cause ?
Suppression of civil liberties and political rights , Mr. Krueger hypothesizes .
“ When nonviolent means of protest are curtailed , ” he says , “ malcontents appear to be more likely to turn to terrorist tactics . ”
Which — ironically , given that Mr. Krueger is no fan of the president ’s actual policies at home or abroad — is close to Mr. Bush ’s rhetoric : “ Liberty has got the capacity to change enemies into allies . ”
And when you look at the Islamic world , what do you see ?
Without exception you see repressive states ruled by cliques , royal families , or President ’s - for - life .
You also see near uniform repression of virtually any form of political and social expression .
And some of these countries are our “ allies ” ; Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Pakistan are all repressive and all of them have been the home of men who have participated in the mass murder of Americans and Europeans .
Ironically , there is one nation in the Middle East that comes close to being a free state , and it ’s the one that is targeted by the terrorists even more than the United States … … Israel .

It is one of five central banks that have injected billions in emergency cash into money markets .
The aim is to cut the cost of lending between retail and commercial banks , which has jumped in the past few weeks .
All banks with enough collateral , and which submitted bids of at least 4.21 % , received funds from the ECB .
The ECB said 390 banks across the eurozone had sought the funding .
The move - making the extra cash available over the next two weeks - will ease fears of a credit meltdown over the Christmas period , when banks need extra cash .
Cutting interbank rates
The hope is that lower interbank rates will mean that banks will also be able to make more funds available at cheaper rates to companies and individuals .
The ECB 's action succeeded in cutting short - term lending rates , with the two week euro Libor rate falling sharply to 4.4 % .
However , the rate still remains above the 4 % ECB refinancing rate .
The two - week ECB refinancing operation is the first time it has said it would offer banks unlimited funds , above a certain interest rate , since 9 August when the credit crisis started .
The size of the offer surprised some analysts .
" The sheer magnitude of the operation caught the market off guard , " said Win Thin , a senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman .
Central bank coordination
The main reason banks have been unwilling to lend to each other is a downturn in the US property market .
A surge in mortgage defaults and bad debts has forced many banks to cut the value of their mortgage investments , costing them billions of dollars .
As a result , the banks fear that they might need any spare cash they have to cover their losses .
Central banks have also been boosting liquidity into the banking sector to ensure banks keep offering credit to businesses .
On Monday , the US Federal Reserve made $ 20bn available through auction , though it did not say how many banks took advantage of the extra money .
And on Tuesday the Bank of England is set to lend more than another £ 10bn in funds .
As well as the Bank of England , the Fed , and the European Central Bank , the national banks of Canada and Switzerland are also involved in the funding plan .
But some analysts say that until the banks reveal the true scale of their potential losses , the central banks will be unable to do much to ease the credit crunch .
Assembly line workers install a hybrid engine into Toyota Motor Corp 's new Prius sedan at Toyota 's Tsutsumi plant in Toyota city , central Japan , October 2 , 2003 .
A Toyota employee died of overwork after logging more than 106 hours of overtime in a month , a judge ruled Friday , reversing a ministry 's earlier decision not to pay compensation to his widow .
REUTERS / Chang - Ran Kim
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - A Toyota Motor Corp employee died of overwork after logging more than 106 hours of overtime in a month , a judge ruled Friday , reversing a ministry ’s earlier decision not to pay compensation to his widow .
The Toyota Labor Standards Inspection office , a local branch of Japan ’s labor ministry , refused to pay the widow the usual compensation for a spouse ’s work - related death , saying the man had only logged 45 hours of overtime in the month before he died , Japanese media reported .
But the court ruled that the employee had worked far more than that , said Yomiuri Online , a Japanese news website .
The Nagoya District Court in central Japan said the ruling overturned the labor ministry ’s decision .
“ We want to think of how to respond to this ruling by discussing it with relevant agencies , ” an official at the Toyota Labor Standards Inspection Office told Reuters .
The employee , who was working at a Toyota factory in central Japan , died of irregular heartbeat in February 2002 after passing out in the factory around 4 a.m .
“ ( The employee ) worked for extremely long hours and the relationship between his work and death is strong , ” Yomiuri Online quoted Judge Toshiro Tamiya as saying .
Overworking is a serious issue in Japan , where an average worker uses less than 50 percent of paid holidays , according to government data .
In fiscal year 2005 - 2006 , the labor ministry received 315 requests for compensation from the bereaved families of workers who died of strokes and other illnesses seen as work - related .
Toyota said in a statement it would further improve the management of its employees ’ health .

DETROIT , Dec. 10  The dollar ’s falling value is making European automakers eager to build more vehicles in the United States , even as American car companies continue to shift production to other , lower - cost countries .
Fiat , the Italian carmaker , is the latest company to suggest that it may build a plant in the United States .
Its chief executive , Sergio Marchionne , told Automotive News Europe for an article published Monday that its sports car brand , Alfa Romeo , needs a North American plant to be profitable .
Alfa Romeo is returning to the United States next year after a 13 - year absence .
Meanwhile , Volkswagen of Germany is scouting locations for a plant in the eastern United States .
It was the first foreign carmaker to open an American factory , in New Stanton , Pa. , but closed the factory in 1988 .
Volkswagen ’s chief executive , Stefan Jacoby , said during last month ’s Los Angeles Auto
Show that the company would decide by mid-2008 whether to build the factory .

Aug. 21 , 2007  --
Consumer confidence sustained its steepest one - week drop in more than 20 years of ongoing polls this week , falling to its lowest level since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in late October 2005 .
The ABC News / Washington Post Consumer Comfort Index lost an extraordinary nine points to - 20 on its scale of +100 to - 100 , down from - 11 last week , and a summertime high of - 5 four weeks ago .
Before now , the index never has fallen by more than seven points in a single week in 1,130 weeks of consecutive polling .
The decline is broadly based among population groups , and there seems not to be a single negative event to blame , but a confluence : the stock market 's fall , troubled housing and credit markets , the Fed 's expressions of concern about an economic downturn , the cumulative effect of high gasoline prices during the summer driving months , and a public broadly dispirited over the course of national events , driven by the unpopular war in Iraq .
Last week 's ABC / Post consumer survey hinted at this change .
It found a significant increase in pessimism about the economy 's future , with 57 percent of Americans saying the economy 's getting worse , far above the 26 - year average of 39 percent , and the most since post - Katrina October 2005 .
This week , ratings of current conditions followed .
The drop in confidence , in fact , has been brewing since late July .
The CCI reached its summertime high of - 5 July 22 , then turned down to - 8 the next week , and - 11 last week .
The index is based on a four - week rolling average of 250 weekly interviews ; this week , the positive week of July 22 rolled out of the average , and far bleaker views the past week rolled in .
INDEX — The index is based on Americans ' ratings of the national economy , their personal finances , and the buying climate , and all took a hit this week : Just 32 percent say the economy 's in good shape , down five points in a week to the fewest since October 2005 ; 53 percent say their personal finances are OK , down five points to the fewest since October 2004 ; and 35 percent call it a good time to spend money , matching what it was this past June .
Compared to a month ago , positive ratings of the national economy have taken the biggest fall , down 12 points ; positive ratings of personal finance have dropped by six points ; positive views of the buying climate , four points .
TREND — Competing positive and negative forces have been pulling at consumer sentiment lately , producing gyrations in the CCI .
It reached a better - than - average - 3 in early May , fell ( amid rising gasoline prices ) to - 15 a month later , recovered in July , and now has dropped again .
At - 20 , the index today is well below its 2007 average , - 7 , and its long - term average of - 9 , since this weekly poll began in late 1985 .
This year alone , it 's ranged from + 2 in March to today 's - 20 , and one of its previous record falls , - 7 , occurred the week of March 18 .
The CCI also fell by seven points in a single week in February 2004 , January 2001 , and February 1990 .
Those shared the record for a one - week - drop — until this week .
GROUPS —
As usual , the CCI is higher in better - off groups , but it 's declined across the board .
It 's +35 among higher - income adults ( down 12 points from last week ) , compared with - 47 among those with the lowest incomes ( down 16 points ) .
The index is - 2 among those who 've been to college while - 49 among high school dropouts , and - 14 among whites , but - 38 among blacks .
The gap between men and women has been narrower than usual , lately ; again , that 's so this week , with a CCI of - 17 among men , and - 21 among women .
Partisan differences remain :
The index is +15 among Republicans , - 32 among independents and - 33 among Democrats .
Republicans were one of the few groups that did n't participate in this week 's decline in confidence ; however , their views , like those of others , have worsened in the past month overall .
Here 's a closer look at the three components of the ABC / Post CCI :
NATIONAL ECONOMY —
Thirty - two percent of Americans rate the economy as excellent or good ; it was 37 percent last week .
The highest was 80 percent on Jan. 16 , 2000 .
The lowest was 7 percent in late 1991 and early 1992 .
PERSONAL FINANCES —
Fifty - three percent say their own finances are excellent or good ; it was 58 percent last week .
The best was 70 percent , last reached in January 2000 .
The worst was 42 percent on March 14 , 1993 .
BUYING CLIMATE —
Thirty - five percent say it's an excellent or good time to buy things ; it was 39 percent last week .
The best was 57 percent on Jan. 16 , 2000 .
The worst was 20 percent in the fall of 1990 .
METHODOLOGY — Interviews for the ABC News / Washington Post Consumer Comfort Index are reported in a four - week rolling average .
This week 's results are based on telephone interviews among a random national sample of 1,000 adults in the four weeks ending Aug. 19 , 2007 .
The results have a three - point error margin .
Field work by ICR - International Communications Research of Media , Pa .
The index is derived by subtracting the negative response to each index question from the positive response to that question .
The three resulting numbers are added and divided by three .
The index can range from +100 ( everyone positive on all three measures ) to - 100 ( all negative on all three measures ) .
The survey began in December 1985 .
CNN 's Blitzer :
Is deputy fire chief trying to ' swiftboat ' Giuliani ?
Greg Wasserstrom and Mike Aivaz
Published : Wednesday November 21 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This New York City Deputy Fire Chief Jim Riches does not want to see his former mayor become president .
As head of the group 9/11 Firefighters and Families , Riches works tirelessly to spread the message that Rudy Guiliani failed his first responders on 9/11 .
Riches appeared on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer to discuss what he 's trying to do .
While former New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir also appeared to defend Giuliani 's record .
" Let 's get right to the issue , " Blitzer said .
" Are you trying to ' swiftboat ' Rudy Giuliani ? "
" No , we 're going to set the record straight on 9/11 and we do n't think he 's the hero he says he was or the leader , " Riches said .
Riches , who lost his son when the Towers collapsed , faults Giuliani for the Fire Department 's faulty radios , a lack of training at the World Trade Center , an inept Office of Emergency Management , and " incompetent and cowardly " police and fire commissioners .
" I take it that you 're thinking of starting what 's called a 527 , a committee that would raise money to go after a specific candidate without being involved in any another candidate , is that right ? "
Blizter asked .
" We 're all from different - , we 're conservatives , we 're Democrats and I voted for Bush and I voted for Giuliani three times , " Riches said , " This is not political , this is strictly about his leadership . "
Riches also rejected claims by the Giuliani campaign that his group was politicizing 9/11 .
" Well , that 's a lie because they 've politicized it from day one and if he wants to run on his record of failure and everything else then let him run on it , but we 're going to set the truth out , " Riches said .
Riches 's group has been visible in the past days in the media and in the early primary state of New Hampshire .
The group was in the State meeting with local media and holding events , countering a Giuliani ad released the same day touting the candidate 's 9/11 credentials , according to a DNC press release .
Giuliani's opponents for the nomination are also beginning to poke at the former mayor 's constant invocation of 9/11 on the campaign trail .
In a CNBC interview recently , Giuliani said in defense of waterboarding , " I 'm very reluctant to take away presidential prerogatives and decision making , maybe because I 've faced crisis more than the other ones have . "
Retorted rival John McCain , " I do not know which ' crisis ' the mayor may have been talking about .
My experience goes back to the Cuban missile crisis and every conflict we 've been in since . "
Responding to Riches allegations , former New York City Police and Fire commissioner Howard Safir , head of the group First Responders for Giuliani , said that despite all Riches ' years of dutiful service to the city , he simply has his facts wrong .
" If you took a look at the Rand Report that took a look at the emergency response to 9/11 , they say it was an excellent response , " Safir said .
He also downplayed the role the notorious faulty radios had in the deaths of Firefighters .
" If you look in the 9/11 Commission Report , it clearly says that 24 of the 32 companies in the North Tower that Chief Riches said were killed because of lack of radios actually had communication and were notified of the evacuation order . "
Safir also went on to say that Giuliani displayed no cowardice that morning as Riches suggests , but was whisked away by security because " he was not there to operationally fight the fires . "
Safir says that by making these claims against Giuliani , Riches and his group denigrate the heroism of those who died on 9/11 .
Though Safir is close to the Giuliani campaign , there has been no word about Riches ' and his group 's allegations from the campaign itself .
The full DNC press release on the Giuliani ad is available at this link .

Wedgie - proof underwear earned 8 - year - old twin boys a spot Friday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show .
Using rigged boxers and fabric fasteners to hold together some seams , Jared and Justin Serovich came up with the " Rip Away 1000 . "
" When the person tries to grab you — like the bully or the person tries to give you a wedgie — they just rip away , " Justin explained Thursday by phone from Los Angeles , where the TV segment was taped Wednesday .
The third - graders from Gables Elementary School began brainstorming one day after they were horsing around , giving each other the treatment .
Their mother 's partner sarcastically said someone ought to invent wedgie - proof underwear , the family said .
The project got the boys to the finals of a central Ohio invention competition earlier this year , followed by the television appearance .

Is Frugal Living the New Trend ?
And How Our Paper Missed the Mark
My husband was taking a break at work last night when he picked up a magazine at the facility he was cleaning .
It was a copy of our local newspaper ’s newest publication : Distinctly Northwest – Sophisticated Living .
The magazine is geared toward the upper class , and includes articles on upscale living .
After flipping through the magazine , and then thinking for a while , my husband came to a conclusion .
The newspaper got it wrong .
The newest trend is n’t toward upscale living .
It ’s toward simple and frugal living .
We had this conversation yesterday morning , and he told me his reasoning .
He sees beingfrugal .net , and blogs similar to this one , growing by leaps and bounds .
Every time we turn around , there ’s a new article on simple living , frugality , or the minimalist lifestyle .
I have to admit he ’s right .
In fact , ever since I wrote why the minimalist lifestyle appeals to me almost two months ago , I get at least one hit a day from a google search for “ minimalist lifestyle ” .
Often I get many more .
In fact , I would say “ minimalist lifestyle ” is second only to “ being frugal ” when it comes to search terms that lead people to this blog .
Beyond that , “ going green ” is a big social issue right now : not wasting , not overfilling our landfills , minimizing the stuff we buy , because it ’s bad for the environment .
Al Gore is pushing for us to take care of the environment with his popular documentary An Inconvenient Truth .
( We can debate what I think about that another day … this post is about societal trends ) .
What it boils down to is that there is tremendous social pressure to be frugal with our environment .
Add to that the fear of an impending recession , and people are watching what they spend .
Housing prices are falling , people are losing their homes , and nobody knows exactly what the economy will do next .
I think people from the lower class all the way up to the upper crust are beginning to keep a careful eye on what they spend , how they spend , and the impact it has on the world around them .
Personally , I ’m all for the new trend .
I ’m not excited about an economy that ’s tanking , but I think it ’s high time people realized that spending more than they earn is a bad idea .
I realize this is bad news for advertisers , because they will have to work harder to get people to buy unnecessary things .
What I would love to see is more publications on frugal living , financial responsibility , or anything that says life is about more than spending money .
It seems to me that people are starting to figure out that money is n’t what makes the world go round .
Perhaps someday the newspaper will catch on .
What do you think ?
Is frugal living the new trend ?
Or are we still a society that revels in upscale living ( or wanna - be upscale living ) ?
Global Warming Fears Norway 's Moose Population in Trouble for Belching
The poor old Scandinavian moose is now being blamed for climate change , with researchers in Norway claiming that a grown moose can produce 2,100 kilos of carbon dioxide a year -- equivalent to the CO2 output resulting from a 13,000 kilometer car journey .
The Republican party has launched a major attack to portray the Democrats as against the Iraq war and caught in the grip of an extremist fringe that wants to pull out of the conflict .
In television ads , newspaper columns and television interviews Republican politicians and conservative commentators have branded Democrats as weak in the ' war on terror ' .
The move is paving the way for the vital November mid-term elections to be fought on national security with a bitter campaign echoing the 1968 presidential election fought against the background of the Vietnam war .
The shift in gear comes in the wake of last week 's stunning defeat of Democrat Joe Lieberman in a primary election for Lieberman 's Connecticut seat in the Senate .
A former vice - presidential candidate , Lieberman was a high - profile supporter of the invasion of Iraq .
But he was defeated by an anti-war candidate , Ned Lamont , sending shock waves through the Democratic party and prompting celebrations among anti-war Democrats .
Many in the party believe there is a powerful vote - winning argument in turning against the conflict .
It has seen a number of politicians , including Hillary Clinton , shift from supporting the war to being much more critical .
If the Democrats do well in November with an anti-war stance , it will probably define the party 's position on Iraq in the 2008 race for the White House .
But senior Republican strategists , including political guru Karl Rove , have long favoured fighting the November mid-term elections on the issues of terrorism and the war .
Polls consistently show that voters favour the Republicans on national security , even as the Iraq conflict appears to be collapsing into a civil war .
It will also allow Republicans to deflect Democratic criticisms over the economy , growing poverty and scandals ranging from lobbyist corruption to the lax response to Hurricane Katrina .
Republicans believe that focusing on terrorism and the war will allow them to keep control of Congress , despite a huge Democratic push and record disapproval levels of President George Bush .
Vice - president Dick Cheney arranged a rare conference call with journalists to push the new message that Democrats were anti-war .
'[ Terrorists are ] betting on the proposition that ultimately they can break the will of American people in terms of our ability to stay in the fight and complete the task , ' he said .
' Lieberman is the first casualty of the war against the war against terror , ' wrote columnist Michael Goodwin in the New York Daily News .
Lieberman 's main public support now is coming from Republicans such as Cheney , who have been quick to praise a man who has openly supported Bush on Iraq .
This mirrors the way top Democrats quickly abandoned Lieberman after his defeat .
Party leaders have now rushed to back Lamont .
But some in the anti-war wing of the party are still deeply suspicious of recent converts .
In particular , Clinton 's recent shifts of position on Iraq have not convinced many of her critics .
Jonathan Tasini , an anti-war Democrat running against Clinton for her New York Senate seat , criticised her shift as a ' quick makeover and cover - up act ' and attacked her previous support for the war .
' The war was wrong from the outset , should never have been fought and was an unnecessary waste of human life and valuable economic resources , ' he said .
He contrasted that with Clinton 's view , which officially is still that invading Iraq was justified but poorly carried out .
' Iraq was no threat to our country , ' Tasini said .
As the Democrats ' anti-war wing grows in power in the run-up to the November mid-term polls , so has the influence of the ' netroots ' , made up of leftwing activists and driven largely by organisation on the internet .
The movement had lobbied hard to support and raise money for Lamont 's bid and is generally anti-war and also supported a host of other anti-war candidates around the country .
However , far from being just a web - based phenomenon , it has also reflected a growing sentiment in America that the Iraq war has been a terrible mistake .
After all , the bloggers still had to persuade ordinary citizens to abandon Lieberman .
' The rank - and - file voters were the ones who put Lamont over the top , ' said Scott McLean , a political scientist at Connecticut 's Quinnipiac University .
The Republican attack machine is well practised in taking apart Democratic candidates based on their perceived weakness on defence .
They even managed to portray John Kerry , a decorated Vietnam veteran , as too soft on national security , despite the Democrats putting his war record at the centre of their campaign .
Many Republicans hope that the Democrats are repeating their miscalculations of the late 1960s and early 1970s , when many spoke out against Vietnam and were trounced by Richard Nixon .
' Democrats went down this road in the late 1960s with Vietnam and they are still carrying the baggage from that leftward turn , ' said John McIntyre , co-founder of the influential political website RealClearPolitics .

Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitisas Zuniga did a great job making DLC Chairman Harold Ford look weak on this morning 's Meet The Press .
Towards the end of the segment , Ford , perhaps sensing that Markos had the better of him , reverts to Republican talking points ( surprise ! ) :
FORD : I want to do nothing more than ensure that progressive causes and interests are advanced .
I want nothing more -- and I know you do as well - want Democrats to win ... We do nothing but help Mitt Romney , Fred Thompson , John McCain and Rudy Giuliani when we argue essentially over semantics ...
MOULITSAS : Will you stop going on FOXNews and attacking Harry Reid for abandoning the troops , betraying the troops ?
Because you just did that a couple of days ago ...
FORD : Markos , in all fairness , your site has posted awful things about Jewish Americans ...
MOULITSAS : That 's not true ...
FORD : Your site has ... now you have a site about ... something about Cindy Sheehan , she uses it as a ... she has a heavy presence there in talking about running against ....
MOULITSAS : It 's called " democracy . "
If you do n't like regular people , hundreds of thousands of people ... you 're gonna have ...
FORD : No , I love it ... but you ca n't be critical of us ...
MOULITSAS : Of course ... you 're not going to control hundreds of thousands of voices .
Your organization has a dozen people , you CAN control that message .
And you do n't need to attack Democrats .
Brief History of Crossword Puzzles
This is a puzzling world
George Eliot
Crossword puzzles are said to be the most popular and widespread word game in the world , yet have a short history .
The first crosswords appeared in England during the 19th century .
They were of an elementary kind , apparently derived from the word square , a group of words arranged so the letters read alike vertically and horizontally , and printed in children 's puzzle books and various periodicals .
In the United States , however , the puzzle developed into a serious adult pastime .
The first known published crossword puzzle was created by a journalist named Arthur Wynne from Liverpool , and he is usually credited as the inventor of the popular word game .
December 21 , 1913 was the date and it appeared in a Sunday newspaper , the New York World .
Wynne 's puzzle ( see below ) differed from today 's crosswords in that it was diamond shaped and contained no internal black squares .
During the early 1920's other newspapers picked up the newly discovered pastime and within a decade crossword puzzles were featured in almost all American newspapers .
It was in this period crosswords began to assume their familiar form .
Ten years after its rebirth in the States it crossed the Atlantic and re-conquered Europe .
The first appearance of a crossword in a British publication was in Pearson 's Magazine in February 1922 , and the first Times crossword appeared on February 1 1930 .
British puzzles quickly developed their own style , being considerably more difficult than the American variety .
In particular the cryptic crossword became established and rapidly gained popularity .
The generally considered governing rules for cryptic puzzles were laid down by A. F. Ritchie and D. S. Macnutt .
These people , gifted with the ability to see words puzzled together in given geometrical patterns and capable of twisting and turning words into word plays dancing on the wit of human minds , have since constructed millions of puzzles by hand and each of these puzzlers has developed personal styles known and loved by his fans .
These people have set the standard of what to expect from a quality crossword puzzle .

Judge Evan Wallach -- former JAG , renowned expert on the law of war , and designer of this web site on the subject -- provides a history lesson on the U.S. government 's treatment of waterboarding in today 's Washington Post :
The United States knows quite a bit about waterboarding .
The U.S. government -- whether acting alone before domestic courts , commissions and courts - martial or as part of the world community -- has not only condemned the use of water torture but has severely punished those who applied it .
. . .
We know that U.S. military tribunals and U.S. judges have examined certain types of water - based interrogation and found that they constituted torture .
That 's a lesson worth learning .
The study of law is , after all , largely the study of history .
The law of war is no different .
This history should be of value to those who seek to understand what the law is -- as well as what it ought to be .
Meanwhile , to anyone acquainted with the outré , turgidly cocksure , over - the - top personality type of the former Navy Seals , Special Ops - types , and other gung - ho para- militarists embodying the ranks of private militias wherever found , none of the extremes come as a surprise .
In fact , precisely because war is hell , one such type , Blackwater Worldwide founder and former Navy Seal Erik Prince , would like us to believe that his private , for - profit heavily - armed and equipped adjunct to the U.S. military , serves as a bulwark shielding the " civilized " of Iraq , namely : diplomats ; Iraqi or foreign government officials ; U.S. politicians ; and , of course , well - heeled disaster capitalists , from the unfettered mayhem and the senses numbing carnage reported in places like Baghdad and Fallujah .
Prince insists that we view the role of his Blackwater contingent in Iraq -- none of whom are constrained in their actions by the Uniform Code of Military Justice ; and each of whom enjoys complete immunity from Iraqi courts -- as a detachment designed to enable the 160,000 member U.S. force in Iraq to more adroitly damper down the insurgency and stabilize a nation of 27 million packed in an area roughly the size of California .
In its own way , Prince would further insist , Blackwater Worldwide is doing its part to help bring " freedom and democracy " ( author 's quotes ) to the volatile Middle East .
He 'd love us to believe that , by accepting dangerous security assignments -- protecting construction projects , ministries and oil fields ; escorting diplomatic convoys ; and serving in a wide range of additional life - threatening capacities in the harrowing mise en scene which is Bush - era Iraq , -- Blackwater , rather than a feckless siphon of more than a billion U.S. taxpayer dollars ( see graph ) , is in fact , an invaluable commodity that prevents the siphoning of needed U.S. soldiers from Iraq ’s urban war zones .
File photo shows Lyndon H. LaRouche , Jr. is making a speech in October , 2005 , in Washington , US .
Lyndon H. LaRouche , Jr. is an American political activist and founder of various political organizations in the United States and elsewhere .
He is perhaps best known for being a " perennial candidate " for U.S. Presidency , having set a minor record for most consecutive attempts at the office by running eight times ; Harold Stassen ran for President nine times , but not consecutively .
LaRouche has run for the Democratic nomination for President in every election year since 1980 , including in 1992 while he was in prison .
Yet he and his " LaRouche movement " have gained only limited electoral support , although he has received some support in Democratic presidential primaries .
Although he has no formal qualifications , LaRouche has written extensively on economic , scientific , political , and cultural topics .
Critics consider him to be a conspiracy theorist and political attention - seeker .
He is frequently described as an extremist , cult leader , a communist , a fascist , and an anti-Semite , all of which he denies .
LaRouche is regarded by his followers as a brilliant individual who for political reasons has been unfairly persecuted .
In 1988 LaRouche was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for conspiracy , mail fraud , and tax code violations .
He continued his political activities from behind bars .
He was released in 1994 on parole after having served five years .
LaRouche lists his formal position as a director and contributing editor of the Executive Intelligence Review News Service , a core part of the LaRouche movement .
Recently Yong Tang , People 's Daily Online Washington - based staff writer , has conducted an exclusive interview with LaRouche at his home in Virginia .
Yong Tang :
It is quite well know that you do n't like Wall Street .
Do you think we should use stocks ?
LaRouche : No , we should n't .
Or similar things .
We create something , like financial derivatives .
It 's a fantastic area .
It 's gambling .
Yong Tang : Does that mean Wall Street should be wiped out ?
LaRouche : Wall Street should be put into an insane asylum .
And let them play their games in an insane asylum where they wo n't affect the world .
Get them pieces of paper .
They can play their games every day .
But they 're locked in there , so they do n't affect the world outside .
It 's insane .
Yong Tang :
But the invention of stocks is an economic miracle .
LaRouche : ( Laughs )
Like the fellow who goes through a gambling casino .
Yong Tang : China is trying to learn from America in developing a better security exchanges system .
LaRouche : These people are gamblers , are thieves , they 're murderers .
These people are the ultimate criminals on this planet .
Yong Tang :
Are you a stock - holder yourself ?
Have you any bought any stocks ?
LaRouche : I did once , but it wo n't happen again .
Yong Tang :
You did it once , and you did n't win .
LaRouche :
That was the time when it was safe to do so .
Yong Tang :
So you are unhappy with the stock market .
LaRouche :
The stock market I can do without .
We do n't need it .
Yong Tang :
You do n't need the stock market !
LaRouche :
You do n't need a gambling hall .
Look at the United States .
it gives you an idea .
If you look at the United States you 'll find over the past period , especially the past quarter century , the spread of legalized gambling in the United States .
And state governments will come in and say , ``We have to have legalized gambling . ''
Legalized gambling !
As a source of income for the state .
Yong Tang :
Many people say gambling is a good idea , is n't it ?
LaRouche : [ Laughs ]
Yong Tang :
Have you ever been to Las Vegas ?
LaRouche : I 've been through there , but I did n't stay .
Yong Tang :
It 's very prosperous !
The State of Nevada makes a lot of money .
LaRouche :
If the food comes in to be eaten by the predator , the predator gets fat as long as the fools come in to be eaten .
So Las Vegas looks prosperous .
Who runs it ?
Gangsters .
They 're all gangsters .
Organized crime people .
Yong Tang : A lot of gamblers come from Asia , especially from China .
So they just get a lot of money from Asia , and from China .
LaRouche :
It 's a notorious Chinese disease , the gambling disease .
And any government in China has to be afraid of the gambling disease , because they 're afraid people get taken over by the gambling disease which can lead to a disaster for the nation .
And this is why there is a danger for China in the stock market .
Yong Tang :
But it 's the only way for remote places like Las Vegas or Nevada to be prosperous .
LaRouche :
But this is not good for the economy .
Look at the way this works .
I was down on a consulting job in 1957 in Cuba .
They had the Cuban Development Company .
The Pimento Bank had a proposal from the government , not the Castro government but the Batista government for financial development of the shoe industry .
So I went down there , as I was an expert in the area , one of my expertises , as a consultant to advise the bank on how to deal with this offer .
And we all knew that the Batista Government was finished .
So I said , yes , we should help the industry , but we should not let the Batista government steal the money .
Give them the assistance by credit , but do n't give them any money .
So I went down there and I stayed in the Hotel Nacional .
And the Hotel Nacional is actually a gambling casino run by Clark .
When Castro took over , Clark the gambling institution left Havana .
So what you 're seeing in Las Vegas is what left Havana .
It 's organized crime .
These people are thieves .
They 're murderers .
Real criminality .
Yong Tang :
Do you see how to reform the Wall Street system ?
LaRouche :
It 's very simple .
We , the United States , have a tradition , the constitutional system , We are a federal government system .
We are a federal system , under a presidential system .
You see , European governments are not real governments .
They are governments that are under the control of the so - called independent central banking systems .
The central banking system controls the government .
So the government is not really sovereign .
It is a parliamentary system under which the financiers and the bankers control the government through a central banking system .
In our system we are a national banking system under the Constitution .
We violate that with the Federal Reserve system .
But our Constitution , our institutions , are presidential .
So therefore , if we have a problem , as Roosevelt did , you look at Franklin Roosevelt 's government and what he did .
Roosevelt is a true American .
And what he did represents the American System .
Those who attack him are the enemies of the American System .
Whenever the people of the United States turn to their government and say ``Save us , '' if the government responds , we 're going to respond with a presidential system .
Under a presidential system , we will do what Roosevelt did , the kind of things he did .
The government will put things into bankruptcy , reorganize things , create credit , regulate things in order to make sure that things that are useful to the nation will prosper , and things that are not useful to the nation will not prosper .
So we make the laws accordingly .
So those things which are useful to the nation , which solve the problems of the nation , will be helped .
We will create the credit to help them .
Those things which are bad for the nation , we will destroy , simply by law .
We will make it difficult for them to function .
We will tax them , we will do various things , and they will not prosper .
Yong Tang :
How can you tax them ?
LaRouche :
We will have a prohibitive tax .
Our system is a system of regulation .
We are not a money system .
We are a physical economy system .
We use money as a medium of exchange , but we regulate the money .
We regulate the way it 's used .
Because we have a national purpose , which is the purpose of the benefit of our nation and our people .
And whenever a patriotic government gets into a crisis , as Roosevelt did , that 's what we do .
So , in the case of Wall Street , we do n't shut it down .
We allow it to function .
But we give it rules by which it functions .
And if it does n't obey the rules , it goes to jail .
If it obeys the rules , fine .
Almost like Chinese thinking .

Have you ever wondered why Coke comes with a smile ?
It ’s because it gets you high .
They took the cocaine out almost a hundred years ago .
You know why ?
It was redundant .
In The First 10 minutes : 10 teaspoons of sugar hit your system .
( 100 % of your recommended daily intake . )
You do n’t immediately vomit from the overwhelming sweetness because phosphoric acid cuts the flavor allowing you to keep it down .
20 minutes : Your blood sugar spikes , causing an insulin burst .
Your liver responds to this by turning any sugar it can get its hands on into fat .
( There ’s plenty of that at this particular moment )
40 minutes : Caffeine absorption is complete .
Your pupils dilate , your blood pressure rises , as a response your livers dumps more sugar into your bloodstream .
The adenosine receptors in your brain are now blocked preventing drowsiness .
45 minutes : Your body ups your dopamine production stimulating the pleasure centers of your brain .
This is physically the same way heroin works , by the way .
> 60 minutes :
The phosphoric acid binds calcium , magnesium and zinc in your lower intestine , providing a further boost in metabolism .
This is compounded by high doses of sugar and artificial sweeteners also increasing the urinary excretion of calcium .
> 60 Minutes :
The caffeine ’s diuretic properties come into play .
( It makes you have to pee . )
It is now assured that you ’ll evacuate the bonded calcium , magnesium and zinc that was headed to your bones as well as sodium , electrolyte and water .
> 60 minutes :
As the rave inside of you dies down you ’ll start to have a sugar crash .
You may become irritable and / or sluggish .
You ’ve also now , literally , pissed away all the water that was in the Coke .
But not before infusing it with valuable nutrients your body could have used for things like even having the ability to hydrate your system or build strong bones and teeth .
This will all be followed by a caffeine crash in the next few hours .
( As little as two if you ’re a smoker . )
But , hey , have another Coke , it ’ll make you feel better .

It 's amazing how much America changed after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy .
In a sense , the idealism , confidence , and optimism of the Democratic Party were assassinated as well .
And then the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King .
And then the assassination of Bobby Kennedy .
And then the assassination (? ) of Senator Paul Wellstone -- with the strategic Iraq flip / flop to the pugs in the Senate after his death .
And the anthrax in the mail that was sent only to high profile Democrats .
Clearly , whoever hates the FDR Democratic Party is willing to murder over and over again .
The impotent anthrax investigation might just as well have been conducted by dogs and cats and the JFK assassination was virtually demoted to a " conspiracy theory " ( the catch all Republican spin to cover their crimes ) .
But wait a minute !
You mean he WASN'T assassinated and all those Democrats DIDN 'T get anthrax in the mail ?
No , those are all conspiracy theories and Democrats just like to shoot and poison themselves .
And 9/11 ?
God knows .
How many desperately needed Democratic Presidential candidates are taking a pass because they simply want to stay alive a few more years ?
Organized crime politics knows that a dollop of terror works wonders to stifle a Congress , so who needs a majority if home grown terrorists are muzzling elected Democratic officials quite nicely ?
This does n't mean the elite hog trough is n't congested with both dems and pugs , but it does mean the dems may be given " offers they can't refuse " .
There 's not much more to be said about this since fear is not something you can explain away .
But have n't you noticed that post Senator Wellstone and anthrax , the Democratic Party abruptly became Republican light ?
Does n’t this plausibly mean “ they got the message ” ?
Let 's pray that our Constitutional Ship of State is n’t being sunk by murdering rats from hell .

* Illustration : Guy Billout * I did n't know I was a surveillance target until the day I walked into a hotel in China 's Fujian province .
I was pushing past half a dozen workmen changing lightbulbs in the glum but busy lobby when a uniformed man stepped in front of me .
Blue jacket , creased trousers , braided epaulets , peaked cap : government security officer .
Politely , he asked whether I would mind answering a few questions .
He stood erect , with the manicured swagger of a corporate CEO .
Next to him , a gangly plainclothes colleague gave me a so - you - thought - we - would n't - catch - you look .
How had they known I would be here ?
The only people who had my itinerary were my editors in London .
A few days earlier , I had sent them an email outlining my trip , and I 'd been updating them daily by phone .
I could only assume that the authorities had been monitoring my email and calls .
I had been chasing down leads on the whereabouts of Lai Changxing , China 's most - wanted man .
Lai had cheated the government out of $ 3.6 billion by smuggling oil , cars , and cigarettes .
Embarrassed , Beijing wanted to hinder any reporting of his case .

Try the international version of a Web site rather than the China - based one .
Google 's US - based search engine ( in Chinese ) is n't blocked , for example .
Watch your language
Avoid controversial terms ( e.g. , " democracy , " " Dalai Lama " ) , or at least do n't put them in the title of your blog post .
Body text is much less likely to be monitored .

The two officers in the hotel demanded to see my passport and asked what I knew about Lai .
Then they withdrew to a corner of the lobby to confer .
Eventually , they took me to a police car , drove me to the airport , and put me on a plane to Beijing .
It was , in short , impressive evidence of the government 's ability to monitor and control electronic communication .
And my experience only hinted at the Chinese government 's appetite for control .
Beijing has recently added a new weapon to its arsenal of surveillance technologies , a system it believes to be a modern marvel : the Golden Shield .
It took eight years and $ 700 million to build , and its mission is to " purify " the Internet — an apparently urgent task .
" Whether we can cope with the Internet is a matter that affects the development of socialist culture , the security of information , and the stability of the state , " President Hu Jintao said in January .
The Golden Shield — the latest addition to what is widely referred to as the Great Firewall of China — was supposed to monitor , filter , and block sensitive online content .
But only a year after completion , it already looks doomed to fail .
True , surveillance remains widespread , and outspoken dissidents are punished harshly .
But my experience as a correspondent in China for seven years suggests that the country 's stranglehold on the communications of its citizens is slipping : Bloggers and other Web sources are rapidly supplanting Communist - controlled news outlets .
Cyberprotests have managed to bring about an important constitutional change .
And ordinary Chinese citizens can circumvent the Great Firewall and evade other forms of police observation with surprising ease .
If they know how .
Like its namesake , the Great Firewall consists of hundreds of individual fortifications spread out along a vulnerable frontier .
At its core is a giant bank of computers and servers .
Traffic generated by China 's 162 million Internet users is routed through the shield , which checks all requested URLs against a blacklist of tens of thousands of Internet addresses .
The list includes pages offering political information deemed dangerous by the government , like BBC News and Voice of America .
Access to these sites is blocked ( at least in theory ) , and when users attempt to view one of them , they are punished with an involuntary time - out lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes .
Search engines are similarly restricted .
If you enter the characters for " democracy " or " Tiananmen Square massacre " into Google .cn you will generally get zero results .
This is a technological breakthrough for the Chinese government .
Until recently , it could not interfere with the inner workings of search engines and instead blocked entire sites , not just individual pages of a site .
The Golden Shield hardware — supplied by Cisco and other US companies — is supplemented by human censors who are paid about $ 170 a month .
They sit at screens in warehouse - like buildings run by the Public Security Bureau .
These foot soldiers in China 's information war monitor domestic news sites , erasing and editing politically sensitive stories .
Some sites provide the censors with access so the authorities can alter content directly .
Others get an email or a call when changes are required .
Similar methods are applied to blogs .
Sensitive entries are erased , and in the most egregious cases blogs are shut down altogether .
The censors also monitor email traffic , looking for politically sensitive content like calls for protest marches and anti-government tracts .
Because it would be impossible to screen millions of Internet users , they home in on watchlists of potentially suspicious emailers — known dissidents , suspicious foreigners — and notify investigators of possible violations .
Information spied online is collected in counties and major cities and matched up with other surveillance data .
In my case , the effectiveness of this technique was obvious .
Police minders always seemed to know where I was traveling and when I was back in Beijing .
Sometimes they 'd call as soon as I landed at the airport , telling me I had yet again broken the rules by traveling without permission or conducting interviews without authorization .
Evading them , however , was surprisingly easy .
I bought additional phone numbers , a tactic I picked up from Lai .
I also learned dozens of tricks to avoid arousing suspicion online .
But the cat - and - mouse game was unrelenting .
A year before my book on Lai was published , I told an official about it .
Maybe I mixed up my tenses , mistakenly suggesting I had already finished it .
" Yes , " the official said .
" I enjoyed the book . "
I was too stunned to ask how he might have got his hands on the still - incomplete manuscript .
But then , I did n't really have to :
When I had arrived at my office in Beijing one morning some eight weeks earlier , I had found the cables on my computer changed around .
The modem wire was rolled up in a coil , the power cable unplugged , and the printer attached to the wrong port .
It appeared someone had been poking around my hard drive .
When I lifted up the computer to fix the mess , I found a piece of paper .
On it was my office address , written in an unfamiliar scrawl .
Illustration : Guy BilloutFor all its ambition , the gears of the giant surveillance machine keep getting fouled with sand .
On one side of the Great Firewall , a small industry is sprouting up , dedicated to evading blocks and monitors .
Libertarian software engineers , enterprising students , banned religious groups , and regular for - profit companies compete with one another to launch new downloadable tools that outfox the censors .
They exploit proxy servers , deploy encryption technology , and ferret out holes in the wall .
I have spent many afternoons in the Internet cafés of Beijing 's Haidian University district , learning from the students who live in this world .
For a dollar an hour , they will help anyone hack the system : set up secure SSH and VPN connections , use a circumvention tool called UltraSurf developed by the banned Falun Gong group , access unregulated Chinese peer - to - peer networks .
Their techniques confirm John Gilmore 's adage : " The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it . "
From these students I learned that censorship is not only easy to subvert , but sometimes it subverts itself .
Each week , for example , Beijing 's propaganda department updates a list of banned stories .
Available to senior journalists at government - controlled news outlets , the list includes scandals , protests , and sackings across the country .
Newspapers are not allowed to report on them , but some journalists post the lists online , telling you all you need to know .
The system is self - defeating in other ways as well : Twelve national government bodies share responsibility for the Internet , and all of them have separate political and commercial interests .
In some cases , departmental budgets are financed through revenue from online businesses , so it 's often in their interests to loosen restrictions .
Furthermore , the Great Firewall is besieged by bureaucratic infighting and incompetence that results in exceptions and loopholes .
One day , I received an official summons from the Public Security Bureau , asking me to present myself at the national headquarters .
When I turned up , I saw hundreds of bikes covered in dust , as if their riders had gone into the building and never come out .
I was met by two uniformed officers who led me to a windowless room .
They came straight to the point :
Had I been in touch with Wang Dan , an exiled dissident living in Boston ?
Yes , I said .
I had exchanged emails with him — but had not yet published a story ( so how did they know ? ) .
Was I aware , they continued , of the rule requiring foreign journalists to ask for official permission to interview Chinese citizens ?
" Yes , " I said .
Then the conversation took an unexpected turn .
" There is a problem , " I told the officers .
" Wang Dan has become an American citizen . "
The officers were silent .
" In the future , " I said , " which government department should I ask for permission to email and interview him ? "
Confused and sheepish , they let me leave , and I found myself back by the dusty bikes .
So these were the bureaucrats guarding the mighty Great Firewall ?
Even police departments working in the same building were not talking to each other .
Otherwise they would have known that Wang Dan was in fact still carrying a Chinese passport , as I later found out .
Government attempts to suppress coverage of another persona non grata , Lai Changxing , were equally futile .
Although excised from the official state media , Lai was well - covered by dozens of Web sites .
Hunted by the government , he was cheered on anonymously online .
Bloggers compared him to the characters in All Men Are Brothers , a 12th - century book of tales about outlaws who outwit greedy , abusive officials .
" Lai is like an ancient bandit , " I read on a discussion board .
" He only takes from the rich . "
After almost two years underground , Lai eventually sought asylum in Canada .
Again , independent Web sites carried the news .
" Lai has a million - dollar home in Vancouver , " was the headline on one site .
At this point , newspapers gave up their silence and began to report on the Lai case , too .
New media was drawing away millions of readers , so newspaper owners lobbied censors and officials to give them more leeway to defend their commercial interests .
As Chinese citizens become aware that their most potent advantage over censorship is their sheer numbers , more and more grievances are aired online — sometimes with significant consequences .
The first cyber -rebellion to have a major political impact took place in 2003 .
Sun Zhigang , a young migrant worker in Guangzhou , died in police detention after failing to produce identity documents during a street check .
Sun 's friends protested his death on discussion boards , and soon other sites picked up a campaign demanding police accountability and reform of the laws affecting migrant workers .
Before the unprepared system monitors could react , an avalanche was in motion .
Tens of thousands of Chinese became involved in a national conversation , despite the risk of punishment .
Emboldened , the mainstream media jumped in and reported the Sun case .
The government opted not to crack down on these violations , rightly sensing that doing so would have been more politically costly then letting the debate run its course .
A few months later , Prime Minister Wen Jiabao abolished the law requiring China 's 120 million migrants to have special identity papers .
( Singapore , with just 2.4 million regular Internet users and very deep pockets , might have a chance at quelling Internet - fueled popular revolts .
But China comprises a fifth of humanity .
Any attempt to impose iron - fisted control over a network this big seems certain to trigger economic paralysis . )
Since the Sun case , dissent has regularly roiled the Internet in China .
Last year , 13 retired senior officials , including Chairman Mao's former secretary , protested a decision to close down a liberal weekly .
In a joint letter published online , they wrote that the government suffered from the " delusion that it can keep the public locked in ignorance . "
The weekly was reopened .
This year , the pace of protests has increased .
In March , the government provoked an outcry online by banning eight controversial books .
Their authors published petitions — widely emailed and blogged — criticizing Long Xinmin , the chief censor .
Within a few weeks their books were returned to shop shelves , an unprecedented move .
Long defended the necessity of censorship , saying , " Advanced network technologies such as blogging and webcasting have been mounting new challenges to the government 's ability to supervise the Internet . "
A month later , Long was fired .
Hu Fayun , one of the eight temporarily banned authors , told The Times of London : " The traditional no - talk ' style of control by the government has been broken by the Internet .
Different voices can be found there . "
Why can't the government block coverage of Lai and other sensitive subjects ?
Besides the seemingly insurmountable technical challenges , one important answer is this : online business .
Rigorously policing encryption technology would undermine ecommerce , which is vitally important to the government 's crusade to lift the economy .
If all encrypted credit card details and other sensitive corporate information had to pass through surveillance bottlenecks , whole sections of the economy would be harmed .
When forced to choose , the government seems to trust that raising incomes is a better way of securing power than spying on dissidents .
Of course , China is hardly a Jeffersonian paradise .
Thousands languish in prison because of harmless online activities .
A recent example is Zhang Jianhong — blogging as Li Hong — who was sentenced to six years for posting political essays .
Cases like his justify strong criticism of China .
But they do n't prove that its monitoring system is successful on a national scale .
Furthermore , the government is increasingly relying on physical rather than electronic surveillance .
Internet cafs are now required to write down the ID numbers of all users so police can track them down no matter how clever their online disguises .
But again , there are physical limits .
Police cannot chase after millions of Internet caf &233 ; visitors .
Today , anyone in China can send a sensitive message if they are minimally savvy , and that fact is transforming the political discourse .
True , technology has not led to the overthrow of the Communist Party , as some had predicted — the party has even harnessed the Internet for its own purposes .
But this does not mean that Beijing has insulated itself against political change driven by technology .
Its critics have unfettered access to mass communications , and the Internet — not the Communist Party — is the main influence on public opinion .
No shield , golden or otherwise , can protect them from the public .
China 's leaders should know this .
Their predecessors built the Great Wall of China to keep out Mongol invaders .
It proved as useful as every other fixed fortification in history , and the Mongols still invaded Beijing and overthrew the political elite .

Sk0t , an ex-administrator of the EliteTorrents BitTorrent tracker is to have his internet connection forcibly monitored by the US Government .
If that was n't bad enough , the monitoring software is Windows based - which means he is being forced to ditch GNU / Linux - or face being barred from the internet .
Scott McCausland ( sk0t ) , the ex-administrator of the EliteTorrents BitTorrent tracker is n’t having much luck lately .
Back in September 2006 , he pleaded guilty to two charges – ‘ conspiracy to commit copyright infringement ’ and ‘ criminal copyright infringement ’ .
Both charges relate to him uploading ‘ Star Wars : Episode III ’ onto the internet hours before the theatrical release , earning him 5 months in jail and 5 months home confinement .
Sk0t has now been released from jail but this does n’t mean that everything is back to normal .
Back on 17 July , sk0t had to see his Probation Officer for the first time and two days later he had to have a special ankle bracelet attached .
This monitoring device is there to enforce the terms of his release : Monday to Friday 08:30 to 21:00 he is free to do as he pleases .
Weekends are more restrictive – freedom is allocated between 08:30 to 17:00 .
The one good thing about this device is that it will be removed before Christmas ( Dec 19th ) .
According to a post on his blog , following another meeting with his Probation Officer , it seems sk0t is having more trouble :
So , I am getting shafted by the Justice Department again … ”
sk0t was informed by his Probation Officer that he has to have special software installed on his PC so that the government can monitor his online activities .
However , what is a more bitter pill to swallow for him is that the monitoring software is Windows only and as sk0t is an Ubuntu user , the Justice Department is forcing him to switch operating systems .
I had a meeting with my probation officer today , and he told me that he has to install monitoring software onto my PC .
No big deal to me , that is part of my sentence .
However , their software doesnt support GNU / Linux ( Which is what I use ) .
So , he told me that if I want to use a computer , I would have to use an OS that the software can be installed on .
Sk0t is left with a tough choice .
Give in to the evils of the monitoring software , format his hard drive and install Windows – or be barred from using a PC completely .
Sk0t told TorrentFreak : “ I think that this whole situation is just one more way that they can impose their will onto me .
I have contacted my attorney , and we are going to fight this .
It is n’t the fact that I have to be monitored that bothers me , it is the fact that I have restructure my life ( different OS , different software on that OS ) and that they would require ( force ) me to purchase software while I a currently unemployed and relatively unemployable with the 2 felonies that they gave me .
It is just a ridiculous situation .
Why should I conform to them when I am consenting to the software … they should have software that conforms to me . ”
Unfortunately , thanks to the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act , some BitTorrent users are considered criminals these days , which means these unusual measures can be forced upon them .
In a society where ‘ the punishment should fit the crime ’ , you ca n’t help but think that somewhere along the line there ’s been a big miscalculation when regular citizens are turned into criminals for sharing files .
The mansion of Mukesh Ambani , the richest man in India , is something more than the average dream house .
When construction is completed next year , his home will top 570 feet – the equivalent of a 60 - story skyscraper – and include a helipad , six floors of parking , and 600 servants for a family of six .
Rising from a Bombay ( Mumbai ) neighborhood where rents run at $ 2,000 per square foot , the home is a monument to the enormous wealth generated by India 's stock market – and how it has created a class of Indian superrich .
Since February 2007 , the value of India 's stock market has doubled to 20000 points , and the biggest winners have been India 's richest .
Based on these gains , India 's four wealthiest men are now worth more than China 's 40 wealthiest combined .
It is , in part , a quirk of South Asian business practices , where even the largest multinationals remain family - run enterprises with almost all their wealth and authority residing in one man .
Yet some critics say it is also the result of India 's inequitable investing laws , which are forcing small investors to the fringes .
As the stock market becomes a part of Indian cultural parlance , more investors further down the economic chain are finding ways to get involved .
Yet the top - heavy distribution of India 's stock - market billions is further amplifying the extremes of rich and poor in a country where an estimated 400 million people – more than the population of the United States – live on less than $ 1 a day .
" Most of the money in the market is still principally owned by the rich and by institutional investors , " says Chris Butel , chairman of Invest India Market Solutions ( IIMS ) , a research firm that has studied Indian investment patterns .
The result , he and others say , is that a very small number of people are accumulating fantastic wealth almost overnight .
Mr. Ambani's fortune , estimated at $ 49 billion by Forbes , is built largely on the success of the stock of his company , Reliance Industries Ltd. , which runs oil rigs and supermarkets , among other things .
Last year , when stocks hit 10000 , his wealth was one - quarter of its current total .
Likewise , the initial public offering ( IPO ) of Indian real estate developer DLF Enterprises earlier this year instantly made owner Kushal Pal Singh the world 's richest property entrepreneur .
Forbes puts his wealth at $ 35 billion .
The small club of India 's superrich
All told , India 's 40 wealthiest businessmen are worth $ 351 billion , according to Forbes – easily the most in Asia .
Its four richest – steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal , Ambani , his brother Anil Ambani , and Mr. Singh – hold more than half that sum .
It is partly the legacy of out - of - date laws governing stock offerings , says Prithvi Haldea , founder of Prime Database , a Mumbai - based market - research firm .
When going public , India 's largest companies need to make only 10 percent of their stock available to the public .
Other Asian neighbors , such as Thailand and Malaysia , usually force a company to make available 25 to 40 percent of its stock .
News reports published in June suggest that at that time , company owners held 57 percent of the shares in India 's largest stock market , the Bombay Stock Exchange , known as Sensex .
Domestic and foreign companies accounted for a further 30 percent , leaving the remaining scraps for small , retail investors .
That , in turn , has stunted the growth of the stock market among India 's middle classes , says Mr. Haldea .
Only 2 percent of Indians own stocks
It is a blow to attempts to spread the wealth being generated by India 's economic boom more equitably .
Shares for the top 30 companies listed on Sensex gained $ 219 billion from January through November .
By contrast , shares for the top 30 companies listed on Wall Street accumulated only $ 84 billion .
Yet only 3 million Indians – from a working - age population of 321 million – hold stocks .
A further 3.5 million hold stocks through mutual funds .
The numbers are small , and the money invested is also modest , says Mr. Butel of IIMS .
Nevertheless , there is evidence of a gradual expansion .
The growth of the Indian economy is pushing more households past the threshold where they have enough cash to invest .
And the stories of Sensex riches are overcoming Indians ' traditional fiscal caution .
Sensex is a notoriously volatile index .
Despite its upward trend , there have been dips , including Monday 's 4 percent dip – the largest in four months .
" This is the heart of the Indian story , " says Anu Madgazkar , an economic analyst in the Mumbai office of McKinsey and Company , a global consulting firm .
" We do see this trend line going up dramatically . "
There are currently 4 million households that make more than $ 10,000 a year – one marker of fitness for investing , she says .
In the next five years , that number is expected to more than triple .
IPO expert Haldea sees pent - up demand in the fact that the listing of Reliance Petroleum elicited 1.9 million applications for shares – the highest number in five years .
Such interest is no surprise to Pradeep Moule , office manager for the Vijay Kumar Stock Market Classes in Pune .
" The share market used to be back page news until a few years ago , " he says , sipping ginger tea in his office .
" Now , it 's front page news . "
He offers a two - week training program to make people Sensex - literate and he is seeing new interest in new places .
Statistics suggest that investors are predominately from India 's six largest cities ; growing numbers of people from smaller cities now have the money but are ignorant of the way the market works .
" A few years ago , the popular perception was that this was only for the highly educated , financially savvy , English - speaking elite , " says Mr. Moule .
" That perception is now rapidly changing . "
Firefighters discovered the curtain fire was caused by a crystal ball
Firefighters said the crystal ball on the windowsill had refracted sunlight on to the curtains , starting the blaze .
The woman returned to her home in Poole , Dorset , at 1400 BST to discover the fire .
Watch manager Dave Cooper , of Dorset Fire and Rescue Service , said : " The conditions were just right with a low , strong October sun . "
He added : " It was a most unusual incident .
" The glass ball had literally refracted the light and set fire to the curtains .
" The lady was understandably quite shocked and called us straight away and then stayed out of the house .
" She asked us to take away the offending article - which we did of course , so it would n't upset her . "
Scala seems to be getting a lot of publicity lately .
I ’m glad for that , because the more I learn about it , the more I realize that it ’s a really great language and needs more attention .
Some other bloggers have already written introductory articles and talked about various aspects of Scala , but maybe I ’ll have something to add .
I ’m planning on using Scala alongside Java in personal projects , but at the moment I ’m just learning and experimenting , writing short pieces of code to try out the various language features .
Coming from Java programming , even after learning the basics and perhaps some of the advanced concepts of Scala , one can run into some really surprising compiler error messages because of the way Scala works .
I ran into one of these issues and thought this would be an interesting way to illustrate some features of Scala .
Note : for clarity , I ’m using type annotations in this blog entry where I would normally leave them out .
After executing the following code , it ’s natural to expect that i will have the value 13 , as we ’re used to in Java , C++ and other languages :
var i : Int = 1
i += 10 + 2
In Scala , the above code will actually produce a compiler error :
error : type mismatch ;
found : Int ( 2 )
required : String
My first reaction : what the hell ?
There ’s nothing to do with String s here , there are only Int s!
It ’s easy to get sidetracked looking for the wrong answers if this kind of error happens in some larger context with type inference involved .
But this comes from still thinking in Java or C++ mode , seeing operators and assignment operators .
Lets switch to the Scala mode of thinking , and try follow what the compiler does with this code , if not exactly .
Firstly , operator precedence in Scala is defined by the first character of the operator name , so += and + actually have the same precedence .
The exact rules can be looked up in ScalaReference.pdf or other documentation .
So from left to right , += is applied first .
And since operators in Scala are actually methods of the operands , this translates to
( i.+=( 10 ) ) .+( 2 )
Now we are already starting to see part of the problem — the parentheses ended up not where we wanted , so in this case , we actually need to use explicit parentheses in Scala , while we would not in many other languages : i += ( 10 + 2 ) , which expands to i.+=( 10 .+( 2 ) ) .
Well , that was quick , we have solved the problem !
But the original error about requiring String is still a mystery .
Lets continue until we get to the bottom of this .
As said above , operators in Scala are methods , but of course the assignment operator = is an exception — otherwise you could n’t assign anything to a new variable .
Operators ending with = are treated specially as well — they are “ expanded to assignments if no other interpretation is valid ” ( as quoted from ScalaReference.pdf ) .
If the left operand has the method += , then that method is called , otherwise l += r will be expanded to l = l + r ( actually it ’s a bit more complex , but for simplicity lets assume that this is the only rule ) .
For the Int class , the method += does not exists , so i.+=( 10 ) is expanded to i = i.+( 10 ) .
The full expression is now : ( i = i .+( 10 ) ) .+( 2 )
Lets assume that the first part of the expression — including the assignment — is correct ( it is ) .
So now we are left with trying to add 2 to the result of the assignment .
Assignments in Scala return the value ( ) of type Unit — which is analogous to Java ’s void .
So the rest of the problem lies in this simplified expression :
( ) .+( 2 )
The Unit type does n’t have a + method , and this causes the compiler to look at implicit conversions to other types that do define this method .
That ’s right !
Scala lets you define your own implicit conversions between types .
And more interestingly : they are scoped .
Some of these conversions are already defined in the Predef object .
All members of Predef are implicitly imported into every Scala source file , so the conversions defined there are always in scope .
On with our example : since Unit ( as all other types in Scala ) is a subtype of Any , the compiler finds the only usable implicit conversion to a type with a + method :
implicit def any 2stringadd( x : Any ) = new runtime .
StringAdd(x )
Finally we are seeing something about String !
What this line does is define a conversion method that converts from Any ( and its subtypes ) to StringAdd .
A call to this method can be inserted implicitly by the compiler where a StringAdd is needed , but an object of another type is given .
The method name is arbitrary , but naming it like this is a convention .
Lets look at the StringAdd class :
final class StringAdd( self : Any ) {
def +( other : String ) = self .
toString + other
}
This class takes
Any as a parameter and defines a method + that converts the class parameter to a String using the toString method and then concatenates it with the argument .
Together with the implicit conversion , this effectively adds a String concatenation method to every type , making it easier to write expressions like this :
var s : String = 1 + " minute "
Instead of the somewhat silly looking things you can do in Java :
String s = " " + 1 + " minute " ; // or String s = String.valueOf( 1 ) + " minute " ; // or , for those who still refuse to believe that the javac compiler actually does optimize string concatenation to the same as below : String s = new StringBuilder ( ) .
append ( 1) .append ( " minute " ) .
toString ( ) ;
Update : I was wrong about this — 1 + " minute " does work in Java as well , as szeiger pointed out in the comments .
Back to Scala … the compiler will insert the implicit conversion , expanding 1 + " minute " to any 2stringadd ( 1 ) .+ ( " minute " ) , and if we inline that method for illustrative purposes ( as far as I know the compiler does n’t actually do this ) , we get new StringAdd ( 1 ) .+ ( " minute " ) .
Similarly , our problematic expression becomes :
new StringAdd ( ( ) ) .+( 2 )
And finally the reason for the original error is visible to us !
We are trying to pass an Int to a method that takes String as an argument .
Fully expanded , the original code looks like this :
new StringAdd( i = i.+( 10 ) ) .+( 2 )
While this is what we intended :
i = i.+( 10 .+( 2 ) )
So , there are definitely some surprising differences when starting to use Scala , but I am not seeing these as problems most of the time — just differences caused by awesome ( and occasionally less awesome ) design decisions .
Certainly differences that need getting used to , but I think it will be worth it .
P.S. This issue was actually brought up in the Scala users mailing list today , but I had n’t read it when I wrote this post .
It turns out that it ’s already recorded in the Scala issue tracker as ticket # 92 .
Personally , I do n’t have a strong opinion on whether this should be fixed or not , but if you do , you could leave comment on that issue ( you must register first , though ) .
There are many deadly lies and deceptions in America today , but one of the deadliest is that the " Bush Regime is over . "
The torture , the wars , the spying and theocratic measures and the toxic waves of bigotry -- against Black people today , gays tomorrow , immigrants or women or dissenting professors the day after - - is n't " limping to the finish " ... it is intensifying .
The crimes committed in our name pile up each and every day .
The planning at the very highest levels -- to sustain the war in Iraq , to very possibly launch a new one against Iran , to hammer in and further legitimize the revocation of the most fundamental rights -- not only continues , but accelerates .
The casting aside of high - level operatives like Rove or Gonzales is not the dissolution of a regime , but preparation for a " sprint to the finish . "
Bush himself is reported to be impervious to criticism , " optimistic , " and acting with his " historic legacy " in mind .
That " legacy " is not something for the history books , after we 're all dead .
It 's about locking in and pushing further the horrific crimes that have become " the new normalcy " of this imperialist system .
It 's about what we 're willing to -- and going to be forced to -- live with ; and what we 're willing to see other people live -- and die -- with .
And that 's what will happen if the tens of millions who hate this regime and what it 's been doing continue on the current passive -- and , yes , complicit -- course .
George Bush aims to use his last 16 months in office to do everything he can to ensure the continued existence and dominance of this empire , on even more horrific terms and with exponentially greater ability to suffocate any fundamental resistance to it .
The Bush Regime must be driven out .
For unless it is decisively repudiated by the people , in massive visible political opposition , the outrages of today will indeed become the norms of tomorrow , with terrible consequences .
There Are the People to Do This
I have had the chance to talk to more people than most -- traveling the country and speaking especially to young people on campuses -- and there is a battle going on among tens of thousands of people .
Giving voice to something I have heard repeatedly before , a young woman at NYU explained to me that if she led a walkout against the war she would risk her scholarship , have to go to a community college and work at the same time , and would never have the career that there is so much pressure to compete for in this increasingly insecure world ... and then she added , " But I would do it in a second .
I would risk all that and more -- if I thought it would make a difference . "
And there are people , increasing numbers of people , who want to hear about revolution -- why it 's needed , what it 's all about , and whether it 's possible .
And how does what we are doing today relate to that .
Three weeks ago in San Francisco , I watched the crowd at Rock the Bells go fucking wild when performers from the stage called for resistance and sacrifice to stop this machine and its fascist drive .
Screaming , jumping , fists in the air .
There is a radicalness brewing in this country .
There 's a section of this generation that is looking out on the world and sees nothing good and nothing they want to have any part of .
A section of this generation that is ready to struggle and to question , that senses the need to be as radical as the times , that gravitates to the need for struggle and even great sacrifice to stop this whole direction .
But somebody 's got to step out and DO IT .
World Can't Wait -- Drive
Out the Bush Regime has called for an " Orange Uprising . "
Stop keeping your discontent and your anguish private .
There are millions and tens of millions who share it -- become a magnet for them , every day .
Be part of setting a different social context where other people who , like yourself , feel -- and right now , are -- isolated , begin to see that there are others .
Declare it loudly and boldly by brandishing orange , the color of the torture victims and the color of those who refuse to bow down .
Wearing orange has to become a declaration of refusal to sit quietly as the world is burning around us .
It has to be a challenge to all those who do in fact already agree but are not yet resisting , giving them the heart and the courage to not only step out against the regime but to go up in the face of those who are still going along , and to insist that they not allow these crimes to be done in their names .
A sea of orange , to revoke the legitimacy of anyone -- from the Bush regime to the " opposition " party Democrats -- who claim to be acting with a mandate from the people ; a sea of orange to confer legitimacy on those determined to drive out this regime , and to encourage and galvanize the massive disgust and refusal to accept its crimes .
Orange must become the color of defiance .
People have to begin noticing all the orange , and asking each other what it 's about , and then become part of it catching on and becoming a social wave .
It must be promoted by popular artists , advertised on the airwaves and internet , and in the actions of individuals and groups that take on these horrors .
The news should feel compelled to regularly report on " orangeclad protesters " sitting down in major intersections or in politicians ' offices and orange flags turning up in the most unexpected places .
At the World Ca n't Wait website there are all kinds of ideas on how this can go viral , and all kinds of things ready to happen -- if people act .
This sea of orange must be coupled with , and reinforce , increasingly militant and growing outbreaks of real political resistance -- actions of individuals or groupings that keep pace with and are on a scale commensurate with the horrors piling up .
Some of that 's starting .
But it 's not yet enough .
We 've got to stop waiting for a resistance to emerge , and go out and lead it .
If we want to see a resistance movement , people need to start being one .
Resistance needs to much more spring up like mushrooms after the rain , in all kinds of different forms and unexpected places , and everybody wearing orange can help spur that and spread it .
Four Crucial Political Battles
Four political battles are shaping up now that are crucial .
If seized upon , and if coupled with the growing social wave of orange envisioned above and with the kinds of resistance I just outlined , these can be openings to make things more twosided , to bring another force onto the stage that can give expression to people 's pent - up aspirations , and to reverse the political momentum and direction in this society .
First , there is the extremely high - stakes Jim Crow trial down in Jena , Louisiana where six Black high school students face decades in prison for standing up against nooses being hung from a " whites only " tree in their schoolyard .
The actions being planned for September 12 and especially September 20 have everything to do with whether anything meaningful will be done to stop the whole direction of this society against Black people -- and with the Bush regime , the definite genocidal element of this agenda has found sharp expression , as became sharply clear with Hurricane Katrina .
Shortly after that , on September 25 , George Bush is daring to come to New York City to speak to the United Nations as part of greasing the way towards a new war against Iran .
The eyes of the world look upon New York City and the city must appear to them as what it is -- one of the most antiwar and antiBush places in the country , not like people who can't be bothered to do anything as massive death , suffering and torture is being engineered .
They also must not see simply an isolated , routinized protest .
The city needs to be ORANGE -- everywhere the eye looks and everywhere a news camera pans , on armbands and ribbons , on flags out store windows , on banners on rooftops and clenched in the fists that get raised in opposition to Bush 's monstrosities right outside where he speaks .
In the week of October 22 - 26 , David Horowitz 's fascist student group " Students for Academic Freedom , " has announced a week against " Islamo - fascism " to take place on over 200 campuses .
Horowitz is a close ally of Bush and intends for this week to target Muslim student associations , women 's centers , and more for not being sufficiently supportive of the " war on terror . "
This has the potential to even more seriously chill what is already an icy atmosphere on campus .
But it also has the potential -- if it is met with orange - clad students and faculty ready to take them on and increase awareness of the fascist order being locked into place here -- to actually turn the tables on these bullies .
Finally , on October 22 , there will be a national day of protest against police brutality .
This too can bring thousands more into political action against yet another horror of this system , and powerfully stand against outrages like the murder of Sean Bell in New York last December , on his wedding day .
Each of these must be very powerful in their own right ; and they must also be times when the " orange upsurge " gets further launched into society .
A Different Political Calculus
If this movement of wearing orange takes hold , and people increasingly see that they are not alone and there 's an everyday defiance that takes hold in the culture and finds expression in all kinds of ways ... if these important days of resistance and action this fall break into the atmosphere in a way that cannot be denied or marginalized ... and with all that taking place in the face of the Bush regime 's high - stakes horrific gambles in Iran , their grinding bloody war in Iraq , and who knows what new measure within the U.S. , as Bush sets out to cement his " legacy " ... then there is a chance for a different sort of political calculus to take hold .
A chance for a serious challenge to the legitimacy of this regime and to create a political situation in which it is driven out .
The synergy between a growing social movement of defiance in the everyday action of wearing orange , and increasingly broad and determined outpourings of resistance , can create something on a whole other level ... in other words , in the political sphere the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts .
And let 's imagine what that would mean .
A victory like that would change things for millions of people and it would open up new possibilities in everybody 's thinking .
People would feel their strength and they would raise their heads .
The question of the imperialist character of the kind of system that gives rise to a Bush - - and to political " opponents " who refuse to question his basic assumptions -- would get posed in a different way , to millions .
The question of what to do about it -- of what kind of future people do need -- including the possibility of revolution , would become a much more living thing .
And the Bush regime and all its horrors and the course it has set things on would be repudiated .
The wars , the torture , the attacks on women 's rights , everything symbolized by Katrina , the gay - bashing , the repression and demonization of the immigrants , the outrages to people 's legal rights , the attack on critical thinking ... repudiated .
And would n't that be a new day worth fighting , and sacrificing , for ?

Vanessa Hudgens Settles Lawsuit - Pays Up
and her former lawyer , , were at odds over $ 150,000 that she owed the barrister for services rendered to the celebrity .
A judge sided with the attorney and Hudgens has settled up .
The actress entered into a contract with the attorney back in 2005 and agreed to pay him 5 % of the earnings she received from several projects that they had undertaken together .
According to the lawyer , she made $ 5 million on those projects .
Somewhere along the way , Hudgens decided Schall was n't meeting her needs so she fired him .
This occurred long before he could be fully compensated , per the terms of the agreement .
Apparently all of that is behind the young star now .
Her legal team tried to get the lawsuit dropped on the grounds that she was only 16 years old when she entered into the agreement .
The judge nixed that idea .
Hudgens received some good news along with the bad .
The High School Musical feature film has been confirmed .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Small , rocky planets that could resemble the Earth or Mars may be forming around a star in the Pleiades star cluster , astronomers reported on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
One of the stars in the cluster , also known as the Seven Sisters , is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles that could be the “ building blocks of planets ” said Inseok Song , a staff scientist at NASA ’s Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology .
“ This is the first clear evidence for planet formation in the Pleiades , and the results we are presenting may well be the first observational evidence that terrestrial planets like those in our solar system are quite common , ” said Joseph Rhee of the University of California Los Angeles , who led the study .
There is “ hundreds of thousands of times as much dust as around our sun , ” said Benjamin Zuckerman , a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy .
“ The dust must be the debris from a monster collision , a cosmic catastrophe . ”
The team used two telescopes to spot the dust , and report their findings in Astrophysical Journal .
Located about 400 light years away in the constellation of Taurus , the Pleiades is one of the best known star clusters and among the closest to Earth .
A light - year is the distance light travels in a year , about 5.8 trillion miles .
“ The cluster actually contains some 1,400 stars , ” said Song .
Song said the dust can accumulate into comets and small asteroid - size bodies , and then clump together to form planetary embryos , and finally full - fledged planets .
“ In the process of creating rocky , terrestrial planets , some objects collide and grow into planets , while others shatter into dust ; we are seeing that dust , ” Song said .
“ Our observations indicate that terrestrial planets similar to those in our solar system are probably quite common , ” Zuckerman added .
Researchers have observed about 200 planets around stars outside our solar system but none are as small as Earth and just one , spotted earlier this year , appears potentially capable of supporting life .
Admittedly , the society had a tough task : restoring an old gospel that was lying in a box of its own crumbs .
It had been looted from an Egyptian tomb in the 1970s and languished on the underground antiquities market for decades , even spending time in someone ’s freezer .
So it is truly incredible that the society could resurrect any part of it , let alone piece together about 85 percent of it .
That said , I think the big problem is that National Geographic wanted an exclusive .
So it required its scholars to sign nondisclosure statements , to not discuss the text with other experts before publication .
The best scholarship is done when life - sized photos of each page of a new manuscript are published before a translation , allowing experts worldwide to share information as they independently work through the text .
Another difficulty is that when National Geographic published its transcription , the facsimiles of the original manuscript it made public were reduced by 56 percent , making them fairly useless for academic work .
Without life - size copies , we are the blind leading the blind .
The situation reminds me of the deadlock that held scholarship back on the Dead Sea Scrolls decades ago .
When manuscripts are hoarded by a few , it results in errors and monopoly interpretations that are very hard to overturn even after they are proved wrong .
To avoid this , the Society of Biblical Literature passed a resolution in 1991 holding that , if the condition of the written manuscript requires that access be restricted , a facsimile reproduction should be the first order of business .
It ’s a shame that National Geographic , and its group of scholars , did not follow this sensible injunction .
I have wondered why so many scholars and writers have been inspired by the National Geographic version of the Gospel of Judas .
I think it may stem from an understandable desire to reform the relationship between Jews and Christians .
Judas is a frightening character .
For Christians , he is the one who had it all and yet betrayed God to his death for a few coins .
For Jews , he is the man whose story was used by Christians to persecute them for centuries .
Although we should continue to work toward a reconciliation of this ancient schism , manufacturing a hero Judas is not the answer .

The Pope has ordered his bishops to set up exorcism squads to tackle the rise of Satanism .
Vatican chiefs are concerned at what they see as an increased interest in the occult .
They have introduced courses for priests to combat what they call the most extreme form of " Godlessness . "
Each bishop is to be told to have in his diocese a number of priests trained to fight demonic possession .
The initiative was revealed by 82 - year - old Father Gabriele Amorth , the Vatican " exorcistinchief , " to the online Catholic news service Petrus .
" Thanks be to God , we have a Pope who has decided to fight the Devil head - on , " he said .
" Too many bishops are not taking this seriously and are not delegating their priests in the fight against the Devil .
You have to hunt high and low for a properly trained exorcist .
" Thankfully , Benedict XVI believes in the existence and danger of evil - going back to the time he was in charge of the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . "
The CDF is the oldest Vatican department and was headed by Benedict from 1982 , when he was Cardinal Ratzinger , until he became Pope in 2005 .
Father Amorth said that during his time at the department Benedict had not lost the chance to warn humanity of the risk from the Devil .
He said the Pope wants to restore a prayer seen as protection against evil that was traditionally recited at the end of Catholic Masses .
The prayer , to St Michael the Archangel , was dropped in the 1960s by Pope John XXIII .
Scroll down for more ...
" The prayer is useful not only for priests but also for lay people in helping to fight demons , " he said .
Father Paolo Scarafoni , who lectures on the Vatican 's exorcism course , said interest in Satanism and the occult has grown as people lost faith with the church .
He added : " People suffer and think that turning to the Devil can help solve their problems .
We are being bombarded by requests for exorcisms . "
The Vatican is particularly concerned that young people are being exposed to the influence of Satanic sects through rock music and the Internet .
In theory , under the Catholic Church 's Canon Law 1172 , all priests can perform exorcisms .
But in reality only a select few are assigned the task .
Under the law , practitioners must have " piety , knowledge , prudence , and integrity of life . "
The rite of exorcism involves a series of gestures and prayers to invoke the power of God and stop the " demon " influencing its victim .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A sticky molecule previously linked to inflammation also helps seal vital insulation around peripheral nerves , making it a potential target for new drugs against nerve disorders , scientists said on Thursday .

The sticky molecule previously linked to inflammation also helps seal vital insulation around peripheral nerves , making it a potential target for new drugs against nerve disorders , scientists said on Thursday .
REUTERS / science
The latest research suggests the molecule , known as JAM-C , could be a key player in regulating the way nerves work .
In genetically modified mice without the adhesion molecule , the myelin insulation sheath protecting nerves deteriorates and the animals experience faulty nerve firing , muscle weakness and a shortened stride , researchers reported in the journal Science .
The team also found that nerves of patients with certain peripheral nerve disorders had defective JAM-C .
Taken together , the findings suggest the molecule is a key player in regulating the structure and function of peripheral nerves and its malfunction may cause a number of illnesses .
JAM-C , which was discovered only recently , is already being studied as a target for new medicines involved in inflammation and as a possible route to fight cancer , since it seems to help tumors form new blood vessels .
“ This finding opens up yet another area that this molecule should be investigated in -- but it ’s very early days , ” Sussan Nourshargh , professor of microvascular pharmacology at Barts and The London School of Medicine , said in an interview .
Nourshargh made the discovery of the molecule ’s role in peripheral nerves by accident , while investigating blood vessels .
Her team then collaborated with scientists at Imperial College London , University College London , Cancer Research UK and the University of Geneva to advance the work further .
There are more than 100 kinds of peripheral nerve disorders affecting approximately one in 20 people .
They often afflict people with existing diseases like diabetes and lupus , a chronic autoimmune disease .
Symptoms include numbness , pain , tingling , muscle weakness and sensitivity to touch .
Problems often start gradually and steadily get worse .
Nourshargh said the new molecule was not found in the central nervous system and was therefore unlikely to play a role multiple sclerosis .
JAM -C seems to work by sealing off the insulation in the critical gaps between so - called Schwann cells , which produce the myelin layers that wrap around nerve cells .

Things that do more than just go " bump " in the night
Following in Halloween spirit , this art will not only cause some goosebumps , but will make a deep and profound impact on your soul , and expose you to some areas of weirdness that you never knew existed .
Art of Kris Kuksi falls in that category : wildly unpredictable and rich creations , ominous in their very amount of detail , often " unspeakable " in a very Lovecraft - ian way , pregnant with the idea that perhaps the world is more twisted than most artists care to admit .
Something that Philip K . Dick might have conjured in his worst moments of battling the " demons of the mind " , or Medieval Architects would aspire to , if they were given more creative freedom .
Visit Kris 's website to see more ( some images may be nsfw ) .
We asked Kris some questions and he kindly agreed to answer Dark Roasted Blend , and provided us with some additional imagery :

How long have you been doing this , and how do you define your genre ?
Kris
I started my first one in 2004 called " Parasite and Host " , and from there they have evolved into what I call an appropriated onslaught of shit put together that otherwise should n't be together in order to create a physical world of what is in my head .
DRB
Any connection with works of Hieronymus Bosch , Lovecraft , Clive Barker ?
Kris
Bosch was an early favorite of mine , perhaps more so than anyone else .
He was well ahead of his time or perhaps he could see more than the other artists at the time .

" His works share his thoughts on psychological issues , religious ideology , and aesthetics .
Yet he never strays from the honesty within himself though he has had to shed many masks in order to do so .
He finds the materialistic world of popular culture as the food for self - indulgence , self - escapism , and shallow - heartedness .
Kuksi is obsessed with exposing the illusions we created as a result of fear in our minds ... "

What kind of " mixed media " do you use in your sculptures ?
Kris
Mixed media is a very simplified term for what materials I use , but the list would be to long for this interview .
I use " things " .
These things are pre-fabricated , injection - molded , press - molded , mass - produced , kitschy , weird stuff all brought together in a very articulated way that involves imagination , skill , math , craftsmanship , paint , and lastly , magic .
DRB
Do you model them on the computer first ?
Kris
No , it is all built in my head first , but the detailing and such is improvised while I build .
There are hundreds of possible ways of bringing these things together , but they must have the appeal of a flowing composition with visual balance and an overall pleasing look .

DRB
What are creative influences in your work ?
books ?
artists ?
music ?
Kris
I really do n't know what inspires me other than patterns .
Patterns in the existing world such as symmetry or harmony in both organic or non-organic materials .
The patterns in music can give me great visual imagination , but mostly I seek pleasing arrangements of forms whether it be man made or not .
But of course , the everyday world of humanity influences me , politics , religion , psychology , etc .
DRB
Are you happy with creative environment around you ?
art business ?
Kris
The world today is n't suited very well for the long process of creating art .
The thinking , the ideas , the production time , are challenging while the world around you moves so fast .
I just learn to adapt to the world no matter how unfriendly it can be to artists .
The art business in my experience has been both good and bad .
Some galleries and agents have good intentions and are loyal in representing artists , while others use artists mostly for monetary gain rather than the preservation of art .
The value of art these days is small in comparison to that of centuries ago .
The artist tells the story of what life was like , and it would be interesting to see what humans will think about what was being made during our time right now .
I just hope to be a voice that will be heard for centuries to come .

Any particular plans for the coming year ?
Kris
I 'll have a major solo show in June of next year , around 20 works .
I also plan to put out my first book next year .
And I imagine still collecting my oddities and the occasional dead animal .
DRB
Tell us three things about you that not many people know .
Kris
First , I 'm an electric guitar virtuoso in the style of neo-classical shredding , popularized by noted guitar players such as Yngwie Malmsteen .
I rarely do any public performances or play in bands , I use it mostly to seduce women - ha !
Second , I have double - jointed shoulder blades with which I can extrude outwards , though I never use this to seduce women .
Third , I was an alter boy in the Catholic Church years ago , that alone will seduce anyone .
Kris Kuksi works in a variety of styles and media .
His " Church Tank " modification we featured before , and here is an example of his " Fantastic Realism " work :
" Psychotropic Comparative Anatomy "
Moving from the " surrealist - turned - philosopher " creations of Kris Kuksi , which pack enough visual punch to merit a repeated viewing , let 's see what 's done in the field of grotesque steampunk sculpture , namely -
Fire - breathing Robots of Lance Greathouse
RaceGreathouseLabs builds fire - breathing monsters , some of which might 've stepped straight out of the nightmarish works of Kris Kuksi .
At first they built battle bots for " Robot Wars " , but moved into fire - enhanced creations for the " Burning Man " Events :
" The Sandman " - a 10 foot long , walking and fire - shooting robotic machine :
Jumping spiders , flaming bots and unnamed " things " inhabit the Greathouse Labs , providing lots of overheated excitement :
Terminator - like entities haunt the grounds :
Wicked - looking battle bots and robot crawlers lurk in the garage , the walking cannons scurry around like mechanized chickens :
Imagine meeting this thing somewhere in the country field in the middle of the night ...
You just might become a connoisseur of " grotesque " for the rest of your life .

Interview with Jeff VanderMeer , Monsters on Display
WASHINGTON , April 19 — Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales encountered anger and skepticism from senators today as he insisted that he had nothing to hide in the dismissals of eight United States attorneys , an episode that has cast a shadow on the Justice Department and brought calls for his resignation .
“ I am here today to do my part to ensure that all facts about this matter are brought to light , ” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning , noting that the panel ’s inquiry into the dismissals had already yielded thousands of pages of internal departmental communications and hours of interviews with department officials .
“ These are not the actions of someone with something to hide , ” Mr. Gonzales said in his opening remarks .
His reception from Democrats and Republicans alike , at a hearing that was widely seen as a make - or - break event , did not seem to augur well for Mr. Gonzales .
But at the end of the day , the White House issued a statement that President Bush thought Mr. Gonzales ’s testimony had gone well , and that he had “ full confidence ” in the attorney general .

I 've never gone in much for the friends thing .
You 've always got to return their calls , and make plans to see them , and wait for them when they 're late , and listen to them when they talk like you care about what they 're saying , and then they expect you to talk back like you care about what they 'll think .
But that 's what friends are for , I guess .
Games are never so demanding .
Sure , some talk more than they should , some do n't listen that well , and others are downright depressing , but they come when you call , leave when you 're tired of them , and never drink all your best bourbon .
So this week 's haiku go out to some good friends .
Long gone , but never forgotten :
Connecticut senator Christopher Dodd 's threatened filibuster of a bill giving immunity to telecoms that helped the government spy on Americans unexpectedly carried the day Monday , as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decided to postpone the vote on the measure until after the winter break .
The announcement was an unexpected victory for civil liberties groups , whose anti-immunity fortunes looked grim this morning as the Senate looked primed to pass an expansive spying bill that would free telecoms like AT&T and Verizon from privacy lawsuits .
Dodd showed his moxie and determination all day , as he held the floor for long stretches , railing against an administration - backed bill that would have freed telecoms from 40 - odd lawsuits pending against them in federal court .
The presidential candidate threatened to filibuster and hold the Senate floor if the Senate shot down his amendment to strip immunity from the bill .
That threat moved Reid to postpone a vote on the bill , so that the Senate could take up war funding bills , a massive domestic spending bill and changes to the Alternative Minimum Tax before the winter break .
Dodd 's determination to fight telecom immunity also boosted his lagging presidential campaign .
Electronic Frontier Foundation legal director Cindy Cohn was " very , very pleased " about the delay .
The EFF is suing AT&T for allegedly helping the NSA wiretap the internet , a suit that is now awaiting a decision from the U.S. Ninth Circuit Appeals Court , which will likely rule in the coming weeks if the suit can continue despite the government 's arguments that the suit puts " state secrets " at risk .
" We hope that the senators will take the holiday break to listen to their constituents , " Cohn said .
" The overwhelming majority of their constituents , as far as we can tell , think telecom immunity is a bad idea . "
Dodd spent nearly 10 hours on the Senate floor Monday , assaulting the administration 's secret warrantless wiretapping program and channeling Senator Frank Church , whose investigation in the 1970s of the nation 's intelligence services clandestine led to Congressional limits on government spying .
Those limits , which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , will be loosened by all of the spying bills moving through Congress .
After Reid 's announcement on Monday night , Dodd took to the floor again , thanking Reid for not invoking procedural moves to stop him from speaking at length today .
" I felt so strongly about this issue I was determined to do everything in my power to stop it , " Dodd said .
" I am grateful we are moving on to other issues and that we will return to this matter in January .
My hope is between now and then we can resolve this matter .
If it 's not I 'll be back here opposing those provisions giving immunity . "

Boy Babies Vanishing Among Inuit ; Who 's Next ?
Posted by wizeGurl ( 9274 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Environment ]
The Inuit , the native peoples of the world 's Arctic regions in Russia , Canada , Alaska , and Greenland ( you may know them by the old name , Eskimo ) , have a little problem .
They 're having more girl babies than boy babies .
A lot more .
In some cases , twice as many .
And in at least one area in northern Greenland , they 're only having girl babies .
This is sad , but why do we care ?
We 're ( most of us ) not Inuit living in the far north .
But they may simply be the exaggerated end of a trend that is growing in other areas as well .
Here 's the problem : advanced modern societies , like the US , Europe , and Japan , as well as the advancing countries worldwide , produce toxic substances like DDT ( banned in the US , but still used in emergencies and in some other countries ) , PCBs , flame - retardants and other chemicals that act as endocrine disrupters .
What are those ?
Why , chemicals that mimic human hormones and are capable of all sorts of scary effects , like triggering changes in the sex of unborn children in the first three weeks of gestation , lowering sperm counts , and generally wreaking havoc with the human body .
Many of these chemical build up at the top of the food chain .
The chemicals enter the environment , pervading the very air we breathe and the water all life depends on .
Small critters like plankton and krill absorb them , bigger fish eat them , then still bigger fish eat those , then seals eat the fish , then polar bears eat the seals , and finally , the Inuit enjoy a nice , rich polar bear steak .
By that time , the endocrine disrupters have become more and more concentrated as they have moved up the food chain .
Since the Inuit traditionally live on fish and meat ( good salads being hard to come by in the Arctic ) , they have very high levels of these chemicals , even though there is no industry at all where they live .
For the Inuit , the results are basically a Beach Boys song : two girls for every boy .
While that may sound pretty good to the guys in the Arctic , it 's a recipe for trouble .
And the boys that are born tend to be more premature and less healthy than the girls .
( Let 's not forget the spot in Greenland where there have been only girls born of late . )
But here 's the part you care about : the natural ratio of boys to girls born has been , for thousands of years , slightly more boys than girls .
( This is presumably because boys take more risks , and so you need a few extra to make up for the ones who kill themselves doing something stupid . )
But a paper published in the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences earlier this year said that in Japan and the US , there were 250,000 boys fewer than would have been expected had the sex ratio existing in 1970 remained unchanged .
The Inuit may be at the head of the trend , because they eat so much meat .
But we 're right behind them ; these chemicals are still being produced and introduced into the environment , and many of them stick around for a very long time .
It will be pretty ironic if our most advanced societies die out due to lack of healthy males , and all for plastic bags , spotless fruit , and sofas that wo n't catch fire easily .

Congressman feels he was pulled over for ' driving black essentially ' David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Friday November 23 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Congressman Danny Davis ( Dem - Ill ) has accused two white Chicago police officers of racial profiling after being pulled over and given a traffic ticket by them earlier this week .
On Friday morning , CNN's Tony Harris asked Davis what reason the police gave for stopping him Monday .
" Well , they said that I was weaving and that I drove left of center , but then , of course , I was not weaving and I was not driving left of center and so I could n't figure any reason to be stopped , " Davis claimed .
" All of the equipment on my car was working . "
The congressman added , " And I had to just ultimately figure out that there was some other reason that I was stopped beyond anything that was legal . "
" We were just simply four adults on our way home from a radio show and no reason , there was no traffic on the street , " Davis continued .
" We were the only people on the street visibly and out of the clear blue , there 's a traffic --" Harris interjected , " You feel like you were pulled over for driving black essentially ? "
" That is correct , " Davis responded .
The CNN anchor was sympathetic , noting that " in the black community we almost kid about that as being such a commonplace event it is something we almost kid about with one another .
I know it 's serious but maybe you can help us here . "
Davis said that he plans to contest the ticket , and referred to an internal Chicago police investigation of the incident , before adding , " I think it 's important that it be investigated , but it 's also important that we find a way to bridge some of the gulf , not a gap , it 's a gulf that exists between the community and the police department . "

Former Minn . Governor Jesse Ventura MPR Photos / Laura McCallum
Shortly after taking office in 1999 , Jesse Ventura writes he was asked to attend a meeting at the state Capitol .
He says 23 CIA agents were waiting for him in a basement conference room .
Ventura 's account of the meeting is detailed in an advance copy of his new book , which is scheduled for release in April .
He claims the agents ' questions focused how he campaigned for office , or as Ventura writes " how had the independent wrestler candidate pulled this off ? "
Memories can fade after nine years , but a meeting with 23 CIA agents is something that might stand out .
John Wodele , who served as Ventura 's director of communications , said the meeting was news to him .
" I do n't recall any indication that the governor had met with a CIA agent , " he said .
" Now , that does n't mean it did n't happen .
But I was not aware of it .
Turns out there actually was a Ventura meeting with the CIA in 1999 .
CIA Spokesman George Little confirmed the event today in a written statement , but he offered few details .
Little said that " on occasion CIA officers meet with senior state government officials , as they did in this case , to discuss issues of mutual interest . "
" On occasion CIA officers meet with senior state government officials , as they did in this case , to discuss issues of mutual interest . "
Little shed less light on another revelation in Ventura 's book .
The former Independence Party governor says he was " stunned to learn that there is a CIA operative inside every state government . "
Ventura says the Minnesota operative was a deputy commissioner , who was working with a dual identity .
In response to a question about Ventura 's claim , Little wrote , " I would n't think of CIA officers as being in state governments .
They 're federal employees . "
John Wodele said it would seem unusual that a CIA agent would be working in state government .
" If that did happen , I 'm not aware of it , " he said .
" And I guess that would be that way it should be .
I think the CIA is supposed to operate that way , where directors of communication are not made aware . "
CIA operations primarily focus on the collection and analysis of information about foreign threats to the United States .
Domestic matters fall into the jurisdiction of the FBI .
Former Republican U.S. Sen .
Dave Durenberger is questioning Ventura 's claims .
Durenberger , who spent eight years on the Senate intellegence committee , says he never heard of CIA operatives in state governments or agents grilling new governors .
" I can not think of a reason why either the details of , or his personal experiences with how he got elected would do anything for understanding threats to the United States and to our national security policy presented by foreign agents , " he said .
" It does n't jibe .
Unless Jesse had another life that he either wrote about in this book or has yet to disclose to us prior to becoming our governor .
It sort of like blows even my imagination to think of how this could be a reality . "
CIA finances and personnel are classified .
But Durenberger said he thinks the agency would be stretched to assign operatives to every state capitol and send 23 agents to attend the same meeting .
It 's unclear whether the current administration has any dealings with the CIA .
Brian McClung , a spokesman for Gov. Tim Pawlenty , said the governor talks on occasion with diplomatic , defense and intelligence officials .
But he said Pawlenty does not comment on matters relating to intelligence .
Coming just four days after the reinstatement of the Latin mass , yesterday 's document left no doubt about the Pope 's eagerness to back traditional Roman Catholic practices and attitudes , even at the expense of causing offence .
The view that Protestants cannot have churches was first set out by Pope Benedict seven years ago when , as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , he headed the Vatican " ministry " for doctrine .
A commentary attached to the latest text acknowledged that his 2000 document , Dominus Iesus , had caused " no little distress " .
But it added : " It is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' Church ' could possibly be attributed to [ Protestant communities ] , given that they do not accept the theological notion of the Church in the Catholic sense and that they lack elements considered essential to the Catholic Church . "
The Pope 's old department , which issued the document , said its aim was to correct " erroneous or ambiguous " interpretations of the Second Vatican Council , which ended in 1965 .
Quoting a text approved by the Council , it said Protestant churches , " because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood " , had not " preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery " .
However , other Christians saw the latest document as another retreat from the spirit of openness generated by the Council , which laid the basis for talks on Christian unity .
Bishop Wolfgang Huber , head of the Protestant umbrella group Evangelical Church in Germany , said : " The hope for a change in the ecumenical situation has been pushed further away by the document published today . "
He said the new pronouncement repeated " offensive statements " in the 2000 document and was a " missed opportunity " to improve relations with Protestants .
The president of the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy , pastor Domenico Maselli , called it a " huge step backwards in relations between the Roman Catholic church and other Christian communities " .
A statement from the French Protestant Federation warned that the internal document would have " external repercussions " .
The Church of England reacted more cautiously than seven years ago when Dominus Iesus was issued and the then Archbishop of Canterbury , George Carey , denounced it as unacceptable .
The spokesman for the current archbishop , Rowan Williams , said : " This is a serious document , teaching on important ecclesiological matters and of significance to the churches ' commitment to the full , visible unity to the one church of Jesus Christ . "
The Vatican 's statement had fewer misgivings about the Orthodox Church , which had " true sacraments " and a genuine priesthood .
But their failure to acknowledge the Pope 's authority meant they suffered from a " defectus " , politely translated from Latin as " a wound " .
On Saturday , the Pope freed Catholics to ask for masses to be celebrated according to the Latin rite abolished by the Second Vatican Council .
This meant the reinstatement of a Good Friday prayer describing Jews as blind to the Christian truth .
The president of the Italian rabbinical assembly , Giuseppe Laras , yesterday called it " a heavy blow " .
He told the daily Corriere della Sera : " We are going back .
A long way back . "
As another World AIDS Day dawns this morning , prepare for the usual media blitz of stories designed to promote more spending on failed approaches to HIV / AIDS , and more bashing of the Bush Administration despite increases in spending by the billions each year .
Here are some of the questions that the media probably wo n’t ask the professional HIV / AIDS lobby , which grows ever fatter while the human tragedy rises :
• What have American taxpayers gotten for the $ 20 billion per year ( and rising ) government spending on HIV / AIDS ?
• What has happened to the more than half a billion condoms that the United States taxpayers have distributed to Third World countries during the past seven years , even while the media have attacked the Bush Administration ’s emphasis on abstinence ?
• Federal funding for HIV / AIDS has increased dramatically every year since 1993 , yet the number of new infections has not declined .
Why do we spend more money every year on prevention programs that have failed to prevent new infections ?
• Why do billions of dollars continue to flow to organizations and programs that have been a colossal failure by any yardstick ?
• Why does the government spend far more on AIDS than cancer or heart disease , which each kill more than 10 times more people annually in the U.S. ?
• After 25 years , why do n’t the AIDS experts even know how many people are really infected ?
Just last week , UNAIDS admitted it had overestimated the global numbers by millions and CDC is expected to announce that it undercounted the number of U.S. cases by tens of thousands .
• Why is the onus on potential victims to take personal responsibility for having “ safe sex ” instead of the people who are already infected with HIV / AIDS , as is the case with other medical epidemics ?
• Why are health officials in major cities like Washington , D.C. , Chicago and San Francisco allowing the reopening of gay bathhouses , which facilitate the promiscuous sex that fuels the epidemic ?
• With CDC statistics showing that HIV / AIDS in the United States is still astronomically higher among men who have sex with men ( MSM ) , why are AIDS officials getting away with saying all Americans are equally at risk ?
• Why have most of the media ignored studies , such as one in the American Journal of Public Health in June 2003 about a program among African - American female adolescents that reported that “ 17.8 percent of the adolescents acquired an STD despite 100 percent condom use . ”
• With the District of Columbia this week reporting the highest per capita HIV / AIDS infection rate in the nation following years of condom promotion , why is the city planning to hand out at least 3 million condoms annually by 2009 ?
• Why does D.C. have 9 percent — nearly one in 10 — of all U.S. pediatric AIDS cases , when the District has a population of only 580,000 in a nation of more than 300 million people ?
Stephen Manning of the Associated Press reported that last statistic but offered no insight into why .
But he did follow it up with this :
“ Despite the virus ’s reputation as a scourge of homosexual male populations and intravenous - drug users , the biggest percentage increase in HIV cases since 2001 came from heterosexual contact .
The number of women living with AIDS has grown 76 percent over the past six years . ”
The increase in cases among women and even children is real and alarming , but it ’s not the whole story .
The AP article ignores these points from the D.C. report :
• “ Between 2001 and 2006 , MSM sexual contact was the most common mode of transmission reported among newly reported AIDS cases . ”
• “ Between 2001 and 2006 among persons living with AIDS , the highest number of cases was consistently among those attributed to MSM sexual contact , followed by heterosexual contact and IDU [ injection drug users ] . ”
• “ Males made up greater than 70 % of all cases living with AIDS , consistent with national trends . ”
When AIDS reporting leaves out key facts like these , news consumers ca n’t be faulted for thinking that homosexual behavior no longer poses any greater HIV risk for males .
Or that we just need to spend more on “ safe sex ” programs to make it all go away .
A congressional staffer on Capitol Hill who has been studying the AIDS issue for more than a decade told the Culture and Media Institute :
“ The media , with the notable exceptions of the Washington Post and Boston Globe , tend to dumb down the issue to two things : lack of money , and lack of support for harm reduction programs , like condoms and needle exchange .
“ There have been a number of really good articles in the Globe and Post in recent years .
Some good scientists have been working behind the scenes to get the truth out .
The reality is the science does n’t matter to the approach the government takes .
Politics has always dictated the response to this disease , and science is twisted and bent to fit an agenda rather than adjusting the agenda to match up with the science . ”
A June 22 , 2003 Boston Globe article by staff writer John Donnelley , “ UN report adds to a condom debate , ” began this way :
“ A draft report for the UN's AIDS agency has found that even when people use condoms consistently , the failure rate for protection against HIV is an estimated 10 percent , making them a larger risk than portrayed by many advocate groups .
“ The report , which looked at two decades of scientific literature on condoms , is likely to add fuel to a heated political battle on U.S. policy in fighting AIDS in the developing world . ”
One would think a 10 percent failure rate against a 100 percent fatal disease would continue to make news , but the stat has disappeared into a media black hole .
Likewise , the media decline to dig deeply into alleged success claims for needle - exchange programs .
All three leading Democratic presidential candidates have pledged to increase federal money for needle giveaway programs , yet reporters seem to lack curiosity about whether these programs actually work .
Absent from most coverage are embarrassing facts like the following , related by Sen.
Tom Coburn ( R - Oklahoma ) in the September 2005 edition of Drug Watch World News :
“ In 1998 , Vancouver , Canada introduced a needle exchange program ( NEP ) in an effort to control high rates of HIV / AIDS among injection drug users ( IDUs ) .
Today , Vancouver boasts the largest NEP in the Western Hemisphere .
“ The city distributes over two million needles every year ; local organizations distribute thousands of needles every day ; and syringes are available over the counter at pharmacies .
Unarguably , nowhere in North America are clean needles more accessible .
“ When its NEP was established , HIV prevalence in Vancouver was one to two percent among the city ’s 6,000 to 10,000 IDUs .
While the expectation was for needle distribution to decrease HIV rates , the opposite has occurred .
HIV rates have soared , and so has the number of drug abusers in the city .
“ Today , there are an estimated 12,000 IDUs in the Vancouver area , and about 40 percent of the city ’s IDUs have HIV .
As a result , Vancouver has earned another not so boastful distinction – having the highest HIV infection rate of any city in the developed world .
Furthermore , more than 90 percent of the city ’s IDUs are estimated to be infected with another blood borne disease , hepatitis C. ”
When you tune in to the networks or your local newspaper , see how many questions are being asked that would shine a light on the longstanding “ safe sex ” approaches to HIV / AIDS .
The main question should be :
Why are we throwing billions of dollars at the same old approaches ?
It ca n’t be “ compassion , ” because it ’s not working .
Pelosi's Sinking Fortunes
COMMENTARY : Pelosi's Sinking Fortunes by Dave Lindorff H ouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi took power in the House of Representatives in January on a wave of public enthusiasm and hopes that Congress would finally start holding the president to account .
Not quite six months out , it 's becoming apparent to Democrats who were looking to her for leadership that she 's not about leading an opposition party ; she 's about posturing and hoping for better days in 2008 , but not much else .
Californians voted for Democrats in Congress because they wanted to end the Iraq War , and because they were , and are , fed up with the anti-democratic antics of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Pelosi's own California Democratic Party Convention recently overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on her and the Congress to impeach the president -- something that Pelosi stubbornly refuses to allow to happen .
Now her failure to act to stop the war , and her refusal to permit a Bush impeachment bill to be filed on her watch , are hitting her where it hurts -- in the polls .
According to a report today by MediaNews in Sacramento , written by Steve Geissinger , Pelosi 's support in California , which was at 52 percent in March , has slumped 13 percent to just 39 percent since then .
That 's Bush territory she 's entering .
It would be nice to think Pelosi would see this decline in support on her home turf as a signal that she needs to do something radically different , but she 's been pretty pig - headed so far about taking on the president .
In fact , as I wrote in yesterday 's column , the Speaker is now on record as saying that impeaching the president would be a " waste of time " and that defending the Constitution " is n't worth it " unless she knows in advance that she can succeed .
Not particularly inspirational talk for an opposition leader , is it ?
Well , maybe Pelosi 's weakness explains why the number of members of Congress who have signed on to Rep.
Dennis Kucinich 's once ignored Cheney impeachment bill ( H.Res. 333 ) has jumped to 13 .
The snowball is rolling downhill and it's starting to get bigger , and to roll faster .
Bush 's commutation of Scooter Libby 's jail sentence , which was done at the urging of Vice President Dick Cheney , and which is clearly designed to keep the convicted felon from turning state 's evidence ( making it obstruction of justice ) , should give that ball a big push in the right direction .
Maybe the July 4 weekend is the right time for California Democrats to start looking for someone to challenge Pelosi for her seat .
Even a write - in campaign would be worth it .
Meanwhile , Democrats in Congress should take a cold , hard look at Pelosi 's home numbers , at the crash in public support for the Democratic Congress , which has fallen from a high of 65 percent last November to just 23 percent , and at the feelings of their own constituents , and consider whether maybe they should look for a new and gutsier leader .
Either than , or they should start working on their resumes .
At this rate , 2008 could be a Democratic bloodbath . .

Arizona Daily Star — U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva is the latest Democrat to endorse Dennis Kucinich ’s “ Articles of Impeachment Against Dick Cheney . ”
Energized by his move , a local group of activists seeking to drum up support for an impeachment is now looking to pressure neighboring Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords to join the effort .
Grijalva , a co-sponsor , said the impeachment bill has a “ limited chance ” at best of gaining the support it needs .
But he signed on because of what he sees as major abuses by the Bush - Cheney administration .
“ At least for me personally , it ’s more of a statement than anything else , ” said Grijalva , who represents Southwestern Arizona .
“ There has got to be some accountability . ”
The bill , which would impeach Cheney for “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” says “ despite all evidence to the contrary , the vice president actively and systematically sought to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States about an alleged threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction . ”
It also points to statements made by Cheney linking Iraq to the terrorist organization al - Qaida before and after the invasion of Iraq .
Grijalva said Democrats are going after Cheney , not President Bush , because they wanted to go after “ the brain . ”
“ This is one vice president who shared power with the president , ” Grijalva said , outlining some of the charges in the articles of impeachment .

Text version follows :
T ORTURE , INTERROGATION AND INTELLIGENCE
What I want you to keep in mind as you read this is that we are to assume the following situation :
We have somebody in our custody , who we believe has knowledge of an impending terrorist attack , and we think that attack could be VERY serious , but we have less than five days to find out what this person knows about the impending attack .
In this piece , I 'm going to specifically address using drugs known as " truth serums " as the means by which we get the intelligence that we need .
Some would call this a form of torture .
I want you to know that I do n't glory torture for its own sake .
I accept it as a means to survival .
To digress for a moment , and to add a little humor to it , I do n't get any pleasure inflicting pain on anybody , unless you 're a quarterback .
I hate quarterbacks .
I was a linebacker .
Quarterbacks live a charmed life .
Think about it .
A quarterback never had zits as a kid .
He never sweat .
He always got the best looking cheerleader .
He or his parents always had the best car .
The teachers and coaches would let him get away with murder , and yet call him a saint .
He always had his picture on the front cover of the football guide and the game - day program .
He was the class valedictorian .
He never had to dig ditches in 100 - degree heat in the summer to make money .
Even during practice , he got to wear a different color jersey from anybody else .
He could sit down , kneel down , slide down , fall down , lie down , down the damn ball or throw it away , and if you even breathed on him you got penalized 15 yards for roughing the quarterback .
I ask you , when was the last time you ever saw any official at any football game -- peewee through the pros -- ever throw flag on anybody for roughing the linebacker ?
I rest my case .
When Israel suffers a terrorist attack , almost invariably they retaliate within 24 hours .
The reason that they can do this is that they have the world 's best human intelligence ( humint ) , and they know how to interrogate people .
Their intelligence is so good and they keep it so current that they know who has attacked them , and they already have plans in existence for retaliation .
Their humint sources are not just Israelis , but actual members of the society on which they are spying .
They use humint and supplement it by signal intelligence ( sigint ) .
We do it just ass - backwards , because we CAN'T do it the way the Israeli's do it -- we simply do not have enough people on the ground .
It takes $ 500,000 - 1,000,000 and 3 - 5 years to train and put in place a good humint source ( assume this is an American hired by , say , the CIA , to try and infiltrate some terrorist group ) .
NOTHING that is going on at present can quickly change this equation or situation .
Forget the hearings , the posturing , the proposals , the realignments , the debate .
It 's all based on the INCORRECT assumption that we already have the tools , they just need to be rearranged .
We do NOT have all the tools and no flow chart or organization chart can change that .
The Geneva Convention was not signed by any terrorist group .
No terrorist should be provided any protection whatsoever under the Geneva Convention .
We are supposed to be a nation of laws .
If you are not a United States citizen , do n't expect protection of our laws .
Therefore , no terrorist -- whether running free or in custody -- is entitled to any protection under any international law to which we are a signatory or law of the United States .
Most of what follows is what I have learned from Israelis , South Koreans , Russians , as well as Americans .
I want to address several fallacies of interrogation .
Fallacy # 1 . Torture never works , because a prisoner will tell the interrogators whatever they want to hear just to stop the torture .
That 's based on a faulty assumption .
That faulty assumption is that , if you act on the fabricated intelligence provided by the prisoner , and then you find out that it is not correct , that the prisoner does not have to pay a price for lying .
Before you ask the prisoner for information , you tell that prisoner that if he or she lies , you will torture the prisoner , the family , the friends , the parakeet , whomever .
And then do it .
Fallacy # 2 . Any prisoner can outwit his or her interrogators .
This does n't work with interrogators who are members of a free society , and have very good to excellent intelligence sources to confirm and verify what a prisoner says .
Part of this fallacy was created as a result of what our American POWs told their North Vietnamese interrogators , when those POWs were held in and around Hanoi during the Vietnam War .
North Vietnam was a closed society .
That society only heard and saw what their leaders wanted them to hear and see .
Our prisoners '
Code of Conduct was changed in response to the brutal torture that our POW 's endured .
Our POWs held out under that torture as long as they could .
When they could hold out no longer , they made up something to stop the torture .
Incredibly , and to show you how stupid and uninformed the North Vietnamese were , our POWs made up names of superior officers .
These names included General Mills ( the cereal company ) , Major Domo , Captain Video , etc .
The North Vietnamese interrogators dutifully wrote down this information , smiled smugly , and assumed that they had extracted critical information from their prisoners .
In this sense , yes , the prisoners did outwit the interrogators .
In contrast , when our POWs were interrogated by Russians , Cubans , East Germans , and Bulgarians , when they tried to pull the same stunt as they did with the North Vietnamese , our guys were beaten , starved , and tortured unmercifully .
Our guys said that you could fool North Vietnamese , but do n't even think about trying it with those other guys .
Fallacy # 3 . Torture as a means of interrogation is generally not accepted throughout the world .
In point of fact , within the last three years , more than three - quarters of all countries in the world have practiced torture as a means of interrogation .
This applies to their own citizens , as well as foreigners , whether combatants or not .
Bleeding hearts just do n't get it .
On the one hand , they kept telling us to allow the weapons inspectors in Iraq more and more and more time and more and more and more time to uncover weapons of mass destruction .
On the other hand , once the President declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq , the bleeding hearts started screeching that the rebuilding and democratization of Iraq was n't happening fast enough .
On the third hand , they run their hands at how quickly we had placed prisoners into detention facilities .
This herky - jerky , stop - and - go , inconsistency is nothing more than political opportunism .
Even the ACLU got involved , not on behalf of Americans , but on behalf of our enemies .
If you did n't know this , read this and burn it in your memory :
The ACLU was founded by a card - carrying member of the Communist Party .
You should never again wonder why the ACLU is trying to tear apart the moral and legal fiber of this country .
Fallacy # 4 .
These things called " truths serums " do n't really work .
They do work to varying degrees of success .
There are three primary truth serums .
Here they are .
Scopolamine ( scopolamine hydrobromide ; first word pronounced : skoh - PAW - lah - mean ) , also known by another name -- hyoscine ( hyoscine hydrobromide ) .
It is colorless , odorless and tasteless .
Its clinical uses are primarily as a sedative , and applied locally ( directly ) as a mydriatic , which causes the pupil of the eye to dilate .
When used as a sedative , the primary uses are to combat vertigo and motion sickness .
When used with morphine and pentobarbital , to a woman in labor , it produces a " twilight sleep . "
It is also used as a premedication preliminary to surgery anesthesia .
Since scopolamine completely blocks the formation of memories , unlike most date - rape drugs used in the United States and elsewhere , it is usually impossible for victims to ever identify their aggressors ( or interrogators , if you were a prisoner ) .
To use scopolamine most effectively to get a prisoner to tell you what he or she knows , the key is where you inject it , and in what amounts .
Normally it is introduced into the body by a transdermal patch or intravenously in the arm .
However , if you inject it into the spine ( amount classified ) , it causes absolutely incredible pain , accompanied by violent convulsions and seizures .
If injected into the spine in the appropriate amount , more than 95 % of all prisoners will tell the truth -- not something fabricated to stop the pain -- within 24 hours ( Source : classified ) .
A far milder form of psychological abuse involves exposing prisoners ( intravenously or orally ) to sodium pentathol — commonly known as " truth serum . "
Sodium pentathol is an ultra- short - acting barbiturate that depresses the central nervous system , slows heart rate , and lowers blood pressure .
In the relaxed state produced by the drug , subjects are more susceptible to suggestion and are therefore easier to interrogate .
The drug does not actually guarantee that prisoners will tell the truth , however .
Often , it makes subjects " gabby " without revealing any important information .
Sodium amythal , also known as a type of " truth serum , " with its clinical application in psychoanalysis , is used primarily to help in memory recovery and dealing with " false " memories .
If you can confuse the prisoner as to what is a real memory and what is a false memory , you might be able to crack their resistance to telling the truth .
However , if the prisoner is smart , he or she will simply shut up and you 'll get nothing from them .
What is interesting is that a prisoner could have been subjected to a truth serum singularly , or two or three over enough time given the appropriate washout of the prisoner 's system , and flatly state that he or she did not tell his or her interrogators anything .
From his or her perspective , he or she is telling the truth -- because he or she has no memory of telling interrogators anything .
That 's the truth in his or her own mind , but it is not the fact of the situation .
In terms of training individuals to resist the three aforementioned truth serums , it is easiest to train someone to resist the sodium amythal , followed by sodium pentathol .
There is no known training that will allow anyone to resist scopolamine , when injected into the spine in the correct amount .
What you do n't want to do is " stack " scopolamine with sodium pentathol and sodium amythal .
" Stacking " means adding one drug on top of another before the previous drug(s ) has / have washed out of the system .
You stack on somebody , you 'll kill them .
When time is not a consideration , and when used in conjunction with skilled interrogators on a prisoner who has not been trained to resist the effects , sodium pentathol and sodium amythal will get you the truth in approximately 10 % to one third of the cases .
When the truth absolutely positively has to be there within five days , forget them – use scopolamine injected into the spine .
I do n't honestly know if we have used any of these truth serums on Saddam Hussein .
Too bad if we did n't .
My clearance does n't extend that high .
For those of you who do n't know -- and to oversimplify it -- there are four different levels of security clearances .
They are : secret ; top - secret ; top - secret / code word ; beyond top - secret / code word .
The words " code word " could be something like UMBRA .
So if I had that level , I would be cleared top - secret / UMBRA , which means I would be allowed to see or hear anything that is secret , top - secret , and -- separately -- anything that a classified under the code word UMBRA .
In 1909 , before World War I , there were a number of terrorist attacks on the United States forces in the island of Mindanao in the Philippines , by Muslim extremists .
General " Black Jack " Pershing was the appointed military governor of the Moro Province .
He captured 50 terrorists and ordered them to be tied to posts for execution .
Since all the prisoners were Muslim , he asked his men to bring two pigs and slaughter them in front of the prisoners .
He then proceeded by dipping bullets into the pig ’s blood .
In the process he executed 49 of the terrorists by firing squad .
Then , the soldiers dug a big hole in the ground and dumped in the terrorists ’ bodies and covered them in pig ’s blood and viscera .
The last man was set free .
For 42 years there was not a single Muslim attack anywhere in the world .
His rationale was quite simple and effective .
Since a radical Muslim is willing to give his life for his religion in a Jihad war , killing him would not make much difference .
He would be seen as a martyr ( shahada ) .
But the General knew that all Muslims believe in eternal life after death with 72 virgins waiting for them in paradise .
He also knew that those that embrace Jihad usually prepare themselves physically and spiritually in case they die in combat .
Since the pig is considered forbidden food ( haram ) in Islam , Pershing introduced this variable to thwart their hopes to enter Allah ’s kingdom .
The pig ’s blood automatically nullified any prior purification by contaminating their bodies .
My interrogation technique is quite simple .
I follow General Pershing ’s example and order a pig to be slaughtered near the prisoner .
The blood of the animal run 's freely toward the prisoner 's feet .
He will immediately lift his knees to avoid making contact with it .
I fill a syringe with the pig ’s blood and threaten to inject him in the arm .
The prisoner will talk -- and quickly .
Fair ?
Depends on your perspective .
Effective ?
Extremely .
A century ago , General Pershing ’s quick thinking installed a great fear in a large sector of the Muslim population in Mindanao putting an end to any type of subversion in an Island that resents the presence of non-Muslims .
Last , here are a few tips in terms of determining if who you have in custody really is a Muslim :
Since most of the concentration is on Islamic terrorism , these are a few signs that very few people know about .
A serious Muslim that prays 5 times a day has a small dark discoloration on his forehead .
If he wears jewelry , it has to be silver and not gold -- usually a silver ring with a space inside where there is a passage from the Koran .
Another important pointer comes from physical anthropology , and deals with faces and body structures .
A real Muslim keeps his left hand away from his food , usually under the table .
Bottom line : there are effective ways to get the truth from a prisoner under interrogation .
Some work better than others .
When drugs are used , both the person administering the drug , as well as the interrogator , must be expert at their profession .
When time is the most important consideration , you 're left with very few options .
Whatever the situation , KNOW YOUR ENEMY .
What I say here are my own opinions , based upon fact .
They are not to be construed as the policy or official position of APUS .
As always , you are free to accept or reject anything I say , and verify it by any means you wish .
Thank you .
Doc
Now big spenders tired of dropping big bucks on the luxury pie can now wake up to a grand breakfast at the Westin Hotel in Times Square , where Executive Chef Frank Tujague has concocted his $ 1,000 bagel .
Yes , that 's a thousand bucks for a single bagel .
So what do you get for your money ?
The bagel is topped with Alba white truffle cream cheese and goji berry infused Riesling jelly with golden leaves .
The white truffle , which is known for its one - of - a - kind aroma , is the second most expensive food in the world , next to caviar , and is very hard to come by .
So hard , in fact , that it 's grown from late autumn to winter beneath certain oak trees in the Alba region of Italy , where trained pigs and dogs are called upon to find the delicacies .
" I wanted to create something that speaks to New York , and is also a reflection of my culinary passion for seasonality and fine ingredients , " Tujague said in a statement .
" Bagels are a New York food landmark , which is where the base for this dish came from .
White truffles are a simple , quality ingredient that takes the meal , or the bagel in this case , to the next level . "
The goji berries are also lauded for their health benefits , as they 're the richest known source of beta - carotene of all known foods or plants on earth , and are demonstrated to be a healing catalyst .
Tujague created the delicacy to raise money for the Les Amis d'Escoffier Scholarship , which benefits culinary arts students .
" We wanted this bagel to be more than an over - the - top seasonal menu item .
By giving back a portion of the proceeds , we are inspiring future chefs to think outside the box and maximize culinary creativity , " said Tujague .
But you better act fast , the luxurious bagel is only available through Dec. 14 .
And if you 're worried about tax and gratuity -- do n't worry , that 's included in the price .
The $ 1,000 bagel must be ordered 24 - hours in advance .

" " " This is a script to apply database migrations .
Run this script with the -h flag to get usage information .
Migration Modules
-----------------
Each migration is a module stored in
``${appname}/db/migration_${revision}.py`` where revision starts at 000
( i.e. an empty database ) .
Each such module should have a module - level
global named migration containing a list of pairs of atoms .
For
instance : :
migration = [
# ( up , down )
( " CREATE TABLE A ( ... ) " , " DROP TABLE IF EXISTS A " ) ,
( " CREATE TABLE B ( ... ) " , " DROP TABLE IF EXISTS B " )
]
The up and down atoms may either be SQL strings , or they may be
functions that accept a SQLAlchemy connection .
Since I 'm using SQLAlchemy , you might wonder why I 'm writing actual SQL .
I like to use the SQLAlchemy ORM .
However , when creating tables in
MySQL , there are so many fancy options that I find it easier to write
the SQL by hand .
Error Handling
--------------
* If something goes wrong when down migrating , just let the exception
propagate .
* If something goes wrong when up migrating , complain , try to back it
out , and then let the exception propagate .
If backing it out fails ,
just let that exception propagate .
* Use transactions as appropriate .
There are a lot of cases in
MySQL where transactions are n't supported .
Hence , backing things
out is sometimes necessary .
However , it 's also possible that a
transaction might rollback , and then the code to back things out
runs anyway .
It 's best to make your down atoms idempotent .
For
instance , use " DROP TABLE IF EXISTS " rather than just " DROP
TABLE " .
Avoiding SQLAlchemy , Pylons , Paste , and Python 2.5
--------------------------------------------------
I 'm using SQLAlchemy , but that does n't force you to use SQLAlchemy in
the rest of your app .
I 'm using Paste 's configuration mechanism because
that 's how my database configuration information is stored .
Passing a
CONFIG.ini to the script meets the needs of Paste and Pylons users
perfectly .
If you 're not one of those users and you want to use my
script , it 's easy to subclass it and do something differently .
Similarly , if you 're not using Python 2.5 , I 'm happy to remove the
Python 2.5 - isms .
Let 's talk !

As part of my day job , I 've written a Rails - style database migration script .
This lets you write migrations from one version of a schema to the next .
This allows you to develop schemas iteratively .
It also lets you upgrade or downgrade the schema .
Best of all , if an attempted upgrade fails , it can back it out even if you 're not using transactions .
Of course , this is based on writing " up " and " down " routines - - it 's practical , not magical .
I 'm releasing this code in the hope that others will find it useful .
It 's well - written , solid , and well - tested .
This is the type of thing you could probably write in a day .
I took four , and polished the heck out of it .
It uses SQLAlchemy to talk to the database .
However , that does n't mean you have to use SQLAlchemy .
Personally , I like writing table create statements by hand .
You can do either .
My database configuration is stored in a .ini file ala Paste / Pylons .
Hence , the script takes a .ini file to retrieve the database configuration .
If you do n't use Pylons , but you still want to use my script , that 's an easy change to make .
Migrations are stored in Python modules named like " ${yourpackage}.db.migration_${number}.py " .
Again , I use Pylons to figure out what " $ {yourpackage} " is , but that 's easy enough to change .
The name of my Pylons app is " multicosmic " , and the script is installed in my application .
You 'll need to change the name to match your app .
Start by creating directories and __init__.py files for " multicosmic / db " and " multicosmic / scripts " .
First , there 's a migrate script in " multicosmic/scripts/migrate.py " :
It comes with two migrations.
multicosmic/db/migration_000.py:multicosmic/db/migration_001.pyLast of all , there are test cases in multicosmic / tests / functional/test_migrate_script.py : I use nose for my tests .
You can find out more about using nose with Pylons , including things to watch out for , here
If this code works out for you , leave me a comment :)

LBS 333 Topics in the History of Genetics and Molecular Biology Fall 2000
Chapter Twelve , The Molecular Wars by E. O. Wilson
Without a trace of irony I can say I have been blessed with brilliant enemies .
They made me suffer ( after all , they were enemies ) , but I owe them a great debt , because they redoubled my energies and drove me in new directions .
We need such people in our creative lives .
As John Stuart Mill once put it , both teachers and learners fall asleep at their posts when there is no enemy in the field .
James Dewey Watson , the codiscoverer of the structure of DNA , served as one such adverse hero for me .
When he was a young man , in the 1950s and 1960s , I found him the most unpleasant human being I had ever met .
He came to Harvard as an assistant professor in 1956 , also my first year at the same rank .
At twenty - eight , he was only a year older .
He arrived with a conviction that biology must be transformed into a science directed at molecules and cells and rewritten in the language of physics and chemistry .
What had gone before , " traditional " biologyómy biologyówas infested by stamp collectors who lacked the wit to transform their subject into a modern science .
He treated most of the other twenty - four members of the Department of Biology with a revolutionaryís fervent disrespect .
At department meetings Watson radiated contempt in all directions .
He shunned ordinary courtesy and polite conversation , evidently in the belief that they would only encourage the traditionalists to stay around .
His bad manners were tolerated because of the greatness of the discovery he had made , and because of its gathering aftermath .
In the 1950s and 1960s the molecular revolution had begun to run through biology like a flash flood .
Watson , having risen to historic fame at an early age , became the Caligula of biology .
He was given license to say anything that came to his mind and expect to be taken seriously .
And unfortunately , he did so , with a casual and brutal offhandedness .
In his own mind apparently he was Honest Jim , as he later called himself in the manuscript title of his memoir of the discoveryóbefore changing it to The Double Helix .
Few dared call him openly to account .
Watsonís attitude was particularly painful for me .
One day at a department meeting I naively chose to argue that the department needed more young evolutionary biologists , for balance .
At least we should double the number from one ( me ) to two .
I informed the listening professors that Frederick Smith , an innovative and promising population ecologist , had recently been recruited from the University of Michigan by Harvardís Graduate School of Design .
I outlined Smithís merits and stressed the importance of teaching environmental biology .
I proposed , following standard departmental procedure , that Smith be offered joint membership in the Department of Biology .
Watson said softly , " Are they out of their minds ? "
" What do you mean ? " I was genuinely puzzled .
" Anyone who would hire an ecologist is out of his mind , " responded the avatar of molecular biology .
For a few moments the room was silent .
No one to defend the nomination , but no one echoed Watson either .
Then Paul Levine , the department chairman , jumped in to close the subject .
This proposal , he said , is not one we are prepared to consider at this time .
With documentation , we might examine the nomination at some future date .
We never did , of course .
Smith was elected a member only after the molecular biologists split off to form a department of their own .
After this meeting I walked across the Biological Laboratories quad on my way to the Museum of Comparative Zoology .
Elso Barghoorn hurried to catch up with me .
A senior professor of evolutionary biology , he was one of the worldsí foremost paleobotanists , the discoverer of Pre-Cambrian microscopic fossils , and an honest man .
" Ed , " he said , I donít think we should use ëecologyí as an expression anymore .
Itís become a dirty word . "
And sure enough , for most of the following decade we largely stopped using the word " ecology . "
Only later did I sense the anthropological significance of the incident .
When one culture sets out to erase another , the first thing its rulers banish is the official use of the native tongue .
The molecular wars were on .
Watson was joined to varying degrees in attitude and philosophy by a small cadre of other biochemists and molecular biologists already in the department .
They were George Wald , soon to receive a Noble Prize for his work on the biochemical basis of vision ; John Edsall , a pioneering protein chemist and youngish elder statesman who smiled and nodded a lot but was hard to understand ; Matthew Meselson , a brilliant young biophysicist newly recrutied from the California Institute of Technology ; and Paul Levine , the only other assistant professor besides Watson and myself promoted to tenure during the 1950s .
Levine soon deserted population biology and began to promote the new doctrine aggressively on his own .
Zeal of the convert , I thought to myself .
***
My own position was made more uncomfortable by the location of my office and laboratory in the Biological Laboratories , the bridgehead from physics and chemistry into which the richly funded molecular biologists were now pouring .
I found the atmosphere there depressingly tense .
Watson did not acknowledge my presence as we passed in the hall , even when no one else was near .
I was undecided whether to respond in kind by pretending to be unaware of his own existence ( impossible ) or to humiliate myself by persisting with southern politenesse ( also impossible ) .
I settled on a mumbled salutationÖ .
My standing among the molecularists was not improved by my having been granted tenure several months before Watson , in 1958 .
Although it was an accident of timing óI had received an unsolicited offer from Stanford and Harvard counterofferedóand in any event I considered him to be far more deserving , I can imagine how Watson must have taken the news .
Badly .
Actually , I cannot honestly say I knew Jim Watson at all .
The skirmish over Smithís appointment was only one of a half - dozen times he and I spoke directly to each other during his twelve years at Harvard and in the period immediately following .
On one occasion , in October 1962 , I offered him my hand and said , " Congratulations , Jim , on the Nobel Prize .
Itís a wonderful event for the whole department . "
He replied , " Thank you . "
End of conversation .
On another occasion , in May 1969 , he extended his hand and said , " Congratulations , Ed , on your election to the National Academy of Sciences . "
I replied , " Thank you very much , Jim . "
I was delighted by this act of courtesy .
At least there was no guile in the man .
Watson evidently felt , at one level , that he was working for the good of science , and a blunt tool was needed .
Have to crack eggs to make an omelet , and so forth .
What he dreamed at a deeper level I never knew .
I am only sure that had his discovery been of lesser magnitude he would have been treated at Harvard as just one more gifted eccentric , and much of his honesty would have been publicly dismissed as poor judgement .
But people listened carefully , and a few younger colleagues aped his manners , for the compelling reason that the deciphering of the DNA molecule with Francis Crick towered over all that the rest of us had achieved and could ever hope to achieve .
It came like a lightning flash , like knowledge from the gods .
The Prometheus of the drama were Jim Watson and Francis Crick , and not just by a stroke of good luck either .
Watson - Crick possessed extraordinary brilliance and initiative .
It is further a singular commentary on the conduct of science that ( according to Watson in a later interview ) no other qualified person was interested in devoting full time to the problem .
***
ÖI was among the Harvard graduate students most excited by the early advances of molecular biology .
Watson was a boyís hero of the natural sciences , the fast young gun who rode into town .
Moreís the pity that Watson himself and his fellow molecularists had no such foresights about the sector of biology in which I had comfortably settled .
All I could sift from their pronouncements was the revolutionaryís credo :
Wipe the slate clean of this old - fashioned thinking and see what new order will emerge .
I was of course disappointed at this lack of vision .
When Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968 ( he kept his Harvard professorship by joint appointment until 1976 ) I commented sourly to friends that I wouldnít put him in charge of a lemonade stand .
He proved me wrong .
In ten years he raised that noted institution to even greater heights by inspiration , fund - raising skills , and the ability to choose and attract the most gifted researchers .
***
There is a final principle of social behavior to help keep thee many developments in perspective .
When oppressed peoples have no other remedy they resort to humor .
In 1967 I composed a " Glossary of Phrases in Molecular Biology " that was soon distributed in departments of biology throughout the country and praisedóby evolutionary biologistsófor capturing the strut of the conquerors .
My samizdat included the following expressions , which I have changed here from alphabetical order to create a logical progression of the concepts :
Classical Biology .
That part of biology not yet explained in terms of physics and chemistry .
Classical Biologists are fond of claiming that there is a great deal of Classical Biology that individual Molecular Biologists do not know about ; but that is all right because it is probably mostly not worth knowing about anyway , we think .
In any case , it doesnít matter , because eventually it will all be explained in terms of physics and chemistry ; then it will be Molecular Biology and worth knowing about
Brilliant Discovery .
A publishable result in the Mainstream of Biology .
Mainstream of Biology .
The set of all projects being worked on by me and my friends .
Also known as Modern Biology and Twenty - first Century Biology .
Exceptional Young Man .
A beginning Molecular Biologist who has made a Brilliant Discovery ( q. v. )
First -rate .
Pertaining to biologists working on projects in the Mainstream of Biology .
Molecular Biology .
That part of biochemistry which has supplanted part of Classical Biology .
A great deal of Molecular Biology is being conducted by First - rate Scientists who make Brilliant Discoveries .
Third - rate .
Pertaining to Classical Biologists .
First rate , Brilliant ,
Wave of the FutureÖbelieve me , this was the phrasing actually used .
Today those once oft - heard mantras clink with antique brittleness .
The passage of thirty years has done much to close the divide between molecular and evolutionary biology .
As I write , systematists , the solitary experts on groups of organisms , have unfortunately been largely eliminated from academic departments by the encroachment of the new fields .
That is the worst damage caused by the molecular revolution .
Ecologists , pushed to the margin for years , have begun a resurgence through the widespread recognition of the global environment crisis .
Molecular biologists , as they promised , have taken up evolutionary studies , making important contributions whenever they can find systematists to tell them the names of organisms .
The surviving evolutionary biologists routinely use molecular data to pursue their Darwinian agenda .
The two sides sometimes speak warmly to each other .
Indeed , teams from both domains increasingly collaborate to conduct First - rate Work in what may now safely and fairly be called part of the Mainstream of Biology .
The corridor language one overhears from molecular biologists has grown more chaste and subtle .
Only hardshelled fundamentalists among them think that higher levels of biological organization , populations to ecosystems , can be explained by molecular biology .

5 Reasons Why IT People Love Lists
Ok , admit it .
You ’re reading this because you want to know the 5 reasons .
That means that you ’re probably like most IT people and you love lists yourself .
Of course it ’s not just IT people who love lists ; it ’s almost anyone who falls into the Myers - Briggs category called “ Judging ” which describes people who need structure and need to have things decided .
Using the Myers - Briggs categorization , most IT people are ISTJ , INTJ or occasionally ESTJ or ENTJ .
I ’m a list person myself .
You can identify true list people by the way they use a To Do list .
When true list people accomplish something that ’s not on the list , they add it to the list just so that they can have the satisfaction of crossing it out .
Does that sound familiar ?
In thinking about lists the other day , I decided to make a list of the reasons why people love lists .
Here they are :
1 . There are two kinds of people in the world : those who classify people and things into categories , and those who do n’t .
Lists are for the first kind of person ; lists are used to categorize .
2. Lists are logical and make it seem easier to cope with what seems to be an inherently illogical world .
Lists are used to create a micro- world that ’s somehow more satisfying than the real world .
It allows us to avoid confusion by restricting our focus to the things on our list .
3 . Lists make it appear that there are a finite number of choices for something , rather than the infinite number of choices that are actually available when you consider alternative ways to solve your problems .
If you have a list then you can eliminate choices one by one until there ’s only one choice left .
That makes us feel like we ’ve done our homework , although perhaps if we had really done our homework then we would have put more types of choices on the list in the first place .
4. Lists define the “ box ” that people do n’t think outside of ( remember the popular business admonition , “ think outside the box ” ) .
Once you make a list you seldom consider other factors that are n’t on the list .
That ’s a good thing if you want to limit your thinking to “ the box , ” but a bad thing if you ’re in a situation where your thinking should n’t be limited .
5 . Lists give us a sense of precision even if there ’s no accuracy .
[ see my sidebar comments below for more on the confusion between accuracy and precision ]
Why This List ?
So far this article has been a bit tongue in cheek , but let ’s apply the concept of lists to the real world of business and IT .
There is a tendency among analytical people – IT people included – to boil issues down to numbers .
That works in some cases .
When we ’re trying to design widgets to do 77 operations per second , creating a widget that does 86 operations per second is generally an improvement .
But when it comes to issues that involve people , or issues that affect groups of people , we need to be careful about the way that we overanalyze the situation .
When trying to decide whether to close down an office , there are non-monetary costs that are not given enough weight in the decision .
When trying to hire a new worker there are intangible factors that are much more important than a list of items on a resume .
When trying to change a business there are social and humanistic issues that are often left unresolved .
There ’s a old saying , “ when all you have is a hammer , everything starts to look like a nail . ”
A list is like a hammer , and it should n’t be the only tool in your tool chest .
If you ’re trying to make a decision and your list tells you that the decision ought to go a certain way , double - check that decision with your gut .
How do you feel about that solution ?
Does it make you uncomfortable ?
Does it make your stomach tighten up ?
Does it seem like something is n’t right ?
Then maybe it ’s the wrong decision and you ’re being deceived by your list .
I ’m not talking about something supernatural here ; your gut is telling you that you ’ve left important aspects of the decision off your list , and that you ought to take those aspects into account .
Listen to your gut ; it ’s the voice of the experience that you ’ve gained over the years .
Pick A or B
As a manager I ’ve often had employees come to me for help with a difficult decision .
They ’ll list the reasons why they ought to pick alternative A , and then give me another list of reasons why they ought to pick alternative B .
They ’ll say they ca n’t decide .
I ’ll tell them , “ Pick B . ”
Then I ’ll ask them , “ How do you feel about that decision ? ”
Sometimes they ’ll say , “ I ’m relieved , I felt like B was better , but I could n’t figure out why . ”
Sometimes they ’ll immediately argue with me , saying , “ But I feel like A would be a better choice . ”
I did n’t pick B because I thought it was better ; I picked B arbitrarily to get a reaction .
Most people know intuitively what decision they should make ; they just ca n’t rationalize the decision using a list .
By arbitrarily picking one of the alternatives , I bypassed the list process and got to their sense of what ought to be done .
After they understood their reaction to the arbitrary choice then they could make the real decision .
Conclusion
Be very careful in your use of lists .
Use them to help you with problems that truly have a finite number of possibilities and a finite number of factors that can be translated into numbers .
Do n’t use them for decisions that depend on ethics , human values or world issues .
And to expand your box a little bit , always add an item to each list : “ other things not on this list . ”
Trust your gut ; the experience you ’ve gained is more valuable than you think .
When something feels wrong , try to figure out why .
Then make the best decision based on a combination of logic and your experience .
Lists can be valuable , but they ’re only one tool in your toolbox .
If you rely on them too much , then you wo n’t be taking advantage of your experience , and you wo n’t be making the best decisions for your business and for your life .
Exercises for the Reader
1 . If you ’re a true list person , try to make a list of the situations where a list should n’t be used .
2 . Make a list of your friends and coworkers who like lists , then forward this article to them .
Sidebar : Confusing Accuracy and Precision
People tend to confuse accuracy and precision .
An accurate number is one that corresponds to reality and has been proven in unbiased testing .
A precise number is one that ’s more exact or has more decimal places , whether or not it ’s accurate .
Advertising people in particular know that it sounds more reassuring to say that “ 4 out of 5 dentists recommend ” a certain toothpaste or that a certain soap is “ 99 and 44/100 % pure . ”
Putting a precise number on something makes it sound more accurate and official , even if the number is invented out of thin air .
There ’s an art to putting numbers in ads ; certain numbers are better than others .
Round numbers like 90 % sound like they ’ve been made up , numbers like 97 % sound more reliable , and adding a decimal place or two like 97.49 % makes the number sound more scientific .
Is there a real scientific basis for a number like 97.49 % ?
Maybe , but it might just be a made - up number that ’s deliberately more precise because people think that a more precise number is more accurate .
I can say things like “ here are the five reasons why people love lists ” even though someone else might include seventy - six reasons and have no overlapping items with my list .
The number 5 is precise and so the list of 5 reasons is precise as well .
In being precise , the list fulfills the reader ’s need for structure and it provides a satisfying sense of closure .
But unfortunately the list may not be accurate at all .
Think about that when you put together your own lists .
Jenkem ( or jekem ) is the common name given to an inhalant made by fermenting raw sewage ( i.e. , fecal matter and urine ) , reportedly used as a cheap means of producing a dissociative or hallucinogenic high ( particularly by children in third world countries ) .
A Collier County , Florida , police informational bulletin about Jenkem was widely circulated via e-mail in October 2007 :
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , October 2007 ]
Information Bulletin
New Drug – JENKEM On 09/19/07 Cpl. Disarro received and email from a concerned parent regarding a new drug called “ Jenkem . ”
The parent advised their child learned about this drug through various conversations with
several students at Palmetto Ridge High .
Jenkem originated in Africa and other third world countries by fermenting raw sewage to create a gas which is inhaled to achieve a high .
Jenkem is now a popular drug in American Schools .
Jenkem is a homemade substance which consists of fecal matter and urine .
The fecal matter and urine are placed in a bottle or jar and covered most commonly with a balloon .
The container is then placed in a sunny area for several hours or days until fermented .
The contents of the container will separate and release a gas , which is captured in the balloon .
Inhaling the gas is said to have a euphoric high similar to ingesting cocaine but with strong hallucinations of times past .
Once ingested the onset of the high takes approximately 10 seconds with the most severe hallucinations happening in approximately 20 minutes .
Several articles indicate that the subject immediately passes out after ingesting the gas then regains a magical / hallucinogenic state within seconds of regaining consciousness .
The high has been described by subjects as a feeling of “ being out of it ” and talking to dead people .
The feeling of being “ out of it ” may last for several hours or days .
All subjects who used the Jenkem disliked the taste of sewage in their mouth and the fact that the taste continued for several days .
Slang terms : Winnie , Shit , Runners , Fruit from Crack Pipe , Leroy Jenkems , Might , Butthash , and Waste .
But evidence that jenkem use is a significant phenomenon in the U.S. ( or indeed , anywhere in the world ) or that the substance can even product the effects described is scant .
The informational bulletin was apparently issued merely on the basis of a few high school students ’ having mentioned hearing about jenkem in schoolyard chat , and its contents originated with a source who said he had fabricated them :
The hoopla over Jenkem , also known as Waste , Fruit from Crack Pipe and Butthash , started at the beginning of the school year when a parent of a student who attends Palmetto Ridge High School in Golden Gate Estates heard about the drug from their son .
The parent brought Jenkem to the attention of the school ’s administration , which passed it on to the Sheriff ’s Office .
“ Other than the one memo I received from that parent , I have n’t heard the name of it mentioned , ” Palmetto Ridge Principal Roy Terry said .
“ I ’m sure that something like this can be done , but I have not heard of anybody doing it nor anyone at our school doing it at all . ”
A deputy spoke to some students on the Palmetto Ridge campus and a few had heard of Jenkem .
Still , there have been no reported cases of Jenkem use in Collier County .
Internet pundits were quick to jump on the [ sheriff ’s ] intelligence briefing , noting that the photos and descriptions of the high jenkem produced came from “ Pickwick , ” a contributor to the Web site Totse.com , who later admitted his “ use ” of jenkem was faked using flour , water , beer and Nutella .
“ I never inhaled any poop gas and got high off it , ” he wrote on Sept. 24 .
“ I have deleted the pictures , hopefully no weirdo saved them to his computer .
I just do n’t want people to ever recognize me as the kid who huffed poop gas . ”
Descriptions of jenkem starting appearing in the press in the mid-1990s , most of them merely referencing it in passing , and nearly all of them specifically mentioning its use as being unique to street children in Lusaka , the capital city of Zambia .
The earliest reference to jenkem we ’ve found so far comes from a 1995 Inter Press Service ( IPS ) wire report :
People used to wonder why a gang of scruffy pre-teen boys hung around the sewer ponds of the Garden
Township here [ in Lusaka ] .
The stench is so overpowering that people literally speed through that stretch of the slum area wondering how those who live close by ever got used to it .
The answer has finally dawned on Zambians , and it has left them pondering the desperation of its street children .
The boys at the garden township have discovered “ jenkem , ” a new way of getting high .
The process is simple .
Human excreta is scooped up from the edges of the sewer ponds in old cans and containers which are covered with a polyethylene bag and left to stew or ferment for a week .
The contents are then inhaled and the result is a lungful of biogases and a powerful “ hit . ” Jenkem “ huffers ” bury their entire face in the ghastly mess , gasping it all in .
“ Ba mudala , niyikali kuchila dobo , ” Mukela Nyambe , a fifth grade drop out , told IPS with teary eyes and a running nose .
“ Old man , this is more potent than cannabis . ” The Drug Enforcement Commission ( DEC ) says there is nothing they can do about it .
It may be a terrible health hazard but is completely legal , as are glue or petrol sniffing , previously the most common way street kids numbed their senses .
Jenkem use also turned up in a brief 1999 BBC News article on the subject :
At the Lusaka sewage ponds , two teenage boys plunge their hands into the dark brown sludge , gathering up fistfuls and stuffing it into small plastic bottles .
They tap the bottles on the ground , taking care to leave enough room for methane to form at the top .
A sour smell rises in the hot sun , but the boys seem oblivious to the stench and the foul nature of their task .
They are manufacturing “ Jenkem ” , a disgusting , noxious mixture made from fermented sewage .
It is cheap , potent and very popular among the thousands of street - children in Lusaka .
When they cannot afford glue or are too scared to steal petrol , these youngsters turn to Jenkem as a way of getting high .
“ It lasts about an hour ” , says one user , 16 - year - old Luke Mpande , who prefers Jenkem to other substances .
“ With glue , I just hear voices in my head .
But with Jenkem , I see visions .
I see my mother who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life . ”
Sniffing sewage is a symptom of the desperate plight of Zambia ’s street - children .
There are thought to be some 75,000 in the country as a whole — a number that has doubled in the past eight years .
Nobody knows exactly where the idea for making Jenkem came from , but it has been used by street - children in Lusaka for at least two years .
Nason Banda of the Drug Enforcement Agency is not proud when he says that it is unique to Zambia .
He shudders when he sees the boys at the sewage ponds , scavenging for faecal matter to make Jenkem .
“ It ’s unimaginable ” he says .
“ It hits right at the heart to see a human being coming down a level , to be able to dip his hand into a sewage pond , picking out the material and not caring about anything but the feeling of getting high . ”
Those few mid-1990s articles are the only substantive information about jenkem use we ’ve turned up so far , and even those are difficult to verify .
We ’ve have n’t found anything to substantiate the claim that youngsters in the U.S. are indulging in jenkem to the extent that it is now a “ popular drug in American schools , ” other than some vague statements from drug enforcement officials who assert the phenomenon is real because they ’ve heard rumors about it :

ANNANDALE , Va. ( MarketWatch ) --
The stock market is acting tired .
It 's tried on several occasions in recent trading sessions to convincingly climb above the 14,000 level , and failed .
Take Monday 's trading session , for example .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % got within 27 points of the 14,000 level within the first couple of hours of trading , but fell back by the close - finishing 57 points below the psychologically important level .
The actions Thursday and Friday were n't dissimilar .
On Thursday , the Dow managed to close above the 14 K level , but just barely - by only 0.41 points in fact .
And , as though it had expended every last bit of energy to do that , it collapsed on Friday , falling some 149 points .
This was enough to satisfy the definition of what Michael Burke and John Gray of Investors Intelligence call a " buying climax . "
This happens whenever a security makes a new 12 - month high and then closes the week with a loss .
Buying climaxes " are a sign that stocks are moving from strong hands to weak ones , " the editors argue .
Not only did the overall market experience a buying climax last week , but lots of individual stocks did so as well .
According to Investors Intelligence , in fact , no fewer than 362 issues last week had a buying climax .
What does this mean for the overall market ?
Burke and Gray report that they have found , in their work , that 80 % of the time following a buying climax , prices in four months ' time are lower .
They emphasize that not all of the myriad technical indicators that they follow are flashing sell signals right now .
And it 's furthermore worth noting that even if the bearish four - month forecast of the buying climax turns out to be correct , the stock market does n't have to fall right away .
The bottom line , according to Burke and Gray ?
While what has happened in recent sessions does n't amount to an " immediate sell signal , " it does indicate that stock market risk has risen .
Investor Intelligence 's track record suggests we pay attention to what Burke and Gray have to say .
In fact , their stock - market timing advice is tied for third place right now for performance since 1985 among all the market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest .
Stock market bulls , take note .
Within afew feet of the first boot print made on the Moon , under the ladder on which a U.S. flag was stowed and a commemorative plaque is stillattached , lies a small white cloth pouch .
Inside thatbag , next to a couple of embroidered emblems , medals and a gold olive branch , is a small case .
Contained within that thin metal sheath is a silicon disc aboutthe size of a half dollar coin .
Etched onto that disc , in letters no largerthan one - fourth the width of a human hair , are 73 messages .
Such anitem , as small as it is , hidden as it was , could be mistaken as insignificantand easily forgotten .
And it almost was ... twice , as Tahir Rahman , aKansas - based physician and space history enthusiast reveals in his new book , " We Came In Peace For All Mankind : The Untold Story Of The Apollo 11 Silicon Disc . "
Rahman , whoas a hobby collects Apollo 11 memorabilia , in particular letters and documentssigned by astronaut Neil Armstrong , recently came across a duplicate of thedisc deposited on the Moon and became curious as to its history .
" Ithought I knew most aspects of the Apollo 11 mission , " Rahman wroteto collectSPACE.com .
" When I acquired adisc for my collection , I quickly discovered that only a sentence or two wasmentioned about it in space history books . "
So , Rahman set about fillingin the missing story .
Afterdeciding to plant an Americanflag on the Moon and before the wording was finalized for the plaquedeclaring that " we came in peace for all mankind , " the U.S. StateDepartment authorized NASA to solicit messages of good will from the leaders ofthe world 's nations to be flown and left on the Moon .
There wereonly two minor challenges : NASA did n't know yet how they would archive thosemessages for flight and as it was June 1969 , there was only one month remainingbefore Apollo 11 would launch for the lunar surface .
" I wasamazed at how NASA and the State Department rushed to get these messages beforelaunch , " Rahman said .
In his book , he describes how 116 countries werecontacted but only 73 responded in time .
Some , confused by the request , repliedasking for more details without realizing that the window for their inclusionwas closing fast .
" Inview of our total ignorance of this project , " began a telegram from theKing of Thailand included in " We Came In Peace , " " wouldappreciate any information you can provide concerning NASA 's invitation to sendmessage ... number of countries responding ... methods of recording and method ofdeposit on the Moon . "
Regardingthe ' methods of recording and deposit , ' NASA turned to the Sprague ElectricCompany of North Adams , Massachusetts , for a solution .
No stranger to working for the government -- the company had designed a firing capacitor for the Manhattan Project -- Spraguewas also an established NASA contractor with more than 50,000 components oftheir manufacture already installed in the Apollo11 spacecraft .
Still , thiscontract was unique , requiring a new material , a new invention ( Rahman includesthe text of the patent in the book 's appendix ) and a short turnaround of justthree weeks .
Even after devising the technique to inscribe the microscopicmessages on the 1.5 inch , 99 % - pure silicon disc and delivering a ' final ' version just a week prior to lift off , Sprague was sent scrambling again byNASA to add more nations ' notes that were late to arrive .
Nor werethese messages simple texts .
Some included intricate artwork , such as the Vatican 's message by Pope Paul VI .
Thoughnot visible to the naked eye , a low - power magnification was all that was neededto reveal the mini masterpieces .
" Thefirst time I looked through a microscope at the disc , I was amazed .
There were allthese messages in foreign languages in beautiful gold scripts .
The message fromthe Vatican in the center was especiallystunning with its gold ornate frame , " Rahman described .
On July 11,1969 , just five days before a Saturn Vrocket was set to take off with Neil Armstrong , Buzz Aldrin , and MichaelCollins , Sprague delivered the second , final disc to NASA .
The space agencypackaged the round wafer in a metal case resembling a woman 's make - up compactto protect it during its journey to the Moon .
That in turn was placed in asmall pouch with other commemorative items , which Aldrin would carry in hisspacesuit 's sleeve pocket .
On July 20 , as Collins orbited the Moon , Armstrong and Aldrin landed on its surface .
History 's first moonwalkers had only two and a half hours to explore the lunarterrain , collect 50 moon rocks and set - up scientific instruments .
Theirchecklists also called for them to take part in a few commemorative activities , including erecting the U.S. flag and reading the inscriptionfrom the plaque attached to their lander .
Unscheduled events , such as asurprise call from President Nixon compressed their timeline further .
Thus , as Aldrinwas climbing up the ladder to reenter their spacecraft for their return home , it was Armstrong who remembered the " package " on Aldrin 's arm .
" Howabout that package out of your sleeve ?
Get that ? "
Armstrong called out .
" No , " Aldrin replied , " want it now ? "
" Guessso , " Armstrong said , and with that Aldrin tossed the package –silicon disc tucked inside – down to the Moon 's surface .
Armstrong thennudged it with his foot .
" Okay ? " Armstrong asked of its placement .
" Okay , " responded Aldrin , which was all the pomp and circumstance the disc would everreceive .

During the Power Ranking segment on Monday 's Hardball , Chris Matthews decided to snub Democratic presidential candidate , John Edwards , choosing instead to insert the floundering Rudy Giuliani into the list .
Not one word about Edwards , but Tweety believes that Rudy is still in the hunt for the GOP nod , giving him the last slot in the rankings .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Surprisingly , ( or not )
Matthews had just shown poll numbers from Nevada showing a virtual three way tie among Democrats , but apparently that , being right on the important issues of the day and having a solid primary season thus far , was n't enough to propel Edwards over Rudy -- who is going broke , plummeting in the polls and is throwing everything he 's got into the Florida race to try and save his joke of a campaign .
There 's a real power player if I 've ever seen one .
In other news involving buried candidates , a judge has ruled that Rep. Dennis Kucinich must be included in tomorrow 's Democratic debate on MSNBC .
UPDATE : Phoenix Woman at Firedoglake has some other polling numbers that no one is talking about either .
As a longtime attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice , I can honestly say that I have never been as ashamed of the department and government that I serve as I am at this time .
The public record now plainly demonstrates that both the DOJ and the government as a whole have been thoroughly politicized in a manner that is inappropriate , unethical and indeed unlawful .
The unconscionable commutation of I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby ’s sentence , the misuse of warrantless investigative powers under the Patriot Act and the deplorable treatment of U.S. attorneys all point to an unmistakable pattern of abuse .
In the course of its tenure since the Sept. 11 attacks , the Bush administration has turned the entire government ( and the DOJ in particular ) into a veritable Augean stable on issues such as civil rights , civil liberties , international law and basic human rights , as well as criminal prosecution and federal employment and contracting practices .
It has systematically undermined the rule of law in the name of fighting terrorism , and it has sought to insulate its actions from legislative or judicial scrutiny and accountability by invoking national security at every turn , engaging in persistent fearmongering , routinely impugning the integrity and / or patriotism of its critics , and protecting its own lawbreakers .
This is neither normal government conduct nor “ politics as usual , ” but a national disgrace of a magnitude unseen since the days of Watergate – which , in fact , I believe it eclipses .
In more than a quarter of a century at the DOJ , I have never before seen such consistent and marked disrespect on the part of the highest ranking government policymakers for both law and ethics .
It is especially unheard of for U.S. attorneys to be targeted and removed on the basis of pressure and complaints from political figures dissatisfied with their handling of politically sensitive investigations and their unwillingness to “ play ball . ”
Enough information has already been disclosed to support the conclusion that this is exactly what happened here , at least in the case of former U.S. Attorney David C. Iglesias of New Mexico ( and quite possibly in several others as well ) .
Law enforcement is not supposed to be a political team sport , and prosecutorial independence and integrity are not “ performance problems . ”
In his long - awaited but uninformative testimony concerning the extraordinary firings of U.S. attorneys , Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales did not allay these concerns .
Indeed , he faced a no - win situation .
If he testified falsely regarding his alleged lack of recollection and lack of involvement , he perjured himself and lied to both Congress and the American people .
On the other hand , if he told the truth , he clearly has been derelict in the performance of his duties and is not up to the job .
Either way , his fitness to serve is now in doubt .
Tellingly , in his congressional testimony , D. Kyle Sampson ( the junior aide to whom the attorney general delegated vast authority ) expressed the view that the distinction between “ performance ” considerations and “ political ” considerations was “ largely artificial . ”
This attitude , however , is precisely the problem .
The administration that Sampson served has elided the distinction between government performance and politics to an unparalleled extent ( just as it has blurred the boundaries between the White House counsel ’s office and the attorney general ’s office ) .
And it is no answer to say that U.S. attorneys are political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president .
The point that is lost on those who make this argument is that U.S. attorneys must not serve partisan purposes or advance a partisan agenda – which has nothing to do with requiring them to promote an administration ’s legitimate policy priorities .
As usual , the administration has attempted to minimize the significance of its malfeasance and misfeasance , reciting its now - customary “ mistakes were made ” mantra , accepting purely abstract responsibility without consequences for its actions , and making hollow vows to do better .
However , the DOJ Inspector General ’s Patriot Act report ( which would not even have existed if the administration had not been forced to grudgingly accept a very modest legislative reporting requirement , instead of being allowed to operate in its preferred secrecy ) , the White House - DOJ e-mails , and now the Libby commutation merely highlight yet again the lawlessness , incompetence and dishonesty of the present executive branch leadership .
They also underscore Congress ’ lack of wisdom in blindly trusting the administration , largely rubber - stamping its legislative proposals , and essentially abandoning the congressional oversight function for most of the last six years .
These are , after all , the same leaders who brought us the WMD fiasco , the unnecessary and disastrous Iraq war , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , warrantless domestic NSA surveillance , the Valerie Wilson leak , the arrest of Brandon Mayfield , and the Katrina response failure .
The last thing they deserve is trust .
The sweeping , judicially unchecked powers granted under the Patriot Act should neither have been created in the first place nor permanently renewed thereafter , and the Act – which also contributed to the ongoing contretemps regarding the replacement of U.S. attorneys , by changing the appointment process to invite political abuse – should be substantially modified , if not scrapped outright .
And real , rather than symbolic , responsibility should be assigned for the manifold abuses .
The public trust has been flagrantly violated , and meaningful accountability is long overdue .
Officials who have brought into disrepute both the Department of Justice and the administration of justice as a whole should finally have to answer for it – and the misdeeds at issue involve not merely garden - variety misconduct , but multiple “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” including war crimes and crimes against humanity .
I realize that this constitutionally protected statement subjects me to a substantial risk of unlawful reprisal from extremely ruthless people who have repeatedly taken such action in the past .
But I am confident that I am speaking on behalf of countless thousands of honorable public servants , at Justice and elsewhere , who take their responsibilities seriously and share these views .
And some things must be said , whatever the risk .

DRAFT
One of the most interesting things about Microsoft 's Halloween Memo is the concept of " de- commoditizing " protocols .
This short essay attempts to explain what this means , and what its effects on free software are .
I argue that decommoditized protocols are a very effective weapon against free software in the short term , but in the long term will help free software become more fulfilling to users .
I use the term " protocol " in a rather inclusive sense , encompassing APIs , file formats , etc. , not just the narrow sense of networking protocols - in short , anything that software modules need to be able to work with each other .
Background : free software and proprietary software
Decommoditized protocols are a marker for some fundamental differences between free software and proprietary software , and the philosophy that goes into them .
In an ideal world , software would be created to fulfill user needs , and would be designed to be maximally usable .
However , real software gets created for somewhat different aims , sometimes in line with these user needs , sometimes less so .
Proprietary software is created to make money for its authors .
To a first approximation , the best way to make money is to create a highly usable product , so that users will be willing to pay for it .
However , at least two other factors come into play :
Barriers to competition
Network effects
For proprietary software to be profitable , it must create a proprietary advantage .
Thus , simple software that just gets the job done has one serious disadvantage : a competitor can duplicate it .
Given the extremely low marginal cost of software , this inevitably drives the price to near - zero .
Thus , all truly profitable software has built - in barriers to competition .
And the most effective way of creating those barriers is to exploit network effects .
Software does n't exist in isolation - it 's constantly interworking with other modules , loading and storing files in file formats , calling APIs , and communicating over the network .
In most cases the usefulness of the software depends more on how well it interworks with other stuff than its own intrinsic merits .
For example , even if a new word processor comes along that 's better than Word , many people would be reluctant to switch because there are so many existing documents in Word format .
Free software , by contrast , is written for lots of different reasons , including a simple desire for the software on the part of the author , education , and being part of the free software community .
However , getting the job done expediently is almost always an overriding concern .
Thus , free software tends not to be much more complex than necessary , and making use of existing modules and protocols is often more appealing than reinventing things from scratch .
How to decommoditize a protocol
There are six things you can do :
Make it more complex
Incompletely specify it
Fail to document it
Change it rapidly
Use encumbered intellectual property
Add value ( i.e. solve more problems , better performance )
Of these , only the last really makes the software more useful to users .
Examples of commodity protocols
The very best commodity protocols solve hard problems , but make it look simple .
Two examples stand out : TCP / IP and HTTP / 1.0 .
Neither of these protocols is perfect .
However , their commodity nature greatly helped them take a foothold .
TCP /IP
TCP / IP is the foundation of the Internet .
The protocol dates back to the early days of the ARPANet , and has existed in its present form since September 1981 ( the date of RFC 791 and RFC 793 ) .
This protocol violates all of the first five principles of de-commoditization .
It is simple .
Together , the two RFCs span 130 simply formatted pages , appendices and all .
This is nothing short of astonishing , considering how difficult a problem internetworking is considered to be .
It is completely specified .
IETF protocols in general are well known for specifying " bits on the wire " , and these protocols exemplify IETF practice .
There are no complicated options or variants .
As a consequence , TCP / IP implementations tend to work together very well .
( actually , you need to add a link layer to get a complete TCP / IP implementation .
However , RFC 1055 describes such a link layer ( SLIP ) in six pages .
It is well documented .
The RFCs are a model of clarity , thanks in large part to Jon Postel .
It is stable and mature .
The protocol has been in use since 1981 , and has scaled by many orders of magnitude .
Old implementations still work on the modern Internet .
on the modern Internet .
It is unencumbered .
No patents , copyrights , nor trademarks are infringed by a working TCP / IP implementation .
To say that TCP / IP has been enormously successful would be an understatement .
HTTP/1.0
Another example of a commodity protocol is version 1.0 of HTTP .
Like TCP / IP , it solves a hard problem ( people had been trying to implement global hypertexts for at least three decades before the Web hit ) , but is very simple .
Indeed , a working HTTP / 1.0 server is a weekend hack , and doing a simpleminded client is pretty easy too .
After the success of HTTP / 1.0 , however , the pressure to make the standard more complex became too great to resist .
As a consequence , the HTTP / 1.1 spec is about 167 pages long , and is still in the process of revision at the time of this writing .
A lot of what 's in HTTP / 1.1 is good stuff ( like pipelining ) , but a lot is also needless complexity .
Examples of de-commoditized protocols
The Microsoft Win32 API
Perhaps the most classic example of a decommoditized protocol is the set of API 's , DLL's , and other stuff comprising the Microsoft Win32 environment .
This protocol is extraordinarily complex , incompletely specified ( indeed , there are numerous inconsistencies between Microsoft 's own implementations ) , poorly documented , and subject to rapid change .
As a consequence , the Wine project ( an attempt to implement the Win32 API within Linux ) has found it very rough going .
But they will get there .
RealAudio
Real Networks is a classic example of a company that was able to leverage a proprietary protocol into a successful business .
Real has been upgrading the protocol continuously , improving quality and compression .
They 've used patents , undocumented protocols , rapid change , and added value to protect their product .
It 's also a classic example of the network effect - the more market share the clients have , the more motivation there is to provide content in RealAudio form , and vice versa .
How the IETF resists de-commoditization
IETF process actively resists de-commoditization in a number of ways .
Most importantly , they require two or more interoperable implementations .
This requirement puts a lot of pressure on the proposed standard to be both simple and completely specified .
The process resists de-commoditization in a number of other important ways , as well .
It encourages the use of unencumbered technology when an unencumbered alternative exists .
The entire process is conducted entirely in the open , with free availability of all documents .
And perhaps most importantly , there is a strong tradition of standardizing technically excellent commodity protocols .
UnixTM in the ' 80s : a case study of how de-commoditization can kill you
Back in the ' 80s , many technically oriented people were hoping that Unix would catch on in the PC marketplace .
It was widely recognized as a powerful and mature system , with many important features such as networking , multitasking , and protected memory ( the last of which is still not completely implemented in MacOS and Win9x ) .
Of course , it required a lot more resources to run than the " toy " PC's of the day were capable of , but it was also clear that PC's were getting more powerful by the month .
None of this happened in the ' 80s , though .
I argue that de-commoditization was a major culprit .
All of the Unix vendors wished for their brand of Unix to have a proprietary edge over the others .
Thus , it was to their advantage to add " features " that did n't exist on other Unices .
The goal was to lock developers into one vendor 's brand .
If they were successful , the the resulting software just would n't work well on other systems .
Unix vendors did ok during this time , but were never able to compete effectively against PC operating systems .
It was not until the advent of Linux that Unix really started taking off in the PC world .
I believe that the success of Linux is due in large part to its wholeheartedly embracing the essential commodity nature of Unix .
Indeed , Linux has fairly few features that were not present in Unices of the ' 80s .
The appeal of Linux is that it implements these features extraordinarily well , and with an eye towards compatibility .
Complexity
The design of software is a constant struggle against complexity .
On the one hand , the world is complex , and many difficult problems inherently require complex solutions .
On the other hand , it 's quite easy to add gratuitious complexity .
The key difference is how much of the problem the complex software solves ( i.e. how much complexity is exported to the other side of the protocol ) .
One example of this sometimes subtle distinction is the comparison of GX vs. OpenType layout by Dave Opstad .
Dave points out that for an application to support , say , Tibetan using OpenType , it still has to do a lot of the work .
In the GX model , it 's done for you in the operating system .
Thus , even though OpenType and GX are roughly comparable in complexity , from the point of view of the application GX is " simpler " .
Thus , overall complexity needs to be weighed against how much of the problem is solved .
For a proprietary software organization that has just implemented a complex piece of software , it is tempting to assign a zero cost to the complexity .
However , this would be quite wrong .
Aside from the simple issue of higher maintenance costs , having more complex protocols makes the software far less agile , i.e. it is much more difficult to adapt it to changing market conditions .
Conclusion
In spite of the strong financial incentives and remarkable market successes of de-commoditized protocols , I believe that the future lies with commodity protocols .
Users are becoming frustrated with the complexity , lack of consistency , poor documentation , and lack of choice that de-commoditized systems suffer from .
Conversely , systems based entirely on commodity protocols have had their own share of remarkable successes .
The fact that commodity protocols are simpler and more completely specified than proprietary ones gives free software developers an edge .
Given the disadvantages that free software developers work under ( lack of funding being the most obvious ) , this edge is critically important if free software is to realize its current promise as a viable alternative to proprietary software as a tool for ordinary people to get their work done .

While Pakistanis are protesting against the Martial Law ( or so called Emergency ) and attack on judiciary , the Harvard Law School has announced Medal of Freedom for Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary .
I first heard the news on Geo and could n’t believe if it were really true but later HLS website has also confirmed this news .
Medal of Freedom is the highest honor of Harvard Law School and is awarded to individuals who have worked to uphold the legal systemâ€™s fundamental commitment to freedom , justice , and equality .
According to Harvard Law School ’s Dean Elena Kagan , this award has been conferred to assure the solidarity of Harvard Law School with Justice iftikhar Chaudhary and Pakistan ’s valiant lawyers in their heroic struggle .
The previous recipients of this prestigious award include people like former South African President Nelson Mandela .
I also found it pleasantly surprising that HLS have have NOT used word former Chief Justice for Justice Iftikhar even though our own Pakistani media is calling him former Chief Justice of Pakistan .
According to Harvard Law School website :
Following last week ’s military crackdown in Pakistan and the detention of hundreds of lawyers , the Harvard Law School Association has decided to award Pakistani Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry its highest honor : The Harvard Law School Medal of Freedom .
Chaudhry was detained after he convened the Pakistani Supreme Court to declare the current state of emergency imposed by General Pervez Musharraf to be null and void .
Although Chaudhry has been placed under house arrest and is not free to leave Pakistan , Dean Elena Kagan has reached out to the chief justice regarding the award and hopes that he ’ll be able to come to the Law School to receive it when the state of emergency is lifted .
“ As lawyers who value freedom and the rule of law , we at Harvard Law School want Chief Justice Chaudhry and all of the courageous lawyers in Pakistan to know that we stand with them in solidarity , ” said Kagan .
“ We are proud to be their colleagues in the cause of justice , and we will do all we can to press for the prompt restoration of constitutionalism and legality in Pakistan . ”
Hundreds of lawyers and other critics of Musharraf have been detained since the emergency rule was established more than a week ago .
HLS graduates and practicing lawyers in Pakistan Babar Sattar LL.M. ’ 02 and Tariq Hassan LL.M. ’ 76 S.J.D. ’ 80 have spoken out in protest of the suspension of the constitution .
To raise awareness and further promote discussion about the events in Pakistan , the Harvard South Asia Initiative will be hosting campus - wide events on Friday , November 16 .
The Medal of Freedom was established by Harvard Law School to honor the achievements of individuals who have worked to uphold the legal systemâ€™s fundamental commitment to freedom , justice , and equality .
To symbolize this commitment , the award bears the image of Charles Hamilton Houston , whose leadership of the crusade that culminated in the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education exemplifies the highest ideals of our democracy .
Past recipients of the Medal of Freedom include the members of the Brown v. Board of Education litigation team and former South African President Nelson Mandela .
Is n’t it amazing that just one word NO , which Chief Justice said to Gen Musharraf on March 09 when he tried to remove him , has changed the course of history .
Since then , Justice Iftikhar has probably become one of the most popular man in Pakistan and Gen. Musharraf the most unpopular man .
I wonder if Gen. Musharraf would release him from detention and allow him to collect this prestigious award .
Pakistani are not honored by world ’s top institutes like HLS everyday .
DIGG THIS
In Saudi Arabia , a young woman is violently gang - raped by strangers .
Her rapists receive a light punishment , but she receives punishment as well .
When she and her lawyer complain about it , her punishment is increased and the lawyer is disciplined for making such a fuss .
The rape victim 's punishment has yet to be carried out .
In the meantime , the whole episode is an international outrage .
In the United States in the State of New York , a young woman is violently raped at knifepoint by a stranger .
Her rapist receives a light punishment but she receives punishment as well .
When she and her lawyer complain about it , her punishment is increased and the lawyer is disciplined for making such a fuss .
In the United States case , the rape victim is now in prison .
Nobody seems to be too worried about it , though , except her and her lawyer .
Do n't believe me ?
It 's all a matter of public record .
The rape victim's name is Sephora Davis .
She was prosecuted in Livingston County , New York by District Attorney Thomas E. Moran under indictment number 2004 - 276 .
Mr. Moran explicitly stated in court papers that it did n't matter that Sephora Davis was raped .
The courts of the United States agreed with Mr. Moran and put Sephora Davis in prison , where she remains , at the Albion Correctional Facility .
Her inmate number is 07 - G-0011 .
Her lawyer is …….me .
Supposedly , the reason for the outrage over what occurred in Saudi Arabia is that the regime there " oppresses women " .
Why is there no outrage over the exact same thing happening in the supposedly much more enlightened People 's Republic of New York ?
Because in theory , we do n't oppress women ; we just worship the state , and the state 's power .
We nurture it , feed it , justify it , lie and cheat for it .
We adore it and nothing else .
So in that context , oppressing women is okay .
You see , Sephora Davis ' rapist was an agent of the state — a police informant who , along with his police officer sponsor , falsely implicated her in his own crime — an armed robbery he and two accomplices committed shortly after the rape .
By that time Sephora had been drugged and was passed out in the car .
That has also never been disputed and is also a matter of public record .
From there , this is how it works in New York .
The police informant gets backed up by the police , naturally .
Then the District Attorney backs up the police .
Then the court backs up the District Attorney .
Then the appellate courts back up the lower court .
Yes , this is how political power works .
But sometimes it gets embarrassing .
I mean , look what has happened in Saudi Arabia .
Of course , Saudi Arabia is an ignorant and backward country .
In their courts they publicly acknowledge that the young woman before them was raped and carry out their judicial atrocity in the light of day .
What a bunch of rubes .
We in New York are much more sophisticated , so here our judges write court opinions pretending that no one ever said anything about Sephora Davis being raped , then we put her in prison where she gets her number .
And now we can forget about it , because she is a " criminal " , and who cares about them ?
You'd think the " media " , the venerable " fourth estate " , would be all over this .
Think again .
The local newspaper barely mentioned the little rape problem — although that is at least more than the courts would do .
And in a remarkable inversion of their usual journalistic policy they refused to name the rapist even though they named his victim .
I think it 's because a rape is n't a rape unless and until the government says so through some authorized " official " .
Go to Hillary Clinton , you say ?
The front - running presidential candidate and junior United States Senator from New York ?
The feminist ideologue , natural champion of rape victims ?
Sephora 's mother did , but …. not a chance .
Hillary will spout off about the woman in Saudi Arabia , but the task of siding with a lone constituent against the state 's entire legal power structure is politically problematic , even if that constituent is a rape victim .
Besides , the Saudis are such an easy target — and so conveniently far away , too .
Hillary understands how political power works .
On to the presidency , I guess .
But surely there are appeals and whatnot ?
Oh , sure — well , sort of .
There are endless pleas you can make — all equally meaningless , devoid of substance and futile .
In practical terms , it is fair to say that criminal convictions in New York are easy to get and never overturned — at least not for people who are actually innocent .
The " system " is broken underneath a hollow façade .
How do you think something like this can happen in the first place ?
Do n't take my word for it , though .
It has been scientifically established .
On that subject , while I certainly admire the Innocence Project and their work very much , I have to respectfully disagree with their conclusion that the legislature can do something about the broken system .
The problems run far deeper than misinterpreting evidence or misapplying the law .
It 's more like there 's no genuine concept of " evidence " or " law " at all .
In most cases , making " arguments " before a judge in New York is like trying to reason with a barbarian , a simple creature that can understand only force : as a general rule , do n't bother .
And you cannot cure barbarism by passing new laws — barbarians can't really read them .
Fortunately , New York is emptying out of civilized human beings .
The young , especially , are leaving in droves .
Those few that remain are increasingly fodder for a ludicrously overbuilt and fundamentally parasitic prison system , overfed by petty tyrant prosecutors like Mr. Moran .
Of course , the civilized world understands that dysfunctional justice systems go hand - in - hand with the economic decline so painfully evident in the region .
But an economy is not grounded in force , so this simple connection is beyond the comprehension of New York in the early 21st century .
We speak only the language of power .
And in that language , prosecutors and judges are " public servants " and their victims have prison inmate numbers .
Feminists have long argued that rape is about power , not sex .
I used to think that was bullshit .
November 24 , 2007
The Best of John M. Regan , Jr .
On Dec. 18 , the five commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission met in Washington , D.C. , and , by a 3 to 2 vote , passed new regulations that would allow more media consolidation .
This , despite the U.S. public ’s increasing concern over the nation ’s media being controlled by a few giant corporations .
Dissident FCC Commissioner Michael Copps said of the decision : “ We generously ask big media to sit on Santa ’s knee , tell us what it wants for Christmas , and then push through whatever of these wishes are politically and practically feasible .
No test to see if anyone ’s been naughty or nice .
Just another big , shiny present for the favored few who already hold an FCC license — and a lump of coal for the rest of us .
Happy holidays ! ”
It was Bush - appointed FCC Chairman Kevin Martin , now just 41 years old , who rammed through the rule changes .
He has served President Bush well .
As deputy general counsel for the Bush - Cheney campaign in 2000 , he was active during the Florida recount .
Before that he worked for Kenneth Starr at the Office of Independent Counsel during the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
Rumor has it that he may run for governor of his native North Carolina .
His wife , Cathie Martin , was a spokeswoman for Vice President Dick Cheney in the midst of the scandal around the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
She now works on Bush ’s communications staff .
The federal regulation in question is the newspaper - broadcast cross -ownership ban .
It has for decades prevented the same company from owning both a television or radio station in a town as well as a newspaper .
Underlying this ban is the core concept of the public interest .
Copps could n’t have been clearer : “ Today ’s decision would make George Orwell proud .
We claim to be giving the news industry a shot in the arm — but the real effect is to reduce total newsgathering . ”
Mergers will result in newsroom layoffs and less , not more , coverage of local issues .
Martin ’s new rule is also going to hurt the diversity of the U.S. media .
Juan Gonzalez , former president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists , recently testified at a congressional hearing on media ownership .
He said , “ Even as our nation has become ever more diverse racially and ethnically … minority ownership of the broadcast companies … has remained at shockingly low levels .
…
Direct experience has shown us that ownership matters when it comes to … a diversity of voices and meeting the news and information needs of minority communities . ”
Gonzalez pointed out that the new rule will allow the 19 minority - owned TV stations in the country ’s top 20 cities to be targeted for takeovers by newspapers , further reducing minority ownership .
There is a reason that journalism is the sole profession explicitly protected in the U.S. Constitution .
As a check and balance on government , it is essential to the functioning of a democratic society .
As Thomas Jefferson famously stated , “ Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter . ”
By eliminating the newspaper - broadcast cross-ownership ban , Martin claims to be saving newspapers .
In a New York Times Op - Ed piece , he writes : “ In many towns and cities , the newspaper is an endangered species . …
If we do n’t act to improve the health of the newspaper industry , we will see newspapers wither and die . ”
As Copps pointed out in his scathing dissent to the rule change , “ We shed crocodile tears for the financial plight of newspapers — yet the truth is that newspaper profits are about double the S&P 500 average . ”
The problem facing Martin and his big media friends is n’t that newspapers are unprofitable ; it ’s that they are simply not as profitable as they used to be .
This is in part because of the Internet .
People no longer have to rely on the newspaper to post or read classified ads , for example , with free online outlets like Craigslist .
The media system in the United States is too highly concentrated and serves not the public interest but rather the interests of moguls like Rupert Murdoch and Sumner Redstone , who controls CBS / Viacom .
Media corporations that will benefit from Martin ’s handout are the same ones that acted as a conveyor belt for the lies of the Bush administration about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
We need a media that challenges the government , that acts as a fourth estate , not for the state .
We need a diverse media .
The U.S. Congress has a chance to overrule Martin and the FCC , and to keep the newspaper - broadcast cross - ownership ban in place .
It should do so immediately , before the consolidated press leads us into another war .

One of the hardest parts of meeting someone new , especially someone who has captured your romantic interest , is finding ways to break the ice without sounding cheesy .
Part of the reason this is difficult is because some really useful questions to ask are asked so often that they almost become parodies … things like “ So , what do you do for a living ? ” or “ What do you like to do for fun ? ”
The solution is to come up with creative questions ( preferably before you meet ) that get them started talking , but which they are not commonly asked .
It really does n’t matter what topic , as long as it ’s something which most people can relate to , something that gets them to talk about themselves and their experiences .
If you do n’t know what to ask , read the examples below … you can actually use these directly , or use them for inspiration to come up with your own .
Either way will work … the key is just to get them talking , to get a flow of conversation started .
If money were no object , what kind of car would you drive ?
Very nearly everyone drives … and very nearly everyone has thought about what their “ dream car ” would be .
This question lets you find out a little bit about them ( what kind of car they like ) and gets them talking .
You can continue by asking why , or possibly going to what kind of car they would never buy .
Alternatives : Almost anything works here , just start with “ If money were no object , what kind of blank would you get ? ”
What ’s the strangest thing you ’ve seen ?
Here ’s a chance to get them talking and laughing … and getting someone laughing is an easy way to lower their walls .
This question works particularly well if you have a truly bizarre story of your own to tell .
Alternatives : Replace strangest with any other – est … it could be biggest , loudest , etc .
What ’s the best restaurant you ’ve ever been to ?
This is a good way to find out what kind of food they like , if you ’re thinking about asking them out at some point .
It also might give you an idea of a good place to eat , whether or not it ’s with the person you ’re talking to at the moment .
Alternatives :
You can substitute other things for restaurant , but most things have less general appeal , and the ones that do n’t are usually asked all the time .
This is one where if you want to change it , you ’ll have to base it on the particular person you ’re talking to at the moment .
Where is the most exotic place you ’ve ever been ?
This is a chance for them to open up and tell a story … and that lowers their walls .
If you ’ve been to the same place , you ’ve got huge bonus points … shared experiencesare the fastest way to get closer to someone .
Alternatives : Most exotic can be replaced with farthest , most dangerous , etc .
What is the biggest event , by number of people , that you have seen in person ?
Another chance for them to tell a story , and another chance for you to have similar experiences .
One warning , though … do n’t ask questions like this and always have abigger , better story to tell … even if you really do , it will make them feel small .
Alternatives : Replace biggest with something like most expensive .
What is the dumbest thing you ’ve ever seen someone do ?
People almost invariably like to tell stories aboutthe dumb things they ’ve seen , particularly when it was someone else that did it .
If you ’re really lucky , the person might tell you about the dumbest thing they have done … you can lead the conversation in this direction by telling them the dumbest thing you ’ve done after they tell their story about someone else .
Alternatives : Really you can replace dumbest with nearly anything … nicest , weirdest , most spectacular , most dangerous , etc .
Very little gets someone to really go off like dumbest , though .
What is the most expensive single item you ’ve ever bought ?
You might want to add words to exclude houses and cars , it ’s up to you … this question gives you an idea of what the person thinks is worth paying extra for , what is important to them .
That can be amazingly valuable both to continue the conversation right then , and in any future times you meet .
Alternatives :
What purchase did you regret the most is a related question that can be interesting … but it may bring up bad memories , and that ’s not really what you want when you ’re breaking the ice .
You might go for the most fun purchase .
What is worst tasting thing you ’ve ever eaten ?
This is another thing that people usually remember quite clearly and do n’t mind sharing .
It can even be another shared experience , if you ’ve eaten the same thing … particularly if you also did n’t like it .
Alternatives : Most delicious , hottest , most sour … any of the major factors in taste can be used .
What is the most vivid / realistic dream you ’ve ever had ?
This is one that can also tell you a lot , but it ’s also more dangerous than most on this list … not everyone is comfortable sharing their dreams
If they are , though , this can get you past a lot of walls they might have , moving you pretty much straight to the “ friends ” level of relationship ( and not in the bad way , for those seeking romantic relationships ) .
Alternatives :
You could also ask what movie ( or movie character ) they most identified with … it ’s basically probing for a deeper opening up .
If you get it , great … if you do n’t , they may push you farther away than when you started .

“ Running a Web site and a search engine is one thing , ” said Mr. Weide of IDC .
“ But developing a phone is a whole different game .
It will not be easy for them . ”

Mr. Weide added that Google ’s impact on the industry will depend to a large extent on its ability to sign deals with wireless carriers that distribute hundreds of millions of phones each year and often control what software and services run on them .
Some carriers , especially in the United States , are likely to give Google a cool reception .
Companies like Verizon Wireless and AT&T have spent billions of dollars building and upgrading their networks , establishing relationships with customers , subsidizing handsets and creating their own mobile Internet portals .
Now they want to make sure those investments pay off , in part , through mobile advertising , and they see Google and other search engines , who are after the same ad dollars , as competitors .
As a result , most carriers in the United States have chosen to shun the major search engines for now .
Instead , they have promoted the search engines and ad systems of small technology companies like JumpTap and Medio Systems , whose services they can stamp with their own brands .
Most carriers declined to comment on Google ’s plans .
But Arun Sarin , the chief executive of Britain ’s Vodafone Group , which offers the Google service on its phones , said it was not clear what compelling functions Google would offer that are not already available .
“ What is it that is missing in life that they are going to fulfill ? ” Mr. Sarin said .
“ It is not a no - brainer .
You can reach Google already through a number of devices .
You do n’t need a Google phone to do that . ”
Google ’s desire to loosen the carriers ’ control over their networks has hardly been a secret .
The company recently lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to impose rules on any carrier who wins a coming auction for valuable wireless spectrum .
The rules , which the F.C.C. adopted despite opposition from Verizon and others , require that the network using a portion of that spectrum be open to any handset and software applications from any company .

Russian crooks have unleashed an artificial intelligence , called CyberLover , that poses as a would - be paramour in sex chat rooms , enticing randy gentlemen to reveal personal information that can then be put to criminal use .
Amazingly , the bot appears to be successful in convincing targets that it ’s a real person .
Reports Ina Fried :
The artificial intelligence of CyberLover ’s automated chats is good enough that victims have a tough time distinguishing the “ bot ” from a real potential suitor , [ security software firm ] PC Tools said .
The software can work quickly too , establishing up to 10 relationships in 30 minutes , PC Tools said .
It compiles a report on every person it meets complete with name , contact information , and photos … Among CyberLover ’s creepy features is its ability to offer a range of different profiles from “ romantic lover ” to “ sexual predator . ”
It can also lead victims to a “ personal ” Web site , which could be used to deliver malware …
The software company believes that CyberLover ’s creators plan to make it available worldwide in February .
Could it be that the Turing Test has finally been beaten – by a sex machine , no less – and that a true artificial intelligence is on the loose ?
Maybe so , but , as I indicate in the title to this post , this breakthrough will , like Barry Bonds ’s homer record , have to carry an asterisk .
After all , studies show that when people enter a state of sexual arousal their intelligence drops precipitously .
I wo n’t go so far as to say that CyberLover is cheating , but I will argue that it has an unfair advantage over other AI wannabes .
UPDATE : A commenter over at Hacker News corrects my misrepresentation of the Turing Test : “ In a _true_ Turing Test , the humans are n’t blindly conversing with the assumption that their conversant is human — they ’re actively seeking to verify the presence of a human . ”
That asterisk is looking bigger all the time .
House Dem defends leadership decision to quash impeachment Nick Juliano
Published : Friday November 9 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This A House Democratic leader defended the party 's decision not to pursue the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney , saying an effort to oust the man who is among the most vocal pushing for war with Iran is " not even in the top 10 " of voters ' priorities and would benefit Republicans at the polls next year .
In a heated exchange Thursday with liberal radio host Ed Schultz , Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , the deputy Democratic whip , said the party , which dramatically swept into power last year , was more focused on other priorities .
Voters asked Congress " to focus on withdrawing our troops from iraq , on expanding healthcare access .
...
They did not ask us to spend any time on the impeachment of the vice president , " Wasserman Schultz insisted .
Impeachment would prevent Congress from addressing issues like the war in Iraq , healthcare , renewable energy and the environment .
" That is all the media would focus on .
...
And to what end ? " she asked , arguing that Bush was the real problem and removing Cheney would n't make a significant difference with only a year until the next election .
" We need to tough out the next 12 months and focus hard on the results - oriented Democratic Congress that we know we are , " she said .
Schultz argued that results were precisely what was lacking -- especially Democrats ' inability to force a change in course in the president 's war in Iraq .
" This president has gotten everything that he 's wanted from the Democratic Congress since the day you folks took power , " the host charged .
Schultz said Democrats need to stand firm and refuse to pass any more funding for the war in Iraq ; he said Cheney 's impeachment might be the country 's best hope to avoid war in Iran .
This week , Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich brought a privileged resolution to the House floor that would have impeached Cheney .
Republicans foiled an attempt by Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer to kill the motion , and the bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee .
Wasserman Schultz voted for Hoyer 's motion to table the impeachment bill , and she was defending that vote on Schultz 's show Thursday .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said Conyer 's committee would not begin impeachment hearings , although several members of the committee are co-sponsors of Kucinich 's impeachment resolution .
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , who 's district neighbors Wasserman Schultz's , called for the committee to " schedule impeachment hearings immediately " .
" I believe Robert Wexler is off base , " Wasserman Schultz said .

Today , unfortunately , CNN joined ranks with Fox News , known to freethinking individuals as “ Faux News “ , or my favorite , “ The Republican Learning Channel . ”
If you want to hear political spin and propaganda , then keep your TV tuned to Fox , and now , it appears that CNN is joining their ranks , leaving citizens who seek truth and facts with very few alternatives other than turning off their TV’s and reading the alternative news on the Internet .
Rather than rewriting a story that has already been excellently documented , I ’ll quote a few paragraphs of importance and allow the readers to see the actual video , a partial transcript of the Glenn ( Neo- Conservative )
Beck segment when he teams - up with ex-Marxist David Horowitz .
I am choosing a few choice excerpts , but this is a site you will want to visit to get the whole story , not my interpretation thereof :
Complaints Flood CNN After Beck Smears Ron Paul Supporters
As Terrorists
Why are Glenn Beck and David Horowitz a threat to America ? a )
They openly call for the U.S. military to be used to suppress freedom of speech , a complete violation of the first amendment and everything that America stands for .
This in itself exposes them as anti-American traitors .
b)
They openly state , without any evidence whatsoever to substantiate the claim , that Lew Rockwell , libertarian and anti-war groups are “ totally in bed with the Islamofascists , ” which could prompt their nutcase followers into physical violence and perhaps even assassination attempts against anti-war and libertarian leaders as well as Ron Paul supporters .
c)
If there are real terrorist groups in America , as we are constantly told , then Beck and Horowitz are diverting attention away from them by fingering peaceful protest and activist groups , leaving genuine terrorists under less scrutiny by law enforcement and the FBI .
Beck and Horowitz are the only ones doing harm to America - they are anti-American traitors .
MUCH MORE
At first glance , you may believe that CNN is simply being “ fair and balanced ” by hosting Glenn Beck ’s anti-American right - wing ranting and distortion of the truth - but the river runs much deeper than that !
Even before this incident happened , I was working on an article where I caught CNN distorting the truth today , for the second time in less than two weeks LINK , something that Media Matters normally attends to - however , the breach of trust was so obvious by their omission of pertinent facts in an important story that I decided to expose them myself in case Media Matters did n’t catch their obvious distortion of the facts by omitting known and relevant issues that would have entirely changed the meaning and perception of the story they were reporting upon .
This is their version of the news :
Telecoms that helped warrantless spying could get off the hook WASHINGTON ( CNN ) —
A bill that would grant immunity to telecommunications companies helping out in a no-warrant eavesdropping program authorized by President Bush and reinstate some court oversight to surveillance was OK ’d by a Senate panel Thursday .
The Senate Intelligence Committee ’s 13 - 2 vote on Thursday could heighten tensions about the disputed program between the White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will consider the measure next .
After the 9/11 attacks ( Emhasis added . ) , President Bush had authorized the National Security Agency to intercept communications of terror suspects overseas with people inside the United States without obtaining warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court .
MUCH MORE
As I have pointed out before , which CNN is well aware of , there is evidence that President Bush began his planning and implementation of illegal wiretaps long before 9 - 11 , and in fact began the second month he was in office !
The issue has been well - documented , CNN knew it , but rather than reporting the whole story so America would be apprised of the truth , CNN has now mirrored Faux News by refusing to report information that wo n’t reflect negatively upon the Bush administration ; why you ask ?
Who knows , and their rationale for hiding information from the public can only be speculated upon , however , whether it ’s because of rank cowardice , complicity with the Bush administration , or the insistence of their owners , Time Warner , the result is the same ; Americans are being mislead by a news organization that once was one of the better media outlets on the MSM .
Ever since Ted Turner sold CNN , there ’s been a downward spiral of the credibility of CNN , another symptom that fascism is rearing its ugly head in the United States !
What irritates me is that I and other Bloggers have posted this information before ; in fact , I even wrote an article that detailed this incident : With This New Evidence , Congress Must Impeach Bush and Cheney
This was the reference I quoted which is far from being unknown , and I have made it a point to bring this matter to CNN ’s attention , but they still choose to ignore factual evidence that if was included in the above article - would have changed the scope and emphasis of the story itself !
Bush administration was either incompetent or is guilty of malfeasance

New Chinese missiles
China ’s military this week quietly showed a new medium - range missile that is part of Beijing ’s rapid military buildup of nuclear and conventional forces , according to a new think tank report .
Chinese Internet sites posted a photograph of what specialists say is the new Dong Feng - 25 missile that could be used by China in a conflict with Taiwan , or to target U.S. forces in Japan and the region , said Richard Fisher , a specialist on the Chinese military and author of the forthcoming report by the International Assessment and Strategy Center in the Washington area .
“ The apparent new medium - to intermediate - range missile constitutes another surprise ” from China ’s military , the report said .
“ China ’s missile threat is likely to strengthen resolve in Tokyo and possibly Delhi to proceed with increased missile defense cooperation with Washington . ”
Little is known about the new missile but the report stated it could have a range of up 1,860 miles or more depending on the warhead .
One Chinese Web site that first mentioned the missile on Sunday stated that it has a range of about 2,000 miles and can carry up to three multiple nuclear warheads .
The report also stated that China ’s normally secretive military has revealed a new version of the DF - 21 short - range missile , also known as the CSS - 6 , that is outfitted with an advanced guided warhead .
“ The significance of these revelations is that China is upgrading its regionally targeted missile forces , which will soon pose additional threats to , among others , India , Russia , Japan , South Korea and to U.S. forces in the East Asian region , ” Mr. Fisher said in an interview .
Mr. Fisher said the shorter - range DF - 21 missile is China ’s first anti-ship ballistic missile designed to attack U.S. aircraft carriers and other warships .
New Chinese radar and photographic satellites are signs that the new anti-ship ballistic missile may be close to initial operational status , the report said .
The new anti-ship ballistic missile poses a serious threat to U.S. ships because “ the U.S. does not have anti-missile capabilities to defend large U.S. ships against this threat , so vulnerable targets , most importantly aircraft carriers , will have to remain out of missile range in order to survive , ” the report said .
The report also discloses for the first time that China has deployed its third Type 093 nuclear - powered attack submarine , which also was pictured for the first time this week on a Chinese Web site .
China ’s government has said nothing about the new missiles and submarines .
CIA sabotage
Former Inside the Ring co-author Rowan Scarborough has written a new book revealing a key reason the Bush administration pressed hard for the 2006 deal for the United Arab Emirates - based Dubai Ports World to take over management of several U.S. ports .
According to Mr. Scarborough , the administration wanted the deal to go through because the UAE government had agreed to let the United States post agents inside its global port network who could report on world shipping .
Dubai Ports currently runs port facilities at key U.S. intelligence targets , including Venezuela , China , Pakistan , India and Saudi Arabia .
“ Dubai Ports , in essence , was going to become an agent of CIA , ” Mr. Scarborough said in an interview .
“ The arrangement is helping us detect whether any kind of terror contraband was being moved around . ”
The management deal to run ports at New York , New Jersey , Philadelphia , Baltimore , New Orleans and Miami was initially approved by the Treasury Department - run Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , but was eventually scuttled in 2006 after pressure from Congress .
Both Republicans and Democrats raised concerns that the deal would affect U.S. port security since al Qaeda had used UAE as a major financial base for its terrorist network .
The book , “ Sabotage : America ’s Enemies Within the CIA , ” highlights the battle between the agency and the Pentagon over Saddam Hussein ’s support for terrorism , and how CIA careerists subverted CIA Director Porter J. Goss ’ efforts to transform the CIA .
It is also critical of CIA intelligence support for the Iraq war , and reports that Justice Department officials think the CIA itself leaked that they had referred the press exposure of CIA officer Valerie Plame to Justice , which triggered the administration ’s biggest political crisis .
Deadly hesitation
A U.S. military officer said the Army is still putting out rules of engagement ( ROE ) that are dangerous and could cause U.S. soldiers to get killed in the war on terrorism .
Gen. David H. Petraeus , the commander in Iraq , recently expressed concerns that soldiers fighting insurgents and terrorists do not have clear guidance on the use of force .
One recent session at the Army Judge Advocate General ’s Legal Center and School in Charlottesville included an instructor who taught one class that “ we must hesitate and be careful when we pull the trigger , ” the officer said .
“ They are teaching that even following ROE , while not illegal , may not be a good idea , ” the officer said .
“ They are teaching that to win the hearts and minds that we may have to take casualties through hesitations . ”
A Defense official said the problem with hesitation is that it is similar to saying that if a solider is confronted by an armed terrorist , he may have a legal right under the rules to fire but that he should hesitate on the theory that the terrorist could be won over through appealing to their “ hearts and minds . ”
The official said such advice is deadly .
“ As statistics show , hesitation in a situation like this gets a soldier killed , ” the official said .
“ Second , ‘ hearts and minds ’ in counterinsurgency operations refers to winning the hearts and minds of the innocent civilians through protecting them from terrorists . ”
The official said Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr. should find the instructor and have him fired .
“ Either that or teach him the words to ‘ Kumbaya ’ and send him into al Qaeda territory in Iraq , unarmed , ” the official said .
Bin Laden hunt
Former Defense official Michael Maloof wrote to comment on the frustrations expressed last week by U.S. intelligence officials on not being able to find al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , despite the belief that he is still alive and hiding somewhere in a remote area of Pakistan .
“ While not surprising , I still believe that he is alive and well in the eastern part of Iran in Baluchistan , ” said Mr. Maloof , noting that he stated this to senior Pentagon policy official Douglas J. Feith in April 2002 .
The reason : the most recent videotape of bin Laden showed a well - nourished terrorist who appeared relatively healthy .
“ He could not look that well or obtain such quality videotaping in Waziristan , ” Mr. Maloof said .
The Defense Intelligence Agency acknowledged two years ago that al Qaeda had a training camp in eastern Iran , Mr. Maloof said to bolster his case .
Mr. Maloof was part of the special Pentagon analytical team that clashed with CIA analysts over links between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein ’s regime .
Mr. Maloof also challenged the comment before the House Armed Services Committee by Deputy Director of National Intelligence Thomas Fingar , who testified that al Qaeda will not use cell phones in remote areas of Pakistan .
“ It ’s mountainous , highly remote with no means of installing cell phone towers , ” Mr. Maloof said .
“ I have the same problem on the Skyline Drive .
Unless Pakistan , of all places , has a better cell phone service than we do , there will be no cell phones up there , and [ bin Laden ] knows better than to use a satellite phone . ”
Mr. Fingar “ must think we ’re all idiots , ” Mr. Maloof said .

Today , a victory was won for privacy advocates and bloggers everywhere , as a school board member failed to convince New York State courts that Google should be required to hand over details about anonymous commenters on a Blogger blog .
Recently , a lot of flak has been tossed in a lot of different directions , much of it towards Google and Yahoo ( but of course we can't forget Facebook ) in regards to their various and often conflicting stances on privacy .
Today , though , Google took a position on privacy that was commendable in that they refused to hand over anonymized data unless the person to whom the data belonged to consented to its release .
Marcy Friedman , the Supreme Court Justice presiding over the case , ultimately agreed , stating that a decision against Google would have a " chilling effect on protected speech . "
The whole ordeal seems to be over anonymous comments on a blog post regarding how public funds should be dispersed .
The original blog post is fairly straightforward , but the comments were accusations baseless and ad hominem .
Those that have been on the internet for more than twenty minutes or so know that this is not out of the ordinary , and it reminds me of the immortal words from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back : " The Internet is a communication tool used the world over where people can come together to [ complain ] about movies and share pornography with one another . "
We would n't want to lose that , now would we ?

HUD Sends New Orleans Bulldozers and $ 400,000 Apartments for the Holidays
By Bill Quigley .
Bill is a human rights lawyer and law professor at Loyola University New Orleans .
You can contact him at Quigley@loyno.edu .
Bill is one of the lawyers for displaced residents .
On the 12th day before Christmas , the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) is planning to unleash teams of bulldozers to demolish thousands of low - income apartments in New Orleans .
Despite Katrina causing the worst affordable housing crisis since the Civil War , HUD is spending $ 762 million in taxpayer funds to tear down over 4600 public housing subsidized apartments and replace them with 744 similarly subsidized units – an 82 % reduction .
HUD is in charge and a one person HUD employee makes all the local housing authority decisions .
HUD took over the local housing authority years ago – all decisions are made in Washington DC .
HUD plans to build an additional 1000 market rate and tax credit units – which will still result in a net loss of 2700 apartments to New Orleans – the remaining new apartments will cost an average cost of over $ 400,000 each !
Affordable housing is at a critical point along the Gulf Coast .
Over 50,000 families still living in tiny FEMA trailers are being systematically forced out .
Over 90,000 homeowners in Louisiana are still waiting to receive federal recovery funds from the Road Home .
In New Orleans , hundreds of the estimated 12,000 homeless have taken up residence in small tents across the street from City Hall and under the I -10 .
In Mississippi , poor and working people are being displaced along the coast to allow casinos to expand and develop shipping and other commercial activities .
Two dozen ministers criticized the exclusion of renters and low - income homeowners from post - Katrina assistance : “ Sadly we must now bear witness to the reality that our Recovery Effort has failed to include a place at the table ... for our poor and vulnerable . ”
The bulldozers have not torn down any buildings yet and New Orleans public housing residents vow to resist .
" If you try to bulldoze our homes , we 're going to fight , " promised resident Sharon Jasper .
" There 's going to be a war in New Orleans . "
Resident resistance is being expanded by allies from a coalition of groups who see the destruction of public housing without one for one replacement harming all renters and low - income homeowners .
Kali Akuno , of the Coalition to Stop Demolition , explains why many people who do not live in public housing are joining residents in this fight .
“ In the past two years , New Orleans has faced a series of social crises that have struck a blow to our collective vision for a more just and equitable city , not simply one that is more inviting to elites .
Yet none of these crises has been as uniquely urgent as this .
What is at stake with the demolition of public housing in New Orleans is more than just the loss of housing units : it destroys any possibility for affordable housing in New Orleans for the foreseeable future .
Without access to affordable housing , thousands of working class New Orleanians will be denied their human right to return . ”
A federal court has refused to stop the scheduled demolitions .
Residents offered evidence to show the three story garden - style buildings were structurally sound and pointed out that the local housing authority itself documented that it would cost much less to repair and retain the apartments than demolish and reconstruct a small fraction of them .
The New York Times architecture critic described them as “ low scale , narrow footprint and high quality construction . ”
HUD promised to subject plans for demolition to 100 days of scrutiny – yet approved demolition with no public input in less than two days .
The court acknowledged some questions about the fairness of the process but concluded that if the demolitions turn out to be illegal , residents can always recover money damages later .
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that requires one for one replacement of any public housing demolished , but Senator David Vitter ( R - La ) has stopped the Senate version cold .
The Institute for Southern Studies reports that the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act , S. 1668 , sponsored by Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) had the support of the entire state 's delegation and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development -- until September , when HUD and Vitter suddenly withdrew their backing .
There 's been much speculation over Vitter 's sudden about - face on the measure , especially since he 's been reluctant to disclose his objections in much detail .
The Congressional Quarterly Weekly offers partisan politics as one explanation for his actions : “... [ P]olitical experts say the senatorial flap is not unexpected , given Louisiana 's rough - and - tumble politics and Vitter and Landrieu 's chilly relationship .
Landrieu is up for re-election next year and has emerged as the GOP 's top target among incumbent senators , in part because of the state 's rightward shift in recent elections .
" The fact that Mary Landrieu is widely identified as the most vulnerable Democrat coming into the next election cycle , you certainly do n't want to give her big victories in helping the state , " said Kirby Goidel , a professor of political science at Louisiana State University .
" He probably feels safe enough to hold it up as long as it's not too obviously political and he has some policy - related cover .
He 's a pretty hardball political player . "
Republican interests are clearly not served by the return of all African - Americans to New Orleans .
Louisiana was described before Katrina as a “ pink state ” – one that went Democratic some times and Republican others .
The tipping point for Louisiana Democrats was the deeply Democratic African American city of New Orleans .
Immediately after the hurricanes struck , one political analyst said “ the Democratic margin of victory in Louisiana is sleeping in the Astrodome in Houston . ”
Tiny turnout by African - American voters in New Orleans in recent elections has led white Republican interests to calculate immediate new political gains .
Demolition of thousands of low - income African American occupied apartments only helps that political and racial dynamic .
But no one will say openly that African American renters are not welcome .
Supporters of the destruction of thousands of apartments have come up with a series of stated reasons for their actions , but it clearly looks like political gain and economic enrichment for contractors , lawyers , architects and political friends are the real reasons .

The focus of the public 's concern over carbon emissions has been overwhelmingly fixated on the potential for future temperature increases .
Accordingly , the legal wrangling has focused there as well , with lawsuits flying over states ' ability to regulate automotive CO 2 output and whether the EPA needs to treat it as a pollutant due to the climate impact .
But a paper that will appear in Geophysical Research Letters ( a PDF of a draft is available ) suggests this legal wrangling may be besides the point : the impact of atmospheric CO 2 on the oceans should exceed EPA standards within decades , and cuts in emissions need to be made immediately if we 're to avoid harming key species .
The impact of atmospheric carbon on the ocean is no secret within the scientific community , but it has yet to pervade the public consciousness .
It 's based on simple chemistry : atmospheric CO 2 exists in equilibrium with its dissolved form in water , and that dissolved form is a weak acid .
Increase the CO 2 in the air , and bodies of water will gradually get more acidic unless they have some way of eliminating the carbon .
Separate from any arguments over its effect on climate , pretty much everyone agrees that atmospheric CO 2 levels are increasing , from about 280 parts - per-million in preindustrial times to about 380 ppm in the current day .
That increase has been accelerating , so that we 're expected to hit 500 ppm within four decades .
Continuing at the current pace would have us clear 750 ppm before the century is over .
The consequences of that 500 ppm level is where the new paper comes in .
The paper started out as what appears to be an academic spat ; an article published by a single author last year in the same journal suggested that the impact of this change on the acidity of the ocean will be relatively mild , and specifically phrased ( for no obvious reasons ) it in terms of being within water quality standards set by the EPA : even by the end of the century , it claimed , the pH of the ocean will be within the EPA 's recommended levels .
The new publication is a response to that earlier work and was prepared by a large collection of authors that work at many prestigious institutes around the globe .
The response hammers the original publication , suggesting that it is flawed at nearly every level .
" Based on inappropriate assumptions and erroneous thermodynamic calculations , " the new report states , " [ the 2006 paper ] mistakenly reports that atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 760 ppm will lower the pH of the surface ocean by 0.28 relative to the natural ' mid 18th century ' conditions . "
For those who do not normally follow the scientific literature , having three separate accusations of error in the second sentence of a paper is very rare .
According to the authors of the new work , the original paper went astray largely because of its assumption that atmospheric carbon will equilibrate instantly across the entire body of the ocean ; instead , this process is expected to take 5 - 10,000 years .
That error , along with a number of more technical problems , led the original paper to grossly underestimate the pH changes that will be caused by the increase in atmospheric carbon .
The net result is that even reaching 500 ppm of CO 2 in the atmosphere will cause the ocean to exceed the acceptable pH change in EPA 's Water Quality Criteria .
The authors of the paper go on to detail how the ocean pH criteria was set in 1976 and does n't even reflect current information on its likely impact .
The current data suggests that , before the century is out , we may reach the point where coral reefs begin receding due to a combination of erosion and having the coral simply dissolve into the increasingly acidic seas .
Many forms of plankton that sit at the base of the oceanic food chain may also have difficulty building their mineral skeletons under the expected pH conditions .
Given the expected trajectory of carbon emissions and the time involved in the ocean 's equilibration , the clear implication is that emissions will have to be cut drastically and nearly immediately to keep things within the recommended range .
Will the EPA do so ?
Their water quality standards were designed to aid the development of strategies for meeting specific targets but , as the agency notes , " the strategy does not impose legally binding requirements on EPA , states , tribes or the regulated community . "
Still , the paper is likely to increase the pressure on the agency , as it obviates the two arguments the EPA has used to defend its current inaction : questioning whether carbon dioxide - induced warming represented pollution in any way , and questioning whether warming posed a risk of material damage .
If the paper 's arguments reach the broader public , they also may shift the debate over carbon emissions in general .
Many people have a hard time grasping century - scale temperature change and melting ice caps ; water pollution and crashing fisheries are things that many people and governments have more immediate experience with .
BANGKOK , Thailand —
A Canadian schoolteacher suspected of pedophilia was arrested Friday in northeastern Thailand after an international manhunt that included the release of his unscrambled Internet photos to the public .
The suspect , 32 - year - old Christopher Paul Neil , was hiding in the town of a Thai friend who police believe may have arranged some of his alleged sexual liaisons with young boys .
Col .
Apichart Suiboonya told the Star's Asia Bureau Chief Bill Schiller in a telephone interview that Neil was arrested in a rented room in Nakhon Ratchasima in northeastern Thailand at 11 a.m. local time .
He says Neil was with a 25 - year - old Thai national at the time of the arrest .
He declined to name the Thai national .
A press conference was scheduled for Bangkok at 2 p.m. local time .
Col .
Apichart would give no other details .
“ Bingo !
We ’ve got him , ” police Maj .
Gen. Wimol Powintara told The Associated Press .
Neil was being driven to Bangkok , about 209 kilometres away , Wimol said .
Wimol declined to give details of the arrest .
Shortly before the arrest , Wimol told the AP that police rushed to the northeastern province Thursday night after receiving credible information that Neil had fled there .
Residents said they had spotted the Canadian near the home of a Thai man who police say had helped Neil to meet young boys in the past , Wimol said .
Neil lived in Thailand from 2002 to early 2004 , police said .
Thai authorities issued an arrest warrant Thursday for Neil after determining that he may have sexually abused boys in Thailand , in addition to the dozen Cambodian and Vietnamese boys , some as young as 6 , whom Interpol suspects he abused .
At Thailand ’s request , Interpol also issued an international wanted persons notice for Neil .
The so - called “ Red Notice ” from the France - based international police agency will be circulated worldwide requesting the subject ’s arrest so he can be extradited .
The Thai arrest warrant was based on the testimony of one boy , who said he was lured to Neil ’s apartment in Bangkok by a Thai man , Wimol said Thursday .
The boy was one of three Thai youths , aged 9 , 13 and 14 at the time , who contacted police Wednesday after seeing Neil ’s photograph on television .
They claimed he had paid them to perform oral sex on him in 2003 , Wimol said earlier , adding that the Canadian allegedly also had sex with at least one other underaged male .
The boys said the suspect showed them pornographic images on his computer at his apartment in Bangkok , and paid them each $ 16 to $ 32 , Wimol said .
Neil has taught at various schools in Thailand , South Korea and Vietnam since at least 2000 .
He suddenly left his most recent teaching job in South Korea last week on a one - way ticket for Thailand as investigators closed in on his identity .
Cameras captured his image as he arrived at Bangkok ’s international airport .
The hunt for Neil began three years ago when German police discovered about 200 online photographs of a man sexually abusing children .
His face was digitally obscured , but German police were able to reconstruct a recognizable image and Interpol circulated those images last week .
The suspect was identified with the help of hundreds of tips from people who responded to an appeal by Interpol for public assistance .
Before teaching in Asia , Neil had worked as a chaplain in Canada , counselling teens .
Canadian authorities have said they would seek his extradition .
Canada has sex tourism laws allowing prosecution for crimes committed abroad .
Quite tragic .
CNN was ready to help lead the march to attack Iran with its special “ We Were Warned â€ “ Iran Goes Nuclear . ”
The two - hour show was to air December 12 .
Rather than deal with facts , the show was set in a future where Iran has become a nuclear threat .
That special was “ based on a different set of rules and a different set of conditions , ” said CNN veep - senior exec producer Mark Nelson , noting that the surprising NIE report “ changed everything . ”
In its place , CNN will this weekend air two Campbell Brown - hosted specials on the Iran situation and its history .
Portions of “ We Were Warned ” correspondent Frank Sesno ’s original reporting will be incorporated into those hours , which air Saturday and Sunday .
I am sure CNN will recover and find some other way to help start a war .
How far has Rudy Giuliani ’s slipped ?
Put it this way : the former mayor has , all of a sudden , discovered religion .
Rudy Giuliani began his Sunday in an unusual place for him - at church - and with an unusual fellow congregant , the controversial former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris .
The former mayor , whose second divorce has left him on the outs with his own Catholic Church , started a three - day bus tour through Florida Sunday with a visit to the bilingual El Rey Jesus , a Hispanic evangelical Christian church here . [...]
“ This is a beautiful church , and I can feel the spirit of God in this room , ” Giuliani told the 7,000 or so worshipers .
Is anyone really gullible enough to believe such shameless pandering ?
Also note that Giuliani has a standard stump speech he uses every day on the campaign trail .
It includes a firm position against illegal immigration , and includes Giuliani ’s unwavering belief that those who want to become U.S. citizens must learn “ to speak , read and write English . ”
Oddly enough , while speaking at this Miami church , Giuliani omitted all of this from his remarks .
I ’m sure it was just an oversight — and had nothing to do with the large Latino population in South Florida , most of which votes Republican .
The compromise should ensure passage in the House , although the Senate may insist on changes .
It does not appear to include provisions , like $ 16 billion in new taxes on the oil industry , that drew a veto threat from President Bush .
The latest version of the measure , if it becomes law , will force wrenching changes on the American car companies , from design studios to new - car showrooms to executive suites .
Automakers now have to achieve 27.5 miles per gallon on cars , a figure that has not changed since 1984 , and 22.2 miles per gallon for light trucks , including minivans , sport utility vehicles and pickups .
Under the compromise , the companies will retain the distinction between the classes of vehicles , but must still meet a combined 35 m.p.g. fleetwide standard .
Ms. Pelosi called the compromise on mileage “ an historic advancement in our efforts in the Congress to address our energy security and laying strong groundwork for climate legislation next year . ”
She said that she was confident it would win the backing of environmentalists , auto makers and labor and would clear Congress by the end of this year .
Mr. Dingell , in a statement , called the new mileage standard “ aggressive and attainable . ”
“ After weeks of productive discussion and negotiation , we have achieved consensus on several provisions that provide critical environmental safeguards without jeopardizing American jobs , ” he said .
Critical to his agreement , he said , were incentives to the American auto industry for producing small cars in the United States and cars that run on a combination of gasoline and ethanol .
The Big Three automakers have warned that complying with the new fuel economy rules will cost them tens of billions of dollars and rob consumers of choices .
But even if they meet the law ’s mandate , the fuel efficiency of the American car fleet will still lag far behind that of other major industrialized countries .
Around one in five young Britons has sex with a new partner while overseas , finds research published ahead of print in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections .
And they are apparently opting for British or European sexual partners in the belief that this minimises the chances of HIV infection , but seemingly unawares of their risks of contracting other sexually transmitted infections .
The findings are based on interviews with a random sample of 12,000 men and women aged between 16 and 44 , who took part in the 2000 National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles ( NATSAL ) .
Just under 14 % of men , and just over 7 % of women , said they had sex with someone new while overseas , with this type of liaison accounting for one in 10 of all men ’s partnerships and one in 20 of women ’s in the past five years .
The young and single were the most likely to have sex with someone new while overseas .
Almost one in four men ( 23 % ) and one in six women ( 17 % ) between the ages of 16 and 24 said they had done this .
Half of all respondents said their overseas partners were British , and more than one in three said these were from another European country .
This is likely to reflect choice of destination as three quarters of overseas trips in 2005 were to European countries , but it may also indicate perceived risk , say the authors .
When quizzed about potential HIV risk , respondents cited North America , Thailand , and Kenya as high risk , and as higher than Britain .
Yet one in 10 men and one in 12 women who said they had had sex while overseas assessed their HIV risk as high or moderately high
Men were significantly more likely to have sex with Asian and North American partners .
Frequent sexual partners at home in the preceding few years and reporting sexually transmitted infections and HIV testing were associated with a greater likelihood of sexual activity while abroad , the responses showed .
This may indicate a pattern of risky sexual behaviour , say the authors , which is currently not being targeted .
Overseas travel has soared in the past five years , say the authors .
Over 66 million trips abroad were made by UK residents in 2005 , three times the number since the mid 1990s .
They suggest that healthcare professionals in GP surgeries , travel , and sexual health clinics need to do more to promote the safer sex message for people intending to go abroad .

■ Ruby 1.9.0 で tDiary を動かしてみる（トップページだけ ）
Ruby 1.9.0 で非互換が増えたって話だけど、実際のところどれくらい影響があるかよく分かんない。 ってことで、ちょうど tDiary 2.2 もリリースされたことだし、無謀にも
tDiary を Ruby 1.9.0 で動かそうとしてみた。 とりあえず、トップページが表示されるところまではできた。
でも、編集とかプラグイン系はダメっぽい。
以下、トップページを動かすまでの記録。

Ruby 1.9.0だ と nil が返ってくる 。

The United States could shave as much as 28 percent off the amount of greenhouse gases it emits at fairly modest cost and with only small technology innovations , according to a new report .
A large share of the reductions could come from steps that would more than pay for themselves in lower energy bills for industries and individual consumers , the report said , adding that people should take those steps out of good sense regardless of how worried they might be about climate change .
But that is unlikely to happen under present circumstances , said the authors , who are energy experts at McKinsey & Company , the consulting firm .
The report said the country was brimming with “ negative cost opportunities ” — potential changes in the lighting , heating and cooling of buildings , for example , that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels even as they save money .
“ These types of savings have been around for 20 years , ” said Jack Stephenson , a director of the study .
But he said they still face tremendous barriers .
Among them is that equipment is often paid for by a landlord or a builder and chosen for its low initial cost .
The cost of electricity or other fuels to operate the equipment is borne by a tenant or home buyer .
That means the landlord or builder has no incentive to spend more upfront for efficient equipment , even though doing so would save a lot of money in the long run .

Mr Craig , a Republican from Idaho , pleaded guilty in August to disorderly conduct over the toilet incident .
He now says the plea was a mistake and is trying to have it withdrawn .
Depending on the outcome of the case , Mr Craig may reverse his earlier decision to resign by the end of September .

Discover the hidden 8 bit Sound card in your PC
By Maxin B. John and Rajith R .
By Maxin B. John & Rajit R. , Govt . Engineering College , Thrissur , Kerala .
This article is dedicated to those who wish to be unconventional .
Linux supports most of the popular sound cards .
Even if you do n't have a sound card , you can still get sound support ( perhaps not all that ear soothing ! ) from the Parallel port in your PC .
In this article , we will discuss one of the many ways to obtain sound output without a sound card .
Our Setup
We are using a 1.6GHZ Pentium 4 .
The Linux distribution on this box is PCQLinux 2004 , which is based on Fedora .
In the hardware part we have used some resistors , a Parallel port connector and wires to interconnect all this hardware .
What is a Sound device driver ?
The sound driver is a character device usually denoted as " / dev/dsp " .
All sound applications such as mpg123 , Mplayer , etc. , direct their digital output to this device .
The DAC ( Digital to Analog Converter ) used here is the Parallel port .
This port is the gadget that converts the 1s and 0s that make up the binary numbers into real analog time - varying voltage which will be connected to the speakers of our Computer .
Understanding device drivers :
There are two main types of devices under all Linux systems : character and block devices .
Character devices are those for which no buffering is performed , and block devices are those which are accessed through a cache .
Block devices must be random access , but character devices are not required to be , though some are .
Filesystems can only be mounted if they are on block devices .
The sources for character devices are kept in drivers / char / , and the sources for block devices are kept in drivers / block / .
They have similar interfaces , and are very much alike , except for reading and writing .
Because of the difference in reading and writing , initialization is different , as block devices have to register a strategy routine , which is registered in a different way than the parsp_read and parsp_write routines of a character device driver .
Now if you have a .wav file which is of a specific format , say 16 - bit , stereo , raw pcm , to make it play on the system sound device you might open the / dev / dsp node using the open ( ) system call , and open your .wav file , read a block of data from the .wav file , and write it to the / dev /dsp node using read ( ) and write ( ) system calls respectively .
The ability to unload a module is one of the most useful features of modularization because it helps cut down development time ; you can test successive versions of your new driver without going through the lengthy shutdown / reboot cycle each time .
Playing with the module :
The compilation of a kernel module is performed by the gcc compiler using the make file , which contains :
gcc -c &1 - O2 - Wall - DMODULE -D__KERNEL__
- I /usr / src/linux ( your kernel version )
The output of the compilation is a module which is to be inserted into the kernel to produce the sound .
Our driver , called parsp .o , can be loaded into the running kernel using :
insmod -f parsp .o
and removed from the kernel using :
rmmod parsp
The install.sh file contains some magic to redirect all the sound applications to our driver .
Usually the applications use the / dev/dsp device , which has a major number 14 , to produce the sound output .
What we are going to do first is delete that special file .
Then we replace the same file with a major number that is specified in our driver .
./install.sh 203
Note that 203 is the major number specified in our driver - so all the applications that use / dev/dsp , such as mpg123 , Mplayer , XMMS , etc. will now use our driver to produce output .
But we know that we cannot forget our past - so , in order to restore our previous state , we would simply run uninstall.sh .
The uninstall.sh script restores the previous state by deleting the / dev/dsp created by the install.sh script and recreating the original / dev/dsp which had the major number 14 and minor number 3 .
mknod / dev/dsp c 14 3
Do n't forget to reconnect the speaker plug to the output jack of the sound card of your system .
( We had this experience three or four times and wondered why there was no sound from the original soundcard of our system !! )
Ioctls :
The ioctl ( ) ( short for input / output control ) system call is used on / dev/dsp to talk to the device driver .
There are recognized conventions in Linux , the most popular of which is the OSS or Open Sound System .
This is the standard interface implemented in Linux and followed by thousands of device drivers on the kernel side .
The ioctl ( ) implementation was the most tedious thing in this project .
The list of all ioctls for the soundcard can obtain from souncard.h or by using the command :
man ioctl_list
We tried our level best to include the ioctls required to play the music files through various music players .
Of these various music players , Mplayer was the most demanding one .
Although we can play music using Mplayer , support for it is not perfect at the moment .
Creating Sound through the " Magic Port "
The Standard Parallel Port of your system is a 25 pin port .
The signals available at the parallel port are 0v , which represents logical 0 , and +5 v , which represents logical 1 .
This port is the simplest port in your system by which you can control a large number of devices .
Although the parallel port contains 25 pins , we 'll focus our attention mainly on the 8 data out pins ( pin numbers 2 - 9 ) and a ground pin ( any pin from 18 - 25 ) that we 'll use for our purpose .
The usual way of using the parallel port is by using the good old outb ( ) instruction .
In our driver , the bytes are written to the parallel port using
outb( b , 0x378 ) ;
So do n't go anywhere , just sit in front of the computer and play something nice with the parallel port of your computer .
But do n't blame us if you end up frying up your computer - just be sensible and things will go smoothly ...
Dive into Code :
We have explained earlier , the bit 1 is represented by 5v and bit 0 is represented by 0v at the parallel port .
The magic performed to create these intermediate voltage levels is done by the resistor circuitry connected to the parallel port output .
These varying voltage levels in turn generate the audible output when connected to the input of your speaker system .
When we experimented with the circuit using the code given below with the help of a multimeter , we got the following results :
( Text Version : test.c.txt )
# include < asm / io.h > main ( ) { iopl ( 3 ) ; int b ; printf ( " Enter the value of b :
" ) ; scanf ( " %d " , &b ) ; out b( b,0x378 ) ; }
Do n't forget to compile it using the optimization option , i.e .
cc filename.c -O2
For b=0 Output voltage = 0v For b=255 Ourput voltage = 3.8v For b=240 Output voltage = 2.1v
The values are obtained across the ground of the port and output of the resistor circuit ( 1 and 2 connected together ) .
This may vary from system to system , so do n't worry if you do n't get those exact values .
Quality of the output can be increased by using other complex circuits such as amplifiers and filters .
We are not going to explain that here as it will increase the cost of the hardware .
The code that performs the core function is present in the pcsp_write ( ) .
count= ( count < 44100 ?
count : 44100 ) ; if ( copy_from_user (( void *) data_buffer , buf , count ) ) return - EFAULT ; canplay = 1 ; for ( v=0 ; v< count ; v++ ) // loops till the end of the buffer { b=buf[ v ] ; outb( b,0x378 ) ; //
Writes those bytes to the parallel port for ( i=0 ; i< loop ; i++ ) ; //loops to adjust the speed of playback }
At first , a music player such as mpg123 opens the / dev/dsp device via pcsp_open ( ) and gathers information on its characteristics ( i.e. , buffer size , mono or stereo , number of channels , etc. ) using parsp_ioctl ( ) .
After that , it writes manageable - sized chunks of information into the buffer of the device driver .
The bytes in the buffer are then transferred to the parallel port :
outb( b , 0x378 ) ;
The next loop is significant , since it controls the playback speed .
for ( i=0 ; i< loop ;i++ ) ;
This value of this loop must be changed to suit the processor speed of each system .
This process continues until the end of the music file .
At that point the count becomes zero and the music player software closes the device by calling parsp_close ( ) .
In the init_module ( ) section , we initialize the variables used in the code .
The module is registered by :
major=register_chrdev(major , name , &parsp_fops ) ;
The memory for the buffer used in the driver is allocated by :
data_buffer= ( long ) kmalloc ( 44100 , GFP_KERNEL ) ;
In cleanup_module ( ) , the allocated memory for the driver is freed by :
k free ( ( void *) data_buffer ) ;
The module is removed from the kernel by :
unregister_chrdev( major , name ) ;

The connection to the speaker plug is as shown in the figure .
The resistors used here are 1 k ohm , 1/4 watt resistors .

Have some fun :-)
After all this painful and time consuming assembly of our device , let 's enjoy the fruit that our hard work has brought us .
The Linux way of testing the device driver is by using the ' cat ' command :
cat ding.wav > /dev/dsp
Do you hear something ?
Yeah ...
You will ...
Now , let us go to the next level .
We will try to play a mp3 file by using mpg123
mpg123 dingdong.mp3
and enjoy that heavenly music !
Try some other players such as Mplayer , XMMS , etc .
More and more ...
Our adventures with the parallel port will not stop here .
A brave new idea is to create and control a mini-fountain right in the living room which will dance with the music played on the computer !
Please let us know your crazy ideas using the parallel port .
Conclusion
We have tried to present a few things about using the parallel port of your PC in an interesting way ; this module is software that makes good use of it .
Be warned , though -- you may get addicted to the " digital noise " produced by this software .
We will be grateful to readers who point out errors / inconsistencies , if any .
We look forward to hearing from you soon !

By dating the time that each of the genes came under selection , they have found that the rate of human evolution was fairly steady until about 50,000 years ago and then accelerated up until 10,000 years ago , they report in the current issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The high rate of selection has probably continued to the present day , Dr. Moyzis said , but current data are not adequate to pick up recent selection .
The brisk rate of human selection occurred for two reasons , Dr. Moyzis ’ team says .
One was that the population started to grow , first in Africa and then in the rest of the world after the first modern humans left Africa .
The larger size of the population meant that there were more mutations for natural selection to work on .
The second reason for the accelerated evolution was that the expanding human populations in Africa and Eurasia were encountering climates and diseases to which they had to adapt genetically .
The extra mutations in their growing populations allowed them to do so .
Dr. Moyzis said it was widely assumed that once people developed culture , they protected themselves from the environment and from the forces of natural selection .
But people also had to adapt to the environments that their culture created , and the new analysis shows that evolution continued even faster than before .
The researchers took their data from the HapMap project , a survey designed by the National Institutes of Health to look at sites of common variation in the human genome and to help identify the genes responsible for common diseases .
The HapMap data , generated by analyzing the genomes of people from Africa , East Asia and Europe , has also been a trove for people studying human evolutionary history .
David Reich , a population geneticist at the Harvard Medical School , said the new report was “ a very interesting and exciting hypothesis ” but that the authors had not ruled out other explanations of the data .
The power of their test for selected genes falls off in looking both at more ancient and more recent events , he said , so the overall picture might not be correct .
Over the last months , thanks to the traf­fic growth of SharpBrains.com ( over 100,000 unique vis­i­tors per month these days , THANK YOU for vis­it­ing today and please come back ! ) , a num­ber of proac­tive book agents , pub­lish­ers and authors have con­tact­ed us to inform us of their lat­est brain - relat­ed books .
We have tak­en a look at many books , wrote reviews of The Dana Guide to Brain Health book review‚ and Best of the Brain from Sci­en­tif­ic Amer­i­can , and inter­viewed sci­en­tists such as Judith Beck , Robert Emmons and James Zull .
Now we are launch­ing a new Author Speaks Series to pro­vide a plat­form for lead­ing sci­en­tists and experts writ­ing high - qual­i­ty brain - relat­ed books to reach a wide audi­ence .
We are hon­ored to start the series with an arti­cle by Lar­ry McCleary , M.D , for­mer act­ing Chief of Pedi­atric Neu­ro­surgery at Den­ver Chil­dren ’s Hos­pi­tal , and author of The Brain Trust Pro­gram : A Sci­en­tif­i­cal­ly Based Three - Part Plan to Improve Mem­o­ry , Ele­vate Mood , Enhance Atten­tion , Alle­vi­ate Migraine and Menopausal Symp­toms , and Boost Men­tal Ener­gy ( Perigee Trade , 2007 ) .
With­out fur­ther ado , let ’s enjoy Dr. McCleary ’s arti­cle :
Brain Evo­lu­tion and Why it is Mean­ing­ful Today to Improve Our Brain Health
You may feel over­whelmed by the stream of seem­ing­ly con­tra­dic­to­ry sug­ges­tions regard­ing the best way to main­tain men­tal clar­i­ty as you age .
Based on an analy­sis of sem­i­nal fac­tors in the devel­op­ment of mod­ern brain anato­my , I believe it is pos­si­ble to make some very com­pelling rec­om­men­da­tions for grow­ing big brains , enhanc­ing their func­tion , and mak­ing them resis­tant to the aging process .
These may be loose­ly cat­e­go­rized as fac­tors per­tain­ing to the men­tal or phys­i­cal attrib­ut­es of the brain .
Although they are not tru­ly inde­pen­dent enti­ties , such a con­cep­tu­al­iza­tion pro­vides a basis for the gen­er­a­tion of brain healthy pre­scrip­tions .
Diet , phys­i­cal exer­cise , and stress reduc­tion enhance neu­ronal resilience .
Sleep and men­tal stim­u­la­tion are vital for cog­ni­tive abil­i­ty , learn­ing , and mem­o­ry .
Diet : Fol­low a mod­ern shore - based / ­ma­rine diet includ­ing seafood in its most gen­er­al sense , non-starchy veg­eta­bles of all col­ors , berries , and eggs .
Oth­er sources of lean pro­tein con­tain­ing long - chain omega 3 fat­ty acids such as free range beef , chick­en , bison , or elk are nutri­tious alter­na­tives .
Phys­i­cal exer­cise ( Think fight or flight — activ­i­ty . ) :
Include all types .
Aer­o­bic activ­i­ties such as swim­ming , bicy­cling , walk­ing , or hik­ing for pro­mo­tion of vas­cu­lar health and weight con­trol ; resis­tance train­ing for pro­mo­tion of neu­rotroph­ic fac­tors , nat­u­ral­ly occur­ring com­pounds that make brain cells more resis­tant to aging , such as IGF ‑1 ( Insulin - like growth factor ‑1 ) and BDNF ( Brain - derived neu­rotroph­ic fac­tor ) ; and bal­ance , coor­di­na­tion , and agili­ty train­ing such as ping - pong , bal­ance beam , tram­po­line , and jump­ing rope to enhance cog­ni­tive speed and motor skills .
Stress Con­trol : From an evo­lu­tion­ary per­spec­tive , stres­sors ( such as meet­ing a cave bear ) and intense phys­i­cal activ­i­ty ( run­ning or fight­ing ) were brief in dura­tion and usu­al­ly occurred togeth­er .
Mod­ern stres­sors ( psy­cho­log­i­cal or emo­tion­al stress ) tend to be unremit­ting and are gen­er­al­ly uncou­pled from the phys­i­cal ( fight or flight ) com­po­nent , mean­ing stress devel­ops with­out any asso­ci­at­ed phys­i­cal activ­i­ty .
Such intense phys­i­cal pur­suits are now called exer­cise .
Not sur­pris­ing­ly , exer­cise is a per­fect phys­i­o­log­ic anti­dote for stress due to its ben­e­fi­cial impact on cor­ti­sol ( the stress hor­mone ) and blood pres­sure and should be incor­po­rat­ed into any pro­gram of stress reduc­tion .
Ade­quate sleep :
The body needs rest , but the brain requires sleep .
Acute or chron­ic sleep depri­va­tion caus­es dev­as­tat­ing short and long - term con­se­quences to brain anato­my ( synap­tic loss ) and func­tion ( mem­o­ry and learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties ) .
Off - line infor­ma­tion pro­cess­ing and mem­o­ry con­sol­i­da­tion are addi­tion­al sleep - relat­ed ben­e­fits .
Men­tal stim­u­la­tion : Brain - train­ing , a cog­ni­tive­ly chal­leng­ing lifestyle , nov­el­ty , and social­iza­tion are vital for the pro­mo­tion of neu­ronal plas­tic­i­ty and neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis ( the for­ma­tion of new nerve cells and neu­ronal con­nec­tions ) , the enhance­ment of spe­cif­ic brain func­tions such as mem­o­ry , and the devel­op­ment of cog­ni­tive reserve — addi­tion­al men­tal pro­cess­ing poten­tial that may be brought online when need­ed .
The com­bi­na­tion of these rec­om­men­da­tions , each of which was instru­men­tal in the trans­for­ma­tion from prim­i­tive to mod­ern ner­vous sys­tems , pro­vides a tem­plate for the most log­i­cal approach for enhanc­ing men­tal func­tion and resist­ing neu­rode­gen­er­a­tion as we trav­el through life .
The Evo­lu­tion­ary Ratio­nale
The human brain clear­ly has the genet­ic poten­tial for dra­mat­ic expan­sion .
This was illus­trat­ed about 1,500,000 years ago .
Enlarge­ment from 900 grams to almost 1300 grams required less than a mil­lion years to com­plete ‚- a mere speck on the evo­lu­tion­ary time­line .
Why and how it hap­pened are open ques­tions .
What remains undis­put­ed are the mag­ni­tude of the change and the impact it had on human capa­bil­i­ties .
The rapid vol­u­met­ric explo­sion pri­mar­i­ly involved the frontal lobe region , a por­tion of the brain that , until recent­ly , was referred to as the silent‚ brain because of its rel­a­tive lack of any dis­cern­able func­tion­al­i­ty .
The frontal lobes are now viewed as the con­duc­tor of the orches­tra , because they have been rec­og­nized as being respon­si­ble for artic­u­lat­ing the big pic­ture and coor­di­nat­ing oth­er brain regions , as need­ed , to exe­cute the game plan .
The Pre­frontal cor­tex ( PFC ) , the most ante­ri­or por­tion of the frontal cor­tex , has dense con­nec­tions with all the oth­er regions it over­sees .
It is gen­er­al­ly con­sid­ered the most plas­tic cor­ti­cal region because its synaps­es are con­tin­u­al­ly being torn down and recon­fig­ured in response to real - time expe­ri­ences .
Plas­tic­i­ty allows the brain to think on its feet .
Expan­sion of PFC enabled the cog­ni­tive pre­em­i­nence of mod­ern day humans over all non-human pri­mates .
The plas­tic­i­ty of the PFC and its mas­sive con­nec­tiv­i­ty with oth­er brain regions rely entire­ly on the pro­duc­tion and main­te­nance of point - to - point nerve cell con­nec­tions , or synaps­es .
In addi­tion to being a think­ing machine , the brain is also a flesh and blood organ that must com­ply with the laws of metab­o­lism and phys­i­ol­o­gy .
Insight into both its men­tal and phys­i­cal prop­er­ties is vital for com­pre­hend­ing key aspects of brain health and func­tion .
Much has been writ­ten about the facil­i­ta­tion of brain growth by cog­ni­tive­ly demand­ing tasks such as tool use and hunt­ing .
How­ev­er , there is a com­po­nent of cir­cu­lar rea­son­ing in this argu­ment .
For it to par­tic­i­pate in such men­tal­ly demand­ing endeav­ors , the brain would have relied on the pri­or exis­tence of sophis­ti­cat­ed neu­ronal cir­cuit­ry .
I sug­gest a nutri­tion­al basis for the dra­mat­ic cere­bral expan­sion , with enhanced func­tion­al­i­ty ( such as devel­op­ment of tool use and hunt­ing strat­e­gy ) being the nat­ur­al respons­es of a larg­er , more plas­tic organ to nov­el­ty and envi­ron­men­tal chal­lenges .
The com­mon link between the evo­lu­tion­ary cere­bral expan­sion and mod­ern brain health / function resides in the mas­sive wiring demands inher­ent in both process­es .
This marked ampli­fi­ca­tion in neu­ronal con­nec­tiv­i­ty is made pos­si­ble by the enhanced pro­duc­tion of synap­tic mem­branes ( nerve cell mem­branes in the regions of points of nerve cell con­tact ) .
How was it pos­si­ble to fuel the pro­duc­tion of major increas­es in neu­ronal num­ber and synap­tic den­si­ty ?
This required the con­cor­dant expres­sion of genet­ic poten­tial ( like­ly dri­ven , in part , by the pro­vi­sion of an unin­ter­rupt­ed ener­gy sup­ply ) and prop­er nutri­tion­al con­tent — mean­ing high , sus­tained caloric and nutri­ent den­si­ty .
Just as a cer­tain lev­el of fat mass is a pre­req­ui­site for expan­sion of the female body to sup­port a suc­cess­ful preg­nan­cy , a per­sis­tent sup­ply of nutri­ent dense calo­ries is essen­tial for brain expan­sion .
In times of fre­quent star­va­tion , this was a sub­stan­tial nutri­tion­al demand .
To ful­ly appre­ci­ate how ener­get­i­cal­ly expen­sive brains are , con­sid­er that mod­ern brains com­prise about 2.3 % of the body mass , yet con­sume almost one quar­ter of the avail­able ener­gy .
New­born brains uti­lize ful­ly 75 % of the body ener­gy !
What type of brain - build­ing diet might have been acces­si­ble 1.5 mil­lion years ago that did­ n’t require the cog­ni­tive demands inher­ent in hunt­ing ?
One solu­tion would be a “ shore - based ” diet .
This means for­ag­ing for life forms such as mol­lusks , crus­taceans , eggs , spawn­ing fish , frogs , and con­tigu­ous plant life read­i­ly avail­able along lake shores or riv­er banks .
In a warm clime it would have pro­vid­ed a year - round , high qual­i­ty diet abun­dant in calo­ries , fat and pro­tein .
It also sup­plied long - chain omega 3 fat­ty acids ( includ­ing DHA ) , the build­ing blocks of elec­tri­cal­ly active mem­branes in neu­rons and pho­tore­cep­tor cells .
Big brains must also syn­the­size abun­dant cho­les­terol and oth­er com­po­nents of nerve cell mem­branes .
This requires a water - sol­u­ble source of appro­pri­ate build­ing blocks .
Ketone bod­ies ( ace­toac­etate and hydrox­y­bu­tyrate ) gen­er­at­ed nat­u­ral­ly from par­tial­ly burned fat were , and con­tin­ue to be , an ide­al ener­gy source for the brain while simul­ta­ne­ous­ly pro­vid­ing key pre­cur­sors for syn­the­sis of nerve cell mem­branes and synaps­es .
These facil­i­tat­ed the anatom­ic expan­sion of the brain , which pro­vid­ed the addi­tion­al neu­ronal cir­cuit­ry that made the learn­ing of hunt­ing skills a pos­si­bil­i­ty .
Hence , what was com­pul­so­ry for explo­sive brain expan­sion of the species is as vital today for opti­mal brain func­tion and plas­tic­i­ty .
It is the ongo­ing abil­i­ty to pro­duce high lev­els of the most func­tion­al sites of nerve cells the synap­tic mem­branes .
Appro­pri­ate assem­blies of nerve cells , as deter­mined by their con­nec­tions ( synaps­es ) , pro­vide the basis for the func­tion­al attrib­ut­es we enjoy today .
Stress reduc­tion , men­tal stim­u­la­tion and prop­er sleep enhance their resis­tance to the aging process .

The existing shelter was hastily constructed after the accident
Ukraine has hired a French firm to build the structure to replace the crumbling concrete casing put over the reactor after the 1986 accident .
The casing project is expected to cost $ 1.4bn ( £ 700 m ) .
It will take five years to complete and the authorities say they will then be able to start dismantling the reactor .
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko hailed the project :
" Today is probably the first time that we can openly look into the eyes of the national and international community and say that a solution to the problem that has long been called the Chernobyl problem was formally found , " he said .
The French construction company Novarka will build a giant arch - shaped structure out of steel , 190 metres ( 623 feet ) wide and 200 m long .
It will cover the existing containment structure which stands over the reactor and radioactive fuel that caused the accident in 1986 .
The reactor still contains 95 % of its original nuclear material , and exposure to weather and poor construction has left the existing casing weak .
A separate deal has also been signed with the US firm Holtec to build a storage facility within the exclusion zone for nuclear waste which has been produced by Chernobyl .
The money for the schemes has come from international donors .
The fund is administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development .
Its president , Jean Lemierre , said the continued commitment of Ukrainian authorities and the international community was vital for the projects to be successfully completed .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 27 — The State Department said Thursday that Blackwater USA security personnel had been involved in 56 shootings while guarding American diplomats in Iraq so far this year .
It was the first time the Bush administration had made such data public .
Blackwater , a large , privately held security contractor based in North Carolina , provided security to diplomats on 1,873 convoy runs in Iraq so far this year , and its personnel fired weapons 56 times , according to a written statement by Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte .
The State Department did not release comparable 2007 numbers for other security companies , but the new Blackwater numbers show a far higher rate of shootings per convoy mission than were experienced in 2006 by one of the company ’s primary competitors , DynCorp International .
DynCorp reported 10 cases in about 1,500 convoy runs last year .
The New York Times reported Thursday that Blackwater ’s rate of shootings was at least twice as high as the rates for other companies providing similar services to the State Department in Iraq .
INCOME TAX
The ratification of this Amendment was the direct consequence of the Court 's decision in 1895 in Pollock v. Farmers ' Loan & Trust Co. , 1 whereby the attempt of Congress the previous year to tax incomes uniformly throughout the United States 2 was held by a divided court to be unconstitutional .
A tax on incomes derived from property , 3 the Court declared , was a ' ' direct tax ' ' which Congress under the terms of Article I , Sec. 2 , and Sec. 9 , could impose only by the rule of apportionment according to population , although scarcely fifteen years prior the Justices had unanimously sustained 4 the collection of a similar tax during the Civil War , 5 the only other occasion preceding the Sixteenth Amendment in which Congress had ventured to utilize this method of raising revenue .
6
During the interim between the Pollock decision in 1895 and the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 , the Court gave evidence of a greater awareness of the dangerous consequences to national solvency which that holding threatened , and partially circumvented the threat , either by taking refuge in redefinitions of ' ' direct tax ' ' or , and more especially , by emphasizing , virtually to the exclusion of the former , the history of excise taxation .
Thus , in a series of cases , notably Nicol v. Ames , 7 Knowlton v. Moore , 8 and Patton v. Brady , 9 the Court held the following taxes to have been levied merely upon one of the ' ' incidents of ownership ' ' and hence to be excises : a tax which involved affixing revenue stamps to memoranda evidencing the sale of merchandise on commodity exchanges , an inheritance tax , and a war revenue tax upon tobacco on which the hitherto imposed excise tax had already been paid and which was held by the manufacturer for resale .
Because of such endeavors the Court thus found it possible to sustain a corporate income tax as an excise '' measured by income ' ' on the privilege of doing business in corporate form .
10 The adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment , however , put an end to speculation whether the Court , unaided by constitutional amendment , would persist along these lines of construction until it had reversed its holding in the Pollock case .
Indeed , in its initial appraisal 11 of the Amendment it classified income taxes as being inherently '' indirect . ' ' '' [ T ] he command of the amendment that all income taxes shall not be subject to apportionment by a consideration of the sources from which the taxed income may be derived , forbids the application to such taxes of the rule applied in the Pollock case by which alone such taxes were removed from the great class of excises , duties , and imports subject to the rule of uniformity and were placed under the other or direct class . '' 12 '' [ T ]he Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power of taxation but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged .

Via Avedon at The Sideshow , I found this lovely Washington Post article about private contractors ( who for some reason we no longer call mercenaries ) running amok in Iraq .
The Post article states the official number of contractors in Iraq is approximately 127,000 , but that 's a lowball estimate since the CIA and intelligence arms of the various armed services are also employing private contractors and the exact number of how many they 've hired is classified .
Obviously , not all of them are engaged in combat - related activities but most of them are .
Let me do a little math here - there are currently 162,000 US troops in Iraq , along with let 's say 100,000 armed mercenaries who are not subject to the Geneva Conventions or the Uniform Code of Military Justice , plus heaven only knows how many insurgents and foreign fighters and armed Iraqi citizens ( Saddam 's policy was to have every household own an AK - 47 assault rifle ) .
Now , we add all that up and it comes out to Iraq being the most fucked - up place there has ever been on the planet Earth .
This being Iraq , of course it gets even worse when you take a closer look .
This article from The Indypendent puts the number of contractors at 180,000 , but also points out that :
... more than 1,000 contractors working for the U.S. occupation have been killed with another 13,000 wounded .
Most are not American citizens , and these numbers are not counted in the official death toll at a time when Americans are increasingly disturbed by casualties .
In other words , Iraq is even bloodier than we thought .
It 's like the onion from hell : every layer of nightmare you peel back reveals an even more terrifying one underneath .
The Indypendent article speculates that the increasing reliance on mercenaries beyond parliamentary controls might embolden governments around the world to engage in even more reckless military gambits .
Maybe .
But historically , mercenaries have always been unreliable , so much so that Niccolo Machiavelli , the spiritual father of the realpolitik the right wingers all claim to follow , argued vigorously against their use .
He was all too familiar with the various betrayals and usurpations that occurred in many Italian city states that relied on mercenary armies .
Worse yet , it was n't uncommon for mercenary armies who met in the field to stage a nearly bloodless battle of maneuvers - actual combat tended to make their contracts much less lucrative .
Who knows ?
Maybe the private armies of the 21st century will come to the same conclusion and thus rein in the Bush adminstration 's ambitions in Iraq .
I hate that we live in an age where we have to rely on the common sense of hired guns for any shred of hope .

It ’s shortly after dawn on February 15th on the remote island of Tanna in the South Pacific .
The oppressive humidity and heat of the rainy season is already building , the pigs and chickens are slowly stirring , and – as on every February 15th for the last 45 years – one of the world ’s strangest religious ceremonies is about to take place .
The village of Sulphur Bay is waking up , as it does every morning , directly under an active volcano .
The cone of Mount Yasur steeples up above it , thumping periodically as blisters of magma burst inside its crater , and scattering ash onto the dead plains around its base like a carbon snowfall .
On the coastal side of the village is a black sand beach running with steaming rivulets of scalding spring water , too hot to touch but ideal for washing clothes and dishes .
Between the devil and the deep , the palm and thatch huts are arranged quite untypically for a Melanesian village : not around a central clan hut or banyan tree but framing a large , deserted square like a parade ground .
This is because Sulphur Bay is one of a handful of villages in this part of the world where the people neither worship the Christ of the missionaries nor practice the traditional kastom ( custom ) religion of their ancestors , but who live with a god of their own : a spirit messiah known as John Frum .
John Frum is the son of God , but he ’s not Jesus .
He ’s a black Melanesian , but sometimes a white man – or , according to others , a black American GI .
He ’s a kastom messiah , come to turn the people of Tanna back to their old ways before the missionaries – but he ’s also a universal avatar of change , a successor to Buddha or Jesus or Mohammed .
Like Jesus , he ’s poised to return – or , perhaps , he ’s already here .
He ’s a volcano god , with an army of the dead who live down in the crater , and a spirit who approaches the men of Tanna when they drink their intoxicating kava and bring their spirits into communion with him .
Back in the days of colonial rule when he first appeared , the British thought he was one of the locals dressing up and spouting nonsense to foment rebellion .
They arrested a succession of ‘ troublemakers ’ , pillorying them before their community to expose the deception , but the locals knew perfectly well that John Frum was neither this man nor that one .
Apart from anything else , he continued to appear .
So , a new tactic : anyone who was found to be talking John Frum nonsense was hauled off to jail in Port Vila , the administrative capital over a hundred miles away .
But these ‘ ringleaders ’ became martyrs to the growing religion , and the stories of how John appeared to them in jail are now part of the canon of oral traditions , hymns and revelations of the new religion .
To anthropologists , John Frum was an example of one of the strangest and most exotic phenomena to be observed in traditional cultures : the cargo cult .
All across Melanesia , from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands to Tanna ’s archipelago , the New Hebrides , dozens of unconnected communities , thousands of miles apart and speaking unrelated languages , seemed spontaneously to generate the same set of bizarre beliefs .
A new dispensation was on the way , when the white man would vanish from the islands , and his cargo – Western goods – would be diverted by magical means to the local people , who were its rightful owners .
‘ Cargo cults ’ got into full swing during the 1950s , though once the phenomenon had been classified by Westerners it seemed that the beginnings of the movement could be traced way back , as far as the 1890s .
The classic account was by the Australian anthropologist Peter Lawrence who went out to the Madang district of New Guinea in 1949 to conduct field research into the traditional social relations of people who , despite colonial rule , were still living much as they had in the recent Stone Age .
Lawrence gradually discovered that his presence in Madang had become woven into an extraordinary complex of beliefs .
Persistent rumours abounded that a cargo ship was about to arrive in the harbour with huge consignments of goods for him , and the local people asked him to help them supervise the clearing of an airstrip .
When he asked what the airstrip was for , he was told that cargo planes were about to arrive bringing tinned meat , rice , tools , tobacco and a machine for making electric light .
And when he asked who was sending this cargo , they replied ‘ God in Heaven ’ .
Lawrence ’s analysis of what was going on came to constitute a template for what seemed to Westerners an inexplicable and repetitive complex of delusions .
First came ‘ cargo belief ’ : the apocalyptic conviction that the world was about to turn upside down , the islanders finally receiving the material rewards of the white planters and administrators who were currently enjoying the fruits of the black man ’s labours .
Then , even more puzzling , came ‘ cargo ritual ’ : new religious practices designed to reel in the cargo by magical repetition of the acts which were currently bringing it to the white man .
All over , islanders were downing tools , clearing airstrips in the jungle , building imitation radio masts out of bamboo , scouring their bibles for hidden messages , even sitting around politely drinking afternoon tea .
If it worked for the white man , so the theory went , it would work for them .
All across the region , colonial governments cracked down hard , rounding up the cargo prophets and imprisoning them .
Planters and other Western commercial interests , who coined the term ‘ cargo cult ’ , saw it all as madness which demonstrated the ignorance and superstition of their workforce .
More liberal whites attempted to explain to the locals that cargo was n’t produced by magic , but by hard work and the product of generations of technological progress , and the only way in which Melanesian societies were going to become rich in cargo was by working and earning it .
To the locals , the subtext of this explanation was clear : the whites were politely refusing to give up the secret of their cargo .
On Tanna , this secret was vouchsafed by John Frum .
The various stories of John ’s first appearance tend to contradict each other : all are oral traditions , amplified by Chinese whispers , reinterpreted by different prophets and constantly trimmed to fit the nature of the religion as it developed .
The colonial version is that the ‘ madness ’ began in 1940 , when certain locals began painting their faces white , wearing hats and appearing to their fellows at night , prophesying in falsetto voices about the coming expulsion of the whites and arrival of huge quantities of cargo .
Most Tannese versions explain that John Frum had been witnessed for many years before this , but they had kept him secret from the authorities , as his message was that the people needed to turn back to their kastom beliefs which the missionaries had prohibited for a century .
But by 1941 there was no doubt that something was going on .
A ‘ prophet ’ named Manehevi from Sulphur Bay had been arrested and tied to a tree for a day by the colonial administration , pour encourager les autres , but John Frum continued to appear .
Subsequent witnesses had been deported and imprisoned .
Then , big news : a huge detachment of American troops had arrived on the neighbouring island of Santo .
Not only had these Americans brought unheard - of amounts of cargo – arms , tanks , boats , food , medicine – but a considerable number of them were black .
The centuries of unbroken symmetry between foreigners ( white , rich ) and locals ( black , poor ) had been broken , and the black GIs were variously interpreted as descendants of the islanders who ’d been kidnapped by plantation owners in the past , or as John Frum ’s own detachment of the US army .
Messianic fervour gripped Sulphur Bay , and one Sunday morning the new movement came out into the open with a baffling act of civil disobedience which sent shock - waves through the white community .
The compulsory attendance at the Presbyterian church was universally ignored ; instead , a group of locals walked solemnly into the white - owned trading post and carefully removed every price label from the stock .
The effect of this surreal outrage was to shift colonial tactics from bullying to a belated attempt at education .
American officers were drafted in to explain that John Frum was nothing to do with the American army , and that if they wanted cargo they were going to have to work for it .
The locals were underwhelmed , and the build - up to Judgement Day accelerated .
In a repeat of a ritual which spontaneously generated itself dozens of times across the region , the John Frum ‘ cultists ’ began to destroy all their Western possessions , throwing their hard - earned money into the sea .
This common motif of ‘ cargo ritual ’ could perhaps be seen as an act of faith and preparation for the new dispensation ( John Frum would bring new money , with a coconut stamped on it ) , or as an adaptation of the traditional potlatch system of Melanesian culture where such sacrifice puts your fellow - man , and by extension the world , into your debt .
But however oblique its motive , its effect as a gesture of resistance was total .
If the natives are destroying their money , even the most stubborn colonist can hardly ignore the message that they ’ve lost control of their workforce .
The crisis gradually devolved into an inconclusive stand - off : John Frum did n’t arrive with the promised cargo , but neither did the Tannese return to the churches or mission schools .
In Sulphur Bay and the surrounding villages , the Sabbath migrated to Friday , on which day John Frum was celebrated with singing , dancing and kava - drinking , a joyful inversion of the dour Presbyterian past .
The movement gradually manifested itself with the restitution of various kastom practices , which the administration had no choice but to tolerate .
Finally , on February 15th 1957 , an American flag was ceremonially raised in Sulphur Bay and the new religion officially announced to the outside world .
It ’s this flag - raising which still forms the ceremonial centrepiece to John Frum Day .
Shortly after dawn , the day is blessed with a service : a hundred people crowd into a small hut on the edge of the parade ground and sing some of John Frum ’s hymns which have been ‘ channelled ’ over the years , some of them miraculously in tongues unknown to the receiver .
These have a sombre , lilting quality reminiscent of their Presbyterian roots , but the ceremony is plainly not Christian : the participants , fingers raised , each place a flower on the shrine at the climax of the service .
While the hymns are sung in near - darkness , the rest of the village goes about its normal morning routines : pigs root around , women wash clothes in the hot springs , men gather in small groups under the trees , the village store opens to display its stock of tinned pilchards , Omo and second - hand nylon shorts .
Slowly , a hum of activity begins to form around the ‘ Headquarters ’ , a corrugated iron shack on the opposite side of the parade ground from the service hut .
John Frum elders emerge dressed in old US Army uniforms , some sporting medals and an array of sewn patches , everything from Greenpeace logos to black American baseball stars .
A couple of them are pointed out to me as sons and grandsons of the original John Frum prophets .
The Headquarters is the command centre not just for Sulphur Bay but for the entire religion , the modest Vatican of the John Frum Movement .
It ’s a strictly supervised male - only domain , in line with both the kastom tradition of the male clan - hut and the initiatic all - male secret societies which take various forms across the islands .
Consequently it ’s a mystery what actually goes on in there – though an English traveller I spoke to claimed to have had a glimpse inside and seen the elders clustered round a video and TV , running off the village solar panel and watching Knights of the Round Table with French subtitles .
A crowd gathers , the chiefs gradually assemble into a parade formation , and two flags are brought out of the Headquarters .
One is an old wartime US stars and stripes , the other the flag of occupied Vanuatu , the resistance movement which led the nation to its independence in 1980 .
Three of the elders process slowly to the flagpole , and the flags are raised and saluted in a faithful facsimile of US military ceremony .
The rest of the elders stand stiffly on parade , awaiting the next stage of the ritual : the John Frum Army .
From the jungle above the village , the army appears : 40 or so of the younger men , in jeans and bare torsos with ‘ USA ’ painted on their chests and backs in day - glo pink magic marker .
Each carries a bamboo ‘ rifle ’ , a long stick with its tip sharpened and painted red , with which they present arms before the elders .
They ’re marched out onto the parade ground , where a second set of flags is raised : the US Marines ’ insignia , and the state flag of Georgia .
The elders put the army through their paces with shouts and whistles , marching them back and forth under the now - baking sun and the volcano ’s plume of steam , each barked command to turn and shoulder arms applauded wildly by the crowd .
Part military drill , part kastom dance , it ’s a performance like no other , genuinely stirring for islanders and visitors alike .
Eventually the Army march back into the jungle , but the elders remain on the parade ground and summon the rest of the village to perform more kastom dances .
Troupes of a dozen or so young men and women take turn to process and wheel in circles , marshalled by the whistles of the chiefs and accompanied by strummed guitars .
The Army return in gaggles , chatting and grinning proudly , supplementing the USA slogans on their chests with fern head - dresses and tinsel streamers and joining in the free - form dancing .
The day gradually devolves into the traditional kastom revels of dancing , singing and eating glutinous lap - lap porridge .
Among the spectators is Vanuatu ’s Minister of Health , who ’s the local member of parliament and a passionate and articulate defender of the John Frum movement .
He could have been at a summit meeting in Japan today , discussing the proposed ( and American - sponsored ) blacklisting of Pacific tax havens like Vanuatu , but on February 15th there ’s nowhere more important for him to be than Sulphur Bay .
“ The John Frum Movement were the first heroes of the independence movement , ” he explains .
“ They were the first people to speak out against colonial rule .
John Frum ’s message was that we should return to kastom ways , to keep our own identity . ”
This is a view which outside observers began to develop during the 1960s , as interest in traditional cultures and the anti-colonial struggle grew .
David Attenborough , visiting Sulphur Bay in 1960 for his Quest in Paradise TV series , could dismiss John Frum as a “ sinister cult ” , “ pathetically childish ” , and no more than an “ act of defiance towards the mission ” , but the next generation of anthropologists began to interpret it as a response to a broader struggle .
The history of white contact had been , for the Tannese , unremittingly grim : murderous explorers and adventurers followed by slavers and sandalwood traders , followed in turn by “ blackbirders ” who kidnapped the islanders for indentured labour in the Queensland cane - fields , and Presbyterian missionaries who forbade dancing , kava , traditional dress and ritual , enforcing their prohibitions with a rod of iron which gradually developed into colonial administration .
Throughout this history the islanders , disparate peoples speaking unrelated tongues , had no language or structure for forming a group identity and no shared belief system which could operate as the basis for a coalition .
Even their religions had no name until the pidgin term kastom was coined to describe them .
‘ Cargo cults ’ , across the South Pacific , began to be reinterpreted in the West as the evolutionary first stage of labour unions , separatist movements , lobbies for democratic and political reform .
But this view of John Frum as an avatar of political independence is shared by few islanders outside the Movement .
Everyone I spoke to in the rest of Vanuatu seemed to share the view which the Minister imputed to the old colonial dispensation : that John Frum is something of an embarrassment to the progressive - minded and politically engaged Vanuatu of today .
“ This is from the age of our grandfathers , ” one told me , “ before we understood how politics works , and how to get independence for ourselves . ”
The David Attenborough view of the superstitious native waiting hopelessly for his cargo remains the perception of most of the other islanders .
“ John Frum was just a black American GI ” , another told me .
“ But you ca n’t tell the John Frum people that .
You ca n’t tell them he was n’t a god . ”
But the charge that John Frum is a cargo cult is one to which the Minister of Health has a robust response .
He insists not just that John Frum is a cargo cult no longer , but that it never was one in the first place .
“ We Tannese knew about God before the missionaries came .
Of course we knew that there was a creator , who made all this .
But the whites could never understand that there could be a revelation for the black man , a messiah for man Tanna .
They could only imagine it had to be about their consumer goods .
Cargo is not our obsession , it ’s the white man’s . ”
And the American flags , the parade we ’ve just witnessed ?
“ This is not about waiting for cargo to come from America .
This is a reminder of our history .
The Americans helped us , they freed our leaders from the colonial jails . ”
It ’s true that the US Army treated the islanders far better than the colonial rulers , paying far above the standard wage and dispensing free Red Cross aid , but the nature of the alliance between the John Frum Movement and the Marines is less than clear .
This being the 21st century , the Minister of Health intends to set the record straight in the near future on the Vanuatu government website .
Nor are the younger John Frum members backwards or insular in their view of their religion .
“ God appeared to the people of Tanna in the form of John Frum ” , one tells me , “ Just as he appeared to the Jews as Jesus , and to the Indians as Buddha .
It ’s the same message , the same revelation .
Our colonial struggle has happened all across the world , across all different cultures .
John Frum is the messiah of all of us who have had the same struggle . ”
But this ecumenical take on the Movement highlights what is perhaps its central mystery : why here ?
All over the world , kastom and Christianity have come into conflict .
In hundreds of cultures , Christianity has meshed with the old religion , producing versions sometimes so idiosyncratic as to be almost unrecognisable .
In dozens of cultures , too , the yoke of Christianity has been thrown off and the kastom ways returned to .
But where else apart from Tanna has the collision produced a third entity , an entirely new religion , with its own indigenous kastom messiah ?
The strains of these unions and contradictions have frequently told throughout the history of the John Frum movement , and its various prophets have rarely sung from the same hymn sheet .
John has been black and white , man and spirit , Tannese and American .
Cargo has been imminent for some , a metaphor for others .
But this year has seen a schism on a grander scale than any before , one which has split the village of Sulphur Bay in two .
One of its chiefs , Isacwon , has decamped half a mile up the hill into the forest , taking several dozen families with him .
Their village , now six months old , seems well - established , and its first John Frum Day finds it festooned with flowers and decorations .
But it has no central parade ground , and no marching John Frum army : its celebration is a return to kastom in the time before the missionaries .
It ’s hard to get anyone to talk about the split , beyond assuring outsiders that the reasons for it are n’t politically serious .
It ’s doctrinal , a question of spiritual emphasis , perhaps just a case of one prophet too many .
Some of the older people claim to have no idea of why Isacwon split off from the village .
But the politeness clearly conceals a profound rivalry , the fault - line of which can be guessed at from the occasional throwaway comment .
In the new village , I ’m told that no - one ’s that interested in the flag - raising and parade ceremony , it ’s “ just for the tourists ” – an odd assertion given that the only foreigners are myself and a couple of journalists from the Sydney Morning Herald .
In Sulphur Bay proper , the sentiment is that the new village has lost the ritual and ceremonial traditions – “ all they ’re doing up there is eating lap - lap ” .
Has the new village decided to make a break with the cargo ritual of the past , and return to kastom pure and simple ?
However the current dispute resolves itself , it seems that the Last Cargo Cult is far from on its last legs , and that it will continue to dance to the beat of its own unique drum .

Senator Sheldon
Whitehouse on wiretapping : President is not king on matters of spying on Americans Nick Langewis
Published : Saturday December 8 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This On the Senate floor Friday , Senator Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) condemned President Bush 's use of executive orders , and perceived manipulation of the Justice Department through slanted legal opinions , to achieve his ends on the surveillance of Americans abroad .
" Make no mistake , " says Whitehouse of the Protect America Act , " the legislation we passed in August is significantly about spying on Americans -- a business this administration should not be allowed to get into except under the closest supervision . "
" We have a plain and tested device for keeping tabs on the government when it 's keeping tabs on Americans , " continues Senator Whitehouse .
" It is our Constitution . "
A member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Whitehouse was given access to classified documents outlining legal opinions rendered by the Bush Administration 's Office of Legal Counsel , which Whitehouse says is engineered to give Bush the legal permission to unaccountably spy on Americans .
Three of the legal opinions , which have been declassified , are : 1 ) An executive order cannot limit a President .
There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order .
Rather than violate an executive order , the President has instead modified or waived it .
Says
Whitehouse in response , even though Executive Order 12333 limits surveillance of Americans to those the Attorney General has determined to be an " agent of a foreign power , " this legal opinion offers a convenient loophole to waive that mandate , without permission or notification to any person or body .
" So unless Congress acts , " says the Senator , " here is what legally prevents this President from wiretapping Americans traveling abroad at will : nothing . "
2 ) The President , exercising his constitutional authority under Article II , can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President 's authority under Article II .
" Yes , that s right , " says Whitehouse .
" The President , according to the George W. Bush OLC , has Article II power to determine what the scope of his Article II powers are . "
Whitehouse cites the 1803 Marbury v. Madison decision , setting the legal precedent that the judicial branch , not the executive , says what the law is , which contradicts any notion the President might have about his gauging of his own legal powers .
3 ) The Department of Justice is bound by the President 's legal determinations .
" We are a nation of laws , not of men , " says the Senator .
" This nation was founded in rejection of the royalist principles that ' l ' etat c'est moi ' and ' The King can do no wrong . ' "
Continues
Whitehouse , " We are not some banana republic in which the officials all have to kowtow to the ' supreme leader . ' "
Whitehouse condenses the three legal opinions from Bush 's OLC to : 1 ) " I do n't have to follow my own rules , and I do n't have to tell you when I 'm breaking them . "
2 ) " I get to determine what my own powers are . "
3 ) " The Department of Justice does n't tell me what the law is , I tell the Department of Justice what the law is . "
" When the Congress of the United States is willing to roll over for an unprincipled President , " says the Senator , " this is where you end up . "
Text of Senator Whitehouse 's speech is available at his website , where a video is also available for download .
With one week remaining before the campaign pauses for Christmas , Mr. Obama is dashing through a 22 - city tour from the Mississippi River in the east to the Missouri River in the west , rushing to lock in voters before a holiday interlude .
His organization faces its greatest test yet : turning enthusiasm among many grass - roots Democrats into widespread support at the caucuses on Jan. 3 in precincts that will decide the outcome , particularly rural areas where his support still remains uneven after 10 months of campaigning .
As he traveled across Iowa a month ago , a chief element of Mr. Obama ’s pitch was to draw sharp contrasts with Mrs. Clinton and to urge voters to consider whether she had been truthful in explaining her positions .
One of the few mentions he made about his rival here Saturday was to respond to criticism by associates of the Clinton campaign that he was too inexperienced and his background was unexamined .
“ I understand that there ’s a history of politics being all about slash and burn and taking folks down , ” Mr. Obama , of Illinois , told reporters .
“ I recall the Clintons themselves calling it the politics of personal destruction , which they decried .
My suspicion is that ’s just not where the country ’s at right now .
They are not interested in politics as a blood sport . ”
Yet despite a fresh sense of confidence surrounding Mr. Obama , the race in Iowa remains remarkably unsettled , and on Saturday evening The Des Moines Register ’s editorial pages announced its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton .
Many potential caucusgoers are still making up their minds  or are open to changing them  as the six major Democratic candidates unleash advertising that urge voters to consider the gravity of the election .
A variety of polls show Mr. Obama , at worst , to be in a dead heat with Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and strongly gaining on her in New Hampshire , which will have a primary election on Jan .

Cambridge , Mass .
In 2005 , Nicholas Negroponte unveiled an idea for bridging the technology divide between rich nations and the developing world .
It was captivating in its utter simplicity : design a $ 100 laptop and , within four years , get it into the hands of up to 150 million of the world 's poorest schoolchildren .
World leaders and corporate benefactors jumped in to support the nonprofit project , called One Laptop Per Child .
Mr. Negroponte , a professor on leave from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , hopscotched the world collecting pledges from developing nations to buy the laptops in bulk .
But nearly three years later , only about 2,000 students in pilot programs have received computers from the One Laptop project .
An order from Uruguay for 100,000 machines appears to be the only solid deal to date with a country , although Mr. Negroponte says he's on the verge of sealing an order from Peru for 250,000 .
The first mass - production run , which began this month in China , is for 300,000 laptops , tens of thousands of which are slated to go to U.S. consumers .
Mr. Negroponte 's goal of 150 million users by the end of 2008 looks unattainable .
Mr. Negroponte 's ambitious plan has been derailed , in part , by the power of his idea .
For - profit companies threatened by the projected $ 100 price tag set off at a sprint to develop their own dirt - cheap machines , plunging Mr. Negroponte into unexpected competition against well - known brands such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system .
ONTARIO , California ( Reuters ) - Between railroad tracks and beneath the roar of departing planes sits “ tent city , ” a terminus for homeless people .
It is not , as might be expected , in a blighted city center , but in the once - booming suburbia of Southern California .

The noisy , dusty camp sprang up in July with 20 residents and now numbers 200 people , including several children , growing as this region east of Los Angeles has been hit by the U.S. housing crisis .
The unraveling of the region known as the Inland Empire reads like a 21st century version of “ The Grapes of Wrath , ” John Steinbeck ’s novel about families driven from their lands by the Great Depression .
As more families throw in the towel and head to foreclosure here and across the nation , the social costs of collapse are adding up in the form of higher rates of homelessness , crime and even disease .
While no current residents claim to be victims of foreclosure , all agree that tent city is a symptom of the wider economic downturn .
And it ’s just a matter of time before foreclosed families end up at tent city , local housing experts say .
“ They do n’t hit the streets immediately , ” said activist Jane Mercer .
Most families can find transitional housing in a motel or with friends before turning to charity or the streets .
“ They only hit tent city when they really bottom out . ”
Steve , 50 , who declined to give his last name , moved to tent city four months ago .
He gets social security payments , but cannot work and said rents are too high .
“ House prices are going down , but the rentals are sky - high , ” said Steve .
“ If it was n’t for here , I would n’t have a place to go . ”
‘ SQUATTING IN VACANT HOUSES ’
Slideshow ( 8 images )
Nationally , foreclosures are at an all - time high .
Filings are up nearly 100 percent from a year ago , according to the data firm RealtyTrac .
Officials say that as many as half a million people could lose their homes as adjustable mortgage rates rise over the next two years .
California ranks second in the nation for foreclosure filings -- one per 88 households last quarter .
Within California , San Bernardino county in the Inland Empire is worse -- one filing for every 43 households , according to RealtyTrac .
Maryanne Hernandez bought her dream house in San Bernardino in 2003 and now risks losing it after falling four months behind on mortgage payments .
“ It ’s not just us .
It ’s all over , ” said Hernandez , who lives in a neighborhood where most families are struggling to meet payments and many have lost their homes .
She has noticed an increase in crime since the foreclosures started .
Her house was robbed , her kids ’ bikes were stolen and she worries about what type of message empty houses send .
The pattern is cropping up in communities across the country , like Cleveland , Ohio , where Mark Wiseman , director of the Cuyahoga County Foreclosure Prevention Program , said there are entire blocks of homes in Cleveland where 60 or 70 percent of houses are boarded up .
“ I do n’t think there are enough police to go after criminals holed up in those houses , squatting or doing drug deals or whatever , ” Wiseman said .
“ And it ’s not just a problem of a neighborhood filled with people squatting in the vacant houses , it ’s the people left behind , who have to worry about people taking siding off your home or breaking into your house while you ’re sleeping . ”
Health risks are also on the rise .
All those empty swimming pools in California ’s Inland Empire have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes , which can transmit the sometimes deadly West Nile virus , Riverside County officials say .
‘ TRICKLE -DOWN EFFECT ’
But it is not just homeowners who are hit by the foreclosure wave .
People who rent now find themselves in a tighter , more expensive market as demand rises from families who lost homes , said Jean Beil , senior vice president for programs and services at Catholic Charities USA .
“ Folks who would have been in a house before are now in an apartment and folks that would have been in an apartment , now ca n’t afford it , ” said Beil .
“ It has a trickle - down effect . ”
For cities , foreclosures can trigger a range of short - term costs , like added policing , inspection and code enforcement .
These expenses can be significant , said Lt. Scott Patterson with the San Bernardino Police Department , but the larger concern is that vacant properties lower home values and in the long - run , decrease tax revenues .
And it all comes at a time when municipalities are ill - equipped to respond .
High foreclosure rates and declining home values are sapping property tax revenues , a key source of local funding to tackle such problems .
Earlier this month , U.S. President George W. Bush rolled out a plan to slow foreclosures by freezing the interest rates on some loans .
But for many in these parts , the intervention is too little and too late .
Ken Sawa , CEO of Catholic Charities in San Bernardino and Riverside counties , said his organization is overwhelmed and ill - equipped to handle the volume of people seeking help .
“ We feel helpless , ” said Sawa .
“ Obviously , it ’s a local problem because it ’s in our backyard , but the solution is not local . ”

The M&A Dealmaker Course
And now , a few Sundays ago , there was another sensational revelation .
The 34 - year - old D.E. Paulk who had succeeded as the head pastor a year and half ago and was known as the venerable Archbishop 's nephew , stood at the pulpit of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit to announce that his predecessor and presumed uncle was his father !
" I am so very sorry for the collateral damage it 's caused our family and the families hurt by the removing of the veil that hid our humanity and our sinfulness , " said D.E. Paulk .
He said he did not learn the secret of his parentage until a recent paternity test .
" I was disappointed , and I was surprised , " he said .
The paternity test itself was a fallout of the salvation - sex scam .
Yes , the employee , Mona Brewer , sued the church after coming out of the spell .
She said he had exploited her for over four years .
While deposing in the case , the venerable archbishop said under oath that the only woman he had ever had sex with outside of his marriage was Brewer .
But the Cobb County district attorney 's office and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation did n't believe him .
It was at their request the judge ordered the test .
( Atlanta is the capital of the state of Georgia in southern US . )
It is not as if the archbishop was alone in such adventures .
His brother , Don Paulk too has a scam to his credit .
In 1992 , a church member claimed she was pressured into a sexual relationship with him .
Other women also claimed they had been coerced into sex with Earl Paulk and other members of the church 's administration .
The church countered with a $ 24 million libel suit against seven former church members .
The lawsuit was later dropped .
Incidentally Mona Brewer has sued the entire family and the case is still going on .
" It was a necessary evil to bring us back to a God- consciousness , " said the younger Paulk apologetically , explaining that the church had become too personality - driven and prone to pastor worship .
The flashy megachurch began in 1960 with just a few dozen members in the Little Five Points neighborhood of Atlanta .
Now , it is in the suburbs on a 100 - acre expanse , a collection of buildings surrounding a neo -Gothic cathedral .
For years the church was at the forefront of many social movements  admitting black members in the 1960s , ordaining women and opening its doors to gays .
At its peak in the early 1990s , it claimed about 10,000 members and 24 pastors and was a media powerhouse .
By soliciting tithes of 10 percent from each member 's income , the church was able to build a Bible college , two schools , a worldwide TV ministry and a $ 12 million sanctuary the size of a fortress .
Today , though , membership is down to about 1,500 , the church has 18 pastors , most of them volunteers , and the Bible college and TV ministry have shuttered  a downturn blamed largely on complaints about the alleged sexual transgressions of the elder Paulks .
These days , Earl Paulk has a much - reduced role at the cathedral , giving 10 - minute lectures as part of Sunday morning worship each week .

Ms Winfrey ( R ) raised $ 3 m for Mr Obama in September
Oprah 's endorsement
Over 18,000 people attended the event in the state capital , Des Moines .
On 3 January , Iowa will hold the first caucus in the 2008 US presidential election , when activists will choose a candidate for their party 's nomination .
Mr Obama 's rival - Hillary Clinton - has also been campaigning in the state , accompanied by her mother and daughter .
' Compelled to speak '
The Oprah - Obama rally drew the biggest crowd of any campaign event in Iowa so far this year .
JOIN OUR VOTER PANEL
We want to hear views from Iowa , New Hampshire and all the states taking part in ' Super Duper Tuesday ' in 2008 .
This is your chance to write for the BBC News website on the election .

How the panel looked in 2004
" For the very first time in my life I feel compelled to stand up and speak out for the man who I believe has a new vision for America , " Ms Winfrey told the crowd .
Ms Winfrey defended Mr Obama against charges that he lacks experience , saying " the amount of time you spend in Washington means nothing unless you are accountable for the judgment you made " .
And she praised Mr Obama for " [ standing ] with clarity and conviction against this war in Iraq " .
Iowans who had signed up to volunteer at least four hours of their time to the Obama campaign were given priority seats for the event .
Dozens of campaign workers were on hand to sign up fresh volunteers for the senator 's electoral operation .
Ms Winfrey announced her endorsement of Mr Obama 's candidacy in May , and hosted a fundraising event in September which raised $ 3 million ( £ 1.5 million ) for his campaign .
Key state
The race to win the Iowa Democratic caucus is very tight , with most polls showing Mr Obama , Mrs Clinton and another candidate - former Senator John Edwards - neck and neck .
Because it is the first state in the country to hold a caucus , presidential candidates are always keen to prove their electability by winning in Iowa .
Mrs Clinton is also campaigning hard in the state , and has appeared at an event with her mother Dorothy Rodham and her daughter Chelsea , vowing to bring " change across the generations " .
In response to the Oprah - Obama rally , a Clinton staffer said " Senator Clinton is a big fan of Oprah's , and she thinks it is great for candidates to have surrogates campaign on their behalf " .
Former President Bill Clinton has been supporting his wife 's campaign , by appearing at events in another early primary state , South Carolina , while Hillary campaigns in Iowa .
Ms Winfrey is scheduled to attend a series of Obama campaign events in New Hampshire and South Carolina over the next few days .

Last week Amazon.com launched a DRM - free music store .
It sells tracks from two major labels and many independents in the unprotected MP3 file format .
In addition to being DRM - free , Amazon ’s songs are not individually watermarked .
This is an important step forward for the music industry .
Some content companies see individualized watermarks as a consumer - friendly alternative to DRM .
Instead of locking down files with restrictive technology , individualized watermarking places information in them that identifies the purchasers , who could conceivably face legal action if the files were publicly shared .
Apple individually watermarks DRM - free tracks sold on iTunes , but every customer who purchases a particular track from Amazon receives the exact same file .
The company has stated as much , and colleagues and I confirmed this by buying a small number of files with different Amazon accounts and verifying that they were bit - for - bit identical .
( As Wired reports , some files on Amazon ’s store have been watermarked by the record labels , but each copy sold contains the same mark .
The labels could use these marks to determine that a pirated track originated from Amazon , but they ca n’t trace a file to a particular user . )
Individualized watermarks give purchasers an incentive not to share the files they buy , or so the theory goes , but , like DRM , even if watermarking does reduce copyright infringement , that does n’t necessarily mean it makes business sense .
Watermarks create legal risks even for customers who do n’t engage in file sharing , because the files might still become publicly available due to software misconfigurations or other security breaches .
These risks add to the effective cost of buying music for legitimate purchasers , who will buy less as a result .
The difference in risk between a customer who chooses to share purchased files and one who does not is ultimately determined by computer security issues that are outside the content industry ’s control .
Aside from users who are caught red - handed sharing the files , who can be sued even without watermarks , infringers and noninfringers will share a multitude of plausible defenses .
Their songs might have been copied by spyware .
( If watermarking becomes widespread , spyware authors will probably target watermarked files , uploading them to peer to peer networks without users ’ knowledge . )
They might have been leaked from a discarded hard drive or backup tape , or recovered from a stolen laptop or iPod .
The industry will need to fight such claims in order to bring suit against actual infringers , leaving noninfringers to worry that they could face the same fate regardless of their good intentions .
With individualized watermarking , there ’s no knob that the content industry can set that varies the disincentive for sharing purchased files independently of the disincentive for purchasing them at all .
Inevitably , legitimate customers will be scared away .
This makes individualized watermarking a blunt antipiracy tool and a bad bet for the content industry .
Amazon was wise not to use it .
In a marketing case that just sounds too good to be true , vending masters Apex Corp. have purportedly laid out plans that will bring free or subsidized non-alcoholic beverage to thirsty consumers who are willing to watch a 30 - second commercial before partaking .
Aiming to launch next month in Japan , the MediCafe project will give users the option of plunking down the ¥ 70 ( $ 0.58 ) to ¥ 120 ( $ 1 ) required to purchase an item , or watching an advertisement for half a minute while the machine dispenses their liquid of choice .
It was noted that not all drinks would be free , as some advertisers would only be offering up discounts in exchange for your attention , but this still sounds like a much more legitimate way to receive gratis soft drinks than other alternatives we 've seen .

The Science of Large Breasts , and Other Evolutionary Verities
I blogged nearly a year ago about a study by the evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa which argued that beautiful women sometimes marry unattractive men because of the following supply / demand gap : there are simply more good - looking women than there are good - looking men .
One reason , Kanazawa said , is that beauty is a more valuable trait for a female , and is therefore accentuated in females via natural selection .
Kanazawa and Alan Miller have now co-authored a book called Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters : From Dating , Shopping , and Praying to Going to War and Becoming a Billionaire — Two Evolutionary Psychologists Explain Why We Do What We Do , to be published in September .
First of all , whoo ! , long subtitle .
Second of all , there is a sizable excerpt of the book in the current Psychology Today , which includes ten bite - size “ politically incorrect truths about human nature ” that make the book sound like a blend of Why Do Men Have Nipples , Survival of the Sickest , and maybe … Mad magazine ?
Here are the ten topics :
1 . Men like blond bombshells ( and women want to look like them ) ;
2. Humans are naturally polygamous ;
3 . Most women benefit from polygyny , while most men benefit from monogamy ;
4 . Most suicide bombers are Muslim ;
5 . Having sons reduces the likelihood of divorce ;
6 . Beautiful people have more daughters ;
7. What Bill Gates and Paul McCartney have in common with criminals ;
8 . The midlife crisis is a myth - sort of ;
9 . It ’s natural for politicians to risk everything for an affair ( but only if they ’re male ) ; and
10 .
Men sexually harass women because they are not sexist
In the excerpt , some of the explanations are far more compelling than others .
I will chalk this up to the limitations of excerpting .
Here , for instance , is Kanazawa and Miller ’s explanation of why men like large - breasted women :
Until very recently , it was a mystery to evolutionary psychology why men prefer women with large breasts , since the size of a woman ’s breasts has no relationship to her ability to lactate .
But Harvard anthropologist Frank Marlowe contends that larger , and hence heavier , breasts sag more conspicuously with age than do smaller breasts .
Thus they make it easier for men to judge a woman ’s age ( and her reproductive value ) by sight - suggesting why men find women with large breasts more attractive .
Large breasts as a helpful indicator of age ?
Really ?
I would think that , even during the Stone Age , if a man had to resort to judging a woman ’s age by the relative sag of her breasts instead of a number of other signifiers , he probably was n’t the kind of fellow who was going to successfully reproduce anyway .
Jade , 7 : Victim of our disposable culture Photo : de Telegraaf
I noted the story a few days ago about the Dutch diplomat and his wife who kicked Jade , their adopted 7 - year - old Korean daughter , out of their home after claiming she did n’t “ fit in ” with their lifestyle .
Via reader Rand M. and the ROKDrop blog , there is a follow - up at the Times of London with more heart - rending , blood pressure - raising details about the little girl ’s neglect and abandonment by the two selfish beasts :
A diplomat accused of “ dumping ” his adopted daughter flew home yesterday after triggering a row about the ethics of Europeans adopting Asian children .
Jade , a seven - year - old of South Korean origin , is the focus of an escalating dispute across two continents .
At the age of four months she was adopted by a Dutch consular officer based in Hong Kong , Raymond Poeteray , and his wife Meta .
But the couple have now surrendered Jade to the Hong Kong social welfare department for readoption , reportedly because the child could not adapt to Dutch culture .
The revelation has sparked protests amid claims that the couple were treating the child as if she were an unwanted present .
She had been discarded like “ a piece of household rubbish ” , said the Dutch daily De Telegraaf .
The couple blamed the girl for her inability to “ bond . ”
But the little girl ’s caretakers –babysitters hired by the couple–tell the real truth :
Dutch newspapers tracked down a former babysitter yesterday who took care of Jade when she was a baby in Indonesia .
She too was bemused by the fate of the little girl whom she remembers as a quiet but normal child .
“ I took care of her in the evenings , while an Indonesian woman was with her in the daytime , ” she told De Telegraaf .
“ But Meta did not treat as her real daughter . ”
The Hong Kong authorities are searching for new adoptive parents .
Jade speaks Cantonese and English and , despite the claims that she could not communicate with her parents , some Dutch .
Another nanny spoke up :
A nanny who cared for an adopted Korean girl given up by a senior Dutch diplomat and his family claims the girl was not treated like a normal daughter , a news report said Friday .
She was rarely in her mother ’s arms and always in the care of someone else , according to a former Indonesian maid quoted in South China Morning Post Friday .
The woman , who has requested not to be named , worked for the Dutch vice - consul Raymond Poeteray and his wife Meta in Hong Kong and when the family was based in Jakarta in 2002 .
She said she thought it strange that the girl , now eight , was so quiet .
‘ They did not treat her the same way as the son .
There was not the love there , ’ the maid told The Post .
Dutch citizens are outraged and embarrassed –and the Dutch and Korean blogospheres have lit up over the incident :
Online chatrooms have hosted hundreds of comments about the case , most of which condemned the actions of a public servant paid to represent his country .
“ Of course a child that has been given away for adoption is going to have a fear of emotional bonding ! ” said Anna , from Lelystad , on the De Telegraaf website .
Another said : “ What would they have done if their own children had been sick ?
Would they have given them away ?
This man is sick himself – ca n’t he be given away ? ”
The Dutch Foreign Ministry , embarrassed by the international fuss , has recalled the diplomat for consultations but is standing by him .
Many Dutch bloggers , however , argue that he has committed an offence against natural justice and that he should resign from the diplomatic service .
ORDER IT NOW
One blogger found a reference to a party that the Poeterays held in January 2005 in which one grateful guest thanked the diplomat , “ his lovely wife Meta and young son Jamie ” .
There was no mention of Jade , suggesting that she was not fully accepted as a member of the family .
The hostility is in part because the case has stoked up lingering suspicions about the commitment of Europeans to adopted Asian children .
Two years ago an Irish couple caused outrage in Asia when they returned a child to an Indonesian orphanage , saying that she did not fit in .
Brit Sung Kyung Kim prints a statement from a global Korean adoption group that includes a line worth repeating :
“ A child is not a returnable product : Adoption is a lifelong commitment . ”
It would take a master economist to chart the complex interplay of greed , shame , and revenge involved in settling on a price for selling out a lover or , as the case may be , a client .
Or maybe — is n’t this often so where powerful men are concerned ?— something in between .
Not that calculations are n’t made on Flynt ’s side as well .
“ Look , ” he says , “ if we can take down a well - known U.S. senator , we ’ll pay the money — we ’ll pay the million dollars .
But when you get down to congressmen , they ’re a dime a dozen .
If they ’re from some remote area of the country , they ’re not worth very much — maybe 25 , 50 grand .
But presidents and senators are really big paydays . ”
That said , he declines to lay out a detailed price list , though he estimates that over the years he has spent in total upwards of $ 5 million on such matters , between bounties and investigative costs .
Here ’s a boring question :
Is any of this ethical ?
Checkbook journalism — paying for sources — is frowned on by most journalists and forbidden at most mainstream publications and news outlets .
The fear is that , for money , a source will tell you whatever you want to hear , true or not — like waterboarding but with a carrot instead of a stick .
Another issue that journalists do n’t typically broach is that paying sources opens up a can of worms :
If you pay one , do you have to pay all of them ?
And at a time of shrinking news budgets ?!
On the other hand , for someone with a book or movie to promote , the publicity generated by an interview , especially a juicy one , could be considered payment in kind .
And no one seems to feel that paying former public officials and other newsmakers to write book - length memoirs undercuts their veracity or is in any way unethical .
Perhaps what ’s good for Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins should be good for The New York Times and even Hustler ?
I do n’t believe that , but you ca n’t dismiss the question out of hand .
As for anyone ’s qualms about rummaging around in politicians ’ private lives , that train seems to have left the station a decade ago , if not longer .
You could even argue that sexual conduct is a relatively weighty issue in an era when presidential elections can be decided by the loudness of a candidate ’s sighs during a debate .
For his part , Flynt has long since made his peace with being vilified ( if it was even an issue for him to begin with ; he has , after all , admitted to having had sex with a chicken in his youth ) .
He recounts a favorite anecdote , about an interview Livingston gave The New York Times shortly after the Speaker - elect resigned .
“ They asked him what he thought about me , and he said he thought I was a bottom - feeder .
So they called me for a comment and I said , ‘ Yeah , that ’s right , but look what I found when I got down there . ’ ”
Speaking of descent , * Hustler ’*s editorial offices are located seven floors below Flynt ’s executive floor .
The elevator opens onto an unmarked lobby whose only feature is a large table with a marble top upon which sits a Jacuzzi - size urn full of multicolored fake flowers .
Beyond a door , the actual magazine offices are decorated with stained beige carpeting , filing cabinets with pornography piled on top , and battered , generic - issue office furniture .
Though the magazine has been edited here for 12 years , the offices have the thrown - together , transient look of a TV production office or the headquarters of a political campaign .
A word about the magazine ’s content .
There is a popular conception among those who do n’t read it — abetted by the 1996 Miloš Forman film , The People vs. Larry Flynt , which dramatized the publisher ’s free - speech battles but downplayed how precisely he was exercising his rights — that Hustler is a slightly raunchier , blue - collar version of Playboy .
This is n’t quite true .
The magazine , which started publishing nationally in 1974 , is much , much raunchier .
In an airbrushed , Vaseline - lensed era , it established itself with brightly lit , sharply focused , speculum - like views of the female body .
There has been evolution .
Today ’s Hustler pictorials feature not just genitalia but also penetration , ejaculation , sex toys , sodomy , and pretty much everything else that one or two or more people can do without endangering their health , risking arrest , or involving other species .
( Though same - sex impulses are rationed strictly to the ladies . )
None of this is unique on contemporary newsstands .
What continues to distinguish the magazine from its competitors ( in what the magazine industry refers to without embarrassment as the “ men ’s sophisticates ” category ) is ( a ) its calculatingly offensive , aggressively un -P.C. , sometimes ugly , sometimes misogynistic sense of humor , a defining part of its editorial DNA , and ( b ) an increasingly liberal , or at least anti-Bush , political stance , an outgrowth of the magazine ’s historic support of nose - thumbing politics .
If Al Gore had an id , is this what it would look like ?
Though Hustler now publishes columns by old lefties such as Nat Hentoff and Robert Scheer , its singular voice , tapping into cultural resentments that more typically underscore conservative politics , is best captured in a recent cartoon that features President Bush ejaculating on Condoleezza Rice ’s backside — semen features in a lot of Hustler humor — while comparing himself to Strom Thurmond and using a racial epithet .
( Flynt says he usually votes Democratic , except when he ’s casting protest votes for Libertarians , which is another way of cross -sectioning the magazine ’s point of view . )
' Tis the season
It 's an old tradition for the British Medical Journal to publish spoof articles in its Christmas issue .
This week 's BMJ continues the tradition , as the cover image reprinted on the right suggests .
For example , one of the featured articles is Sreeram V Ramagopalan et al. , " Origins of magic : review of genetic and epigenetic effects " , BMJ 335:1299-1301 , 22 December 2007 :
Objective
To assess the evidence for a genetic basis to magic .
Design Literature review .
Setting Harry Potter novels of J K Rowling .
Participants Muggles , witches , wizards , and squibs .
Interventions Limited .
Main outcome measures Family and twin studies , magical ability , and specific magical skills .
Results Magic shows strong evidence of heritability , with familial aggregation and concordance in twins .
Evidence suggests magical ability to be a quantitative trait .
Specific magical skills , notably being able to speak to snakes , predict the future , and change hair colour , all seem heritable .
Conclusions
A multilocus model with a dominant gene for magic might exist , controlled epistatically by one or more loci , possibly recessive in nature .
Magical enhancers regulating gene expression may be involved , combined with mutations at specific genes implicated in speech and hair colour such as FOXP2 and MCR1 .
I can also recommend the article by Gareth Williams and Poonam Dharmaraj , " Dissent of the testis " , which complains that the redesign of certain popular British candies means that they are no longer a suitable substitute for 8 ml orchidometer beads " to gauge testicular volume " ( " This is a major setback for paediatric endocrinology , and the manufacturer 's decision to change the sweets ' morphology without consulting the medical profession is a further kick in the Teasers . " )
The practice of running spoof stories in the BMJ Christmas issue is not exactly a secret .
The lead article in this year 's issue includes a pie chart showing the topical distribution of spoofs over the past two decades :
Apparently , it 's an equally old tradition for the reporters and editors at BBC News to swallow such jokes hook , line and sinker .
A letter printed in the BMJ in 2003 , from John Attia and Kichu Nair , notes :
Every year the BMJ and Medical Journal of Australia use their Christmas edition to inject some medical humour into the normally serious scientific literature .
In this spirit we put together a fictional study entitled " Evidence based physicians ' dressing : a cross - over trial , " in which we documented the effect of " retro " dress ( flared jeans , Hawaiian shirts , moussed hair , and nose rings ) on patients ' confidence .
Tongue in cheek , we described the Kolmogorov - Smirnoff test as two statisticians eyeballing the data over a glass of vodka , and we created a " fashion - operator characteristic " curve which defined a zone of " fashion limbo . "
We also calculated a number needed to dress ( NND ) , analogous to the number needed to treat ( NNT ) .
Despite what we and others saw as the obvious lightheartedness of this story , it has been reported as a serious research finding by the BBC ...
This year , the BBC news team somehow missed the stories on the genetics of magic and the testicular shape of Teasers , but did cover at least two spoof stories as if they were serious .
One was Lee Graves et al. , " Comparison of energy expenditure in adolescents when playing new generation and sedentary computer games : cross sectional study " :
Procedure Participants were fitted with a monitoring device validated to predict energy expenditure .
They played four computer games for 15 minutes each .
One of the games was sedentary ( XBOX 360 ) and the other three were active ( Wii Sports ) .
Main outcome measure Predicted energy expenditure , compared using repeated measures analysis of variance .
Results Mean ( standard deviation ) predicted energy expenditure when playing Wii Sports bowling ( 190.6 ( 22.2 ) kJ/kg/min ) , tennis ( 202.5 ( 31.5 ) kJ/kg/ min ) , and boxing ( 198.1 ( 33.9 ) kJ / kg/ min ) was significantly greater than when playing sedentary games ( 125.5 ( 13.7 ) kJ/kg/min ) ( P< 0.001 ) .
Predicted energy expenditure was at least 65.1 ( 95 % confidence interval 47.3 to 82.9 ) kJ / kg / min greater when playing active rather than sedentary games .
Conclusions
Playing new generation active computer games uses significantly more energy than playing sedentary computer games but not as much energy as playing the sport itself .
This was picked up as " Wii players need to exercise too " ( " Playing ' active ' computer games on consoles such as the Nintendo Wii is no substitute for playing real sports , warn UK experts . " )
Curiously , the BBC reporter was unable to transcribe the spoof article 's statistics correctly -- the third sentence of the article reads :
Wii players used only 2 % more energy than players of regular computer games .
which is a strange way to report the statement " Predicted energy expenditure was at least 65.1 ( 95 % confidence interval 47.3 to 82.9 ) kJ / kg / min greater when playing active rather than sedentary games . "
The second spoof article picked up by the BBC news hounds was from the " Retirement " section -- Sam Shuster , " Sex , aggression , and humour : responses to unicycling " , BMJ 335:1420 -1322 , 22 December 2007 .
The abstract :
After retiring from a busy university department in Newcastle upon Tyne , and with the time and the need for more than the usual consultancies , I was able follow some of my more extreme inclinations .
As a cyclist , I had occasionally thought of using more or fewer wheels , but it was only when choosing a grandson ’s gift that I got seriously lost in contemplation of a gleaming chrome unicycle .
My wife said " buy the bloody " thing , which I did on the whim of the moment .
After months of practice at home , I graduated to back streets , a small paved park , and finally town roads .
I could n’t avoid being noticed ; in turn , I could n’t avoid observing the form that notice took .
Because at the time there were no other unicyclists in the area , such sightings would have been exceptional , yet I soon found that the responses to them were stereotyped and predictable .
I realised that this indicated an underlying biological phenomenon and set about its study .
This was rendered as " Humour ' comes from testosterone ' " ,
12/21/2007 :
Men are naturally more comedic than women because of the male hormone testosterone , an expert claims .
Men make more gags than women and their jokes tend to be more aggressive , Professor Sam Shuster , of Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital , says . [...]
Professor Shuster believes humour develops from aggression caused by male hormones .
In these last two studies , it 's possible ( though not certain ) that the reported data were not made up as a joke , even though the presentations are certainly light - hearted .
And in fact , in the Australian case cited earlier , the news department of the BMJ itself was apparently fooled .
The letter that I quoted before continues :
[ Despite what we and others saw as the obvious lightheartedness of this story , it has been reported as a serious research finding by the BBC ] and now the BMJ , both with a commentary from a medical expert .
We are both amused and alarmed by these occurrences and have been puzzling about their interpretation .
Is this a sad commentary on : * The sense of humour ( or lack of it ) in the medical scientific community ?
* How thoroughly news media check their sources ?
* The state of evidence based medicine ?
Does writing up something as a randomised trial give it such credence that it overrides common sense ?
* How people read articles ?
Is an abstract sufficient to create the perception of veracity ?
We wish to set the record straight that this was a fictional study and was simply intended to be , and was labelled as , medical humour .
From the amount of interest it has generated it may be a fertile area for real research .
I believe that the news department at the BMJ is has now gotten the hint to consider the date and the content before accepting silly - seeming stuff .
However , the journalists and editors at the BBC seem to be quite resistant to the idea of applying any such faculty of judgment -- though I 've occasionally speculated that the whole BBC News enterprise is a sort of vast Pythonic joke , a secret subtle Onion , organized entirely for the private amusement of those initiated into its mysteries .
[ Hat tip : Cosma Shalizi ]
[ Update -- Holly at Feministing does n't think that the BBC 's journalistic incompetence is funny at all ( " The BBC says : humour ' comes from testosterone . '
Holly says : bad reporting ' comes from the BBC . ' " ,
12/21/2007 ) .
She 's right , of course .
But the BBC is insulated from market forces , and apparently impervious to complaint , so what can reasonable people do but try ridicule ? ]
[ Update by Geoff Pullum : Sadly , it 's not just the BBC , and it's not about insulation from market forces ( the World Service of the BBC was spun off into a profit - making separate entity , and a lot of the bad science reporting seems to come from there ) .
The Independent is a profit - making ( or at least , profit - attempting ) newspaper , and a comparatively good one ; but on page 19 of the issue for today , Saturday December 22nd , 2007 , you will find an earnest report by Jeremy Laurance , the Health Editor , reporting the story about the dermatologist on a unicycle correlating male jeering with testosterone level .
He swallows it hook , line and sinker .
It looks to me as if people are being put into science and medicine reporting when they do not have good science degrees .
Or a sense of humor . ]
[ Update # 3 -- the " humor from testosterone " story is certainly spreading vigorously around the world , presented as a serious scientific result .
And the BBC is certainly not the only credulous ( or opportunistic ) media outlet : " Scientist claims men are funnier than women " , The Telegraph ; " Aggression ' makes men more humorous than women ' " , The Independent ; " Humor Develops From Aggression Caused By Male Hormones , Professor Says " , ScienceDaily ; " Is humor tied to male aggression ? " , World Science ; " Quand les testicule régissent l'humour " , TF1 ; " Das Geheimnis des männlichen Witzes " , Spiegel ; " Humor entsteht aus Aggression " , Die Welt ; " L'umorismo è maschile perchè legato a testosterone " , AGI ; " ' L'umorismo è maschio ' , sostiene una ricerca " , ANSA ; " El humor ' está en la testosterona ' " , BBC Mundo ; " Bewijs : mannen hebben inderdaad meer humor " , Elsevier ; " Testosteron ger män aggressiv humor " , Svenska Dagbladet ; " Estudo diz que senso de humor está ligado à testosterona " , BBC Brasil ; " Smysl pro humor je prý výhradně mužská záležitost " , České noviny . ]

NY Times : Law barring college aid to pot offenders should be repealed Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007

It 's time for Congress to repeal a law that prevents students with marijuana convictions from receiving federal financial aid for college , says the New York Times editorial board in a Friday opinion piece .
" Anything that keeps ex-offenders from attending college makes it more likely that they will be caught in the revolving door that leads to prison , " writes the Times .
" Tens of thousands of people have been pushed in that direction since the 1990s when Congress passed a law that barred even minor drug offenders from receiving federal education aid . "
Although the editorial points out that Congress last year struck portions of the law barring aid for individuals whose offenses took place more than ten years ago , it insists that the rest of the provisions should be scrapped as well : " The law is wrong - headed on several counts .
It primarily affects low - income students and exempts the wealthy , who dont need aid to attend college , " continues the Times .
" It targets young people of color , who are disproportionately prosecuted for drug offenses and already less likely to complete college . "
Even relatively small - time offenses , for which criminal courts typically only mete out probation , fines or community service orders , can render an individual temporarily ineligible for aid .
The current provision , passed by Congress as part of a 1998 amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965 , was proposed by Rep. Mark Souder ( R - IN ) .
The legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton .
In 2006 , Congress revised the law again , scaling it back so as to pertain only to those convicted of marijuana crimes while currently receiving aid .
That amendment was tacked on to a deficit - reduction package slashing $ 12.7 billion from federal student - loan programs .
" Federal college aid was never intended to be used as a weapon of enforcement , " concludes the Times .
" Any attempt to employ it that way inevitably results in perverse and unintended results . "
The ACLU and a coalition of organizations critical of US drug policy have previously called for the law 's repeal .

LAS VEGAS  During a tour of a Las Vegas Athletic Club gym , a prospective member , Todd Phillips , was struck by the fact that his wife was offered a cheaper sign - up rate than he was and that there was a special workout area for women .
A club representative dismissed his questions about the disparities , said Mr. Phillips , a lawyer who specializes in gender bias cases , so he filed a complaint with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission , arguing that price breaks and special areas of the health club for women only were illegal under state law .
A ruling is expected shortly .
The complaint is perhaps the first anti-male gender bias case in Nevada , but civil rights panels and courts in several other states have grappled in recent years with what has come to be known informally as Ladies ’
Night law because it often involves policies and practices among bars and nightclubs .
Results have been mixed .
In 1985 , the California Supreme Court ruled that such disparities were illegal , effectively ending them .
Judges in Colorado , Iowa and Pennsylvania all have said that such events and offers are illegal , but state courts in Illinois and Washington have concluded that they are a permissible means of attracting desired customers .

The South American country has bought 100,000 of the machines for schoolchildren aged six to 12 .
A further 300,000 may be purchased to provide a machine for every child in the country by 2009 .
The order will be a boost for the One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) organisation behind the project which has admitted difficulties getting concrete orders .
" I have to some degree underestimated the difference between shaking the hand of a head of state and having a cheque written , " Nicholas Negroponte , the founder of the organisation , recently told the New York Times .
However , he said he was " delighted " with the first deal .
" We commend Uruguay for being the first country to take concrete actions to provide laptops to all its children and teachers and look forward to other countries following this example , " he said .
Rumour factory
The XO laptop , as the machine is known , has been developed to be used primarily by children in the developing world .
It is durable , waterproof and can be powered by solar , foot - pump or pull - string powered chargers .
It includes a sunlight readable display so that it can be used outside and has no moving parts .
OLPC aims to sell the laptop for $ 100 or less .
However , over the last year , the machine 's price has steadily increased and now costs $ 188 ( £93 ) .
Governments were initially offered the green and white machines in lots of 250,000 .
However , this has since changed and there are now a variety of ways that the laptops are sold or distributed .
For example , from 12 November , members of the public can buy a machine for themselves as well as one for a child in a developing country .
The Give 1 Get 1 ( G1G1 ) programme will initially distribute laptops to Cambodia , Afghanistan , Rwanda and Haiti .
Other schemes allow donors to purchase lots of 100 or more of the machines for a country of their choice .
Prices start at $ 299 ( £ 145 ) per machine .
Connected country
However , the main focus for OLPC has been selling the machines direct to governments .
The $ 100 has already been tested in many countries
In July , hardware suppliers were told to ramp - up production of all of the components needed to build the low - cost machines .
Many believed that the decision meant that the organisation had met or surpassed the three million orders it need to make production viable .
However , the latest news suggests this was not the case .
Previous reports had also suggested deals with the governments of Libya , to provide a laptop for every child , as well as Peru and a sponsorship programme with Italy to provide 50,000 machines to Ethiopia .
A spokesperson for OLPC said none of these were confirmed deals .
Instead , Uruguay is the first country to sign up for the scheme .
The order for 100,000 machines was placed by the state - run Laboratorio Tecnológico del Uruguay ( Latu ) which runs a large scale education and communications project known as Ceibal .
The scheme will also provide connectivity to all of the schools involved .
Before placing the order , Latu had also evaluated the rival Intel Classmate PC .
Initially the XO laptops will be distributed in eight to nine of the country 's 19 regions .
A further 300,000 machines will provide machines for all of the country 's children .
" We will also cover the rest of the country later in 2008 and Montevideo in 2009 , " said Miguel Brechner , president of the organisation .
