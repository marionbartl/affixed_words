A vampire is a demonic entity that needs the blood of others to experience life .
Yeshua gave His Blood that others might live , completely emptying His Human Form on the cross . . . and he does not need the blood of others to live , but has eternal life .

A string of deadly attacks in Pakistan in the past week , including one on the army 's HQ in Rawalpindi , has highlighted the increasing militant threat ahead of a planned army offensive in the Taliban stronghold of South Waziristan .
Here Pakistanis , for whom bomb attacks have become part of life , discuss how the army should deal with the militant threat .
Khadija Ali , 20 , law student , Rawalpindi I live next to the army HQ in Rawalpindi , which was under attack on Saturday .
There is a lot of hype created by the media about these attacks .
Yes it was a big attack and yes , there was a siege .
But I did n't feel threatened in any way .
The army was very effective in taking control of the situation and the world did n't come to an end .
When there are frequent attacks they become second nature and they stop bothering you .
You get accustomed to them .
I am not saying that the loss of human life does n't matter .
Extremism is a state of mind which can only be altered through education
Khadija Ali
These attacks have a negative , but also a positive effect .
Do you remember the video of the girl being flogged by the Taliban ?
That changed public opinion against the Taliban .
These suicide attacks consolidate it .
I can confidently say that more than 90 % of people in Pakistan are against the Taliban .
Five years ago the reaction was at best , confused .
This is extremely important in defeating the Taliban .
At this point a military operation seems the only solution .
But what worries me is that innocent people will be killed .
The short - term solution will be to infiltrate these areas .
But more importantly , the long - term solution is education .
Extremism has little to do with guns and weapons , it is a state of mind which can only be altered through education .
The government needs to revise our education policies in order to end the fan - following of these bigoted mullahs .
Doctor in Peshawar Last week 's blast in Peshawar happened in front of one of the gates of the hospital where I work - the biggest hospital in the NWFP .
There were many seriously injured people and I was one of the doctors providing first aid to them .
We 've had quite a few blasts this year in Peshawar .
People are very scared .
Every time I go to the market I worry about bomb blasts .
We are being targeted and our life has become very difficult .
We are waiting and hoping that the situation will get better .
What else can we do ?
I see the latest attacks as an act of desperation by the militants
The army defeated the Taliban in Swat .
But other areas need urgent attention .
The operation in South Waziristan needs to begin as soon as possible .
We are anxiously waiting for something to be done , for the operation to be conducted as soon as possible .
I see the latest attacks as an act of desperation by the militants .
This is a fight for survival for them .
They react in this manner when they are threatened .
When the operation in Swat started , there were a few attacks in Peshawar .
Now that an operation in South Waziristan has been announced - they attack the army headquarters .
Everybody is miserable and sad .
We do n't know what will happen .
Rafique Waqas , 27 , news presenter , Lahore Rafique : Nothing is good news any more I am a TV presenter and while I try my best to remain indifferent to the news I read , the attack in Swat made me realise that my voice and expression was a bit too grim .
It was devastating to find out that a 13 - year - old kid carried out this attack .
The fact that children are being brain - washed into committing suicide attacks is a matter of great concern .
The army need to realise that there is a great challenge ahead .
They thought that they had broken the back of the militants in Swat .
But the very fact that the attack happened a day after the attack on the army HQ means that the militants are very much together and well organised , despite the death of Baitullah Mehsud .
There is no leadership crisis in the Taliban .
The attack on the army HQ proves in a way that militants are frustrated that they have been dismantled in Swat .
They wanted to show that they are still a force to be reckoned with and they struck back with full force .
The army need to go to Waziristan .
The operation has been delayed for a long time and there 's no reason to delay it any further .
Why have they delayed it ?
It could all be about deployment .
The army is also in Malakand , now south Punjab is coming into the picture as well .
The army must be struggling to be in all those places .
People are worried that the delay of the South Waziristan operation puts lives in danger .
I am concerned because the number of casualties has risen dramatically .
Nothing is good news any more .
Hasan Zaman , 27 , graphic designer , Islamabad The Taliban are trying to make a statement .
They do not want their territory in South Waziristan invaded .
I do n't think Pakistan is even capable of carrying out such a big operation right now .
The repercussions are going to be more bomb explosions and suicide attacks .
That greatly damages the business climate and that in its turn affects everyone .
Things are deteriorating - over 60 % of businesses have closed down since 2007 .
Our livelihoods and the future of our generation are at stake .
I am scared of the fact that I might see the end of Pakistan in my lifetime
I work on the creative side of the industry .
The advertising industry is greatly affected by businesses shutting down , which makes things difficult for me .
People in Islamabad are on red alert .
The area where the UN office is - that 's a central and posh area of Islamabad .
Yet it was attacked .
First it was Karachi , now it 's Islamabad .
When you live in a place which is under attack you think twice before going out to get bread .
People are very scared and you can easily see it - there are fewer people on the streets .
America has responsibility .
" Afpak " strategy - this is something I am afraid of .
Pakistan is very different from Afghanistan .
I am afraid that all America wants is to establish bases in Pakistan to use as a launching pads to conduct its operation in Afghanistan .
The army should try to consolidate the situation within Pakistan 's borders before focusing on areas close to the border with Afghanistan .
If they can't provide security in Islamabad , how are they going to sort out Waziristan ?
The popular opinion is that we are being sold to America piece by piece .
Our national integrity is at risk .
I am scared of the fact that I might see the end of Pakistan in my lifetime .

During a bizarre hearing there yesterday , a Superior Court judge dismissed animal - cruelty charges against a Moorestown police officer accused of sticking his penis into the mouths of five calves in rural Southampton in 2006 , claiming a grand jury could n't infer whether the cows had been " tormented " or " puzzled " by the situation or even irritated that they 'd been duped out of a meal .
NEW YORK , July 29 ( UPI ) -- New
York is providing homeless families with one - way airline tickets out of town in an effort to keep them out of the city 's shelter system , officials say .
Since 2007 , the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg has paid for more than 550 families to leave the city , The New York Times reported Wednesday .

City officials say there is no limit to where a family can be sent .
So far , the program has provided flights to 24 states and five continents , most often to Puerto Rico , Florida , Georgia and the Carolinas .
One family with 10 children accepted an offer to go to Puerto Rico while another family moved to France with their three children .
New York spends $ 500,000 a year on the program which employs a local travel agency to book the one - way flights .
" We want to divert as many families as we can that need assistance , " says Vida Chavez - Downes , who heads the program .
Mark Uemura ( mtu@ ) writes in :
I have always been intrigued with encrypted network tunnels , be it ipsec ( 4 ) or ssh ( 1 ) .
Yet , I do n't think that anything beats SSH VPN tunneling on OpenBSD for a quick , elegant and stealth - like solution without the IPsec headaches .
Read on to find out more about SSH VPN tunnels :
Articles 1 2 3 4 5
After discussing tunnels with Ryan McBride ( mcbride@ ) and its implications for security and / or policy violations , he made a comment that he has yet to see a network that he was not able to tunnel out of .
There are various tools in ports to do just that , assuming that you are not using IPsec or SSH .
However , before I get into corporate policy violations and back - channel malware tunnels , I should back up in time to give some perspective and my experiences with VPNs .
At C2K6 , I was working with Hans - Joerg Hoexer ( hshoexer@ ) on IPsec failover VPNs using sasyncd ( 8 ) .
I also had the pleasure of sitting pretty close to Reyk Floeter ( reyk@ ) .
He was the first person to introduce me to VPN tunnels using SSH .
Reyk had a SIP phone that he was carrying around to call home with a SSH VPN using the tun interface .
He developed this SSH VPN functionality with bits of code from Markus Friedl ( markus@ ) and merged it into OpenSSH at the end of 2005 .
Since then , we have had the ability to create SSH based layer 2 or layer 3 VPN tunnels all handled at layer 7 :-) .
It was n't until last year that I started experimenting with this in earnest .
Normally , I use SSH port forwarding with authpf ( 8 ) and key / passphrase authentication for most things and IPsec with authpf where port forwarding is not practical .
Generally , with OpenSSH VPNs , you do n't have to worry about Maximum Transition Unit ( MTU ) issues or firewalls getting in the way of the VPN .
For the record , I 'm not a fan of PKI so I have never gone down the ssl ( 8 ) VPN path .
SSH VPNs do their magic at the application layer ( layer 7 ) without the headaches and baggage that come with traditional IPsec VPNs .
Now , I can use OpenSSH to do what IPsec used to do for me in the past .
IPsec on OpenBSD is really simple to set up but became more problematic with other Operating Systems .
Yes , you need to work through this and familiarize yourself with IPsec implementations for each OS but it seems more complicated than it needs to be .
OpenBSD has really simplified the setup and configuration of IPsec VPNs .
Unfortunately , in the real world , you often come across firewalls that block ESP / AH or ISAKMP / ISAKMP - NAT -T .
Moreover , packet fragmentation caused by MTU issues were always a concern .
If you did n't get the MTU just right , the user would run into fragmentation issues making the VPN really slow resulting in a negative end user experience .
Lowering the MTU is really important in order to avoid this issue but in doing so , you inevitably reduce the maximum throughput of non-IPsec traffic .
However , too many networks block icmp( 4 ) or TCP MTU discovery which at times can cause " speed issues " with the road warriors you need to support .
Well , with pf and scrub you can compensate for this but when you are dealing with Windows , changing the MTU is an all or nothing dilemma .
To the point , with SSH VPNs , you 've got one of the most trusted of SSH implementations , OpenSSH , and all the security goodness that comes with it .
Here 's a simple config set borrowed from ssh ( 1 ) :
How to use OpenSSH - based virtual private networks
-------------------------------------------------
(1) Server : Enable support for SSH tunneling ( /etc/ssh/sshd_config ) : PermitTunnel yes send the hangup signal ( SIGHUP ) to reload the new sshd_config ( 2 ) Server : Restrict client and assign the tunnel ( / root/.ssh/authorized_keys ) tunnel= " 1 " , command= " sh /etc/netstart tun1 " ssh-dss ... my_id_dsa ( 3 ) Server : /etc/hostname.tun1 inet 192.168.5.2 255.255.255.252 192.168.5.1 !/sbin/route add - inet zzz.yyy.xxx.0/24 192.168.5.1 ( 4 ) Client : Configure the local network tunnel interface ( /etc/hostname.tun1 ) set up the layer 3 tunnel on the client : inet 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.252 192.168.5.2 !/sbin/route add - inet aaa.bbb.ccc.0/24 192.168.5.2 ( 5 ) Client : Configure the OpenSSH client ( in /root/.ssh / config ) : Host AAA .
BBB .CCC.DDD Tunnel yes TunnelDevice 1:any PermitLocalCommand yes LocalCommand sh /etc / netstart tun1
The following network plan illustrates the previous layer 2 configuration .
zzz.yyy.xxx.0/24 aaa.bbb.ccc.0/24
---------------- ---------------- | | | | zzz.yyy.xxx.www
AAA .BBB.CCC.DDD +--------+ ( )
+--------+ | Client |--------------(
Internet )---------------|
Server | +--------+ ( )
+--------+ : 192.168.5.1 192.168.5.2 : :.....................................................: Forwarded ssh connection ( Layer 3 tunnel ) --- real connection ... " virtual connection " AAA .
BBB .CCC.DDD " Server public IP address " aaa.bbb.ccc.0/24
" Private network behind above public IP address " zzz.yyy.xxx.www
" Client private IP address " zzz.yyy.xxx.0/24
" Private network behind above private IP address " ( 6 ) Client : Connect to the server and establish the tunnel # ssh AAA .
BBB .
CCC.DDD when successful , you should see the following interface created on the server : tun1 : flags=51 mtu 1500 groups : tun inet 192.168.5.2 --> 192.168.5.1 netmask 0xfffffffc ( 7 ) Client and Server : pf needs to be configured to allow and perhaps hide networks on either side via NAT .
Essentially both the client and the server have become VPN peers .
The Client above is not directly connected to the Internet .
It is on a private network behind some Internet router .
Imagine the client inside some corporate network .
I went a little crazy to see how far I could take this .
When forced to use Windows , I would configure VMWare and install OpenBSD as a guest and then create the SSH VPN .
I could then pass traffic to and from Windows through the tunnel using OpenBSD and OpenSSH as the conduit .
I 've done similar things with Mac OS X but David Gwynne ( dlg@ ) informed me that there are more elegant hacks that can be done when using a Mac .
Obviously , running OpenBSD in VMWare just to create a VPN to tunnel out of some restricted network seems a little much and dangerous for many reasons but it is not too difficult to do .
Alternatively , you can create the SSH VPN tunnel on a different machine running OpenBSD and turn it into a router for other machines to enjoy the tunnel too .
Now the benefits are that you do n't have to worry about firewalls as most networks do n't proxy SSL connections .
Configuring your SSH server to listen on port 443 and / or port 53 eliminates firewall issues most of the time .
Since we are using OpenSSH for this VPN , we also do n't have to worry about fragmentation issues :-) .
Thanks Reyk !
The above discussion is background info for another article that I have in the pipeline .
In the meantime , I would be very curious and happy to hear what others have to say about their experience with SSH VPN tunnels using the tun interface .
I am also interested in what packages and efforts you go through to break out of supposedly secure proxied networks .

Russia has put its troops in South Ossetia on heightened alert ahead of the first anniversary of its war with Georgia .
At the same time , Tbilisi warned of the risk of renewed fighting over the breakaway region .
Accusations flew from both sides , with Georgia denying it had fired mortars into the disputed territory .
EU monitors said they had seen no evidence of shelling .
Fighting erupted last summer when Tbilisi tried to retake its rebel region .
Moscow sent in the troops , who routed the Georgian forces and drove towards the capital .
Amid claim and counter - claim , the Georgians say Russia has physically moved the border line south of the village of Kveshi , to drag the village into South Ossetia .
These pictures were shot by local Georgian television and purport to show new border posts and their original positions .
Russia denied the charge and , in turn , accused Tbilisi of provocation .
President Obama ’s speech to the kids is now available , and it just makes the right - wingers look absolutely absurd .
In a sane world , this would be the tipping point for our members of the media , and they would simply stop taking these folks seriously .
My personal favorite wingnut excuse for the crazy was offered up by the increasingly amusing Malkin :
It ’s not the speech , it ’s the subtext .
It ’s the radical activism of the White House Teaching Fellows who designed the education guides tied to Obama ’s speech .
Yeah .
It ’s the subtext , alright .
You ca n’t make this shit up .
Lupica had it right when he called these guys mouth - breathers .
*** Update ***
BTW -
Who do you all think will be the first wingnut to find a hidden coded message in the text of the speech ?
The odds on favorite for that kind of lunacy would be Glenn Beck , but then again the one lunatic who pushed the “ Republican car dealers is being punished ! ” nonsense would be a good bet , too , as would that clown who freaked out over dijon mustard .
There is just so much quality amateur wingnuttery going on these days that there really is no safe bet anymore .
Now that I think about it , these guys freaked out for two days over the condiment he put on his hamburger .
We should have realized a speech to schoolkids would give them the vapors .
Hurricane Katrina was the one event that unraveled the Bush Administration .
This horrible event unmasked what the Bush White House was all about and Bush lost the independent voters for the Republican Party by their uncaring , insensitive , do n't carish attitude towards the people of the Gulf Region .
We , Americans watched in horror as New Orleans unraveled and the Super Dome became a death trap , all LIVE on television .
To this DAY , I will never forget the reporting of Jeanne Meserve , CNN , it was dark , night fall and she literally had to keep it together as you heard screams , cries for help , people trapped in flooded homes , etc .
I will never , ever forget her reporting it brought streaming tears to my eyes .
Hurricane Katrina hardened Americans towards the Bush Administration and their total disarray and unpreparedness for what happened .
And who can forget as President Bush was in a hangar in Alabama , telling the television crew that , " Brownie you 're doing a hellava job . "
When the reality on the ground was that Brownie was not doing SHIT as FEMA Director .
How can one forget how long it TOOK FEMA to get water , food , transportation into New Orleans and the hard hit parts of Mississippi ?
Who can forget Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans telling the federal goverment to , " Get off your asses " !!
The Republicans with Bush paid a price for their horrible handling of Hurricane Katrina and their lack of empathy and sensitivity .
Now , President Obama who blasted the Bush Administration for their reckless handling of Hurricane Katrina , came into New Orleans , yesterday for a quick drive by .
When I read he was only going to be there four hours , my first inclination was , " Who set this up ? "
Especially , when he left to go to a glitzy fundraiser in San Francisco ?
Obama White House , do n't ever do this again .
That whole Gulf Region is STILL A DISASTER AREA , it warrants more than a four hour drive by , while you are picking up gumbo , President Obama .
President Obama 's brief display of drive - by compassion Thursday in New Orleans was , for me , by far the worst outing of his presidency thus far -- and the biggest disappointment .
I covered Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath -- the flood in New Orleans that drowned a great city , the storm surge in Mississippi that erased whole communities , the devastation , the agony .
For weeks afterwards , I had trouble sleeping .
I could n't forget the scenes I 'd witnessed or the stories I 'd heard .
More than a year later , I covered a Senate subcommittee hearing in New Orleans on the lagging reconstruction effort .
I watched as a young senator who was thought to be considering a presidential run -- that would be Barack Obama -- used his Harvard Law skills to eviscerate Bush - era officials for not doing enough to rebuild and revive the Gulf Coast region .
So it was strange and disheartening that Obama would wait nine months to make his first visit to New Orleans as president .
It was stunning that he would spend only a few hours on the ground and that he would n't set foot in Mississippi or Alabama at all .
But worst of all was the way he seemed to dismiss the idea that his administration could and should be doing much more .
I know that local officials say the Obama administration is more responsive and more effective than the Bush administration , but that 's not saying much .
What says more is that New Orleans still does n't have an operational full - service hospital .
And that an adequate flood barrier is still not in place .
" I wish I could just write a check , " Obama said .
If that was his message , he should have stayed home .
We now know that our government can make hundreds of billions of dollars available to irresponsible Wall Street institutions within a matter of days , if necessary .
We can open up the floodgates of credit to too - big - to - fail banks at the stroke of a pen .
But when it comes to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast , well , these things take time .
I doubt these are the priorities Obama wants to be remembered for .
What would an AIDS vaccine mean to the world ?
In some ways , it would outshine a cure for the common cold .
After all , even if the cold and its stealth wingman , pneumonia , kill more people , they do n’t do it quite so grimly .
People with AIDS tend to die after years of suffering , often screaming from the agony of cryptococcal meningitis or choking on thrush fungus .
In poor countries , they too often leave behind a blighted harvest of orphans , coldly furious infected spouses and spiteful neighbors cackling with schadenfreude and lying about their own H.I.V. status .
Those who slip away from pneumonia are usually very old and weak or very young and weak .
Families may be bereft , but less often financially and spiritually broken .
On a larger scale , a vaccine would mean so many things :
The end of an age of fear that has loomed since the 1980s and has gnawed at Africa the way the Black Death once gnawed at Europe , only more slowly .
The savings of billions of dollars .
An excuse for the vast new disease - specific institutions like UNAids , the President ’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria to hold their medal ceremonies , play their anthems , pack up and head home .
( Fat chance , since bureaucracies are immortal  though , admittedly , there is no UNSmallpox . )
But there is nothing to suggest in the news from Thailand this past week that such an age is dawning .
In a conversation about the politics of freedom David Boaz and Dennis McCuistion answer the question : “ What is a libertarian ? ” as well as discussing the societal fight over power and freedom since time immemorial .
Joining Dennis McCuistion is David Boaz .
David Boaz is the Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute and author of Libertarianism : A Primer .
Dennis and David talk about the principles of libertarianism that are in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution .
They discuss absolute free trade and the conflict between big government , the Federal Reserve and free markets .
As they continue to discuss all that surrounds the question , “ What is a libertarian , ” they address the query of individuals having the right and responsibility to make decisions over their own lives , yet today government makes many of these decisions .
The classical liberal position of the 18th century is discussed and how parties function today .
They continue to discuss libertarianism by discussing Think Tanks and the differences between them .
The Cato Institute , for instance , is fiscally conservative but socially liberal .
David Boaz addresses the ‘ polling ’ Cato has done regarding how people view politics and parties .
He states that many poll libertarian on the fiscally conservative , socially liberal side , with less government interference .
As a Think Tank , Cato is skeptical of government interference in your personal life , from what Americans read to whom Americans marry .
They believe that the government has no right to dictate values .
Cato is different from the Heritage Think Tank , which is more conservative .
Brookings , for instance , is more sympathetic to government and is further to the left on economic policies .
Dennis and David both agree that ideas are important and many voters do n’t seem to care and certainly government does not .
Policies are made by special interest groups promoting their own agendas .
Yet independence is bred into the bones of the United States .
It is what makes us a great country and freer than others .
We have free enterprise , private property , religious freedom , and separation of Church and State .
Join us as we answer the question , “ What is a libertarian ? ” and discuss issues surrounding libertarianism and the politics of freedom .

1803 – 10.11.09
For Ms. West , whose youthful appearance belies her age , in her mid-50s , the nights spent on couches in other people ’s homes were uncomfortably familiar .
She grew up an only child in a housing project in Neptune , N.J. , where her mother slept in the lone bedroom , and she occupied a pullout sofa in the living room .
“ I ’ve always had this dream of doing better , ” she said .
“ I always wanted to own my own house . ”
She realized that dream shortly after arriving in Cleveland with her husband and two children in the early 1990s .
At first , they rented .
But one fall afternoon , Ms. West found herself on a block lined with leafy trees in Mount Pleasant , a neighborhood east of the Cuyahoga River that was a magnet for middle - class black families like hers .
Red brick homes with wooden porches sat on ample lots .
Public schools were a few blocks away .
When she saw an ad in the Sunday paper offering a house on that very block , she bought it for $ 45,000 ; for the $ 9,000 down payment she used the savings her mother had left her when she died .
She and her husband assumed the mortgage from the previous owner , with affordable payments of less than $ 400 a month .

By December , she will exhaust its 90 - day limit .

Ms .
West then had a job as a maintenance worker at an apartment complex for about $ 9 an hour .
Her husband earned about $ 10 an hour as a truck driver .
As the years passed , they added shrubbery to the front yard and photos of children ’s birthday parties to the walls .
“ I thought that was going to be my house , ” she said .
She tapped her inheritance to buy another house on nearby Union Street , paying $ 15,000 in cash for a light - blue , vinyl - sided A - frame .
She turned the house into a home for five homeless people .
She did their laundry , reminded them to take their medications and cooked meals , while collecting payments of up to $ 750 a person each month from the agencies that placed them .
Over the years , Ms. West and her husband spent more than they earned .
They used credit cards to finance restaurant meals .
They bought a new S.U.V .

Pour David Schardt , nutritionniste en chef au Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) , une des plus importantes associations américaine de défense des consommateur , « si Bernard Madoff avait fait dans le business alimentaire , il aurait donné dans les ' doses d'essai gratuites ' de pilules pour maigrir à base d'açaï » .
L'objet du délit ?
Une gigantesque arnaque à la carte bancaire sévissant depuis quelques mois sur Internet et révélant un engouement tout aussi énorme pour une petite baie amazonienne , rapidement promue au rang de super - aliment bien - être .
Pendant ce temps -là , les populations locales voient un ingrédient phare de leur cuisine traditionnelle devenir trop cher pour eux .
Vous avez certainement déjà vu ces encarts ( il y en a des tonnes sur Facebook , sur des pages web ciblant un public féminin , dans les pubs Google lors d'une recherche évoluant autour du champ lexical du régime , en fait à peu près partout ) vous promettant une perte de poids spectaculaire .
Au pire , si vous avez cliqué dessus , vous êtes arrivé sur des sites aussi grandiloquents que moches , narrant les exploits de Sophia ou de Julie qui , photos « avant - après » à l'appui , vous expliquent en long , en large , et dans un français pas très correct , comment elles ont réussi à perdre plusieurs dizaines de kilos en quelques semaines grâce à l'action combinée de l'açaï , une plante amazonienne « révolutionnaire » , et d'un complexe « purificateur de côlon » .
Pour ne pas vous laisser en reste , Sophia et Julie s'appuient sur la meilleure caution scientifique possible - c'est passé à la télé - , et si , par hasard , vous tentiez de fermer la fen être de votre navigateur , histoire de reprendre vos esprits ou de « googler » les bienfaits réels de cette merveilleuse plante du bout du monde , une boîte de dialogue vous demandera si , réellement , vous souhaitez quitter la page et renoncer à l'incroyable cadeau qui vous est offert .
Car oui , comble de leur bienveillance , vos nouvelles copines de diète vous proposent d'essayer « complètement gratuitement » leurs remèdes miracles .
Qui pourrait résister ?
Maigrir du compte en banque
Complètement gratuitement ?
Non , pas complètement , enfin , bon on se comprend : il vous faudra vous acquitter des frais de port - environ 5 € .
Au diable les varices , une broutille comparée au retour triomphal de votre poids de jeunesse ET à un intérieur d'entrailles totalement sain .
Fébrile , donc , vous rentrerez votre adresse ( vite vite !
des lettres rouges et clignotantes vous alertent sur l'expiration prochaine de l'offre et des stocks limités ! ) ainsi que votre numéro de carte bancaire - le tout en https , vous êtes à l'abri .
Mais là , c'est le drame : et de un , jamais vous ne recevrez les échantillons promis , et de deux , jamais vous ne maigrirez de 30 kilos en deux semaines , et de trois , votre carte bancaire sera débitée régulièrement de quelques dizaines , voire de quelques centaines d'euros sans que vous ne puissiez rien faire , sinon mettre votre carte en opposition - et payer les frais bancaires qui vont avec .
La vie est parfois bien injuste .
C'est en mars 2009 que le CSPI tire la sonnette d'alarme : des milliers de personnes ayant cru commander des doses d'essai de pilules diététiques miracle se retrouvent avec des débits bancaires interminables , certains atteignant la centaine de dollars .
La chose vient aux oreilles du Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) , vénérable réseau de surveillance économique et d'éthique commerciale nord - américain , qui , devant la multiplication des sites frauduleux ( dont certains , pas fous , mettent en garde les internautes contre l'arnaque et garantissent l'envoi des bonnes pilules sans entourloupe ) appose désormais son logo sur des sites « vérifiés » de vente de complètements alimentaires à base d'açaï .
Du sorbet de plage au super - aliment star
Si rien ne prouve qu'il puisse , en un clin d'œil , transformer une Beth Ditto en une Kate Moss ( les images des 75 - au moins - sites - miroir sont à l'origine des « photoshopages » vendus sur Istockphoto ) , l'açaï ( Euterpe oleracea ) est un palmier poussant dans les zones marécageuses d'Amérique du Sud .
Son nom dérive du terme natif içá - çai ou poétique « fruit qui pleure » car , une fois mortes , ses feuilles tombent très vite .
Consommés depuis des lustres , ses fruits , des baies violettes et huileuses , sont un aliment de base des populations locales .
En Amazonie , bien avant la colonisation du Brésil par les Portugais , on en faisait du jus , elles accompagnaient aussi du poisson frit ou se retrouvaient piquetées dans une purée de manioc .
Aujourd ' hui encore , à Belem , la consommation quotidienne de jus d'açaï avoisine les 200 000 litres , dépassant celle du lait .
Et voici peu de temps , c'était tout : il fallait avoir traversé l'Atlantique , voire le poumon vert de la planète pour connaître l'existence des baies d'açaï .
Et même si , dans les années 1980 , le sorbet à l'açaï devint un hit des plages brésiliennes , personne ne voyait encore l'intérêt à ramener dans les villes occidentales ce fruit exotique .
De plus , il pourrissait très vite , ce qui rendait son importation délicate .
L'heure de gloire de l'açaï devait attendre la fin des années 1990 et le début des années 2000 , quand l'homo occidentalis moyen se mit à avoir peur pour sa santé .
Lui qui se pressait auparavant , clope au bec , dans des cabines d'UV , commença à parler cancer , vieillissement cellulaire , fitness et alicament .
En 2004 , la bible de l'hygiénisme post - moderne , The Perricone Promise , ouvrage d'un dermatologue éponyme , affirmait que le salut des riches blancs flippés par la mort ( avec des rides ) leur serait garanti par une meilleure alimentation - la première des médecines , on ne cesse de vous le répéter , spots du Ministère de la Santé à l'appui .
En particulier , pour résister à tous les fléaux du monde moderne ( cancer , Alzheimer , diabète , maladies cardio - vasculaires , arthrose ou cataractes ) celle - ci devait s'enrichir en antioxydants , soit toutes les substances ( vitamines A , C et E , minéraux , caroténoïdes , polyphénols ... ) empêchant le « stress oxydatif » , cet horrible phénomène faisant que tout corps plongé dans un environnement riche en oxygène en vient irrémédiablement à... s'oxyder .
Que retrouvait - on dans la liste du Dr Perricone ?
Vous êtes perspicace : l'açaï .
Pour le Dr Perricone , l'açaï était même « l 'aliment le plus nutritif au monde et le plus puissant agent antivieillissement qui soit » , dix fois plus antioxydant que le raisin rouge , à la concentration en anthocyanines ( les pigments responsables de sa couleur pourpre ) trente fois supérieure au vin rouge , avec aussi des tas de graisses mono - insaturées , dont l'acide oléique ( comme dans l'huile d'olive ) , bonnes pour le cœur , des fibres et des phytostérols , des acides aminés essentiels propres à régénérer les tissus musculaires , etc .
C'est d'ailleurs sous cette étiquette « régénérante » que Guayapi , marque phare des épiceries bio , spécialistes en bien de la planète et de soi , le commercialise en France , à près de 450 € le kg .
En vrai , le Dr Perricone s'est un peu avancé : si l'açaï est certes un bon anti-oxydant , sa teneur en substances magiques est relativement moyenne .
Selon la méthode TEAC ( Capacité Antioxydante en Équivalent Trolox ) , l'açaï est même en-dessous du raisin ; dans l'ordre décroissant acerola > mangue > fraise > raisin > açaï > goyave > murier > graviola > fruit de la passion > cupuaçu > ananas .
Mais trop tard , la nouvelle mode est lancée .
En 2007 , Coca - Cola signe un contrat avec Bossa Nova http://www.bossausa.com/flash/ , la principale marque de jus d'açaï , Procter & Gamble décide de sortir un shampooing « Herbal Essences » contenant un extrait de la baie , Smirnoff conçoit une déclinaison de son « happy drink » , Smirnoff Ice , parfumé à l'açaï , et sur les chaînes de télé , la folie se propage .
Chez Oprah Winfrey , mastodonte des talk - shows , le Dr. Mehmet Oz , mélange de Jean - Pierre Coffe et du Dr. Ross , consacre une de ses rubriques du mardi à la petite baie , chronique devenue d'ailleurs la référence des sites frauduleux .
A l'heure qu'il est , Oprah Winfrey et Mehmet
Oz ont entamé des poursuites légales pour utilisation abusive de leurs noms .
Pendant ce temps -là , en Amazonie les prix flambent - sur un an , l'augmentation frôle les 60 % , sur 10 ... 500 % ( inflation déduite ) : le litre avoisinant auparavant les 39 centimes d'euro s'arrache aujourd ' hui à 2 € , dans une région où le revenu moyen avoisine les 150 € mensuels .
La baie , auparavant bien culturel comparable à notre patate ( qui , rappelons - le , est native des Andes ) , est devenue un luxe .
Ce qui , pour Adaladio Correio Santos , marchand d'açai depuis quarante ans , ne va pas sans créer pas un manque insupportable : « Si quelqu 'un ne peut pas manger d'açai , il va dire qu'il manque quelque chose dans son estomac , même s'il vient de faire un repas complet .
Pour tout le monde ici , sans açai , rien ne peut vous rassasier » .
Imaginez les frites s'arracher au prix du caviar , on ne frôlerait pas la guerre civile peut - être ?
Au jeu de l'offre et de la demande , la solution pourrait venir de Açai Farm qui , c'est ingénieux , propose non pas l'achat de baies mais du palmier entier - de quoi concilier chez l'homo occidentalis , désir de mourir en pleine forme et bonne conscience écologique .
Une fois sauvées les traditions alimentaires des indigènes du bout du monde , son intérieur décoré avec une plante verte super « hype » , et ses cellules régénérées de l'intérieur au niveau de son ADN cellulaire , il ne reste plus qu'à trouver le prochain fruit qui résoudra tous nos problèmes .
Tiens , en Chine , ils viennent de trouver une plante qui guérirait la grippe H1N1 ...

The Day the Penis asked for a Raise
I , the Penis , hereby request a raise in salary for the following reasons :
I do physical labor .
I work at great depths .
I plunge headfirst into everything I do .
I do not get weekends or public holidays off .
I work in a damp environment .
I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation .
I work in high temperatures .
My work exposes me to contagious diseases .
Sincerely ,
P. Niss
The Response :
Dear Penis :
After assessing your request , and considering the arguments you have raised , the administration rejects your request for the following reasons :
You do not work 8 hours straight .
You fall asleep after brief work periods .
You do not always follow the orders of the management team .
You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations .
You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working .
You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift .
You do n't always observe necessary safety regulations , such as wearing the correct protective clothing .
You will retire well before you are 65 .
You are unable to work double shifts .
You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed assigned task .
And if that were not all , you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious - looking bags .
Sincerely , V. Gina

Today , the New York Times published the article “ MIT Taking Student Blogs to the Nth Degree , ” an overview of student blogging at universities and colleges in America .
It is astounding that MIT is willing to publish completely uncensored student blogging on its website .
And inspiring .
This represents , for me , the beginning of the uncensored corporate blog .
Which is exactly what corporate and nonprofit blogging needs to be : open , honest , transparent and true .
I am a big advocate of uncensored corporate blogs .
Most consumers do n’t trust the traditional corporate blog .
In fact , according to Forrester Research , only 16 % of consumers trust corporate blogs .
Why ?
Because we ’re smarter than that .
We know the bloggers are hand - picked to show the “ sunny side ” of the company – and not reveal the “ real ” experience of working at a company and producing a service or a product .
Traditional corporate blogs are no better than website content written by a marketing communications team .
In the New York Time article both an MIT admissions officer and a dean of students admit that uncensored blogging is risky ; students have written blog posts censuring housing policy , complaining that classes are boring and talking about the down side of student life .
On the other hand , student blogs are overwhelmingly positive about the MIT experience and each of the blogs has created a community of followers interested in MIT .
The payback for MIT is , I suspect , tremendous : a more informed incoming student body , a more informed admissions process , ability to reach and recruit high quality applicants , higher rate of current student satisfaction , and of course knowledge about MIT from the student ’s perspective .
Open , uncensored blogging encourages customer and client loyalty in ways that corporate blogging will never achieve .
Sun Microsystems encourages all of its employees to blog , uncensored , without asking permission first .
Opera ( the web browser and internet suite company ) also encourages uncensored blogging in its policies .
Their policy of openness starts at the top , too .
I follow the blog of Sun Microsystem ’s CEO Jonathan Schwartz .
I ’ve written before about why his blog is inspiring in its transparency and willingness to discuss corporate direction , pitfalls and challenges .
I have heard the objections to uncensored stakeholder blogging and I think they ’re just that – objections .
At MIT , one student blogger expressed continual dissatisfaction with the resident housing system .
It ’s easy to take down a blog that makes the university look bad .
It ’s harder to admit that there might be a problem .
MIT maintained the student ’s right to blog unfettered and allowed the housing system to offer an open rebuttal to her complaints on her blog .
If MIT had shut down the blog , it would not have closed down her voice .
That ’s a fact about social media : she would have moved her complaints onto Twitter , others ’ blogs , and possibly the sidewiki of MIT ’s Housing web page , until she felt that her complaint was heard and addressed .
So here ’s to open , uncensored blogging .
Take a chance .
Invite all employees , volunteers , and other relevant stakeholders to blog .
The benefits :
Increased trust in your blog and company by the people you care most about – potential clients , stakeholders and customers
More links pointing to your website , which help more people to find you
Better understanding of the needs of your staff , company , clients and stakeholders .
Improved staff performance – employees that blog are happier at work
Engagement that leads to long - term loyalty
One last note - this is n’t just about blogging .
It ’s an important trend in corporate web communications .
Companies like Best Buy and Zappos allow any verified employee to tweet – uncensored – as the employee .
Zappos , in particular , is a customer - service oriented company that views corporate tweeting as an extension of customer service .
Is this the future of corporate blogging ?
Does your company have an open blogging policy ?
What do you think about uncensored employee – or even stakeholder – blogging ?
I would love to also know about nonprofit organizations that encourage open employee , or stakeholder blogging .
Please share your points of view here – I promise not to censor !
Update : another aspect to this blog post is using employees , and their personal brands , to extend your organization ’s reach .
For insight into how one company is doing this , read “ Employee Personal Brands – Who Is Your Human ? ”

Enlarge Sara D. Davis , for USA TODAY Debra Jones , of Holy Springs , N.C. , had become addicted to prescription Percocet , which she was taking for rheumatoid arthritis , and had to seek substance abuse treatment .
She 's been clean two years .
FATAL OVERDOSES FATAL OVERDOSES
Big spikes in overdose rates have coincided with increases in the use of street drugs , such as black tar heroin in the 1970s .
Year and rate per 100,000 :
In the ' 80s , crack cocaine caused many overdoses :
In recent years , deaths from drug overdoses have risen sharply .
Abuse of prescription painkillers grew in the late '90s : More pills , more deaths
The recent increase in fatal overdoses is due largely to rising use of opioid painkillers .
The rising mortality rates from drug overdoses parallels the growth in sales of opioid painkillers ( milligrams / U.S. resident ) : ( Overdose deaths / 100,000 ) : Source : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Debra Jones did n't begin taking painkillers to get high .
Jones , 50 , was trying to relieve chronic pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis .
Yet after taking the painkiller Percocet safely for 10 years , the stay - at - home mother of three became addicted after a friend suggested that crushing her pills could bring faster relief .
It worked .
The rush of medication also gave her more energy .
Over time , she began to rely on that energy boost to get through the day .
She began taking six or seven pills a day instead of the three to four a day as prescribed .
" I was n't trying to abuse it , " says Jones , from Holly Springs , N.C. , who has since recovered from her battle with addiction .
" But after 10 years , I could n't help what it did to my body or my brain .
It was hard to work without it . "
Addiction to prescription painkillers — which kill thousands of Americans a year — has become a largely unrecognized epidemic , experts say .
In fact , prescription drugs cause most of the more than 26,000 fatal overdoses each year , says Leonard Paulozzi of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The number of overdose deaths from opioid painkillers — opium - like drugs that include morphine and codeine — more than tripled from 1999 to 2006 , to 13,800 deaths that year , according to CDC statistics released Wednesday .
In the past , most overdoses were due to illegal narcotics , such as heroin , with most deaths in big cities .
Prescription painkillers have now surpassed heroin and cocaine , however , as the leading cause of fatal overdoses , Paulozzi says .
And the rate of fatal overdoses is now about as high in rural areas — 7.8 deaths per 100,000 people — as in cities , where the rate is 7.9 deaths per 100,000 people , according to a paper he published last year in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety .
" The biggest and fastest - growing part of America 's drug problem is prescription drug abuse , " says Robert DuPont , a former White House drug czar and a former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
" The statistics are unmistakable . "
About 120,000 Americans a year go to the emergency room after overdosing on opioid painkillers , says Laxmaiah Manchikanti , chief executive officer and board chairman for the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians .
More sales , more addicts Experts say it 's easy to see why so many Americans are abusing painkillers .
There are lots of the drugs around , and they 're relatively easy to get , says David Zvara , chair of anesthesiology at University of North Carolina Hospitals .
As Americans age and carry extra pounds , more are asking for pain relief to cope with joint problems , back pain and other ailments , Zvara says .
He says he has seen a huge increase in the number of patients seeking care for chronic pain .
Paulozzi notes that the rise in fatal overdoses almost exactly parallels a corresponding rise in prescription painkiller sales .
In surveys , about 5 % of Americans say they have used a prescription narcotic in the past month .
Doctors today are also more apt to prescribe pain pills in an effort to relieve real suffering , says James Garbutt , a UNC addiction specialist .
Of course , many people take painkillers legally and carefully follow their doctors ' prescriptions .
The medical profession has paid more attention to adequate pain relief for terminal cancer patients , for example , who are n't in danger of addiction , Zvara says .
But some people are genetically susceptible to addiction , especially if they have a family history of it , says Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
People are also at higher risk of addiction if they are depressed or under stress , because many people find that painkillers provide a sense of well - being or euphoria , Volkow says .
Some begin to rely on these psychological benefits long after their physical pain has subsided .
Many abusers go from doctor to doctor for new prescriptions .
Others , when turned down by doctors , buy painkillers on the street or through illegal Internet sites , Manchikanti says .
It 's also easy for addicts to overdose .
Although these drugs are safe when taken as directed , taking high doses can make people stop breathing .
" At the high doses used by drug abusers , the margin of safety is small , " Paulozzi says .
" Combining such drugs on your own or using them with alcohol increase the risk . "
Getting help
Because persistent pain and painkillers can carry so many risks , people with pain that lasts more than three months should consult a pain - management specialist , says Christopher Gharibo , medical director of pain medicine at NYU - Hospital for Joint Diseases in New York .
To treat long - term pain , doctors may try a combination approach , using anti-inflammatory drugs , anti-convulsants and muscle relaxants , Gharibo says .
For lower back pain , for example , doctors may use anesthetic patches and " trigger - point injections " into specific muscles , he says .
To prevent patients from abusing or selling their painkillers , doctors may do unannounced urine tests or count a patient 's remaining pills , Manchikanti says .
He says patients need to accept that they may never be completely free of pain .
Instead , he says his goal is to help patients to " be active and functional without escalating their dosage . "
Krista Smith , 39 , takes the narcotic Vicodin to relieve the lingering pain caused by a car accident 23 years ago , when she was burned on over 80 % of her body .
But Smith uses them sparingly — making a bottle of 50 pills last four months — to avoid becoming addicted .
" I deal with pain every day , " says Smith , a mother of two from Timberville , Va . " I 've been through so much pain that I guess I can tolerate a lot . "
Many doctors say that preventing abuse requires a national effort .
Although 39 states have electronic databases to track narcotics prescriptions , none share that information fully with other states , Manchikanti says .
So patients who get narcotics in one state may be able to cross the state line to get more .
A nationwide system of electronic medical records also would help , Zvara says , because doctors in different hospitals and clinics would easily be able to measure how many narcotics doses a patient has had .
Easy to underestimate Experts say there are many reasons why the public — and even doctors — do n't realize the seriousness of the problem .
Unlike crack , prescription painkillers generally are n't associated with increased street crime or violence , Zvara says .
And Volkow notes that many people underestimate how lethal painkillers can be , assuming that anything prescribed by a doctor must be safe .
Experts say Jones was lucky to get help before it was too late .
Jones says she tried and failed to quit the drug on her own .
Although she never spent more than about $ 50 at a time buying extra pills from " acquaintances of acquaintances , " Jones says she realized she was becoming dependent on them .
She eventually kicked the habit through a UNC program and has been clean for two years .
She now takes a methadone - like drug for pain .
" I can't tell you how good it feels to be off of it , " Jones says .
" I never dreamed it could be so addictive or dangerous .
It 's something you do n't know about until you live it . "

The United States Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) is predicting that the national debt of the US will double in 10 years .
Meanwhile , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) has raised its forecast of the 10 - year cumulative budget deficit to US $ 7.137 trillion , due to increased spending .
Both offices released reports on Tuesday .
" Over all , it underscores the dire fiscal situation that we inherited and the need for serious steps to put our nation back on a sustainable fiscal path , " wrote Peter R. Orszag , President Barack Obama 's budget director .
" I know that there will be some who say this report proves that we cannot afford health reform .
I think that has it backward , " Orszag said in a conference call .
The CBO report predicts that public debt will exceed 61 % of gross domestic product ( GDP ) by the end of 2010 while continuing to rise to 68 % of GDP by the end of 2019 .
" If anyone had any doubts that this burden on future generations is unsustainable , they 're gone , " said Senator Mitch McConnell , the Senate minority leader .
" Today 's budget numbers send a clear signal that the time for putting off tough choices is over and the time to act is now , " said the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , Kent Conrad .
" While the U.S. health care system does need to be reformed , we cannot ignore the fiscal realities of our situation , " said Senator Judd Gregg who is also on the Senate Budget Committee .
" We must proceed with extreme caution before putting in place a huge and costly new program that will threaten our economy and the future of our children . "
" The administration has always said that you have to get deficits under 3 percent of GDP to be safe .
They now admit that they will not in the next 10 years , " commented Douglas Holtz - Eakin , a former director of the CBO .
" I 'm stunned at how hard they have worked to bury this . "

The US capital has the highest level of banknotes that have traces of cocaine
The largest study of banknotes has found that 95 % of dollar bills in Washington DC bear traces of the illegal drug cocaine .
The figure for the US capital is up 20 % over two years .
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth tested notes from more than 30 cities worldwide .
They say the rise observed in the US may be due to increased drug use caused by higher stress levels linked to the global economic downturn .
Bank notes can pick up traces of cocaine directly from users snorting it through rolled up bills or when cash is stacked together .
Stress factor ?
Besides Washington , other big US cities such as Baltimore , Boston and Detroit had the highest average cocaine levels on their dollar bills .
Dr Yuegang Zuo , who led the research , said : " To my surprise , we 're finding more and more cocaine in banknotes .
" I 'm not sure why we 've seen this apparent increase , but it could be related to the economic downturn , with stressed people turning to cocaine . "
Other countries where notes were tested were Canada , Brazil , China and Japan .
China had the lowest rates , with only 12 % of its bills contaminated .
In the US the cleanest bills were collected from Salt Lake City , home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints , better known as the Mormons .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 10000 for the first time in a year Wednesday after a sharp rally sparked by earnings news and investors ' appetite for risk .
Although indexes usually " test " such barriers , with sellers rushing in to book quick profits the first few times an index closes above such a level and sending it back down , this time the Dow barreled through the same day it first crossed 10000 intraday .
The Dow finished up 144.90 points , or 1.5 % , to end near its intraday high at 10015.86 , its highest level since Oct. 3 , 2008 , when markets were plunging amid the outbreak of financial crisis on Wall Street .
The Dow 's gain on Wednesday was its biggest one - day rise since Aug. 21 in both point and percentage terms .
The move above 10000 was fueled by better than expected results from Dow components Intel and J.P. Morgan Chase and a smaller decline than anticipated in U.S. retail sales , which boosted hopes that stocks ' momentum may carry through year end .
Earlier this week I ran into a missing feature in the Scala xml library and I ended up adding this feature myself , which turned out to be pretty simple .
I was trying to extract the text contents of an element in a piece of XML using the handy \ and \\ methods on scala.xml .
NodeSeq .
These methods allow you to extract sub-elements from an XML node in a way very similar to XPath , something like this :
[ scala ]
val xml = <a>< b>< c>text</c></b></a>
val c1 = xml \ " b " \ " c "
val c2 = xml \\ " c "
val text = c2.text
[ / scala ]
The problem I ran into occurred when I tried to use these methods to extract an element when one of its attributes had a certain value .
Based on my experience with “ real ” XPath , I tried to do the following :
[ scala ]
val xml = < a >< b id = " b1 " />< b id = " b2 " /></a>
val b2 = xml \ " b[ @id == b2 ] "
[ / scala ]
But that did not work , resulting in an empty NodeSeq .
I tried a couple of syntax variants but nothing seemed to work .
When I went to have a look at the Scala source code , it was pretty easy to see that support for this type of thing simly did not exist .
There is a package called scala.xml.path but it only contains one source file and as far as I could tell , this package and its contents are neither useful nor used from anywhere else in the Scala source code .
Having seen the source code for the \ and \\ methods , I thought it should be pretty simple to add support for extract nodes based on attribute values , and indeed it was .
The Scala 2.7.5 source code for those methods was kind of clunky and very imperative ( lots of while loops and nested ifs ) but the 2.8 code looked a lot more like it should so I chose to base my implementation on the approach taken there .
So without further ado , here is the code for my RichNodeSeq implementation .
The full code and the accompanying unit tests can be found on GitHub .
[ scala ]
import scala.xml ._
object RichNodeSeq {
val MatchNodeByAttributeValueRegExp = " " " ^ (.*) \[@ (.*) ==(.* ) \ ] $ " " " . r
def apply ( nodeSeq : NodeSeq ) : RichNodeSeq = {
new RichNodeSeq(nodeSeq )
}
}
class RichNodeSeq(nodeSeq : NodeSeq ) extends NodeSeq {
def the Seq = nodeSeq.
theSeq
import RichNodeSeq ._
override def \( that : String ) : RichNodeSeq = {
def filterChildNodes ( cond : ( Node ) => Boolean ) =
RichNodeSeq ( NodeSeq fromSeq ( this flatMap ( _.child ) filter cond ) )
that match {
case MatchNodeByAttributeValueRegExp( element , attribute , value )
=> filterChildNodes (
isElementWithAttributeValue(_ , element.trim , attribute.trim , value.trim ) )
case _ => RichNodeSeq ( super .\( that ) )
}
}
override def \\( that : String ) : RichNodeSeq = {
def filterChildNodes ( cond : ( Node ) => Boolean ) =
RichNodeSeq ( NodeSeq fromSeq ( this flatMap ( _.descendant_or_self ) filter cond ) )
that match {
case MatchNodeByAttributeValueRegExp( element , attribute , value )
=> filterChildNodes (
isElementWithAttributeValue(_ , element.trim , attribute.trim , value.trim ) )
case _ => RichNodeSeq ( super .\\( that ) )
}
}
private def isElementWithAttributeValue (
node : Node ,
elementName : String ,
attributeName : String ,
attributeValue : String ) : Boolean = {
( node.label == elementName )
. &&(
node.attribute(attributeName ) match {
case Some( attributes ) => attributes ( 0 ) == attributeValue
case None => false
}
)
}
}
[ / scala ]
You might notice some funky use of braces here and there , esspecially in the last bit .
This should not really be necessary but without the braces and the periods the Scala eclipse plugin could not parse the code correctly .
You can use this functionality by wrapping any existing instance of NodeSeq in an instance of RichNodeSeq .
I played around with an implicit conversion so all you would need was an import statement but ( AFAIK ) I would have had to rename the methods to make that work .
Here is an example :
[ scala ]
val xml = < a >< b id = " b1 " />< b id = " b2 " /></a>
val b2 = RichNodeSeq ( xml ) \ " b[ @id == b2 ] "
[ / scala ]
So how does it all work ?
The basic approach is to extend NodeSeq and to override the two XPath - like methods .
I use a regular expression extractor to test whether the argument to the methods contains an attribute value expression .
If not , I simply hand over to the super class .
If the argument does contain an attribute value expression , I use the extracted element name , attribute name , and attribute value to match against the children and / or the descendents of the current NodeSeq .
The isElementWithAttributeValue method then simply determines whether the element name matches , whether the element has any attributes , and if so whether the attribute matches the attribute value .
The nested pattern match in the boolean expression makes it look a bit harder then it should be so I think I will extract that into another method later .
As stated above , the sources and the unit tests are available on GitHub so go ahead and use this code if you think it is useful .
And , of course , if you think I did it completely wrong ( or totally right ) , do n’t hesitate to leave a comment .
Garry Hoy , a 38 - year old lawyer and a senior partner at the Holden Day Wilson Law firm in Toronto , Canada , fell to his death on July 9 , 1993 , after he threw himself against a window on the 24th floor of the Toronto - Dominion Centre , in an attempt to prove that the glass was " unbreakable " to a group of visiting law students .
He had apparently attempted this stunt many times in the past , having previously bounced harmlessly off the glass .
His first attempt failed to damage the glass at all .
On his second attempt the glass still did n't break but instead actually popped out of the window frame , and he fell over 300 feet to his death .
The 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact is controversial even today , with historians divided over its importance .
In the first of a series of articles marking the outbreak of World War II 70 years ago , the BBC Russian Service 's Artyom Krechetnikov and Steven Eke analyse the significance of a treaty that helped set the scene for war .
The pact led to the carving - up of parts of eastern Europe Signed on 23 August 1939 , the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact was accompanied by a secret protocol that detailed the reshaping of Europe 's map .
Substantive talks on forming a political alliance between Nazi Germany and the USSR had begun that month .
They built on earlier discussions aimed at boosting economic co-operation , and were accompanied by military and even cultural co-operation in the form of exchanges of high - profile delegations .
The pact was signed by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and his Russian counterpart , Vyacheslav Molotov , in Moscow .
It led to the carving - up of Poland between Nazi Germany and the USSR , as well as the annexation by the USSR of eastern Finland , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and northern Romania .
The western parts of Ukraine and Belarus , formerly Polish territory , were also incorporated into the Soviet Union .
At that point , believe some historians , a war in Europe became unavoidable .
Why Russia signed the pact Soviet historical approaches currently in favour with Russia 's modern - day leadership suggest the treaty : Allowed the USSR to delay the onset of war with Nazi Germany
Allowed the Soviet border to be moved 200 km or more to the west , greatly boosting the subsequent defence efforts against Nazi aggression
Allowed Russia to take under its defence the " blood - brother peoples " - the Ukrainians and Belarussians
Prevented an " anti-Soviet alliance " between the West and Nazi Germany
The records of the politburo meeting held on 19 August 1939 show that Stalin believed that war with Germany could be avoided , should the USSR form an anti-Nazi alliance with Britain and France .
But , he warned , " the subsequent development of events after that would be unfavourable to the Soviet Union " .
He told his colleagues that Germany was prepared to offer the USSR " complete freedom of action in the three Baltic countries " , and hinted that Romania , Bulgaria and Hungary would be ceded to the USSR as a " zone of influence " .
At the same time , talks between the USSR , Britain and France over a co-ordinated response in the event of an attack by Nazi Germany , floundered .
Britain and France would not acquiesce to a key Soviet demand , namely that Soviet troops be allowed free passage across Poland .
Falsified history ?
One of the most enduringly controversial aspects of the pact was the Soviet policy to deny the existence of the secret protocol .
The secret protocol was signed by von Ribbentrop and Molotov
The policy built on Stalin 's written rejection of claims relating to Soviet - Nazi co-operation , published in 1948 and known as The Falsifiers of History .
It was only in the late 1980s , the era of Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika reforms , that the Soviet government admitted the truth .
The West never accepted - and viewed as illegal - the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union .
Certainly , many people from the Baltic states made their own feelings clear when , on 23 August 1989 , more than two million of them linked hands along the entire length of their countries ' eastern borders to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the pact .
The leading British historian , Orlando Figes , described the pact as " a constant thorn in Russia 's relations with neighbouring European states " .
The pact is the most cynical operation of the World War II
Leopold Unger
Polish - Belgian author
Viewpoint : The Nazi-Soviet Pact
He suggested it continued to underpin the perspective in those states of post - war Soviet oppression .
The respected Polish - Belgian author Leopold Unger referred to the pact as the " most cynical operation of the World War II , and the founding document of the post - war Soviet empire in Europe " .
Russian state archives do not allow historians unfettered access to the documents detailing Nazi-Soviet co-operation .
In early August , Russia 's normally secretive SVR ( foreign intelligence service ) issued a rare statement asserting that the USSR had " had no other option than to sign " the pact .
The ultimate blame , it claimed , lay with Britain and France , for scuppering the tripartite negotiations in the summer of 1939 .
This statement came just weeks after the Russian defence ministry published an essay by a high - ranking official , in which it was suggested that Poland was ultimately responsible for World War II , by refusing to acquiesce to " legitimate " Nazi territorial demands .
Revisionist analysis ?
Does the appearance of such views suggest that a revisionist analysis of the pact is becoming widespread in the Russian establishment ?
Russia now says Stalin had " no option " but to sign the pact
And is this linked to current , apparently official , efforts to rehabilitate Stalin as a " great statesman " - even if his victims are also recognised ?
Alexander Dyukov , a young Russian historian who claims Soviet repression has been systematically exaggerated , wrote : " Attempts to compare or equate Hitler 's regime with the USSR destroy the single historical focal point - our victory in the war - that holds together our society . "
Mark Solonin , a liberal historian , takes a very different view .
" In one short act , Stalin threw Europe into mayhem , and abandoned the Franco - British bloc , whose leaders had already promised Poland security guarantees , to the maniac in Berlin , " he wrote .
" After the signing of the pact , he fell into a state that can only be described as foolhardy bravery .
" A European war became unavoidable .
It began precisely one week after the signing of the pact . "
Russia increasingly maintains that the pact was a strategic document , driven primarily by considerations of self - defence .
It strongly rejects the idea that Soviet collusion with the Third Reich was a factor in the destruction of Europe that soon ensued .

The next generation of technology to turn saltwater into a fresh resource is on tap for the Navy .
The Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) is sponsoring the development of an innovative solution for generating potable water at twice the efficiency of current production for forces afloat , Marine Corps expeditionary forces and humanitarian missions ashore .
" Saving energy and producing clean water is a tactical issue for the Navy , " said Dr. J. Paul Armistead , an ONR program officer with interests in water purification .
" We plan to build prototype desalination units that will use 65 percent less energy and be 40 percent smaller by weight and by volume relative to current Navy reverse osmosis systems .
They should require roughly 75 percent less maintenance . "
Delivering drinkable water for ships at sea and Marines ashore for less cost and less energy became an ONR priority in 2004 under the Expeditionary Unit Water Purification Program , or EUWP .
Before the advent of modern desalinization plants , mariners relied on the fresh water they collected from rain and stowed while at sea .
Today , Sailors and Marines benefit from high - tech , Reverse Osmosis ( RO ) desalinization plants aboard most U.S. Navy ships .
It takes energy to make water , and that energy comes from burning fuel to spin turbine generators that produce electricity necessary for ship systems , including RO plants .
A more efficient desalinization plant translates into a more efficient ship , which uses less fuel , extends combat capability and reduces its carbon footprint .
Since its inception , the EUWP program has produced advances in desalinization capability .
The first generation EUWP technology demonstrator was designed as a deployable high water production unit more easily transported by the military and used for a variety of missions .
In fact , the EUWP Gen 1 demonstrator has been used in a number of humanitarian missions .
In 2005 , it was deployed in support of the Navy´s response to Hurricane Katrina where it delivered safe drinking water to Gulf Coast residents being treated at a hospital in Biloxi , Miss .
In this case , the EUWP Gen 1 was trucked in and set up on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , approximately four blocks from the hospital .
The Gen 1 unit desalted and purified about 100,000 gallons of water per day from the turbid Gulf of Mexico , replacing the daily caravan of 18 tankers needed to keep the hospital running .
The second generation EUWP Gen II technology demonstrator , built with shipboard constraints imposed on the design , is a larger , more stationary demonstration unit , and has potential for use by isolated communities .
It has been tested successfully at the Seawater Desalination Test Facility at the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center in Port Hueneme , Calif .
Armistead anticipates increased capabilities from the newer demonstration unit .
" From current Navy desalination systems we only get 20 percent product water , " he said .
" That means for 1,000 gallons of feed water , we would get only 200 gallons product water .
These new systems will likely double that . "
Michelle Chapman , a physical scientist with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation , is a member of the ONR team managing the research program .
She highlighted the program´s success by noting its benefits to the public at large .
" Several of the projects we have funded have turned into patents for commercially available products and processes that are available for use in water desalination systems for communities where freshwater sources are not available , " Chapman said .
Based on the successes in the EUWP program , the Advanced Shipboard Desalination , Future Naval Capability Program will begin in 2010 .
Navy Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division , Ship Systems Engineering Station ( NSWCCD - SSES ) , is a partner in this effort .
According to Dave Nordham , a NSWCCD - SSES mechanical engineer , " Any sort of technology advancements we find for ships are directly applicable ashore and can be utilized by ever - increasing drought ridden areas . "
Key partners in the EUWP program include NSWCCD - Philadelphia , U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Command , U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center´s Seawater Desalination Test Facility at Port Hueneme , Calif .
A global push toward production of biofuels , advocated by many as a measure to curb greenhouse gas emissions , could have exactly the opposite effect unless adequate controls are put in place , a new study has found .
Because forests , which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , could end up being cut down to create new cropland as a result of intensive agriculture for fuels , a gallon of biofuel could ironically end up being responsible for twice as much greenhouse gas emission as a gallon of gasoline .
This indirect impact from biofuels production is " an inescapable effect " unless regulations control it , but it cannot directly be measured , says John Reilly , associate director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change .
Reilly , along with five other MIT researchers , is a co-author of the new study , being published Oct. 23 in Science .
The lead author is Jerry Melillo of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole , Mass .
The study found that a massive campaign to substitute biofuels for petroleum could result in a net doubling of the amount of land devoted to agriculture worldwide - and that , perhaps surprisingly , there is enough land available to sustain that .
But this change in land use , unless coupled to regulations that either specifically protect forestland , or that tax the destruction of forest sufficiently to render that uneconomic , would lead to a net increase in carbon emissions .
In addition , the increase in intensive agriculture would require an enormous addition of nitrogen fertilizers to the soil , producing emissions of nitrous oxide , a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
Together , these two effects could double the overall emissions attributable to land use .
However , with proper controls in place , the use of biofuels instead of petroleum could reduce carbon emission by almost four - fifths , Reilly says .
The effects are often indirect and hard to measure , because typically the growing of crops for biofuels - whether traditional food crops such as corn and soy , or new cellulosic crops intended specifically for fuel production - may not be on forestland freshly cleared for that purpose , but on existing agricultural land .
But , because of resulting pressures on food supplies and prices , the result may be that forests , perhaps in an entirely different region , are cleared to grow food crops displaced by the fuel production .
Although such indirect effects can't be directly measured , " you need statistical techniques to estimate the land - use change and other factors , " Reilly says .
And that is what the new study attempted to do .
Currently , in many parts of the world there is little protection of large natural forests , and that which exists is often ineffective .
Absent effective protection , if an international push toward biofuels production were put in place now , " you would probably get this increase in deforestation , " Reilly says , and the net result could end up being an increase in net greenhouse gas emissions .
That increase , for each gallon of biofuel produced , could be " two to three times worse than a gallon of gasoline , " he says .
" It 's a hugely negative effect . "
Still , the study 's findings do n't necessarily mean that increased biofuel production would be a bad idea , only that it needs to be done in the right way .
" In order to make this efficient , we need to control deforestation , " Reilly says .
But with sufficient regulations to control the changes in land use and to limit the use of nitrogen fertilizers , he says , " it would not have these negative effects , and might have positive effects . "
Matt Hartwig , communications director for the Renewable Fuels Association , a Washington trade group representing the vast majority of U.S. ethanol producers , counters that regulations are already in place to require greenhouse gas emissions reductions for biofuels .
In a statement in response to the Science paper , the association says it " strongly agrees with the authors that natural ecosystems with high carbon storage - such as rainforest , peat soils , and other native lands - absolutely should not be converted to produce biofuel feedstocks .
Those who directly convert these land types for biofuel crop production or any other purpose should be severely penalized and every effort should be taken locally to prevent this type of direct action . "
As the world prepares to negotiate new agreements to control global warming in Copenhagen later this year , Reilly says , it 's important that there be " an awareness that this is an issue to look at .
It 's not clear that there 's a full awareness of how crucial this is . "
It will be essential to figure out how to treat biofuels correctly in any proposed cap - and - trade system , he says .
U.S. airlines and their unions have joined forces to push the Federal Aviation Administration to let pilots do what was once unthinkable : sleep on the job .
Though the practice of nodding off midflight in the cockpit is now strictly forbidden by the FAA , U.S. airlines and pilot unions say there is reputable research supporting the notion that so - called controlled napping can enhance safety by making crews more alert during critical , often hectic descents and landings .

Update 19/10/09 – London art gallery dumps toxic sponsorship deal with Trafigura !
From The Guardian
The Guardian has been prevented from reporting parliamentary proceedings on legal grounds which appear to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1688 Bill of Rights .
Today ’s published Commons order papers contain a question to be answered by a minister later this week .
The Guardian is prevented from identifying the MP who has asked the question , what the question is , which minister might answer it , or where the question is to be found .
The Guardian is also forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented – for the first time in memory – from reporting parliament .
Legal obstacles , which cannot be identified , involve proceedings , which cannot be mentioned , on behalf of a client who must remain secret .
The only fact the Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter - Ruck , who specialise in suing the media for clients , who include individuals or global corporations .
From Parliament.uk , “ Questions for Oral or Written Answer beginning on Tuesday 13 October 2009 ”

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice , what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of legislation to protect ( a ) whistleblowers and ( b ) press freedom following the injunctions obtained in the High Court by ( i ) Barclays and Freshfields solicitors on 19 March 2009 on the publication of internal Barclays reports documenting alleged tax avoidance schemes and ( ii ) Trafigura and Carter - Ruck solicitors on 11 September 2009 on the publication of the Minton report on the alleged dumping of toxic waste in the Ivory Coast , commissioned by Trafigura .

UPDATE – pleased to see that the mighty Guido Fawkes had the same idea .
Injunction scuppered …
UPDATE 2 – “ Jack of Kent ” gives a legal view
UPDATE 3 – Big thumbs up to The Spectator for , I think , being the first mainstream UK media to break ranks and fully report what ’s been going on .
If only they were this good the whole time – for any Spectator staff who are reading , can I request more of the defending - democracy stuff and less of the pseudo - debating AIDS - denialism ?
I hope Lord Fowler knows what you ’re letting him in for !

SYRACUSE , N.Y .
— The financial crisis and subsequent global recession have led to much soul - searching among economists , the vast majority of whom never saw it coming .
But were their assumptions and models wrong only because of minor errors or because today 's dominant economic thinking violates the laws of physics ?
A small but growing group of academics believe the latter is true , and they are out to prove it .
These thinkers say that the neoclassical mantra of constant economic growth is ignoring the world 's diminishing supply of energy at humanity 's peril , failing to take account of the principle of net energy return on investment .
They hope that a set of theories they call " biophysical economics " will improve upon neoclassical theory , or even replace it altogether .
But even this nascent field finds itself divided , as evidenced by the vigorous and candid back - and - forth debate last week over where to go next .
One camp says its models prove the world is headed toward a dramatic economic collapse as energy scarcity takes hold , while another camp believes there is still time to turn the ship around .
Still , all biophysical economists see only very bleak prospects for the future of modern civilization , putting a whole new spin on the phrase " the dismal science . "
Last week , about 50 scholars in economics , ecology , engineering and other fields met at the State University of New York 's College of Environmental Science and Forestry for their second annual conference on biophysical economics .
The new field shares features with ecological economics , a much more established discipline with conferences boasting hundreds of attendees , but the relatively smaller number of practitioners of biophysical economics believe theirs is a much more fundamental and truer form of economic reasoning .
" Real economics is the study of how people transform nature to meet their needs , " said Charles Hall , professor of systems ecology at SUNY - ESF and organizer of both gatherings in Syracuse .
" Neoclassical economics is inconsistent with the laws of thermodynamics . "
Like Hall , many biophysical economic thinkers are trained in ecology and evolutionary biology , fields that do well at breaking down the natural world into a few fundamental laws and rules , just like physicists do .
Though not all proponents of the new energy - centric academic study have been formally trained in economics , scholars coming in from other fields , especially ecology , say their skills allow them to see the global economy in a way that mainstream economists ignore .
Central to their argument is an understanding that the survival of all living creatures is limited by the concept of energy return on investment ( EROI ) : that any living thing or living societies can survive only so long as they are capable of getting more net energy from any activity than they expend during the performance of that activity .
For instance , if a squirrel burns energy eating nuts , those nuts had better give the squirrel more energy back then it expended , or the squirrel will inevitably die .
It is a rule that lies at the core of studying animal and plant behavior , and human society should be looked at no differently , as even technologically complex societies are still governed by EROI .
" The basic issue is very fundamental :
Why should economics be a social science , because it 's about stuff ? "
Hall said .
' Peak oil ' embraced
The modern biophysical economics movement may be relatively young , but the ideas at its roots are not .
In 1926 , Frederick Soddy , a chemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize just a few weeks before , published " Wealth , Virtual Wealth and Debt , " one of the first books to argue that energy should lie at the heart of economics and not supply - demand curves .
Soddy also criticized traditional monetary policy theories for seemingly ignoring the fact that " real wealth " is derived from using energy to transform physical objects , and that these physical objects are inescapably subject to the laws of entropy , or inevitable decline and disintegration .
The sharpest difference between biophysical economics and the more widely held " Chicago School " approach is that biophysical economists readily accept the peak oil hypothesis : that society is fast approaching the point where global oil production will peak and then steadily decline .
The United States is held as the prime example .
Though the United States is still the world 's third - largest producer of oil , its oil production stopped growing more than a decade ago and has flatlined or steadily fallen ever since .
Other once - robust oil - producing countries have experienced similar production curves .
But the more important indicator , biophysical economists say , is the fact that the U.S. oil industry 's energy return on investment has been steadily sliding since the beginning of the century .
Through analyzing historical production data , experts say the petroleum sector 's EROI in this country was about 100 - to - 1 in 1930 , meaning one had to burn approximately 1 barrel of oil 's worth of energy to get 100 barrels out of the ground .
By the 1990s , it is thought , that number slid to less than 36 - to - 1 , and further down to 19 - to - 1 by 2006 .
" If you go from using a 20 - to - 1 energy return fuel down to a 3 - to - 1 fuel , economic collapse is guaranteed , " as nothing is left for other economic activity , said Nate Hagens , editor of the popular peak oil blog " The Oil Drum . "
" The main problem with neoclassical economics is that it treats energy as the same as any other commodity input into the production function , " Hagens said .
" They parse it into dollar terms and treat it the same as they would mittens or earmuffs or eggs ... but without energy , you can't have any of that other stuff . "
Nor is conservation or energy efficiency the answer .
In his presentation , Henshaw noted that the International Energy Agency 's own data show that energy use is doubling every 37 years or so , while energy productivity takes about 56 years to double .
In fact , the small world of biophysical economists seems to agree that energy and resource conservation is pointless in the economic system as it is now construed , contrary to what one might expect .
Such efforts are noteworthy as it buys the world a bit more time , but the destination is inevitably the same — a gallon of gasoline not burned by an American will be burned by someone else anyway .
Other peaks ?
Though not as closely studied , biophysical economists theorize that the peak oil phenomenon holds true for all non-renewable resources , especially energy commodities .
Proponents of the field say they are moving closer to understanding " peak gas " and " peak coal . "
Consumption of many of the world 's most valuable minerals could likewise see those resources nearing exhaustion , as well , they say .
And no amount of technology can fix the problem .
Hagens points out that oil extraction has evolved by leaps and bounds since the early 1900s , and yet companies must expend much more energy to get less and less oil than they did back then .
" It is n't that there 's no technology , " Hall said .
" The question is , technology is in a race with depletion , and that 's a whole different concept .
And we think that we can show empirically that depletion is winning , because the energy return on investment keeps dropping for gas and oil . "
The most pessimistic of the biophysical economics camp sees the oil - fueled world economy grinding to a halt soon , possibly within 10 years .
They are all working to get the message out , but not all of them believe their peers in other professions will listen .
" Of course I 'm trying to send a message , " said Joseph Tainter , chairman of Utah State University 's Department of Environment and Society .
" I just do n't expect there 's anyone out there to receive it . "

The last time we heard a squeak from him was on June 3 this year .
The world ’s most notorious terrorist outsmarted America by releasing a menacing message as Air Force One touched down on Saudi Arabian soil at the start of Barack Obama ’s first and much vaunted Middle East tour .
What if everything we have seen or heard of him on video and audio tapes since the early days after 9/11 is a fake – and that he is being kept ‘ alive ’ by the Western allies to stir up support for the war on terror ?
Incredibly , this is the breathtaking theory that is gaining credence among political commentators , respected academics and even terror experts .
Of course , there have been any number of conspiracy theories concerning 9/11 , and it could be this is just another one .
But the weight of opinion now swinging behind the possibility that Bin Laden is dead – and the accumulating evidence that supports it – makes the notion , at the very least , worthy of examination .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The theory first received an airing in the American Spectator magazine earlier this year when former U.S. foreign intelligence officer and senior editor Angelo M. Codevilla , a professor of international relations at Boston University , stated bluntly : ‘ All the evidence suggests Elvis Presley is more alive today than Osama Bin Laden . ’
Prof Codevilla pointed to inconsistencies in the videos and claimed there have been no reputable sightings of Bin Laden for years ( for instance , all interceptions by the West of communications made by the Al Qaeda leader suddenly ceased in late 2001 ) .
Prof Codevilla asserted : ‘ The video and audio tapes alleged to be Osama ’s never convince the impartial observer , ’ he asserted .
‘ The guy just does not look like Osama .
Some videos show him with a Semitic , aquiline nose , while others show him with a shorter , broader one .
Next to that , differences between the colours and styles of his beard are small stuff . ’
There are other doubters , too .
Professor Bruce Lawrence , head of Duke University ’s religious studies ’ department and the foremost Bin Laden expert , argues that the increasingly secular language in the video and audio tapes of Osama ( his earliest ones are littered with references to God and the Prophet Mohammed ) are inconsistent with his strict Islamic religion , Wahhabism .
He notes that , on one video , Bin Laden wears golden rings on his fingers , an adornment banned among Wahhabi followers .

John Boehner on Healthcare Reform : The Public Option will be the Only Option in Five Years
The president likes to claim that the “ public option ” health insurance program is just on option .
He claims that if you like the health insurance that you have you will be able to keep it , but that may not be true according to House minority leader John Boehner .
We already know that the government run healthcare option will put the private insurance companies out of business eventually leaving only the government option , the debate is over on that issue , it is settled science to borrow a term from Al Gore , but let us just pretend for a minute that private plans will not be run out of business by the government run option .
After five years all private insurance companies ( which we are still pretending will be in business ) will be purposely eliminated by the government themselves .
Here is what John Boehner had to say on this issue :
in their bill it says that after five years , you ca n’t go out and buy a health insurance policy on your own
After five years you will not be able to purchase your own healthcare .
So that means that in five years those people who are just coming of age and entering the workforce , who will be purchasing healthcare for the first time will not be able to purchase their own policy .
Where will they get their healthcare ?
From the government , of course .
You have to go to one of their government exchanges to buy a plan that was designed by the government , ” he added .
“ So it ’s pretty clear that we ’re going to have a big government - run system that will eventually drive out the private sector plans we have today
And after the five year mark a big , bloated federal bureaucracy is going to decide whether people who are still on private insurance plans have what they deem to be adequate plans .
The government deciding which plan is best for you , not giving you the choice to decide what is best for you .
After five years every employer - sponsored health care benefits have to be approved by the Department of Labor and the new Health Choices Czar to make sure that it meets federal standards
What does all of this mean ?
So it ’s pretty clear the government is going to design the health insurance policies that are going to be out there , ” Boehner reiterated
Do not be fooled by Barack Obama ’s false claims that you will be able to keep your healthcare plan .
Do not be fooled by the notion that the “ public option ” government run plan will not choke out the private sector insurance plans .
But do not take my word for it , take the word of someone that has a little inside information , Barney Frank .
Just watch the video below and you will see him admit that the public option will lead to SINGLE PAYER health insurance , in other words government run healthcare .
He admits that the public option is the best way to get to single payer healthcare in the end .
They are playing us for fools .

Lily Allen stirred up a hornets nest , recently , with her campaign against file sharing / music piracy .
Allen argues that file - sharing is fine for older , established bands , but that " For new talent , file sharing is a disaster , as it's making it harder and harder for new acts to emerge . "
Allen 's stance that you should pay for the music you listen to and support new artists plays well with a lot of musicians , but has opened her up to scorn from others .
The pro file - sharing vs anti-piracy debate seems to bring out the worst in many - so it 's refreshing to hear Dan Bull 's witty musical response to Allen , above .

But is the euro the right " fixed point " when the currencies of Sweden , Russia , Poland , Ukraine have plunged around you ?
The official view is that exports are not sensitive to the exchange rate .
This overlooks the suffocating effect of deflation in a post - bubble economy saddled by debts and wage levels that raced ahead of productivity .
The country faces an " internal devaluation " within the EMU bloc to right the ship again .
Such cures are painfully slow , and very damaging to democratic solidarity .
BMW M3 E92 orange mat can only mean one thing : Halloween is coming !
Okay , okay , it ’s just a film that can get out after you ’ve finished wandering throughout the city …
That if we want .
For the M3 looks like crazy … I mean , if an IS -F I “ shade ” good in orange , an M3 why would not sit well in the orange mat ?
There are more aesthetic changes , like extending the front spoiler , side sills , rear speaker , CSL - style trunk and the 20 - inch HRE wheels … .
So … “ trick or treat ? ” 🙂

1. I 'm Sadek Drobi .
I 'm here at Erlang Factory with Simon Peyton Jones and Joe Armstrong .
Can you please tell us about yourselves and what you 've been busy with lately ?
JA : I 'm Joe Armstrong and I 'm at Erlang Factory .
I 've just been to a very nice talk where Simon has told us about the birth of Haskell and Erlang and how they point along parallel routes solving the same problems .
I think we can talk a bit about that , because in your lecture you said things about " We tried that and it was an absolute disaster " .
We also tried - you know this making everything parallel - we did that as well .
SPJ : Was it a disaster ?
JA : Yes .
You know this bit about you deleted all the people 's code ?
We 've done that as well .
SPJ : I 'm Simon Peyton Jones , I work at the Microsoft Research in Cambridge at the moment .
Previously I was a professor at Glasgow University .
I 've been doing functional programming now for 30 - odd years , because I got addicted to it when I was at university and never been able to give it up .
It 's like a drug , but a good drug .
Haskell is a programming language evolved because a bunch of different academics were working on lazy functional programming languages around the world , but they were all different languages and we realized that if we'd just agree to a common language , then we would be able to share a lot more work together , so we got together and formed a committee , which was n't necessarily a very promising way to go about designing an elegant and beautiful language .
But actually the committee worked very well , because we had enough common goals .
That was in the very early '90s .
Haskell has come a long way since then .
Many languages die fairly quickly after they 've been designed , but Haskell has lasted 20 years , as has Erlang .
JA : Erlang had a different start than Haskell .
It started in an industrial environment .
It started in the computer science lab at Ericsson and the original goal was to find a better way of programming .
It was n't actually to make a programming language at all , it was somewhat after the event that we discovered we created a programming language - that was kind of accidental .
SPJ : But you also had a very specific application at least , did n't you ?
You really were telecoms .
JA : We wanted to just program a small telephone exchange in the best way possible and we wanted to just steal our ideas from different programming languages and put them together and just try them out and see if they work .
SPJ : You knew the application you needed and you knew that concurrency was key - concurrency and robustness was key .
JA : I remember back in the ' 80s going to conferences and talking about shared memory systems , and I always poked up my hand and asked the same question over again - " Well what happens if one of these shared memory things fails ? " and they would say " Well it all fails " .
That 's what we did n't want , you know .
We make products with ... a standard Ericsson product should have a downtime of four minutes per year or something like that ; or better than that .
Our key problem is handling failure .
Right from the early days , we thought " Well the only way to handle failure is no shared memory and no transaction memory or anything that locks things " and that 's why we copy everything .
That 's why we have a sophisticated error handling .
So , here we are back in the ' 80s , about 1984 - 1985 , just thinking how we can put these things together and it was only later that we realized " Oh , we 've made a programming language and better give it a name " and people started using it and such .
SPJ : It never struck me quite as positively as this before , but Erlang was born very much out of a demand pool .
You had a telephone exchange , you wanted to program it and the language happened to come out of that .
Haskell was the exact reverse .
We were on a mission from God to explain why laziness was fantastic for the world , so it was very much technology push .
We wanted to explain functional programming , lazy functional programming in particular , through the medium of a language .
You were at this end and we were at this end .
JA : But in the same point in time we were doing the same things .
I remember one of the things we did in Erlang , we ...
First of all we implemented it in Prolog and I did that .
Later , Robert Virding came along and Robert was very into parallel concurrent languages .
We made one of our first big mistakes , which was announcing what the performance of something will be before you 've done it .
You 've made that one !
SPJ : No , no , no !
We 'd never do that !
JA : We cross-compiled Erlang to Strand , which was a parallel language and we implemented a language like that and we happily told everybody " It will be 6 times faster " before we 'd actually done this .
SPJ : Was it ?
JA : No .
It did n't work .
SPJ : Did n't work at all !
Naught times faster !
JA : The first thing we did , we wrote an Erlang program , we cross -compiled it to all this parallel stuff and we had 3 Erlang processes and it was as parallel as possible and suddenly there were 6 million processes in the machine , 6 million threads - we got far too much parallelism .
At that was the same time you said , in your talk , " Well , we tried to make everything parallel and it was just far too much parallelism . "
We did the same stuff at the same time .
SPJ : A nice remark I remember you making about Robert was that he came to you one day and asked to make a few small changes in the compiler .
Then , the next line in your paper was " Robert is incapable of making a small change to anything , so he completely rewrote the whole thing . "
JA : He left a little comment at the top , " Joe first wrote this " , and then everything is completely different .
We used to rewrite each others ' code .
2. Haskell and Erlang have 2 distinct models of concurrency , right ?
Haskell is going to side - effect free , Erlang is about messaging .
Can you talk a bit about this in contrast to both models of concurrency ?
SPJ : I suppose Haskell initially was n't a concurrent language at all .
It was a purely functional language and we had the idea from the beginning that a purely functional language was a good substrate for doing concurrency on .
But it turned out to be a lot harder to turn that into reality than I think we really expected because we thought " If you got e1+e2 then you can evaluate e1 at the same time as e2 and everything will be wonderful because they can't affect each other because it's pure . "
But it turned out to be very hard to turn that into actual wall clock speedups on processes , leaving aside all issues of robustness or that kind of stuff , because if you do that style of concurrency you get lots of very tiny fine - grained processes and you get no locality and you get very difficult scheduling problems .
The overheads overwhelm the benefits , in short .
From there , we 've evolved generally towards giving the programmer some control over that kind of concurrency .
That was the first form of concurrency that Haskell grew .
It was a controlled form of this implicit level of concurrency .
We added other things afterwards that we 'll talk about later , but it was very different to Erlang 's model of concurrency .
JA : Erlang started with just this pure process and copying everything .
The reason for copying was error handling .
Error handling was central .
In my view of the world , the view of the world I 've always had was all these little processes all talking to each other in a global namespace .
SPJ : But that already , as you know , was completely alien to Haskell , which is just a functional program which is evaluated , so a totally different model .
JA : In the first incarnation of Erlang , it was just ... little black boxes were communicating , copying their messages - it 's a mailbox model , copying to a mailbox .
What we were doing was relational .
We had Prolog processes inside the black boxes .
SPJ : But you saw the light .
JA : We had to .
You are launching a rocket program , because ...
We wanted from a black box perspective , if you send a certain sequence of messages in , you want the same sequence of messages to come out .
You want that to be reproducible and deterministic and Prolog is n't like that .
It backtracks , and it has things like that .
It just sort of became more natural to make it functional .
We never made a decision about having types or not having types .
That was n't an issue .
We started with Prolog .
Prolog did n't have types , so we got the dynamic type system that Prolog had .
The issues we were interested in were limiting errors , propagation of errors , restarting things , restarting bits of the system without taking down all the system , having things which may appear inconsistent while you are upgrading them , continuously evolving systems , not systems you stop and restart .
We can't stop our systems and globally check they are consistent and then relaunch them .
We incrementally change bits and we recognize that they are inconsistent under short time periods and we live with that .
Finding ways of living with failure , making systems that work , despite the fact they are inconsistent , despite the fact that failures occur .
Error models are very sophisticated .
When I see things like Scala or I see on the ' net there 's this kind of " Erlang - like semantics " , that usually means mailboxes and message boxes , it does n't mean all the error handling , it does n't mean the live code upgrade .
The live upgrade of code while you are running a system needs a lot of deep plumbing under the counter - it 's not easy .
SPJ : I still think it 's amazing you can make that work at all .
JA : Phil Wadler saw it ...
You know , you can have two versions of the same model with all the same names , he did n't believe it was possible until we showed it to him .
3 . You mentioned some other language got inspired from Erlang and from Haskell , also about concurrency .
For example , Scala .
The dynamic part of Erlang actors in the same way that languages like F# and C# implement features coming from functional programming , more specifically Haskell .
Can you talk a bit about this and how things get implemented in the mainstream or in other languages ?
JA : I do n't know .
People say " What will happen to Erlang ? " and I have no idea .
There are certain languages which are very influential , but do n't get widely used , like Smalltalk , for example .
Smalltalk is the ultimate object - oriented language and it has influenced Objective - C and all sorts of languages .
It has this core band of pure Smalltalk programmers who do n't believe in anything else , but it was n't destined to take over the world .
Erlang is probably ...
I do n't know , maybe it's in that category , it influences other languages ...
It comes from a funny place , it comes from Ericsson , it comes from a telecoms company and that 's really not our main business , to make languages .
Microsoft 's main business is to make languages , but you have the sort of muscle to support a language .
We have languages supported by companies like Microsoft and Sun and Java and C# and things like that .
Then , you have languages not supported by big companies like Ruby and Perl , and they have their own communities .
Erlang is in between - it's not in the sense of Microsoft or Sun being supported in the big scale , but it 's not living all by itself in an open source community .
It has the financial resources to do the compiler and keep the core clean , which is very good .
Where it goes from there , I do n't know .
SPJ : But nevertheless , there is this company that supports it - there is n't for Haskell , curiously .
Microsoft is generously supporting myself and Simon Marlow , but they are not supporting us to work on Haskell .
I 'm hired as a researcher and I happen to work on Haskell .
JA : It 's a good change to work on C# .
SPJ : In principle I could .
I do n't think it 's going to any time soon .
I suppose Microsoft could turn around and tell me " Please do n't work on Haskell any more . "
4 . Like they did with Erik Meijer , right ?
SPJ : Erik is a whole different ball of wax .
Erik works in the developer division in Microsoft and that 's much more product focused , but amazingly Erik has brilliantly found a way to meld ideas from functional programming in quite a product - focused kind of way and build a little research bubble in the developer division that they perceive as being actively valuable to them .
I think that 's amazing !
Whereas I 'm a mere parasite .
I 'm a researcher who is n't required on a month - by - month basis in the way that Erik is to produce immediate value to the company .
But I think Haskell is also a bit different to Erlang .
I think of Haskell as a ...
Its principle value is a kind of ideas factory .
It 's a laboratory in which ideas can grow and flow .
It has a very active user community and a very active research community .
Lots of research papers use Haskell as their substrate and indeed use GHC , the compiler that Simon and I built , as a substrate for their work .
It 's a laboratory in which ideas can go in that may then get transferred elsewhere .
We 've seen lots of examples of that , not perhaps specifically for Haskell or for functional programming in general , going right back to garbage collection , which is now taken as " Of course you have garbage collection " , but it was a long time before that was taken as wrote , it was a long time that people thought it would never be taken as wrote , but that grew up in the functional programming community .
Generics in Java and C# grew up in their functional programming type system world and are now taken for granted .
LINQ , the language integrated query system in C# , is heavily informed by ideas of functional programming .
I 'm actually quite happy if Haskell serves as a role of generating ideas then move into the mainstream .
Whether Haskell will itself ever become a truly mainstream language - it has hundreds of thousands of users , but not hundreds of millions of users , so it 's a completely different kind of scale than Microsoft 's product languages .
Whether it will ever become a language on that scale , I do n't know and I would n't want to give up being an ideas factory in order to get that .
I 'm just delighted that my colleague , Don Syme , who is 3 doors down the corridor , has developed F# , in which now actually there 's a kind of pipeline , so now he can get pipeline ideas out of Haskell into F# and out of F# into C# .
And I 'm also delighted that he successfully made the case to Microsoft to turn it into a product that the company does support in a way that Erlang is supported and Haskell is not .
F# really is a Microsoft product .
That 's a huge breakthrough for a big mainstream company like Microsoft to support a functional language .
But the ideas factory is the bit that I ... that is the most important thing , the high order bit .
JA : That 's fun , is n't it ?
It 's the same in Erlang .
I think in a way you know your graph , and it 's like you have this initial enthusiasm , you get up to there and there 's this sort of plateau where not much happens .
I think that happened in Erlang as well .
I do n't understand why , it seemed to be very stop - go .
You work on things , then suddenly something happens and then I think it 's a time taken to ingest the ideas , these ideas are fermenting in people 's brains for a long time .
When people started being permanently connected to the Internet with broadband connections - that 's a quantitative change .
You saw the file - sharing networks .
It 's only about 4 - 5 years ago that people started deploying distributed algorithms .
In the first few years of that they said " What shall we do ? "
Nobody knows so they invented Bittorrent and things like that .
You have social networking programs , you have things like that .
Google
Wave will come along and replace email in a few years time .
Suddenly people want to know how to write distributed programs , which they never wanted to do before .
So , how do you do distributed transactions ?
How do you do consistency ?
It was always a pretty obscure part of computer science , these distributed algorithms .
Then we said " We 've got these to do parallel .
How the heck do we program these things ? "
In Erlang or Haskell , these algorithms are just difficult , but in other languages they are ...
SPJ : Downright impossible !
JA : Yeah , right !
I mean even if you have a very clean , pure programming language and you take Paxton algorithms or something like that , they are complicated things .
They make your head hurt .
There is a whole branch of mathematics , a whole branch of computer science to understand distributed algorithms and they live at the bottom of these social networks and things , ticking along .
So I do n't think you are going to see Erlang replacing Javascript or anything like that in browsers , but where you are seeing them being deployed is in the infrastructures , in the clouds and things like that , to glue the bits together properly , because that 's where you need the complex algorithms .
We are seeing an infrastructure - building things , cloud computing and what you are doing inside modern massive multicores , how do you organize computations .
There where it 's being used a lot .
SPJ : Whenever you 've got concurrency and multiple processes working , you need to be very careful about side effects .
Otherwise it just does your head in .
Something that Haskell and Erlang both share is being careful about effects .
Haskell is sort of super - careful and Erlang is merely careful , but in both cases , we do n't have this , unrestricted side effects all the time , the computational fabric being effectful .
It seems to me it makes it jolly hard to write programs that exploit multithreads .
JA : I did n't really know what thread safety was in Java , so I wrote a little Java Swing thing and of a Java friend I asked : I wrote this Java process and it worked fine .
I could create one window , and then I created 2 windows in a graphical program and I drew a rectangle in one and I drew a rectancle in the other and it crashed .
And I said " Why did it crash ? "
And he said " Well the Swing library 's not threadsafe " .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means if you got one thing that works , you do 2 of them in parallel , they interact in strange ways .
I thought " How can you program like that ?
It 's impossible to program ! "
If you got this non -thread safety , maybe you got this code that 's threadsafe that reads stuff and this code that 's threadsafe that writes stuff , you try to compose into a program that reads and writes and then you go " Oh , it did n't work ! "
Then you are scratching your head and thinking " Maybe something is wrong .
Let 's put a mutate or a lock around the whole thing " and it works for a while and then somebody else has forgotten to lock it .
What happens when it crashes ?
How is the failure model integrated with the locking models ?
Because if you lock stuff it seems you do n't fail and you release the lock and then you hide that in the libraries and nobody can see and you inherit stuff from there and you 've got a mess .
SPJ : One of the ways that I speculate that functional languages may end up influencing the mainstream , is that mainstream languages will gain a larger and larger subset of purely functional programming , that will make it easier to write functional programs that do n't use side effects a lot .
So , you can get more and more computation done , useful and complicated computation , like the algorithms you were describing , without using side effects .
I think that , as they get richer subsets - F# is an example of this because it 's built on a substrate that is completely imperative .
The .NET system is an imperative system , but F# makes it easier - it reduces the barrier to entry for writing functionally .
I think that 's a trend that we will see continue .
JA : What I noticed is that the Erlang libraries , they are pure libraries , and the pure functions are incredibly reusable .
They just work forever .
You do them , you test them and forget about them and you can reuse them in many different contexts that you had n't thought about .
The goal in system design is to divide your system in such a way that as much as possible of it is pure and the messing stuff's on the side .
SPJ : That 's why you need those types , Joe !
JA : No , that 's why you need good error recovery mechanism , because even with your types , you need to test it .
First , I want to write a factorial program , my factorial program will say " factorial of n is 42 " and the type inference then will say " This is a type int to int " , so it 's OK , it 's correct .
You have to say factorial 3 is 6 .
SPJ : You are misrepresenting me !
I never said that types guarantee your program is correct , but you were talking about segregating events and types are a very good way to segregate things .
5 . In the same topic , in Scala , which we say got inspired by Erlang , for the actor model , actually they do n't copy memory , they do n't copy data structure , but they rather share them and there are no constraints on the data structure , so it could be mutable and it could be shared .
Martin Odersky , father of Scala wrote a paper about using types , be it inferred or not , type annotations for guaranteeing that the reference is not consumed concurrently .
So , you can use mutable data structure , which is very nice for performance reasons , yet you get some guarantees of not having race conditions .
Can you talk a little bit about that from the two perspectives ?
SPJ : First thing to say , Scala is not just a knock - off of Erlang .
It 's a whole sophisticated language which rather elegantly combines functional and object oriented systems , in a rather innovative and unusual way .
But I think you are right - one thing you can do with Scala is implement an Erlang - like model .
Once you 've got an imperative system , in which you can mutate things , it is possible to use type systems to constrain exactly how you mutate them so that , for example , ownership types in object oriented languages are an example of doing this .
I do n't know about Scala's ...
I do n't know the paper that you are describing of Martin's , but systems that allow mutual objects to flow around and be used once and be owned by different threads can work , but they tend to be rather complicated .
My gut feel is that you need type systems that tread this narrow line between being expressive enough to say what you want and not being so complicated that nobody can understand them anymore .
Ownership types for a conventional object oriented language are a way of controlling some of these things , but that feels to me like taking a system that 's already using too many effects and trying to retrospectively patch it up , is better to start - from my preferences - would be to start with a system in which effects are ( a ) few , because the functional subset is very big and ( b ) rather constrained .
Now , Haskell has a rather crude distinction between effectful programs and not .
That 's not enough to just say it has some effects , might not be enough .
That gets you back into the land of controlling effects more precisely , but at least it 's a smaller piece of your program .
At the moment I 'm agnostic about whether types are the right mechanism for trying to do this much more fine - grained control of effects in which you are saying " This reference is owned by that thread for this period and then the ownership moves to that . "
That 's a rather sophisticated thing to do .
It 's very clever , I 'd be very interested in papers written about it .
JA : I do n't like the idea of mixing things too much .
SPJ : What sort of mixing ?
JA : If you look at Haskell , Erlang , Scala and F# , what do you see ?
If you look at Haskell , you see something which , within its context , within the little framework it sets up for its sandbox , it 's very consistent , it 's very beautiful .
You look at Erlang , it kind of fits , the bits fit together nicely .
Of course , they do n't fit together nicely with the JVM or with .NET or anything like that .
If you want to use all the nice things that are there , you can't use them , or you can use them , but it 's difficult .
So the other approach is , you say " Let 's use the JVM and target lots of different languages , so that the different languages can use each other " or you can do that within the .NET framework , you get Scala and you get F# .
The benefit there is you can use all these other things that are available , but in order to do them , you have to break them , massively corrupt and break these abstraction boundaries and I do n't like that .
I think you are breaking abstraction boundaries in the wrong place .
How I would like to see systems built is through communicating back boxes .
And I would like to see the type systems applied to the definition of the protocols themselves and I have n't seen that done .
SPJ : That 's been lots of work on that kind of stuff in the type systems for contracts .
JA : Yes , I 've done some stuff myself , but it seems to have very little impact on how protocols are designed .
Protocols are designed , typical ways are , if you write RFCs and things like that and they are defined in English with text and a lot of people think they are defining protocols , but they are in fact defining message structures and they do n't say anything about ordering ...
SPJ : You must send an A and then a B and they must be all applied .
JA : Yes .
Classically , an API for files , say , you can open a file and you can close a file and you can read a file and you can write it .
They do n't tell you that you have to open it before you can read it , do they ?
SPJ : The very idea that there is a thing that you do things to it is part of what gives rise to that problem .
JA : In a lot of programming languages , if you have a file open and read and write , the programmer is supposed to know just by magic that you should open it before you read it .
That makes sense on one processor - what does it mean on a parallel program ?
What happens when you have 2 things that try to open the file at the same time ?
Do you get 2 copies and one of them fails ?
Is it like a transaction ?
Is the file put back to the old state ?
If you start trying to read the APIs , you can't find the answer in the API .
John Hughes was saying " Did you know that if you open a file and write it and rewind it and do this and do this then this happens , which is very counterintuitive " and you try and look in the POSIX specs , and you can't find any reference to what they should do .
This good check threading discovers things like this .
If you are doing I / O properly , in the sense that you are doing it , you do n't do it at all and save it all up to the end , then do it !
A lot of those problems go away .
SPJ : We do n't actually .
It just looks like it .
We certainly do n't save it all up to the end !
JA : You 're fibbing !
SPJ : We are tackling the awkward spots .
There are very detailed operational semantics given that explains that I / O happens as you go .
It 's no good if you 've got to print the message and then read the response and then print something else .
You can't save that up to the end !
8 . With any feature of the language , you define a mental model for the programmer , so that the programmer can reason about this feature .
The implementation tries to get in sync with this mental model , but it 's not always true .
In some cases , it gets far from it .
It 's the same thing with processors , when you are sending messages .
It 's not exactly the same thing , because you need to copy or you do n't need to copy .
Sometimes it's not performant to do it that way , you do it another way .
What do you think of this problem ?
The same thing with I/O , that as a programmer I think that is happening by the end , but it is actually happening on the fly , it 's happening right away .
SPJ : It is happening right away and by design .
I think the presentation that I gave today which said the main program is an I/ O action , which is gotten by stitching together other things , that 's a first approximation .
I 've taken quite a lot of trouble to add a tutorial that explains in rather more explicit details .
I mean , that model does n't work at all for a concurrent program , for example , when you are spawning threads that have got to talk to each other , of course you are n't going to save all that up to the end .
So no , the I/ O monad is an action that runs in an interactive fashion with other I / O threads that are going on at the same time and it's possible give a much more precise model for what 's happening than say you save up one big thing that 's performed at the end .
I think the truth of it then , the one big thing you do at the end is just an oversimplification you might do for your first program that just printed 3 things , but then you have to get a slightly more sophisticated understanding of what 's going on .
Or , alternatively , just bail out into " well it looks like a C program and actually it runs like a C program " , you say " Do : print this , read that , send this message to this other process " and that 's exactly what happens , just as if it were a C program .
You can look at a monadic I/O Haskell program with 2 sets of spectacles .
You can either think of it very much like an imperative program and that 's a very accurate model actually , or you can think of it as the compiler does in this more functional way and that 's what means that the compiler 's optimizations are actually robust .
I suppose that 's the way I deal with the dissonance , is to try to say " that was an oversimplification to start with " .
JA : You do n't tell all the truth .
SPJ : That 's right , the truth in bits .
JA : For example , it might sound that when you send messages between Erlang processors , your mental model of what 's happening is you copy everything .
And indeed we do copy everything , apart from - now there 's small print - if it 's a big binary and you are on the same processor , then it's in a shared heap with a reference counting garbage collector .
SPJ : And it 's immutable , of course .
JA : Yes , but it 's like ...
What 's it called in operating systems , when you have a process , if you do n't write to the memory , you 've got the same memory , but you do copy on write .
So , when you write to the memory , you split it into 2 .
The binaries behave like that and they are in a shared heap .
SPJ : You have to be careful about your cost model .
If somebody suddenly redistributed that , so it suddenly was on a different processor ...
JA : If you distributed , then it is copied .
SPJ : That 's what I mean - suddenly the program would run at a very different speed .
JA : Even that statement , that it's on a shared heap and binaries are not copied , is not true for small binaries because small binaries are copied , because it 's just not worth sharing them and doing things .
Even that statement is not quite true , because sometimes you keep fragmented ones - there is an awful lot of small print .
SPJ : It 's a business of a runtime system to provide a simple abstraction for complicated stuff .
JA : Should a programmer know about that ?
No .
SPJ : No .
But we are not talking about the cost model , right ?
Whereas you were talking about the understanding of what semantics of the program is .
He does less talking here than his guests , actually , but the clip ’s obligatory after the food fight in last night ’s 9/12 Project thread .
Two noteworthy statements by GB .
One :
He reminds Randian atheist Yaron Brook that the country was founded on the idea of religious ( and irreligious ) coexistence , which is certainly true and which would have made a fine “ core principle ” for that libertarian Project of his in lieu of the one declaring God “ the center of my life . ”
Two :
A few minutes earlier , he tells the Christian minister that “ we must restore God in his rightful place because these rights belong to him . ”
What he means by “ rightful place ” is unclear — prayer in public schools or something more ? — but the canard about divine rights is an ancient atheist pet peeve .
Good luck getting
God to protect your rights when they ’re being trampled on , and better luck in trying to form a consensus between left and right on precisely which rights “ belong to him ” and what that means in practice .
Do I have a right to be cared for when I ’m sick ?
I say no , but I do n’t think it ’s nutty that a socialist might read Biblical passages about doing unto others and being my brother ’s keeper and conclude otherwise .
Watch Brook for more on that , although it ’s nothing you have n’t heard before .
As for the minister , it sounds like he ’s suggesting ObamaCare is actually a Darwinist ( or rather , social Darwinist ) plot by godless elites to thin the herd of baby boomers , but I might be misunderstanding him .

US Press Corps Fails Again on Iran The U.S. press corps appears to have learned little or nothing from the Iraq debacle as a new crisis looms with Iran .

Yet , the most dangerous parallel between the misreporting on Iraq and the current hysteria about Iran may be that major U.S. news outlets , especially the New York Times and the Washington Post , continue to paint the disputes in black and white and leave shades of gray out of the frame .
In doing so , these news organizations again are casting aside their own rules about objectivity and balance .
Just like in the run-up to the Iraq War , they obsess about a villain ( with Iran ’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad replacing Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein ) – and have thrown down the memory hole inconvenient facts and important context .
For instance , prior to the June 12 election in Iran , it was well known and widely reported that President George W. Bush had signed a covert action finding targeting Iran ’s Islamic government with a major program of propaganda and political destabilization .
In the July 7 , 2008 , New Yorker magazine , investigative reporter Seymour Hersh wrote that late the previous year , Congress had agreed to Bush ’s request for a major escalation in covert operations against Iran to the tune of up to $ 400 million .
“ The Finding was focused on undermining Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change , ” one person familiar with its contents told Hersh .
The operation involved “ working with opposition groups and passing money , ” the person said .
Other news organizations reported similar facts , with Bush administration officials even citing the aggressive covert action as one reason why the Israelis should tamp down their heated rhetoric about launching a military strike against Iran ’s nuclear sites .
Yet , when the campaign of Mir Hossein Mousavi took on the appearance of a “ velvet revolution , ” with Mousavi claiming victory before any ballots were counted and then organizing mass demonstration when the official vote count went against him , the U.S. press corps mocked any suggestion from Ahmadinejad ’s government that foreign operatives might have had a hand in the disruption .
Not to say that Mousavi ’s campaign definitely was orchestrated from outside Iran – nor to suggest that it did n’t speak for genuine grievances inside Iran – but the U.S. press corps behaved as if it had forgotten its own earlier reporting about the CIA covert operation .
It was hard to avoid the obvious conclusion that the big American media was taking sides with Mousavi .
The Iran - Contra Connection
Truly objective journalism at least might have included some historical facts about the three chief opposition leaders and their longstanding ( often secret ) ties to the West .
In the 1980s , then Prime Minister Mousavi was , in effect , the control officer for Manucher Ghorbanifar , the Iranian agent who hooked up with neoconservative activist Michael Ledeen for clandestine Iran-Contra weapons shipments that involved both the United States and Israel .
In November 1985 , at a key moment in the arms - for - hostages scandal as one of the missile shipments via Israel went awry , Ghorbanifar conveyed Mousavi ’s anger to the White House .
" On or about November 25 , 1985 , Ledeen received a frantic phone call from Ghorbanifar , asking him to relay a message from the prime minister of Iran to President Reagan regarding the shipment of the wrong type of HAWKs , ” according to Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh ’s Final Report .
“ Ledeen said the message essentially was ‘ we 've been holding up our part of the bargain , and here you people are now cheating us and tricking us and deceiving us and you had better correct this situation right away . ’ ”
Ghorbanifar also had dangled the possibility of Reagan ’s national security adviser Robert McFarlane meeting with high - level Iranian officials , including Mousavi .
In May 1986 , when McFarlane and White House aide Oliver North took their infamous trip to Tehran with the inscribed Bible and the key - shaped cake , they were planning to meet with Mousavi .
Another leading figure in today ’s opposition , Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , also sat at the center of the web of arms deals that Israel arranged for Iran in its long war with Iraq .
Rafsanjani , who was then parliamentary chairman , built his personal fortune , in part , as a war profiteer benefiting from those lucrative deals with Israel .
[ For more on the arms deals , see Ari Ben- Menashe ’s Profits of War . ]
A third key opposition leader , Mehdi Karoubi , and his brother Hassan also were linked to the secret arms deals .
Mehdi Karoubi has been identified as an intermediary as early as 1980 when he reportedly had contacts with Israeli and U.S. intelligence operatives and top Republicans working for Ronald Reagan .
[ See Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
The brother , Hassan Karoubi , was another Iran - Contra figure , meeting with Ghorbanifar and Ledeen in Geneva in late October 1985 regarding missile shipments in exchange for Iranian help in getting a group of U.S. hostages freed in Lebanon , according to Walsh ’s report .
Normally , such an unusual line - up of opposition leaders might be expected to raise some eyebrows in the U.S. press corps .
If the CIA or Israeli intelligence were trying to achieve regime change in Iran , they might reasonably reach out to influential figures with whom they ’ve had prior relationships .
Losing History
But all that history , as well as the prior knowledge of Bush ’s covert operation seeking “ regime change ” in Iran , disappeared , not to be mentioned in the volumes of reporting about June 12 election .
The stories all were about supposedly spontaneous demonstrations in protest of Ahmadinejad ’s allegedly fraudulent reelection .
Over time , some U.S. journalists even dropped the “ alleged ” ahead of “ fraud , ” treating Mousavi ’s vague and sometimes contradictory accusations as fact , much as the Washington Post editorial page described Iraq ’s WMD stockpiles as fact in the run-up to that war .
[ See the Post ’s WMD excuse in Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Smearing Joe Wilson Again . ” ]
Yet , the evidence of substantial election fraud in Iran ’s election was always thin and many of the allegations touted by the U.S. news media failed to stand up to serious scrutiny .
For instance , a prevalent complaint that Ahmadinejad ’s claim of victory came too fast ignored the fact that Mousavi was out with a declaration of victory before any votes were counted .
The partial results showing Ahmadinejad in the lead followed hours later .
Another claim was that Mousavi would have surely won his home Azeri district handily , rather than lose it outright to Ahmadinejad , but that argument collided with a pre-election poll sponsored by the New America Foundation which had shown Ahmadinejad with a 2 - to - 1 lead in that area .
Even if the election tightened in the final weeks – as some Mousavi supporters contend – Ahmadinejad ’s lopsided lead in Mousavi ’s home territory in May undercut the notion that Azeris would automatically back their favorite son .
Some Iranian analysts have noted that Ahmadinejad poured government resources into that region , explaining his apparent popularity there .
Generally speaking , Mousavi ’s support was concentrated among the urban middle class and the well - educated while Ahmadinejad was more the candidate of the poor – of which there are many in Iran .
They have benefited from government largesse in food and other programs , and they tend to listen to the conservative clerics in the mosques .
Mousavi seemed to acknowledge this point when he released his supposed proof of the rigged election , accusing Ahmadinejad of buying votes by providing food and higher wages for the poor .
At some Mousavi rallies , his supporters reportedly would chant “ death to the potatoes ! ” in a joking reference to Ahmadinejad ’s food distributions .
Yet , while passing out food and raising pay levels may be a sign of “ machine politics , ” such tactics are not normally associated with election fraud .
Assessing the Election
The last real hope for definitive evidence proving Ahmadinejad ’s victory was fraudulent may have passed when Mousavi rejected the possibility of a recount .
Instead Mousavi insisted on an entirely new election .
Mousavi ’s objection to a recount drew support from the New York Times ’ top brass .
“ Even a full recount would be suspect , ” the Times wrote in an editorial .
“ How could anyone be sure that the ballots were valid ? ”
But one reason for a recount is that it may unearth evidence of fraud , especially if ballot - box stuffing was done chaotically or if the tallies were simply fabricated without ballots to support them , as some Western observers have speculated regarding Iran .
The view inside Iran , however , appears to be different .
A poll by WorldPublicOpinion.org questioned 1,003 Iranians across the country between Aug. 27 and Sept. 10 , discovering that 81 percent said they considered Ahmadinejad to be the legitimate president of Iran .
Only 10 percent called him illegitimate , with eight percent offering no opinion .
Sixty - two percent said they had strong confidence in the election results , which showed Ahmadinejad winning by about a 2 - to - 1 margin , and another 21 percent said they had some confidence in the official vote count , for a total of 83 percent expressing favorable views on the election .
By comparison , only 13 percent said they had little or no confidence in the results .
Those poll results were either ignored by the U.S. news media or discounted as the result of fearful Iranians simply saying what their government wanted to hear .
However , similar polls have been conducted in countries around the world , including during the U.S. military occupation of Iraq , and have been regarded as useful measures of public opinion .
It seems in the case of Iran – as earlier with Iraq – the U.S. news media starts with its desired answer and then picks out whatever supports that position and discards what does n’t .
Nuclear Fury
That pattern has continued into the latest round of fury about Iran ’s newly disclosed nuclear plant near Qum .
Both U.S. officials and media pundits have waxed eloquent about the need for Iran to “ come clean ” about its nuclear ambitions and to comply with international demands for transparency .
But there is almost never a reference to Israel ’s secret nuclear weapons program , nor those in Pakistan and India .
All three nations surreptitiously built nuclear bombs with either Western collaboration or acquiescence .
Israel is believed to have one of the most sophisticated nuclear arsenals in the world , but has refused to openly acknowledge its existence .
Even if you agree that Iran represents a greater threat than those other three countries – although that point is arguable given the belligerent rhetoric emanating at times from all three capitals – it would still be traditional journalistic practice to note other factors that might be driving Iran ’s thinking .
And , just as the reporting about the CIA ’s “ regime change ” covert operation was forgotten in the context of the June 12 election , so too has the U.S. media forgotten about a possible reason for Iran to build a highly fortified nuclear plant away from its main facility in Natanz : the Israelis have been threatening to demolish Natanz in an air attack .
Besides the threat from Israel , Iran faced hostile rhetoric from President Bush , who famously counted Iran as part of his “ axis of evil ” and invaded Iraq another member of that alleged “ axis . ”
While the U.S. news media may laugh at the Iranians as paranoid for thinking they faced imminent attack , American pundits would surely take a different view if the United States were under a direct threat from a foreign power whose military had conquered a neighboring state and was poised on the U.S. border .
From the 1980s , I recall how the Reagan administration would suggest ludicrous schemes by Nicaragua or Cuba or even tiny Grenada to endanger U.S. national security – and how career - conscious U.S. journalists would dutifully scribble down those warnings for their news articles .
Once in late 1987 , as a Newsweek correspondent , I was at a Pentagon background briefing when a senior U.S. military official asserted that Nicaragua ’s Sandinista government was in position to send its army through Costa Rica and into Panama .
“ There would nothing to stop them from taking the Panama Canal , ” the official warned .
I was alone in piping up with an irreverent question .
“ Might n’t the 82nd Airborne show up ? ” I asked .
Pavlov ’s Dogs During the Reagan era , Republican officials learned they could pretty much get away with telling the Washington press corps anything about a supposedly dangerous foreign enemy and get away with it .
The press corps had grown terrified of being labeled “ liberal ” or “ not patriotic . ”
Even after Bill Clinton became President , the big news outlets continued to operate as if the Reagan team were still in power , almost like Pavlov ’s dogs , successfully conditioned by rewards and punishments .
For instance , when San Jose Mercury News reporter Gary Webb revived the story of drug trafficking by Reagan ’s beloved Nicaraguan contras , the big newspapers trashed Webb and defended the contras , despite clear evidence that Webb was right .
[ See Robert Parry ’s Lost History . ]
The same pattern reasserted itself dramatically after the 9/11 attacks when George W. Bush found that he could exaggerate any threat and have the New York Times , the Washington Post and most other mainstream news outlets eagerly repeating his propaganda .
Now , even with Bush gone , the Pavlovian effect continues .
The U.S. press corps struts about in outrage over Ahmadinejad – just as they did with Saddam Hussein .
The journalists know intuitively what points to highlight and what context to leave out .
In doing so , the journalists may feel they are protecting their flanks from criticism about their patriotism or their toughness .
But the risk for the nation is that such unprofessional journalism is contributing to a new hysteria , creating a political dynamic that may block President Obama from taking actions for peace that might well be in the best interests of the country .

I was chatting with my son tonight whilst reading Hucklebery Finn , when we came to the part where Huck and the slave Jim are trying to get to the Free States .
My son mentioned that they could use the underground railroad .
It got me to thinking .
The underground railroad “ was an informal network of secret routes and safe houses used by 19th century Black slaves in the United States to escape to free states and Canada with the aid of abolitionists who were sympathetic to their cause ” –was a network of people helping slaves to escape , to get away from oppressive regimes .
Now , slavery means legal ownership of another person .
Legal ownership means the legal right to control .
Although the antebellum form of slavery has been abolished ( in the US at least ) , the state still maintains legal ownership over us : it claims some ownership rights in our bodies when it claims the right to conscript us , regulate us , jail us for using drugs or evading taxes .
So there is still slavery , of another form .
It ’s partial slavery , perhaps , but it ’s slavery –bureaucratic , inescapable , cloying , repressive , democratic slavery .
( For more on this see my What Libertarianism Is . )
So , given that there is a modern analogue to chattel slavery , namely state taxation , fines , jail , conscription , regulation –what would the modern analogue to the underground railroad be ?
Maybe we ought to use that as a modern metaphor : refer to institutions and ways of fighting taxation as a modern Underground Railroad , or try to design a more carefully orchestrated one designed to help people evade state taxes , etc .
For example , imagine a data farm on a little island nation , or some kind of banking secrecy system , that we promulgate as The New Underground Railroad–heping you escape tax slavery .
Something like that .
Any legs ?
I ’m all for it .
Maybe we need …
The Underground Railroad Party …

Update : from readers :
The NetBeans development team has announced the release of version 6.8 milestone 2 and the beta version is scheduled in a few days .
Notable additions include support for Java EE 6 , JSF 2.0 , an embedded broswer and more .
The announcement higlights the major new features :
Release Highlights include : Java Enterprise Edition 6 JavaServer Faces 2.0 for web interfaces and the ability to use EJBs in web applications Java Persistence JPA 2.0 and RESTful web services support Deployment , debugging and profiling with GlassFish v3
JavaServer Faces 2.0 ( Facelets )
Code completion , error hints , namespace completion , documentation popups , and tag auto - import for Facelets Editor support for Facelets libraries , composite components , expression language
Kenai.com : Connected Developer Full JIRA support Improved issue tracker integration
PHP Full PHP 5.3 support Symfony Framework support
Maven Improved support for Java EE 6 , Groovy , Scala projects Customizable dependency exclusion in dependency graph
Ruby Support for JRuby 1.3.1 , Ruby 1.9 debugging , and RSpec 1.2.7
Improved rename refactoring , type inference , and navigation
C/C++ Profiling : New tools for I/O Monitoring , Thread Analysis and Race Detection Faster synchronization during remote development
As Adam Bien reports , two very practical features in the current milestone , which are native support for JIRA and fast incremental deployment with Glassfish :
· Incremental deployment with Glassfish v3 b66 is extremely fast .
It takes less than a second in general .
Class , interface , method changes are immediately recognized and deployed .
· The HttpSession is preserved during deployment .
You do n't even have to re-login after the deployment of your application .
... · JIRA is directly supported for kenai.com .
Additional plugins are no more needed .
One thing that seems to confuse users in the NetBeans forum is the support for the Visual Web pack which was based on the Woodstock components library :
Visual Web JSF and Project Dynamic Faces are not available in the Update Center .
I understand in NetBeans 6.7 , Woodstock version 4.2 is still available .
Is woodstock no longer included in the update center for NB 68 M2 .
I went thru the Stable and Beta Update Center but it is not available .
Visual Web JSF in NetBeans is still the best in its class , even in its version 4.2 form .
There appears to be no alternative that is close enough .
I do n't understand that other 3rd party plugins are supported in the Stable Update Center while the homegrown woodstock is not .
This feature is a big differentiator for NetBeans ( vs. Eclipse and others ) .
Many of us have made good use of this tool can not really find comparable substitutes , The IceFaces Visual Web though good in some ways , has many bugs that we go back to Visual Web JSF in NetBeans 6.5 / 7 to avoid hassle .
Since Woodstock is no longer supported and there is no “ Visual Pack ” for NetBeans yet , there are people that suggest that Oracle should be replacing all this with ADF support from JDeveloper :
Oracle has much better support for JSF / ADF , and NetBeans is a superb and lightweight Java EE 6 environment .
In NetBeans 6.8 + the Visual Web Pack is no more supported , so JDevelopers ADF supported would fit just perfectly into NetBeans
The fact is : JDeveloper is a good IDE , but is not as popular as NetBeans .
I really only rarely ( < 5 times ) saw it in action in projects .
The beta version of NetBeans 6.8 is planned for Oct 22nd and will be followed by two RC versions in November .
The final release is planned for the Dec 1st .
You can download m2 or visit the mailing lists and forums for more information .
Limbaugh echoes Malkin :
" In Obama 's America , the white kids now get beat up with the black kids cheering , ' Yay , right on , right on , right on , right on ...
I wonder if Obama 's going to come to come to the defense of the assailants the way he did his friend Skip Gates up there at Harvard . "
I 'm sorry but this is outrageous .
The story was a classic schoolbus bully incident ; it could happen anywhere any time and has happened everywhere at all times with kids of all races , backgrounds and religions .
To infer both that it was racially motivated and that this is somehow connected to having a black president is repulsive .
I know that is almost de trop with Limbaugh , but sometimes you have to regain a little shock .
This man is spewing incendiary racial hatred .
He is conjuring up images of lonely whites being besieged by angry violent blacks ... based on an incident that had nothing to do with race at all .
And why , by the way , does someone immediately go to the racial angle when looking at such a tape ?
These people are going off the deep end entirely : open panic at a black president is morphing into the conscious fanning of racial polarization , via Gates or ACORN or Van Jones or a schoolbus in Saint Louis .
What we 're seeing is the Jeremiah Wright moment repeated and repeated .
The far right is seizing any racial story to fan white fears of black power in order to destroy Obama .
And the far right now controls the entire right .
Do they understand how irresonsible this is ?
How recklessly dangerous to a society 's cohesion and calm ?
Or is that what they need and thrive on ?

Every once in a while , it 's worth taking a step back and reminding ourselves that Sean Hannity is n't just a Republican partisan hack , he 's also a dumb partisan hack .
A very , very dumb hack .
Case in point : on Wednesday night , he attacked the ABC News / Washington Post poll that showed 57 % support for the public option .
Hannity 's argument ?
Roll the tape :
Transcript : With the exception of Fox News , the other networks , they ’re receiving gold stars on their White House report cards , and the latest case in point is the Washington Post / ABC News poll that shows that 57 % of Americans support a government health care takeover and only 40 % oppose it .
Now a closer look at that poll explains why .
Now get this :
They polled 13 % more Democrats than Republicans .
Now that explains a few things .
Let 's leave aside the fact that Hannity inaccurately claimed this was a poll on a " government takeover " of health care .
It was a poll on the public option .
With that out of the way , Hannity 's core complaint is that the poll is biased because it had more Democrats in it than Republicans .
Apparently the fact that there are more Democrats than Republicans is completely lost on him .
The fact that there were more Democrats than Republicans in that poll is a reflection of reality .
In recent polls , Republicans have averaged 21 % of the electorate , and Democrats have averaged 33 % .
In this poll , Democrats were at 33 % and Republicans were at 20 % .
But let 's say we practiced Hannity 's idea of " fair & balanced " and weighted Democrats , Republicans , and independents equally in the poll .
If we did that , there would be 53 % support for the public option ( the simple average of support by party , which is 77 % of Dems , 57 % of independents , and 26 % of GOPers ) .
Hannity might have realized just how stupid his criticism was if he'd paid attention to the simple fact that he was whining about a 13 - point gap between Dems and Republicans in a poll showing the public option ahead by 17 points .
But no such good fortune for Hannity .
Instead , he grasped for straws , and made a stupid case against a good poll .
Even dumber yet , he made a stupid case which , even if you accepted its core premise , still would have shown solid majority support for the public option .
With political opponents as stupid as Sean Hannity , who needs allies ?
Seated Buddha Statuette in a Viking Ship
Oseberg ship was found in a large burial mound in 1904 near Oseberg farm , Vestfold county , Norway .
It is believed to be one of the best preserved and most exciting Viking ship finds , even though the burial ( dating to 834 AD ) was looted as early as in the Middle Ages .
The ship ’s prow and the roof of the burial chamber were hacked through , skeletal remains of two women were scattered , all precious metal objects stolen .
However , Oseberg burial yielded wealth of grave goods that were deemed worthless by the thieves but are indeed priceless for the Viking Age archeology .
One of the most interesting Oseberg discoveries is the so - called Buddha - bøtte or Buddha bucket .
It is a pail with two identical figures forming the joints of the pail handle .
Both figures represent a man seated in the Lotus position .
His head is flat .
His face with closed eyes has a peaceful and sunken expression .
The man ’s breast is ornamented with red and yellow champlevé enamel as well as panels of millefiori .
Four swastikas on the enamel decoration have the shape common in the Buddhist tradition , in which this symbol represents auspiciousness and good fortune .
Vikings could in fact meet Buddhist missionaries during their expeditions .
Sixth - century Buddha statuette from northern India was found on the island of Helgö , Sweden ( currently on display in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm ) .
However , Oseberg Buddha does not seem to have been imported from Asia .
Researchers point to either Ireland or England as possible places of origin .
Hexham bucket decoration represents a flat human head with the same type of broad face and the same stress on the eyes .
Among other parallels , hanging bowl found at Löland , Norway ( Oslo Museum ) , and the one found in the Maas , Holland ( Leiden Museum ) , could be named .
Both have human shaped handles with red and yellow enamel decoration .
Perhaps the most striking parralel to Oseberg Buddha are the anthropomorphic escutcheons on the Myklebostad hanging bowl , which have similar elaborate champlevé in red , yellow and green , with panels of millefiori .
However , the man is not seated , but standing .
Who is the person represented on the Oseberg bucket , if not Buddha from Asia ?
Is it a meditating Viking ?
A Norse god ?
This remains a mystery .

the dune chair by jonas lyndby jensen for skandiform blends classic scandinavian craftsmanship with contemporary design .
the chair was first exhibited at the 2008 stockholm furniture fair , where designboom first discovered it .
the swedish manufacturer skandiform also saw jensen ’s prototype and worked with the designer to incorporate it into their line .
one year later the chair is in production with a modified fibreglass design available in white and black .
the original featured a felted cushion , while the skandiform produced model uses fibreglass as its material .
the base on both the prototype and the final design is made from soap treated ash .
the design was originally based on ‘ the imprint made when sitting in a sand dune ’ says jensen .

Apparently , General Jones would have us believe that President Obama was n’t aware that we were fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan when he promised to lift the gay ban during the campaign in exchange for our votes .
So , Jones tells us today , Obama ca n’t get to that particular promise right now because he ’s busy fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Uh huh .
So when exactly are both of those wars going to be over ?
I ’m guessing some time after Obama leaves office .
And that of course assumes that we do n’t have more wars to “ distract ” the president .
Jones just set us back .
Again .
He just gave the Republicans , and conservative Dems , the perfect talking point .
Should anyone – members of Congress or the administration – move to lift the ban any time before these wars are over , our opponents will simply quote General Jones saying that to lift the ban during war time would be too distracting .
What could Jones have said ?
How about , there ’s a new analysis from a Department of Defense - related publication that says the ban can be lifted without hurting morale and cohesion .
Or how about saying that the President just wrote to Senator Reid , agreeing to work together to lift the ban ?
Nope .
None of that .
All we got was another reason why the president may never be able to keep his promise .
The Obama administration is doing next to nothing – and perhaps nothing altogether – to move the ball forward on repealing DADT .
This is n’t the kind of policy you just wake up one morning and say “ ah , today is the day to lift the ban . ”
Bill Clinton found that out the hard way .
It takes months , if not years , of preparation .
Working the PR angles , the media , the grassroots , the public at large , the Pentagon .
While we have no idea what if anything Obama is doing to work the Pentagon – though Jones ’ repeated unhelpful remarks suggest that whatever the president is doing , it is n’t working – we certainly do know what he ’s doing on the Hill .
Zippo .
Harry Reid had to write Obama a letter last week begging him help .
And in terms of lobbying the public , we get unhelpful statements like what Jones did , again , today .
In the end , do n’t think that Jones is simply freelancing .
There is no way a senior administration official goes on TV and keeps screwing up like this .
At first it ’s a screw up .
After this many times , it ’s part of the plan .
And the plan is to move the goal posts again and again and again until Obama can pass his gay rights promises to the next president , assuming we get a Democrat elected again this century .

Pass on your thoughts in the forums
A new statistical analysis report shows that despite a child - homicide
rate in the United States which surpasses that of most other Western
nations , firearms are near the bottom of the list of causes for the
alarming statistics .
According to a report drafted by Iain Murray , a senior research
analyst at the Statistical Assessment Service , a Washington - based non-profit , non-partisan think
tank , " in the rush to reduce America 's high juvenile homicide rates into
a gun-control debate , we 're missing the chilling bigger picture of the
real and deadly risks our children face , and what it says about our
society . "
The most recent statistical data available on child homicide rates ,
Murray said , indicated that the U.S. had the highest infant - child
homicide rate -- four times as high -- as all other Western nations
surveyed , at 4.1 children per 100,000 people .
But " for every American child 4 or younger " that is murdered , he
said , " more than eight others die violently by other means -- blunt
objects , strangulation or , most commonly , hands , fists or feet . "

Even in the 5 - 14 age group , he said , the U.S. non -gun murder rate is
more than double the rates taken from the international sampling group ,
" although the rate of murders by firearms does increase considerably as
children get older . "
One of the most recent high - profile child murder cases involving a
gun was the shooting death of six - year - old Kayla Rolland , who was killed
by a classmate in a Michigan school last month .
As expected , the
incident sparked more calls for childproofing handguns -- such as adding
trigger locks -- from traditional gun control advocates and from the
Clinton administration .
Some experts have said the Rolland case may even have been the
impetus for Smith & Wesson , one of the
nation 's largest handgun makers , to strike a deal with the
administration that would prevent the company from being sued by
municipalities and the Justice Department , who say gun makers shoulder
responsibility for illegal acts committed with guns they manufacture .
Specifically , Smith & Wesson executives agreed to add trigger locks to
all handguns sold by the company , and to forbid shipment of their
handguns to dealers who would not agree to the company 's new childproof
packaging mandates .
But Murray said the statistics do n't measure up to the hype .
" While the rate of child gun homicide in the U.S. is much higher than
elsewhere -- as everyone acknowledges -- so is the rate of non-gun
murder , " he said .
" Even if all the gun homicides were taken out of the
equation , America would still have an infant - homicide rate more than 3.5
times as high as the other Western countries , " a phenomenon he called
" staggering . "
America 's obsession with guns and gun violence , Murray said , is
understandable , but that obsession is " blinding us to another
significant social problem , " noting that in 1997 alone , 738 children
under the age of 13 were murdered across the country ( but only 133 by
guns , according to the FBI ) .
" America is witnessing something barbaric happening to its young
children , " Murray said , noting that the figures might be unbelievable
had they not been tallied by official U.S. government sources .
He said the case of another child , 23 - month - old Brianna Blackmond ,
" is more typical of the young children killed in this country . "
She died
in January from a blow to the head given to her by her mother after
being returned from a foster home .
" But how much press attention did that death receive outside
Washington , compared with Kayla Rolland 's tragic but unusual death ? "
Murray asked .
RELATED : Textbooks : ' Few followers of Jesus spread His story '
It is also important to note , he said , " that the main thrust of the
' Kids and Guns ' study " -- a recent government report -- " is that the
rise and subsequent fall in the murder rate among older juveniles in the
1990s was driven by firearm murders and the consequent gun-control
measures .
...
But this does not apply to murders of children aged 13 or
younger . "
Murray said the murder rate in that group was 1.8 per 100,000 in 1976
and 1.7 in 1997 , " never having risen above 2.1 in the intervening 20
years . "
" Children under 13 are being killed just about as often now as they
were during the height of the crack - fueled murder boom of the early
1990s , " said the STATS researcher .
" If anything has been done to combat
the problem , it has n't worked , " which , ostensibly , includes a number of
new gun-control laws that have been passed over the last 20 years .
Yet the data show something surprising : 85 percent of U.S. counties
reported no child homicides -- by any cause -- in 1997 , while just 7
percent experienced two or more .
" In great swaths of the country , child murder is virtually unknown , "
Murray said .
" The problem is confined mainly to the big cities of the
East and West coasts , and to the Southwest . "
The research analyst also questioned the wisdom of universal gun laws
emanating from the federal level .
Though gun violence in otherwise
peaceful suburban communities seems to garner headlines , " the
overwhelming majority of child murders happen elsewhere .
This fact alone
would imply that across - the - board federal solutions affecting the entire
country may be misplaced , " he said .
Though it would seem more sensible to use government resources to
" concentrate where the problem is the greatest , " Murray added that other
feel - good measures , such as having " pediatricians nationwide ... talk to
all young children about guns , " as some national pediatric groups have
proposed , " is well - intentioned , but will achieve little . "
" By letting ourselves believe that guns are the problem for
pre-adolescents , we are avoiding the unpalatable truth that something is
very wrong in American society , " Murray said .
" We focus on exceptional
cases , and ignore the unsettling nature of the daily reality . "
But , he said , there may be " a lesson here . "
" We may be able to reduce child - murder rates to the levels of other
countries if we concentrate on what causes those murders -- and guns
are n't the biggest factor . "
There may be a hidden " domino effect , " he said , that causes children
who live in unstable or dangerous environments " where their lives have
little value " to also regard the lives of others in the same light " when
they are seduced by the power of the gun . "
Breaking that cycle and
making childhood safer and saving the lives of the youngest children may
help save older children down the road , Murray said .
" Perhaps the safety locks we most need are the ones that other
civilized countries place in their citizens ' consciences , " he said .
While the tragic deaths of the " Kayla Rollands are thankfully the
exception rather than the rule ... it is the Brianna Blackmonds who
really deserve the attention of the nation 's doctors and the president . "
php watermark and resize image
So I have this friend that likes to take photos , well yea hes a photographer , and apparently one of the lamest parts of his job is the prep work after the show .
Basically he spends a lot of time resizing and adding his logo to some 100s of photos each next day after parties .
And as I ’m currently building an online gallery for him , I wanted to make his life simpler in this aspect .
This is code ripped out of the upload script , then i added some comments to explain whats going on , and then starting writing this post .
I have n’t tested it , but it should work .
UPDATE : well wordpress butchers code , i put it on [ pastebin.ca ]

I 'm off to see Alex from the Shedworking blog .
The last time he featured on this page , he was showing off his neat little garden office ( aka shed ) tucked down at the end of a Hertfordshire garden .
I 'm back this morning because a month ago he moved to a slightly bigger house , and while he has identified where he wants his new , bigger garden office to sit , at the moment it 's occupied by about a ton of ivy and brambles .
So he 's got in a rotovator ( known these days as a " tiller " ) for two weeks , and I 've come to watch him , and possibly laugh , while he tries to clear a nice space for his next HQ .
But photographer Teena and I arrive to find a somewhat downcast atmosphere .
Alex has managed to clear and rotovate only a tiny patch of earth , about the size of a picnic blanket , which has taken him a good 40 minutes .
" It 's much harder work than it looks , " he sighs , with a faint air of Eeyore .
" I had to dig the soil before I could get the rotovator blades in to work the earth . "
Teena is practically crying with laughter at the position Alex has to crunch himself down into in order to push the rotovator along .
" You look like a Buddha , " she says , in between giggles .
This can't be what 's meant to happen , can it ?
" God it 's hard work , is n't it ? ' says Teena , after she has a go .
But she spots something we have n't , which is the handle adjustment lever .
In about 10 seconds , she has the handles flying high , and the rotovator suddenly looks a bit more low - slung and Easy Rider .
Now the balance of body weight works with the movement of the blades .
" It 's still not easy , though .
But at least now I do n't have to look like a complete arse , " comments Alex .

The rotovator is now positively churning through the soil , and Teena is smiling as she points out : " The problem with garden equipment , it 's like photography equipment , it 's all built for men .
And the rotovator , you have to be a bit rough with it , which is a bit of a man thing . "
But Alex is at least smiling now too .
I find myself singing " Three men went to ro- , ro -tovate a meadow ... "
" The secret , I reckon , " says Alex , " is to dig it in at the back to hold it still , and have the handles as high as possible to avoid getting a hernia from standing in a weird position . "
About 10sq m are now cleared , which is about 20 per cent of the total " wild " area , and it 's taken an hour .
" After that fannying about at the beginning , I 'm really pleased , " says Alex .
" It 's the Tom Good aspect – it's my garden , and I 'm clearing it .
My friend has got a gang in to clear his , for £ 350 a day , so if I can save anything like that , I 'll be delighted . "
The Honda FG315 tiller is £ 607 including VAT from Honda dealers .

The big tidy : Emma 's rotovating tips
At this time of year , abandoned allotments and overgrown gardens alike often call for rotovation .
Remember that rotovating where there are perennial weeds such as couch grass or thistles may break them up into smaller pieces , all of which can regrow into new plants .
To save weeding time later , pick through the soil after your first rotovator pass , taking out any visible roots before they are chopped to pieces .
You can rent a cultivator from your local tool - hire specialists – Travis Perkins will rent one for two days for £ 108.80 , or a week for £ 136 .
Keep an eye on the weather forecast before booking it out – you will need to avoid rain so that your soil does n't turn into a mushy cake .
If you think you are going to be using a tiller over and over again , consider buying , especially if you can share with a friend .
The same day as the Transportation Department meeting , Mr. Ensign and Mr. Gallagher had lunch in the Senate Dining Room , with Mr. Hampton and Mr. Lopez joining them .
Mr. Hampton also set up meetings for Allegiant with five other senators on Capitol Hill , including Mr. Coburn .
Mr. Coburn said he realized only when asked about it that his meeting with Mr. Hampton might have violated the one - year lobbying moratorium .
“ It was wrong , ” Mr. Coburn said .
Allegiant Air and November Inc. also said they were unaware of any possible legal issues until asked recently , and said they would consult their lawyers to determine if corrective action was needed .
Mr. Slanker , at November Inc. , said that if his company was part of improper lobbying efforts , “ I ’m going to make it right . ”
The whole situation , he added , “ makes me sick to my stomach . ”
Going Public
Months after Mr. Hampton discovered the affair , he and his wife began seeing a counselor to salvage their marriage .
But Mr. Hampton said he became increasingly embittered toward Mr. Ensign over the “ destruction ” the infidelity had caused .
By July 2008 , Mr. Hampton said he was worried about his finances , since the senator had helped him get only two clients .
The next month , Mr. Hampton secured a full - time position at Allegiant Air that paid as much as $ 225,000 a year .
But he said he still felt he was in a precarious position because of his reliance on the senator for access in Washington .
“ I could n’t keep living a lie , ” he said .
So in April , he hired a lawyer , Daniel J. Albregts of Las Vegas .
In an interview , Mr. Albregts said he believed the Hamptons might have a civil claim against Mr. Ensign over their dismissals from his staff and the consequences for their family .
A blood - alcohol test taken on a cop more than seven hours after he fatally mowed down a minister ’s daughter in Brooklyn while allegedly drunk shows absolutely no booze in his system , The Post has learned .
Two sources familiar with the case said today that the blood - alcohol test on NYPD Officer Andrew Kelly — who was admittedly drinking hours before the crash that killed Vionique Valnord — came back as 0.0 .
The stunning finding does not rule out the possibility that Kelly had alcohol in his system at the time of the early Sunday morning crash , only to have it dissipate in the more than seven hours before he took the BAC test .
But the result could seriously complicate efforts to convict the 30 - year - old cop of the charges of manslaughter and driving while intoxicated that he faces .
A spokesman for Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes , whose office is prosecuting Kelly , refused to comment on the negative BAC reading .
But the spokesman said , “ We believe we have enough circumstantial and direct evidence to get a conviction in this case . “
Kelly , who is assigned to the 68th Precinct , had been boozing last Saturday night with several buddies — among them fellow cop Michael Downs , according to sources .
Kelly was behind the wheel of his Jeep , which was carrying Downs and three other friends , when the vehicle fatally struck Valnord , 33 , on Avenue N at about 12:40 a.m.
Valnord had just left a wedding .
Kelly , who desperately tried to revive Valnord , was described by authorities as having bloodshot eyes and reeking of booze .
He refused a Breathalyzer test at the scene .
Because of that refusal , authorities were forced to obtain a search warrant compelling him to give a blood sample .
That sample was drawn from Kelly by a doctor at about 8 a.m. at Kings County Hospital .
Kelly has been suspended from the NYPD , as has Downs , who was disciplined for leaving the scene of the crash without identifying himself as a cop to responding officers .

Review by Matt GraysonNormally if something jumps out at me , I shriek and run off , but the pictures of the Fujifilm Real 3D W1 are n't at all scary .
Unless you take my photography into consideration .
Making it 's début in July 2009 , the Fujifilm W1 3D camera breaks new ground by producing the most realistic 3D images to date .
Fujifilm have managed to give the coolest 3D images by using two lenses to take pictures with .
Each lens has it's own dedicated 10 Mp CCD sensor which are then merged into one final image in the camera for viewing on the 3D screen on the back .
Taking a picture is easy enough as the camera starts up in 3D mode .
On the front are the two lenses hidden behind a slide down screen which is used to switch the camera on .
There are also two microphones next to the lenses for stereo audio when filming video which can also be done in 3D .
The great thing about the development of this technology is that the camera still has all the usual features of a digital compact such as an optical zoom , macro mode , self timer and flash overrides .
These can all be accessed on the back of the camera although I 'm sorry to say that I do n't get on with the way the buttons are laid out all .
It 's not that they 're in the wrong place , although the ISO ratings going up on the screen instead of down is infuriating .
There are only three buttons on each side of the 2.8in screen but they all have many different options and the buttons have a scored line so that they can be pressed on the right and the left .
Take the button on the top right ; pressing it on the right plays back all the images and videos you 've already taken .
Pressing the left side accesses the main menu .
This is a similar vein all through the buttons with the neat exception of the parallax correction button .
The what ?
Parallax error is what occurs if you try to take a picture and the lenses are n't aligned .
It gives an effect similar to bringing an object too close to your eyes , you start to see double .
Using the middle left button corrects this issue .
Although if you have a subject that 's too close and you align it , the background will start to shift out of alignment .
Fujifilm recommends that you take a ten minute break from viewing in 3D every half and hour and you can either not take pictures or use the 2D / 3D button in the bottom left and this will switch between the two types .
It works like this because the camera records the 3D information as two separate file types ; JPEG and MPO .
MPO is n't for viewing on a normal computer screen and because it's a brand new format it comes out as unsupported .
The Mode button has an interesting few options .
As well as the normal manual , aperture - priority and program modes , Fujifilm have also included the Natural light & flash modes .
They 've also created two new modes called Advanced 2D and Advanced 3D .
The former has three options which you can access by pressing menu .
The first takes two images at wide angle and zoom to give a creative double exposure effect .
The second takes two simultaneous images in different colour sets before merging them together while the third uses two ISO settings which is good for manipulating the shutter speed as the camera does n't have a shutter - priority mode .
Advanced 3D offers two options , one will give a 3D image from two consecutive images taken on a timer while the second one does the same thing but at the same time and takes the two shots from each individual lens .
The menus are easy enough to use but is made harder by the difficult buttons , I forget the amount of times I selected the self timer instead of the display / Finepix button .
Video can be filmed in 2D or 3D and takes advantage of stereo sound thanks to the separate mics on the front of the camera .
It 's by no means perfect , but let 's face it , stereo is better than mono any day .
The file format is AVI so no HD recording here , that may be something to do with the 3D technology as it only runs at a maximum of 640x480 ( VGA ) .
It 's quite a big camera by today 's standards but new technology is always larger than when it becomes an everyday item , look at mobile phones .
The aluminium die - cast body ensures a solid feel to the camera and the sliding door is firm and glides nicely into place .
One unfortunate turn of events is the plastic tripod bush but it looks like it 's replaceable as there are two screws keeping it in place so a metal one may be made available if you use a lot of tripod work .
On the back of the camera is the 2.8in LCD screen which looks like any normal digital compact camera screen .
However , Fujifilm have added Light Direction control to allow 3D images to be viewed straight from the camera without the need for 3D glasses to be worn .
The way it works is by directing light into each eye to stimulate parallax which makes the 3D effect possible .
Fujfilm have included a newly developed 3D RP processor which analyses all photographic data from each image that 's sent from the two sensors before merging it in camera to display a 3D image .
Herein lies the problem as I have no way of showing any of the images that I took on the Fujifilm W1 3D camera .
The images will display but only have the software is being used and that 's to display the image as a 2D picture .
I found through my tests that pictures can't be taken with a subject too close or parallax error begins to occur where the image starts to split into two .
There 's a correction facility available but it only works so far .
It also turns out that if you do have a subject closer than the camera would like , if you use the parallax correction then the background will slip out of parallel and show a double image .
For the performance images , I used the camera in 2D mode to give it a fair chance .
In the colour test chart image , warm colours appear slightly muted while cooler colours get a much more dramatic boost .
I like the skin tone tile , earthy brown and forest green colours , they display an accurate rendition of what I 'd expect .
The mono tones also look nicely balanced but the pastel tones are a little too pale for me .
Despite a tepid performance in the colour chart from the skin tone , I quite like the portrait shot .
It 's balanced enough for a dull day and there 's a decent amount of detail in the hair .
Adding flash has lightened the whole image but not by a great deal and it's great to see that they 've opted for a flash style that tries to remain discreet .
A mild shadow has formed on the wall and while wider than other cameras , it 's not over bearing and can be put down to the position of the flash unit on the camera .
The image of the flower has come out a bit dull , which I 've put down to the over cast day , but the image is also suffering from noise despite an ISO100 setting .
Still , the image is sharp and exposed to a decent level .
I also like the amount of depth of field sending the background out of focus , I 'd just like to be able to close in a bit further .
I like looking at the landscape image on the screen at standard 25 % size but closing in to 100 % and the noise is evident again .
It 's a real shame but Ica n't help but forgive the camera simply due to the innovation that it 's carrying inside .
Dynamic range is to a minimum and it's a shame some of that EXR technology could n't be brought over to help with the darker areas of the picture .
In terms of colour fringing , the camera has performed very well with only a mild amount on the white bars that go into the lock and none that I can see on the leaves that back onto the sky .
This is the part I 'm looking forward to the most .
Throughout the test I 've seen a lot of noise creeping into images that should n't really be showing any .
It 's true of the noise test results though as the ISO100 image does show evidence of noise creeping in at all scales .
There 's detail in the petal leaves so it's not a bad performance and I think that the people who this is aimed at will be less bothered of such issues .
ISO200 shows a drop in detail in the petals but with a similar amount of noise in the grey card .
ISO400 shows little difference in noise invasion but ISO800 shows a distinct drop in quality before the highest setting has a complete lack of detail and purple blobs start to lace the edges of the petals .
It 's certainly an interesting camera to look at and even though it hurt my brain if I looked at it in the wrong direction , it was great to see the proper 3D images on the screen of the camera .
There are a number of people criticising the technology saying it wo n't last and that their is n't enough provision for it .
But it has to start somewhere and I think Fujifilm have shown a lot of courage by pioneering it .
I love the effect it gives and it does look realistic but it 's worth keeping in mind that true 3D has the facility to interact with it by moving around it such as a statue gives you .
This is a 3D effect image which shows considerable depth compared to normal photograph but is more similar to the Magic Eye images that used to be popular where you had to find a dinosaur .
If you 're interested in this technology then buy into it so that it can gain momentum .
3D television is progressing through all major electronics companies as the next big thing so it could be a natural state of events that photography follows on anyway .
Whatever happens , these are exciting times and I 'm glad I 'm here to witness them .

I like shadows in the movies .
I do n't like them in life .
Memory does n't last .
When Kosovo started , they had already forgotten about Bosnia , let alone World War II .
I remember after the war was over and my father returned from the concentration camp .
He said , " You 'll see -- fifty years from now , people will have forgot all about it . "
After Sharon 's death , I definitely had a strong desire to give up .
Your next question will be , What prevented me ?
But I can't answer it .
I just survived .
I was simply born this way .
My father survived the concentration camp .
I 've been asked , Why did he survive ?
Well , I do n't know .
He wanted probably more than the others to survive .
It can be anything .
It can be the desire for revenge .
It can be a longing to see your loved ones .
Truly I do n't know , and I never asked myself the question .
I think you should not ask yourself too many questions .
It 's the centipede syndrome , you know ?
The centipede was asked which foot he puts after which , and he could n't walk anymore .
Work has always sustained me .
Sex is not a pastime .
It 's a force , it 's a drive .
It changes your way of thinking .
For a long time , I did n't want children .
After what happened , I did n't particularly want to get married .
Children without a partner with whom you intend to share the rest of your life does n't make much sense to me .
Can you understand the way one can feel after an event like that ?
After losing someone who is everything to you ?
Dealing with adversity is like the brake pedal in the car .
It just happens instinctively .
You go through it or you perish .
Kids just accept reality as it is , because they have no way of comparing it with anything else .
I 'm much more sensitive now to all this , having a child that goes through all these stages that I went through .
She 's now six :
That 's the age I was when the Germans walked into Poland .
She 's five :
That 's the age when my parents took me for the last holiday in the country .
You see ?
She 's seven :
That 's when I was running in and out of the ghetto through the hole in the barbed wire .
I see it through her eyes , and it's only now that I realize that I was in harm 's way .
But at the time when I was a kid , no .
The only tragic thing was the separation from my parents .
This was something that made me cry , not that the food was bad , not that I had lice , not that there were fleas in the bed , not that there were bedbugs .
And I think , you know , how tragic it would be for my daughter to go through that .
Toutes proportions gardees .
Movies always cost more than you have anticipated .
I think the Pill altered female thinking .
When you think that millions of women were taking daily hormones , you cannot deny that it must have changed their personalities .
I truly do n't think that feminism would reach such absurd proportions if there were no Pill .
It must have had an effect .
I do n't think that Hollywood people like making movies .
They like making deals .
After the party , you either clean up the mess or move the apartment .
In general , I clean up .
There 's a different justice for people who are public figures than for those who are not .
There was no plot against me .
There was no setup .
It was all my fault .
I think that my wrongdoing was much greater than Bill Clinton's .
Pleasure is a carrot .
And a stick .
I think in America , people are getting too big .
Drugs taken for recreation may be justified .
Taken for any kind of positive output , I think it 's laughable .
Drugs alter perception , and you have to be an observer as well as a creator .
You have to have a handle on what you do .
If your sense of touch is impaired , you may break the handle .
Or you might take it for your wife 's ass .
Films are films , life is life .
Flatter actors .
It 's irresistible to them .
Never pull a hair from Faye Dunaway 's head .
Pull it from somebody else 's head .
I 'm not a masochist , but I always take a cold shower in the morning .
It 's a great beginning of the day , because nothing can be worse afterward .

In his exclusive interview with the Washington Post on Friday , fired Alaska state police chief Walt Monegan detailed how Gov. Sarah Palin kept raising the issue of her ex-brother - in - law , state trooper Mike Wooten .
Palin 's sister , Molly , was involved in a bitter divorce and custody battle with Wooten .
Monegan , who was fired by Palin 's office in July , told The Post that the subject came up when he invited the governor to a birthday party for his cousin , a state senator , in February 2007 during the legislative session in Juneau .
" As we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building she wanted to talk to me about her former brother - in - law , " Monegan said in the first interview he has given since Sen .
John McCain announced on Friday that Palin would be his running mate on the Republican ticket .
" I said , ' Ma'am , I need to keep you at arm 's length with this .
I can't deal about him with you .
If need be , I can talk to Todd . "
Todd Palin , the governor 's husband , had brought Monegan a dossier of information on Wooten compiled by Todd and a private investigator .
Monegan looked at the information and determined that , " There was no new evidence , no new complaints . "
In 2005 , when Gov. Palin 's sister filed for divorce , her father had lodged several complaints with state police against Wooten : using a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson , shooting a moose without a permit and drinking beer while driving a patrol car .
An investigation sustained the allegations regarding the moose hunt and the Taser , and later also sustained the drinking charge after at first finding it unsupported .
Documents say Wooten was reprimanded and suspended .
Monegan and John Cyr , chief of the troopers ' union , said that Wooten 's wife had obtained a permit to hunt moose but balked when she saw the prey .
She handed the gun to her husband , who killed the moose .
Cyr also said that Wooten told him he used the Taser on his stepson when the boy asked him to try it on him .
Cyr said Wooten has a " spotless record " and no complaints in his file other than those filed by the governor 's family .
After looking at Wooten 's file , Monegan called Todd Palin back and said there was nothing he could do .
" I tried to explain to him , ' You ca n't head - hunt like this , ' " Monegan told The Post . " ' What you need to do is back off , because if the trooper does make a mistake , and it is a terminable offense , if can look like political interference . ' "
Monegan also called Gov. Palin on her call phone .
" I explained to her there as no new evidence , the issue was closed .
She also was unhappy with that . "
Monegan was fired by Palin 's office on July 11 .
Her chief of staff told Monegan that the governor wanted " to go in another direction , " Monegan said .
" When I was let go , I was a little surprised .
There was not a warning shot or anything . "
Gov. Palin at first denied that she or anyone in her administration had ever pressured Monegan to fire Wooten .
But on Aug. 13 , she acknowledged that a half dozen members of her adminstration had made more than two dozen calls on the matter to various state officials .
" I do now have to tell Alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist , although I have only now become aware of it , " she said .
Also that day , Palin 's office released a recording of a call made in February by Palin 's chief of commissions , Frank Bailey , to a police lieutenant .
Bailey said Palin " really likes
Walt a lot , but on this issue ... she does n't know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue .
It 's very , very troubling to her and the family . "
Palin has said the Wooten made a death threat against her father .
" Wooten was not a model trooper , " Monegan said .
" On the other hand , the allegations pre-date her election .
So , there is some issue about whether it was truly motivated by public safety concerns , or it was vindictiveness . "
Twilight star Kristen Stewart vamps it up as she stars in sultry , grown - up shoot
She made her name as the girl who fell in love with a vampire .
So perhaps it's not that surprising that Kristen Stewart has grown up into something of a gothic beauty .
The 19 - year - old star of the Twilight movies showed off a stunning new image in a sultry photoshoot .
In the accompanying article for a U.S. magazine , Stewart tells how the success of the first Twilight movie changed her life .
Now , working on the sequels , she can no longer walk about without being recognised and feels like a prisoner as she returns to her hotel room after filming each day .
Leggy : Kristen Stewart shows off her pins as she reclines on a bed in a leopard - print coat
With her hair cropped and dyed black after her recent role as Joan Jett in the biopic about The Runways , Stewart looks very different from Bella Swan , the fresh - faced teen she portrays in Twilight , the story of a romance between a vampire and human girl .
Smoky make - up , leopardskin and lace ensure she smoulders in the striking shots by Craig McDean for Interview magazine .
During the interview , conducted by veteran actor Dennis Hopper , Stewart admits she is struggling to adapt to her sudden fame .
Punk princess : Stewart goes for the punk rock look with her black quiff , smoky eyes and rebellious hand gestures
New romantic : Stewart swaps her usual black for romantic white lace
It was less than a year ago that she and leading man Robert Pattinson starred in the first Twilight film - adapted from Stephanie Meyer 's best - selling books .
There have been rumours of a real - life romance , although Stewart is in a relationship with actor Michael Angarano .
She tells Hopper : ' I do n’t talk to anybody about my personal life , and maybe that perpetuates ( the attention ) , too . '
Followed by fans and photographers , Stewart finds it hard to live normally and has become ' boring ' because she spends so much time in her hotel room while she is filming the sequels .
Wild thing : Kristen goes for an edgy look in leopard - print heels and sunglasses
' I 'd like to take more walks after work instead of having to come back to my hotel room and not leave .
So it can be boring , ' she said .
' I do n’t leave my hotel room - literally , I do n’t . '
As well as her day - to - day - life , she feels the movie series has begun to dominate her conversation .
' The sad thing is that I feel so boring because Twilight is literally how every conversation I have these days begins - whether it ’s someone I ’m meeting for the first time or someone I just have n’t seen in a while .
All wrapped up : Stewart gets to grips with some cellophane
' The first thing I want to say to them is , “ It ’s insane !
And , as a person , I ca n’t do anything ! ”
But then I think to myself , God damn it , shut the f**k up . '
Stewart is currently working on the third Twilight movie Eclipse after finishing the sequel New Moon earlier this year .
While New Moon sees Pattinson 's vampire character Edward Cullen attempt to leave his human girlfriend Bella to save her life , Eclipse sees her torn between her blood - sucking lover and her werewolf friend Jacob Black ( Taylor Lautner ) .
The full interview with Stewart is in the new issue of Interview magazine , on sale now
Stewart says she is finally getting a better understanding of Bella in the sequels although she finds her obsessive love for Edward disturbing .
She said : ' I feel like I really know Bella now ...
' You have to question their ( Bella and Edward 's ) motivations - to watch two people so unhealthily devoted to each other .
' I stand behind everything that they do .
I have to justify it in my mind , or else I could n’t play the character .
But they are definitely not the most pragmatic characters .
' The weirdest f**king themes run through this story - like dominance and masochism . '
Meyer 's Twilight books have sold over 25 million copies worldwide and a further 20 million copies in the U.S. and have been translated in 37 languages .
When the Twilight movie was released in the U.S. last November , it took an amazing $ 69 million on its opening weekend .

We were surprised that the American Planning Association recently named Montrose one of its “ 10 Great Neighborhoods ” for 2009 .
Montrose is a great place .
But does it , as the association writes , “ highlight the roles that planners and planning play in creating communities of lasting value ” ?
We think that planning helped make Montrose what it is .
But much of what 's great about that funky urban neighborhood had nothing to do with planning — and in fact , arose in spite of it .
It may surprise you to hear that Montrose was planned .
Not publicly , by city officials of course : Houston 's not that kind of town .
But in the 1910s and ' 20s , private developers made many important decisions , such as laying out a pedestrian - friendly street grid , that gave the neighborhood good bones .
Those early planners envisioned rows of mansions where Houston 's elite could escape downtown 's grit and bustle .
Later developers added middle - class bungalows , but the basic idea remained the same : Montrose was supposed to be a quiet , leafy respite from the city .
That plan fell apart long before the end of the 20th century .
After Montrose fell from fashion among the social elite , its cheap rents attracted gays , lesbians , artists and students .
In the '80s and '90s , those poor - but - interesting residents made the place feel wild , exciting , even dangerous .
Planned as a refuge from the city , Montrose became a throbbing center of urban life .
Since then , gentrification has mellowed the vibe to a pleasant bohemianism .
Montrose remains known for its gay bars — but also for one - of - a - kind coffee shops , boutiques and antiques .
These days , planning advocates struggle not to make Montrose feel like an escape from the city , but to help it keep the character that distinguishes it from duller neighborhoods .
Planning fans complain that routine townhouses have swallowed whole streets of the neighborhood 's sweet bungalows .
And they despair of dull commercial development , such as that which reigns over Montrose and Westheimer , the intersection right at the neighborhood 's heart .
As the pro-planning group Blueprint Houston recently pointed out , three of the intersection 's four corners are occupied by pedestrian - hostile blah - ness : a gas station , a dispirited - looking half - empty strip center and a drive - thru restaurant .
No planner in his right mind would allow such crud to command that spot .
And there 's the irony .
Planning can't take credit for the off - beat charms of Montrose .
But without at least some planning — public , private or both — that unplanned charm may disappear .

Real Madrid star makes plea to former team - mate
Cristiano Ronaldo has urged former Manchester United team - mate Wayne Rooney to quit Old Trafford and join him at Real Madrid .
The Portuguese forward is currently sidelined with an ankle problem but prior to his injury he settled impressively in the Spanish capital following a world record £ 80 million move to the Bernabeu .
Having scored nine goals in seven games to date it would seem Ronaldo is coping fine without Rooney , but he looks back fondly on the partnership he enjoyed with the England striker .
And while he admits Rooney is unlikely to leave England any time soon , Ronaldo believes the 24 - year - old would fit in at Madrid .
" Wayne would be a sensation out here .
I think we could do with Rooney to help us out , " Ronaldo told .
" He would be brilliant if he came .
This is the ideal place for the world 's best players and there 's little doubt he is one of them .
" Wayne has all the skill and determination you need to make a fine career here .
" He has shown just how good he is over the last few years in England .
" And there 's no doubt he would be the same sort of player in Spain .
It would be lovely to see him here one day at Real Madrid .
" I realise it would take a lot for him to move from England .
" He loves the country , he loves Manchester and he is a Liverpool boy .
And United is a good club for him .
But you never know what could happen in the future . "

I 'm pleased to announce the availability of version 0.5 of text , a library that provides fast Unicode text handling for Haskell .
This version contains numerous changes compared to version 0.4 , in three broad categories :
I made improvements to the performance of some common functions by , in many cases , more than 10x .
I have substantially refined the API .
Many bugs fixed , almost all of them subtle , thanks to the ever - astounding QuickCheck library .
Performance improvements
In real - world code , many of the most frequently performed text manipulation operations involve searching for substrings .
I 've written a fast search function , based on Fredrik Lundh 's very elegant adaptation of the Boyer - Moore - Horspool - Sunday algorithm , and rewritten all of the functions that perform searches internally to use it ( without changing any of the APIs in question , of course ) .
Retooling with this function has made a big difference to performance .
Here are measurements of old - style searches , searches over the popular ByteString type , and new - style searches :
For this data set , the new search code is 10.4 times faster than the old , and 24 % faster than the ByteString search code .
If we perform a search for a short snippet of DNA in a large data set , we see a similar pattern :
Over the DNA data set , the new search code is 15.3 times faster than the old , and 85 % faster than the ByteString search code .
By the way , it was writing — and wanting to measure the performance of — this new search function that led me to create the criterion benchmarking package , which in turn begat the statistics package .
What a month of hacking it 's been !
API changes
While the API of the text package still somewhat resembles the venerable Data .
List API ( which is now almost two decades old ) , I have modified it to be both narrower and more useful for text processing tasks .
All of the integer - index - based search functions are now gone , since using integer offsets into Unicode strings is a bad idea ( especially when the underlying representation uses a variable - length encoding ) .
Instead , the search functions break up the original string .
Consider the new find function , for instance : find :: Text ->
Text -> ( Text , [ ( Text , Text ) ] )
This function returns all non-overlapping instances of needle in haystack .
The first element of the returned pair is the prefix of haystack prior to any matches of needle .
The second is a list of pairs .
The first element of each pair in the list is a span from the beginning of a match to the beginning of the next match , while the second is a span from the beginning of the match to the end of the input .
find " : : " " "
== > ( " " , [ ] )
find " / " " a/b/c/d "
== > ( " a " , [ ( " / b " , " / b/c/d " ) , ( " / c " , " / c/d " ) , ( " / d " , " / d " ) ] )
Notice that no matter how much of the result list you consume , you can always reconstruct the entire original haystack from the elements you 've already seen .
More often , you wo n't want something nearly this general .
Instead , you may want a function that simply splits a string on a separator : split :: Text -> Text -> [ Text ]
Here are a few examples of how the split function works : split " \r
" " a\r
b\r
d\r
e "
== > [ " a " , " b " , " d " , " e " ]
split " aaa " " aaaXaaaXaaaXaaa "
== > [ " " , " X " , " X " , " X " , " " ]
split " x " " x "
== > [ " " , " " ]
Some of the functions supplied by the list API are not very useful in the context of a text - oriented API .
Consider break : break :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> ( [ a ] , [a ] )
I use this name in the text package , but give the function a simpler and more useful type signature ( its behaviour is otherwise the same ) : break :: Text ->
Text -> ( Text , Text )
If , for some reason , you still want the predicate - based functions , they 're usually available , but ( in most cases ) with a " By " suffix added , to provide uniform naming : breakBy :: ( Char -> Bool ) ->
Text -> ( Text , Text )
8 Asians
I ’ll post about my adventures in Canada soon enough , but first I wanted to talk about a side project that I ’ve been working with a couple of people - 8 Asians .
8 Asians is a collaborative blog of eight different people of Asian decent .
We ’ll be posting about whatever Asian issues are currently relevant in our lives , whether it be pop culture or current events or politics .
Think “ The View , ” with Star Jones and Rosie O’Donnell and that chick from Survivor .
Now , replace them all with Asian - Americans and Asian - Canadians .
Yeah .
My role in this weblog is one part editor , one part blogger , one part casting director because I ’m trying to cast a bunch of different writers .
Some of the writers are relatively familiar , while others are first - time bloggers .
That ’s on purpose .
Admittedly , the blog is pretty rough both in terms of design and process , and I ’m doing this in my free time when I ’m not working at the start - up , but it ’s something to pass the time , I suppose .
( And , if you ’re a writer interested in writing about Asian - American issues that might want to be on the blog at a later time , let me know . )
The Gayest Vacation Ever
On Saturday , I am leaving for a week - long trip to Miami , for the Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival .
If this seems a little out - of - character for me , it ’s because it is : I ’m going as a guest of my friend Royce , who won tickets , airfare and hotel accommodations to the festival through a contest .
I ’m actually the fourth person he chose , since his boyfriend is n’t over the age of 21 , another friend is getting ready for the Peace Corps and yet another friend is in Arizona .
Seriously , I ’ve never been so excited to be fourth string in anything , ever .
While I ’ve been to Disneyworld three or four years ago , I know enough to know that Miami is n’t the same as Orlando .
What I DO know about Miami consists the following : Miami Vice ,
The movie “ The Bird Cage , ” Gloria Estefan and Grand Theft Auto : Vice City .
So basically , the image in my head is of the following : Nathan Lane in a hot pink bikini , listening to his Walkman ( NOT his iPod , mind you , his WALKMAN ) while he ’s rollerskating down South Beach .
Then some random guy in a Hawaiian shirt comes up to him , does a line of cocaine and shoots him in the back of the head .
The End .
On top of all of this , Royce and I are going to spend a day or two in Key West , which single - handedly makes this the gayest vacation I ’ve ever been on .
( Seriously , have you browsed the gay accommodations in Key West ?
Christ , I ’m going to feel like I ’m trapped in an 80’s Chaturbat porno movie . )
I ’m handling all of this with a mixture of excitement and absolute horror ; while Royce is getting an outfit , his hair done and has appointments at tanning salons planned , it ’s not really my thing , personally .
And as a result , I might have to apologize to the locals later for how tubby and pale I am , walking around their city full of beautiful people .
If nothing else , it ’ll make for an interesting blog post .
( And if you ’re in the area , of course , let me know one way or another . )
Two Things I ’ve Learned From Eating Alone in Vancouver
Two Important Lessons I 've Learned
This is the first time I ’ve eaten out alone .
Well , okay , the first time I ’ve eaten alone that is n’t a fast food restaurant or a burrito truck or coffeehouse , but an actual restaurant where the point of the institution is to sit there with someone else , eating food together .
Eating out has always been a social activity for me .
I do n’t go to bars alone , do n’t go to movies alone and have never gone to a nice restaurant alone before .
And yet , here I am , taking blurry camphone photos of myself while the two Japanese girls in the school uniforms roll their eyes at me .
For one reason or another , I thought it would be more difficult than it actually is .
As I end up more and more in strange cities where I know very little Jasminlive people , I figure I should start getting used to this feeling ; being strangely alone , but not necessarily lonely .
( Or is that the other way around ? )
Now all I have to do is be able to stand hanging out at a gay bar by myself and I ’m all set .
Someone told me that even the bad sushi in Vancouver is great sushi .
THIS IS A BOLD - FACED LIE , especially if you go to that one sushi house on Main Street and Broadway .
Bacon - wrapped scallops should never be in a bento box .
EVER .
Moving to San Francisco
All the talk about taking a new job at Brickhouse brings me to this point as well : Starting in July , I am renting out my unit in Fremont and moving to San Francisco .
And not just anywhere in San Francisco , but in the Mission District .
I used to joke that the Mission was a place where only two types of people exist : heroin junkies and Live jasmin product managers .
Well , burn me a spoonful of drugs and give me a copy of Microsoft Visio , because I ’m comin ’ home .
To illustrate the contrasts between my current and future living situations , I ’ve written a simple list .
Commute time :
Fremont : 1.5 hours including traffic and parking and time sobbing in the men ’s restroom from the stress of commuting
SF : 20 minutes , walking and BARTing
Building style :
Fremont : Two - story condominium , build in the 90’s , vaulted ceilings .
Actually , not too bad .
SF : A Victorian , converted into three separate units .
A fucking Victorian !
It ’s like I ’m going to be living in Full House , except not in a safe area and there ’s absolutely no boys that will grow up into born - again Christians , meth addicts or socialites .
There will , however , be a laugh - track machine .
Fremont : Greater in number , mostly Indian or Taiwanese , agitated due to the apartment complex not allowed them to play outside due to liabilities
SF : Fewer in number , agitated due to their mothers previous heroin addictions ; may or may not be in a street gang
Neighboring commercial building of establishment :
Fremont : Kentucky Fried Chicken
SF : Lexington Club ( For the record , this will actually be the second time living next to a lesbian establishment .
I know , crazy , right ?
I was also going to be a really inappropriate comment about chicken or fish , but that got self - censored by my notoriously refined taste in humour .
With a fucking u ; that ’s how refined it is , bitches . )
Neighbors :
Fremont :
Angry older woman in her 50’s with tall plants in her patio to prevent neighbors from looking in .
Has a bobblehead cat on her SUV .
SF : Laurie , who referred me to the apartment .
Fellow gay geek , no bobblehead cat that I am aware of .
+10 .
Parking :
Fremont : Ample , but I have a parking space .
SF : Shitty , but I have a parking space .
Social life :
Fremont : Zero , on a scale of one to , well , anything
SF : It ’ll be at least a million times better ; unfortunately , a million times zero is still zero .
Returning to Yahoo !
A couple of months ago , I had written a blog post where I had announced I was leaving Yahoo ! to pursue an opportunity in Vancouver .
Maybe if this website was n’t so public I would go into some of the details ; instead , I ’ll simply say that lessons were learned , photos of myself sitting alone in restaurants were taken .
Once it became obvious that I would n’t be moving to Vancouver any time soon , there was a lot of moments working from Internet cafes and watching television at home .
( Did you know Bob Barker is n’t on The Price is Right anymore ?
Or that Rosie O’Donnell was once on The View ? I KNOW ! )
When it was time for me to start looking for jobs , applying to Yahoo !
again was n’t even remotely on the radar - besides , who leaves a company only to come back to it , right ?
- until Kevin told me about an opportunity at Yahoo !
Brickhouse , Yahoo ! ’s experimental start - up incubator in San Francisco .
When he told me about the project , the types of things I would be doing , as well as some of the fantastic people involved - people I respect professionally as well as am friends with in real life - well , I had to at least see what kind of trouble I could get myself into .
( I ’m under NDA so I ca n’t really say much besides that .
If anyone really gives me a hard time , I ’ll just say I work on Gay Pipes or something . )
This job is also giving me an opportunity to move out of Fremont and to the Mission , but that ’s for another blog post .
So we ’ll see .
By the way - just so we can get it out of our system now : I ’m a Brick … Hooouuuse .
Yes , I ’m might - tay might - tay , just lettin ’ it all hang out , yes yes .
I know .
It ’s the name of a popular song in the 70’s .
I get it .

Via : Mercola :
The New Secretary of Agriculture is a Fan of Factory Farms , GM Crops and More
Former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack is now the Secretary of Agriculture , an appointment that took place despite massive public outcry .
What was needed for an effective Secretary of Agriculture was someone who would develop and implement a plan that promotes family - scale farming and a safe and nutritious food system with a sustainable and organic vision .
What we got was yet another politician who ’s already made room in his bed for the industry lobby .
As the Organic Consumers Association ( OCA ) points out : [ 3 ]
* Vilsack has been a strong supporter of genetically engineered crops , including bio-pharmaceutical corn
* The biggest biotechnology industry group , the Biotechnology Industry Organization , named Vilsack Governor of the Year .
He was also the founder and former chair of the Governor ’s Biotechnology Partnership .
* When Vilsack created the Iowa Values Fund , his first poster child of economic development potential was Trans Ova and their pursuit of cloning dairy cows .
* The undemocratic and highly unpopular 2005 seed pre-emption bill was Vilsack ’s brainchild .
The law strips local government ’s right to regulated genetically engineered seed ( including where GE can be grown , maintaining GE - free buffers or banning pharma corn locally )
* Vilsack is an ardent supporter of corn and soy - based biofuels , which use as much or more fossil fuel energy to produce them as they generate , while driving up world food prices and literally starving the poor .
* Overall , Vilsack ’s record is one of aiding and abetting Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ( CAFOs ) or factory farms and promoting animal cloning .
You may also be interested to know that Vilsack is widely regarded as a shill for biotech giants like Monsanto ( he even reportedly often travels in Monsanto ’s jet ) ! [ 4 ]
The New Senior Advisor for the FDA is a Former Monsanto VP !
Michael Taylor , a former vice president of public policy and chief lobbyist at Monsanto Company , is the new senior advisor for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
Who is Michael Taylor ?
He is the person who “ oversaw the creation of GMO policy , ” according to Jeffrey Smith , the leading spokesperson on the dangers of GM foods .
Smith continues :
“ If GMOs are indeed responsible for massive sickness and death , then the individual who oversaw the FDA policy that facilitated their introduction holds a uniquely infamous role in human history .
That person is Michael Taylor .
He had been Monsanto ’s attorney before becoming policy chief at the FDA .
Soon after , he became Monsanto ’s vice president and chief lobbyist . ” [ 5 ]
The FDA policy being referred to is the 1992 GMO policy , which stated :
“ The agency is not aware of any information showing that foods derived by these new methods [ genetic engineering ] differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way . ”
In reality , there was major concern among FDA scientists that GM foods were in fact different than natural foods , and that their creation could prompt unknown and unpredictable health problems .
Along with being a key player in the initial pushing of GM foods onto Americans ’ plates ( without any required safety studies ) , Taylor also oversaw the policy regarding Monsanto ’s genetically engineered bovine growth hormone ( rbGH / rbST ) .
This growth hormone , which has been banned in Canada , Europe , Japan , Australia and New Zealand because of cancer risks and other health concerns , was approved in the United States while Taylor was in charge at the FDA .
Smith writes :
“ Taylor also determined that milk from injected cows did not require any special labeling .
And as a gift to his future employer Monsanto , he wrote a white paper suggesting that if companies ever had the audacity to label their products as not using rbGH , they should also include a disclaimer stating that according to the FDA , there is no difference between milk from treated and untreated cows . ”
Taylor ’s white paper , which again was untrue as even FDA scientists acknowledged differences in the rbGH milk , allowed Monsanto to sue dairies that labeled their products rbGH - free .
Dennis Wolff , Another Monsanto “ Yes Man , ” May be the Next Under - Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety
In another ironic turn of events , it ’s rumored that Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff may be appointed the new Under - Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety — the top food safety post at the USDA .
Wolff declared that labeling products rbGH - free was against the law , and ordered all such labels to be removed from Pennsylvania .
Fortunately , due to consumer demand Pennsylvania ’s Governor Ed Rendell stepped in and stopped the ban on rbGH - free labels ( although he did require such claims to include Taylor ’s FDA disclaimer that there is no difference between milk from treated and untreated cows ) .
As Jeffrey Smith explains :
“ Rumor has it that the reason why Pennsylvania ’s governor is supporting Wolff ’s appointment is to get him out of the state — after he “ screwed up so badly ” with the rbGH decision .
Oh great , governor .
Thanks . ” [ 6 ]
Not only did Dennis Wolff attempt to ban rbGH - free labels , but OCA points out that he has “ also worked to deprive communities the right to ban toxic sewage sludge , factory farms , and GMOs . ” [ 7 ]
The most popular site for watching video on the Internet may soon get Hollywood ’s most popular movies .
Google Inc.'s
YouTube is in talks with several major studios -- including Sony Pictures , Warner Bros. and Lionsgate -- about streaming movies when the DVDs become available in rental stores and kiosks , according to sources familiar with the situation .
The move represents a bold gambit for the entertainment giants , which have been cautious in embracing the Internet out of fear it would disrupt relationships with major retailers and undercut lucrative DVD sales .
But with DVD sales in a cliff dive and the growing popularity of websites such as Hulu , where TV shows and second - tier movies are available to watch free of charge , Hollywood finally appears to be embracing the notion that the Internet could become a major venue for movie distribution .

Movie theater attendance is n’t growing , and the studios are finding it tougher to attract paying audiences that are large enough to justify the huge expense of producing and marketing their films , which increasingly are forced to compete against video games and other forms of entertainment .
Despite YouTube ’s dominance in Internet video , several companies already offer online movie rentals and downloads , including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc .
The fast - growing DVDs - by - mail service Netflix also streams films online .
But with 437 million visitors a month , YouTube is the gorilla in the Internet video market , and any studio that aligns with it will be in an advantaged position against rivals .
This means Google might finally be able to make YouTube profitable .
And for the studios , it might be a way to win back the lost revenue from declining DVD sales .
YouTube has been in discussions with studio executives for several months , exploring options , said people with knowledge of the matter , which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal .
The website initially proposed an advertising - supported model in which the movies would be offered to online viewers free of charge .
Hollywood pushed for a more traditional pay model , however , in which films would be available to buy as a download or a $ 3.99 rental .
YouTube has had a contentious history with Hollywood , beginning with its roots as a repository for illicitly copied television and movie content .
It pinged the entertainment industry ’s radar in 2005 when “ Lazy Sunday , ” a short “ Saturday Night Live ” clip , was posted on the site and racked up millions of views before being removed .

Partly on the back of copyrighted material -- comedy shows , sports and movie clips -- the video - hosting site grew wildly popular .
But that popularity was anathema to an angry Hollywood , which viewed YouTube as turning a blind eye to piracy .
“ With a combination of ignorance , naivete and arrogance , they set off the immune system of the entire industry , ” said Jeffrey Lindsay , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. , who said the young site was making enemies when it should have been making allies .
“ They missed a golden opportunity to get the industry on their side , ” he said .
The enmity came to a head in 2007 when media giant Viacom initiated a $ 1 - billion lawsuit against YouTube over copyright concerns , saying the site was “ brazenly exploiting ” its position to make money off of the hard work of the entertainment industry .
The suit is ongoing .
But since that time , YouTube has sought to clean up its act .

In an effort to become less like a rowdy digital saloon and more like a quiet online movie theater , the site is hoping to woo Hollywood back , premium content in tow .
To create a welcoming environment , YouTube has tightened rules about language and racy content and has built special screening areas -- such as its “ Shows ” section -- that safely house its growing library of studio - produced movies and television .
As a result , Hollywood appears to be gradually overcoming its fear of the Google boogeyman .
Sony Pictures began to experiment this spring with offering older full - length movies and television shows , including “ Spider - Man ” and “ News Radio . ”
The shows were free and supported by advertising .
In August , YouTube hosted a full - length version of Sony ’s 1984 film “ Ghostbusters , ” which attracted about 680,000 viewers in a week .
YouTube has pointed to the screening as illustrating the site ’s power as a major outlet for mainstream content .
Disney / ABC Television Group began putting clips on YouTube this spring : video highlights and interviews with the stars of its most popular prime - time shows , including “ Desperate Housewives , ” “ Lost ” and “ Grey ’s Anatomy , ” as well as sports highlights from its cable sports network , ESPN .
Time Warner Inc. this month started offering video clips from its CNN news coverage and its Cartoon Network and Warner Bros .
Television shows , such as “ Gossip Girl . ”

YouTube has been courting more professionally produced content , in part to attract advertisers who are reluctant to place their brands next to amateur videos of karaoke and wedding pratfalls .
But the Internet ad business has been in a tailspin for more than a year .
Online ad revenue shrank during the second quarter to $ 13.9 billion from $ 14.7 billion , down 5 % from a year earlier , according to technology consulting firm IDC .
And the worst is n’t over : IDC expects it to continue hemorrhaging for at least the rest of the year .
Offering movie rentals would provide a fresh source of revenue for YouTube -- and push the site closer to something that , despite an audience that sometimes even dwarfs the viewership of network TV shows , has eluded it : profitability .

Conservative economic historian Bruce Bartlett has just released a new book entitled The New American Economy : The Failure of Reaganomics and a New Way Forward .
Here ’s a short blurb from Amazon on the thesis of the book :
As a domestic policy advisor to Ronald Reagan , Bruce Bartlett was one of the originators of Reaganomics , the supply - side economic theory that conservatives have clung to for decades .
In The New American Economy , Bartlett goes back to the economic roots that made Impostor a bestseller and abandons the conservative dogma in favor of a policy strongly based on what ’s worked in the past .
Marshalling compelling history and economics , he explains how economic theories that may be perfectly valid at one moment in time under one set of circumstances tend to lose validity over time because they are misapplied under different circumstances .
Bartlett makes a compelling , historically - based case for large tax increases , once anathema to him and his economic allies .
In The New American Economy , Bartlett seeks to clarify a compelling and way forward for the American economy .
It may surprise you to learn that I was contacted recently by a publicist for Mr. Bartlett ’s book about doing a Q&A interview with him to explore the themes he sets out in the book .
I should be receiving a copy soon and will let everyone know when the Q&A is scheduled to go down .
In the meanwhile , please check out a new blog post that Bartlett just wrote that contains a lot of excellent context on what drove him to write the book .
Here ’s just a taste :
I continue to believe that what the supply - siders did was good for the economy , good for the country and good for the advancement of economic science .
The best economists in the country were pretty clueless about our economic problems during the Carter years .
It was widely asserted that the money supply had no meaningful effect on inflation , that marginal tax rates had no incentive effects , and that it would take decades or another Great Depression to break the back of inflation …
During the George W. Bush years , however , I think SSE became distorted into something that is , frankly , nuts –the ideas that there is no economic problem that cannot be cured with more and bigger tax cuts , that all tax cuts are equally beneficial , and that all tax cuts raise revenue .
These incorrect ideas led to the enactment of many tax cuts that had no meaningful effect on economic performance .
Many were just give - aways to favored Republican constituencies , little different , substantively , from government spending .
What , after all , is the difference between a direct spending program and a refundable tax credit ?
Nothing , really , except that Republicans oppose the first because it represents Big Government while they support the latter because it is a “ tax cut . ”
I think these sorts of semantic differences cloud economic decisionmaking rather than contributing to it .
As a consequence , we now have a tax code riddled with tax credits and other tax schemes of dubious merit , expiring provisions that never expire , and an income tax that fully exempts almost on half of tax filers from paying even a penny to support the general operations of the federal government .
The supply - siders are to a large extent responsible for this mess , myself included .
We opened Pandora ’s Box when we got the Republican Party to abandon the balanced budget as its signature economic policy and adopt tax cuts as its raison d’être .
In particular , the idea that tax cuts will “ starve the beast ” and automatically shrink the size of government is extremely pernicious .
Read the whole thing .
h/t Sully
If I understand him correctly , Bartlett is making two very sound and interconnected points , i.e. , ( a ) marginal tax rates used to be very high and by dropping them we jumpstarted the American economy , and ( b ) just because we cut taxes when marginal rates were ridiculously high , this does n’t justify the ongoing Republican obsession with tax cuts always being the panacea to solve all our ills .
In essence , he ’s saying that just because something worked once , we ’d be stupid to simply assume that it will always work when used again and again .
Good stuff !
I ca n’t wait to read the book !
MY husband and I were riding our bikes not long ago , and when we were about a mile from home , we did our usual thing .
We call it the sprint to the finish : ride as hard and as fast as we can until we reach our driveway , racing to see who could get there first .
We pulled up , slammed on our brakes and hopped off our bikes .
A neighbor was walking by and said , “ How did you do that ? ”
“ I just put on my brakes , ” I told him .
No , he said , he meant how could we just stop like that without cooling down ?
Strange as it might seem , that had never occurred to me .
But the cool - down is enshrined in training lore .
It ’s in physiology textbooks , personal trainers often insist on it , fitness magazines tell you that you must do it  and some exercise equipment at gyms automatically includes it .
You punch in the time you want to work out on the machine and when your time is up , the machine automatically reduces the workload and continues for five minutes so you can cool down .
Mr ElBaradei is accused of holding back information about Iranian concealment France has repeated its accusation that the UN nuclear watchdog is hiding facts about Iran 's atomic activity , just as the body 's head issued a strong denial .
International Atomic Energy Agency head Mohamed ElBaradei said he had been dismayed by the " politically motivated and totally baseless accusations " .
A foreign ministry spokeswoman insisted Paris had proof that key information was left out of the latest IAEA report .
The missing details had been included in a technical briefing , she said .
In a rare public dispute at the normally discrete IAEA 's discussions , Mr ElBaradei lashed out at certain members which he did not name .
" I am dismayed by the allegations of some member states , which have been fed to the media , that information has been withheld from the Board .
" These allegations are politically motivated and totally baseless , " he said at the opening of the regular IAEA governors ' meeting in Vienna .
" Such attempts to influence the work of the ( IAEA 's non-proliferation inspectorate ) and undermine its independence and objectivity are in violation of ... the IAEA Statute and should therefore cease forthwith . "
Concealment
In the main part of his speech , Mr ElBaradei summed up the situation between Iran and the IAEA as a " stalemate " and he urged Tehran to " substantially re-engage " with the UN body .
He referred to an inquiry into weaponisation which Iran has blocked , its refusal to suspend enrichment as demanded by the UN Security Council and its failure to adopt an IAEA protocol permitting inspections away from declared nuclear sites .
A week earlier French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said the UN watchdog had delayed publication of " important " annexes about enrichment in its most recent report .
Israel said that the latest IAEA report did not reflect all the agency knew , in respect of Iranian concealment and deception .
After Mr ElBaradei's rejection of this in Vienna , France 's foreign ministry spokeswoman Christine Pages said : " France attended a technical briefing at the agency .
All of this information was not reflected in the report . "

The term world population commonly refers to the total number of living humans on Earth at a given time .
As of 15 October 2009 , the Earth 's population is estimated by the United States Census Bureau to be 6.791 billion .
[ 1 ]
The world population has been growing continuously since the end of the Black Death around 1400 .
[2 ]
There were also short term falls at other times due to plague , for example in the mid 17th century ( see graph ) .
The fastest rates of world population growth ( above 1.8 % ) were seen briefly during the 1950s then for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s ( see graph ) .
According to population projections , world population will continue to grow until around 2050 .
The 2008 rate of growth has almost halved since its peak of 2.2 % per year , which was reached in 1963 .
World births have levelled off at about 134 million per year , since their peak at 163 - million in the late 1990s , and are expected to remain constant .
However , deaths are only around 57 million per year , and are expected to increase to 90 million by the year 2050 .
Because births outnumber deaths , the world 's population is expected to reach about 9 billion by the year 2040 .
Human Population - Global Issues
" Go Forth And Multiply ! "
That 's what the human population has successfully been doing for thousands and thousands of years , expanding , exploring , migrating , conquering , utilizing , evolving , civilizing , industrializing , and now , destroying the very land upon which we live .
Many feel ( as has been the case throughout history ) that the major international wars to be fought in the future will continue to be over natural resources .
Power conflicts and self - interest will perhaps mean that there will be gross violation of basic rights and death or misery for millions of innocent people .
Throughout history , most wars have had trade and resources at their core ( leading to ideological battles ) fueled by imperialistic motives .
In the future , while this pattern is likely to continue , as resources get depleted and wasted in these wars ( hot and cold ) , additional conflicts and contention will arise through access to even more limited resources .
Many of us have grown up learning and being told that 6 billion is too much and this " over population " is primarily impacting the planet 's ability to cope .
But is that really the case ?
Sure , the planet is facing incredible stress .
But how much of that is due to large populations , and how much is based on other factors , such as how we choose to live , how we produce , consume and waste our resources ?
The poor are numerous , but as we shall see , consume far less resources of the planet , for example .
Studies point to ecological limits to sustain people , but these limits can be different , based on the way we consume resources etc so it is hard to say for sure what over population means let alone if we are at some threshold , below , or above it .
The information understood so far provides valuable insights and is very important to consider , nonetheless .
Yet , the figure of 6 billion and literature about over - population naturally looks to the poor regions where there are high populations and environmental degradation as the problem .
In the poverty section of this web site , we see numerous causes of poverty , and many are found in unfair economic and trade agreements from wealthier nations and institutions .
While it might be an oversimplification to say the poor are victims , a lot of poverty , if not the majority is caused by factors which the poor themselves often have no control or choice over .
Yet , at the same time the poor seem to get the blame for burdening the planet .
Is this the case ?
While the concern for the environment and the planet 's health is usually the central issue here , is there a risk of addressing the issue in ways that may not get to the root causes of any problems that are perceived to require serious attention ?
This section of the globalissues.org web site attempts to look at and introduce some of these issues .
Overpopulation is a condition where an organism 's numbers exceed the carrying capacity of its habitat .
In common parlance , the term usually refers to the relationship between the human population and its environment , the Earth . [ 1 ]
Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population , but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources .
It also depends on the means of resources used and distributed throughout the population .
If a given environment has a population of 10 individuals , but there is food or drinking water enough for only 9 , then in a closed system where no trade is possible , that environment is overpopulated ; if the population is 100 but there is enough food , shelter , and water for 200 for the indefinite future , then it is not overpopulated .
Overpopulation can result from an increase in births , a decline in mortality rates due to medical advances , from an increase in immigration , or from an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources .
It is possible for very sparsely - populated areas to be overpopulated , as the area in question may have a meager or non-existent capability to sustain human life ( e.g. the middle of the Sahara Desert or Antarctica ) .
The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include clean water , clean air , food , shelter , warmth , and other resources necessary to sustain life .
If the quality of human life is addressed , there may be additional resources considered , such as medical care , education , proper sewage treatment and waste disposal .
Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources , leading to a diminished quality of life . [ 2 ] .
If resources required to sustain the organism are being consumed by the organism faster than the resource can be renewed , then the organism is overpopulated .
For example , humans are consuming fossil fuels much faster than the planet can renew them and those resources are currently required to produce and distribute the necessary quantity of food to feed the population , and therefore humans are overpopulated on Earth .
Although Amazon 's Kindle e-reader has become the first major hit in its category – and the best - selling product in Amazon 's entire store this year – it does have its drawbacks .
One of the biggest is that its wireless connection to the Kindle store works only in the U.S .
That changes on October 19 , when Amazon begins shipping a new version of the Kindle that can be used to purchase and download books in over 100 countries .
The new version , with the snappy name of " Kindle with US and International Wireless , " will sell for $ 280 and can be pre-ordered now .
The current version will still be for sale , and Amazon is dropping the price from $ 300 to $ 260 .
The bigger Kindle DX is unchanged .
As Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explains it in a phone interview with Wired , " The two Kindles are identical , except for the radio . "
The new device does not sync with Sprint , which was previously the exclusive supplier for Amazon 's Whispernet technology .
Instead , it works with AT&T 's wireless network , which has the global reach that Amazon needs for its international plans .
This seems to push Sprint out of the long - term Kindle picture .
Wo n't everybody want to spend 20 bucks more on the AT&T version that that works all around the world , even if a cross - border trip is n't on the immediate horizon ?
" I would ! " says Bezos .
Indeed , having a Kindle that downloads from overseas means you can get your favorite newspapers and magazines delivered instantly , at the same cost you pay at home .
It makes the Kindle a travel guide , too :
If you want the lowdown on a Kyoto temple , or are wondering where to get the best fries in Amsterdam , you can download a relevant guide on the spot .
And for the first time , the Lonely Planet series will be sold on Kindle , along with the previously available travel books from Frommer , Rick Steves and Michelin .
No wonder the Amazon press release has an ecstatic quote from AT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson and not a word from Sprint honcho ( and vanity TV pitchman ) Dan Hesse .
Other unhappy people may include owners of current Kindles who travel internationally :
Their gadgets can't be switched to AT&T versions .
Bezos suggests that they give away or resell their Kindles ( first - gen Kindles are currently going for around $ 190 ) and buy new ones .
Those who bought a Kindle in the last 30 days can exchange them for the international version .
Maybe the biggest gripes will come from those who bought the most expensive Kindle , the supersized DX .
Imagine sitting in a Paris bistro with your US - download - only $ 490 DX and watching some tourist with a puny $ 280 Kindle filling up with newspapers , Michelin guides and the latest Michael Connelly thriller .
The international Kindle is not just for Americans traveling abroad .
Bezos says that Amazon 's sales patterns show a sizable demand for English language books in countries that speak other languages .
Until now , readers in those countries have found such books to be expensive and hard to find , not to mention slow to arrive after being ordered .
The global Kindle will make the process cheap and instant .
Amazon staved off copyright problems by negotiating an arrangement with English language publishers that pays royalties depending on the territory of purchase .
( If you buy a copy of The Perfect Thing in London , for instance , the UK publisher Ebury press gets the sale , instead of US publisher Simon & Schuster . )
Still , the rights clearances are n't yet comprehensive ; of the 350,000 books in the Kindle store , only around 200,000 will be available in some countries .
While I had Bezos on the phone , I asked him about some other e-book issues .
He would n't comment on Amazon 's filing against the the Google Books settlement .
Nor would he respond to Google 's comment that Amazon was being hypocritical in its objection .
He also had nothing to add to the apology he gave to Kindle users for the company 's abrupt and scary retraction of copies of a Orwell 's 1984 .
But he did have a response to a recent strategy employed by publishers of books expected to be mega- sellers , like Teddy Kennedy 's True Compass and Sarah Palin 's upcoming memoir , Going Rogue .
The respective publishers think that withholding lower - cost Kindle versions for a few months will boost hardcover sales .
Bezos believes this is short - sighted , and that offering a book on Kindle increases the total sales .
He notes that when an author comes out with a new book , he or she will do publicity or get reviews .
" When you 're on NPR and someone goes on their Kindle to look for the book , it 's your chance to make that sale , " he said .
" They wo n't remember in a month or two . "
As proof of the way that the Kindle has changed reader habits , Bezos brings up an amazing statistic .
Earlier this year , he startled people by revealing that of books available on both Kindle and paper versions , 35 percent of copies sold by Amazon were Kindle versions .
Now , he says , the number is up to 48 percent .
This means that a lot of people have bought Kindles ( Amazon wo n't reveal the figures ) and that Kindle owners buy a lot of books .
Bezos has n't missed the buzz about upcoming digital tablets .
He says that Amazon is hard at work making software apps ( like the one already available for the iPhone ) that will extend the Kindle system to other devices .
He 's also still open " in principle " to rival e-reader manufacturers who wish to use the Kindle store to provide content .
But he feels that while people may read on phones and web - surfing tablets , the dedicated e-reading device will keep improving .
" We want Kindle to be the best way to read , " Bezos says .
And now , people can read books that they download outside the US .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Support for the war in Afghanistan is at an all - time low , according to a new national poll .
U.S. troops participate in a ceremony commemorating the eighth anniversary of 9/11 in Bagram , Afghanistan .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday morning indicates that 39 percent of Americans favor the war in Afghanistan , with 58 percent opposed to the mission .
Support is down from 53 percent in April , marking the lowest level since the start of the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan soon after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The poll suggests that 23 percent of Democrats support the war .
That number rises to 39 percent for independents and 62 percent for Republicans .
" Most of the recent erosion in support has come from within the GOP , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" Unlike Democrats and independents , Republicans still favor the war , but their support has slipped eight points in just two weeks . "
How does Afghanistan compares with Iraq ?
" The Afghan war is almost as unpopular as the Iraq war has been for the past four years , " Holland said , noting that support for the war in Iraq first dropped to 39 percent in June 2005 and has generally remained in the low to mid-30s since .
The poll 's release comes after the two deadliest months for the U.S. military in Afghanistan .
In August , 48 U.S. troops were killed in the fighting , surpassing the previous high of 45 the month before .
President Obama has called Afghanistan a " war of necessity " and has placed great emphasis on defeating the Taliban and al Qaeda militants operating there and in Pakistan .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to approve sending thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan to deal with the growing threat from roadside bombs , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said last week .
Gates has concluded there is not enough manpower or equipment in Afghanistan to protect U.S. troops from such bombs , Morrell said .
Watch U.S. senators on the next U.S. moves in Afghanistan »
The CNN / Opinion Research poll was conducted Friday through Sunday , with 1,012 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

( Nicole : ) Our very own CSpanJunkie attended Rep. Rick Larsen 's town hall meeting on health care in Everett , Washington .
By all accounts , it was n't one of the crazed mob scenes they love showing us on the cable channels .
However , the addition of decorum did not bring with it the addition of sense .
And in response to one person 's dutiful recitation of misinformation , courtesy of the right wing , Rep. Larsen retorted with a classic line I think should be part of every Democratic congressman 's repertoire :
CITIZEN : I have two real concerns about the nationalized health care insurance .
Why are all Americans forced into a government - run health care and insurance plan when only 46 million out of 312 million are uninsured ?
Do you want me to break down how those insured are found ?
12 million are illegal immigrants , 17 million earn $ 50,000 plus and choose not to have inurance .
8.8 million without insurance for four months or less…or more because they ’re between … they ’re unemployed and between jobs .
8.2 are chronically uninsured .
That ’s a total of 46 million people .
I ’d be willing for the government to buy insurance policies for the 8.2 million chronically uninsured , but the other 37.8 million are not the responsibility of the American citizens and I will …I ’m not willing … and I am unwilling to throw my present health care away for them .
LARSEN : Thanks .
Thanks , Jim .
Thanks for your input and your comments .
With regards to the first comment about being forced to buy health care , I ’ll say it again , not ‘ till I ’m blue in the face , I may get cold enough and I ’ll look blue in the face here tonight , but it wo n’t be until I ’m blue in the face .
The bill does not force anybody to buy health care , to change … to change … .
I ’m sorry , the bill does not force anybody to change their health care plan .
If you ’re in a plan , you will not be forced into the public option .
You will not be forced into the health insurance exchange .
Now folks will say that ’s not true , but I ’ve got facts on my side and you ’ve got Glenn Beck on your side .
It ’s just not going to play off that way .
Bravo , Rep. Larsen ... let 's keep marginalizing Beck and his ilk in the exact same way over and over until even these Fox News viewers are too embarrassed to cite him .
Ohio is to try again to execute a man convicted of murder after his death by lethal injection was botched earlier this week when technicians spent two hours in a futile hunt for a vein able to take a needle .
At one point , Romell Broom , who was convicted of rape and murder of a teenage girl 25 years ago , tried to help prison officers find a suitable vein by moving around and flexing his muscles .
The prison governor later thanked him for his cooperation .
What critics of the death penalty are describing as the " virtually unprecedented " failure of the attempt to execute Broom , 53 , has again raised questions over its continued use in the US .
Concerns have also been raised over a case in Texas in which a man is facing execution despite an admission by the judge and prosecutor in his trial that they were lovers .
Prison officers described how , after about an hour of hunting for a suitable vein , Broom helped them by turning on to his side , by moving rubber tubing along his arm and by flexing his hand and muscles .
At one point , technicians found what appeared to be a suitable vein but it collapsed as they inserted a needle , apparently because of past drug use .
Broom , who was convicted of kidnapping , raping and killing 14 - year - old Tryna Middleton , became so distressed that he lay on his back and covered his face with both hands .
One of the execution team handed him a toilet roll to wipe away tears .
The prison director , Terry Collins , contacted Ohio 's governor , Ted Strickland , to tell him of the difficulties .
The governor issued a temporary reprieve .
Collins later thanked the condemned man for what he said was the respect he showed toward the execution team and for the way he endured the ordeal .
One of Broom 's lawyers , Adele Shank , who witnessed the failed execution , said her client was clearly in pain .
" It was obviously a flawed process , " she said .
" He survived this execution attempt , and they really can't do it again .
It was cruel and unusual punishment . "
Broom 's legal team has now asked Ohio 's supreme court to cancel the execution but state officials today said they will attempt it again next week .
The Death Penalty Information Centre in Washington said that the botched attempt is the first of its kind since the electric chair failed to kill a murderer , Willie Francis , in Louisiana in 1946 .
Francis argued that a second attempt to execute him would be unconstitutional but the supreme court ruled otherwise and he was electrocuted the following year .
" This is virtually unprecedented , " said the DPIC 's director , Richard Dieter , said of the Broom case .
" The public in the US are increasingly jaded about the death penalty .
There is evidence of innocent people executed , prosecutors sleeping with judges and being ignored , failed executions .
At some point enough is going to be enough and even people who support the death penalty are going to let it go " .
There are fresh questions about the legal process around the death penalty in Texas , which carries out by far the largest number of executions in the US .
The state 's court of criminal appeals has turned down an appeal from a man on the brink of execution who said there were questions over the fairness of his trial after it was revealed that the judge and prosecutor kept secret that they were lovers .
Charles Hood was convicted of the 1989 robbery and murder of two people .
The appeals court said that the defence should have raised the issue of the affair at the original appeal .
But defence lawyers said that it was no more than a rumour at the time and was only confirmed by another official in the prosecutor 's office hours before Hood was originally to have been executed last year .
The two people involved later confirmed their affair .
One of Hood 's lawyers , David Dow , called the decision " gutless " and the American Bar Association ethics committee described it as a " blot on the Texas judiciary " .
Texas is also grappling with revelations that it may have executed an innocent man five years ago after he was convicted of murdering his three children through arson on the basis of deeply flawed " scientific " evidence that has been compared to the stuff of witch trials .
We ’ve heard that the eviction attempt will take place tomorrow Friday at 12 noon .
There ’s only one response possible : mobilise , asap , as many as possible .
If you can get to the Island go .
See the travel board for advice .
Email savevestas@gmail.com if you can offer transport to others .
If you ca n’t get to the Island and had protest plans in place , bring them forward , mobilise now .
Email Ed Miliband and tell him to step in as an earnest of his commitment to renewable energy .
Oh , and creating green jobs .
Quentin Tarantino sauntered onto celluloid in the mid-1990s as a Natural Born Thriller , the boy - man who was going to stab adrenaline straight into the heart of American cinema .
The movies he wrote and directed were highly stylized ballet dances of torture , haemorraghing internal organs , and rat - a - tat - tat pop culture monologues about Madonna ’s vagina , the Brady Bunch , and what they call a Big Mac in France .
( It ’s Le Big Mac ) .
He showed extreme cruelty in extreme close - up and – somehow – made the audience laugh with him through the screams .
But there were always dark questions underneath the guffaws and applause – and his new film , ‘ Inglorious Basterds ’ , sucks them to the surface .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The story of Tarantino ’s rise is a film geek ’s fantasy - screenplay .
Born to a single mother in Los Angeles , he dropped out of school at sixteen , got a job at a video store , and marinated himself in the history of film .
He absorbed everything from Lucio Fulci ’s Italian horror - fests to Preston Sturges ’ one - liners to John Woo ’s Hong Kong shoot - outs .
And as he took them in , they churned inside his brain – and spilled out , reassembled and regenerated , into a string of his own screenplays .
The first to be made was ‘ Reservoir Dogs ’ in 1994 .
Like all his films , it took an old stock genre premise – an armed robbery goes wrong , and in the aftermath the gang tries to figure out which of them is an undercover cop – and made it twitch back to life .
He scrambled the chronology , poured hot sauce onto the dialogue , and made the bleeding after a shooting slow and real .
Trapped together in a bare warehouse , the characters slowly destroy themselves .
In the most famous scene , Mr Blonde – played by Michael Madsen – captures a cop and tortures him to get him to give up the identity of the fink .
As he dances to the old cheese - hit ‘ Stuck In The Middle With You ’ , he hacks off the cop ’s ear , and douses him with petrol , threatening to burn him alive .
It ’s entrancing and repulsive all at once – and one of the most disturbing scenes in cinema .
At the time , many critics recoiled , saying this was sadism served up as style .
The film was even banned on video in Britain for several years .
But I was inclined to defend the film : I thought this violence was more real and repulsive than the glib gore - free massacres of an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle .
When these characters bleed , they really scream .
When they feel pain , you really flinch .
Here was a director showing violence as it really is .
But since then , Tarantino has enthusiastically proved his critics right , and his defenders wrong .
The moral vision of Reservoir Dogs turns out to have been something well - meaning viewers projected onto it : Tarantino really does think violence is “ like , cool . ”
He has been systematically squandering his cinematic talent ever since – in ways that reflect disturbingly on us , the viewers .
He has turned suffering into a merry joke .
From ‘ Pulp Fiction ’ to ‘ Kill Bill ’ , he encourages the audience to chortle at torture and mutilation and anal rape .
A typical punchline is – whoops !
– a man being shot in the face .
Where there should be a gag reflex , he gives us a gag .
In ‘ Inglorious Basterds ’ , a group of Jews undercover in Germany torture and scalp Nazis , and he gets the viewer to roar with laughter as people are carved up , alive and howling .
“ Violence in the movies can be cool , ” he says .
“ It ’s just another colour to work with .
When Fred Astaire dances , it does n’t mean anything .
Violence is the same .
It does n’t mean anything .
It ’s a colour . ”
He scorns anyone who tries to see simulated violence as having meaning .
With a laugh , he says : “ John Woo ’s violence has a very insightful view as to how the Hong Kong mind works because with 1997 approaching and blah blah blah .
I do n’t think that ’s why he ’s doing it .
He ’s doing it because he gets a kick out of it . ”
Praising Stanley Kubrik ’s direction of ‘ A Clockwork Orange ’ , he says : “ He enjoyed the violence a little too much .
I ’m all for that . ”
In the slightly pretentious language of postmodernism , he is trying to separate the sign ( movie violence ) from the signified ( real violence ) – leaving us floating in a sea of meaningless signs that refer to nothing but themselves and the sealed - off history of cinema .
What ’s wrong with this vision ?
Why does it make me so queasy ?
I do n’t believe works of art should be ennobling .
I do n’t believe the heroes should be virtuous , or that bad characters should get their comeuppance .
It can show deeply violent and deeply cruel people , and tell us that – as in real life – they can be charismatic and successful and never pay a price for their cruelty .
But what it should never do is tell us that human suffering itself is trivial .
It should never turn pain into a punch - line .
Violence has particular power on film precisely because it involuntarily activates our powers of empathy .
We imagine ourselves , as an unthinking reflex , into the agony .
This is the most civilising instinct we have : to empathize with suffering strangers .
( It competes , of course , with all our more base instincts ) .
Any work of art that denies this sense – that is based on subverting it – will ultimately be sullying .
No , I ’m not saying it makes people violent .
But it does leave the viewer just a millimetre more morally corroded .
Laughing at simulated torture – and even cheering it on , as we are encouraged to through all of Tarantino ’s later films – leaves a moral muscle just a tiny bit more atrophied .
You can see this in the responses of Tarantino himself .
Not long after 9/11 , he said : “ It did n’t affect me because there ’s , like , a Hong Kong action movie … called Purple Storm and they work in a whole big thing in the plot that they blow up a skyscraper . ”
It ’s a case - study in atrophy of moral senses : to brag you were n’t moved by the murder of two and half thousand actual people , because you ’d already seen it simulated in a movie .
Only somebody who has never seen violence – who sees the world as made of celluloid – can respond like this .
Tarantino ’s films are n’t even sadistic .
Sadists take human suffering seriously ; that ’s why they enjoy it .
No : Tarantino is morally empty , seeing a shoot - out as akin to dancing cheek - to - cheek .
He sees violence as nothing .
Compare his oeuvre to the work of a genuine cinematic sadist – Alfred Hitchcock – and you see the difference .
Precisely because Hitchcock enjoyed inflicting pain , the pain is always authentic , and it is never emptied of its own inner horror .
And yet , and yet …
I have to admit that part of me loves Tarantino ’s films .
The scene in ‘ Pulp Fiction ’ where John Travolta and Uma Thurman dance the twist in a 1950s - style diner , and later when he has to stab adrenaline into her heart after she ODs , are burned onto my brain , even though I have refused to watch the film for more than a decade .
There are scenes in ‘ Inglorious Basterds ’ of perfect tension .
This man knows how to make a scene work than almost any director working today .
But I ca n’t forget – it sees the Holocaust as just another spaghetti Western , and one where the suggested solution is more torture , coming from the victims this time .
Can you love a film even while you are repulsed by its moral vision , or lack of it ?
This is a question that goes right back to the birth of cinema ( and beyond ) .
The three greatest silent films are all explicit hymns of praise for totalitarianism .
‘ The Birth of a Nation ’ champions the Ku Klux Klan , ‘ Battleship Potemkin ’ hymns for Bolshevism , and ‘ The Triumph of the Will ’ is a paean to the Nazis .
They are ravishing and repellent all at once – and I defy anyone to watch them and not get swept up in their power , even as your frontal lobes yell : “ Stop ! Danger ! ”
But aesthetics and the rest of life are not entirely separable spheres – and anybody who claims they are is simply posing .
We do n’t leave our moral senses at the door when we go to the movies , or pick up a novel , or go to a gallery .
We feel such tension in Tarantino ’s movies because the good and sane part of us does n’t want the violence to come – while the debased part of us is cheering it on .
That ’s a moral conflict underpinning the aesthetics ; by denying it is there , Tarantino is wilfully misunderstanding the effect of his films on their audiences .
The artists who have claimed their work was purely aesthetic were either frivolous , psychopathic , or lying .
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov – who I love – claimed in the introduction to ‘ Bend Sinister ’ that “ politics and economics , atomic bombs , primitive and abstract art forms , the entire Orient , symptoms of ‘ thaw ’ in Soviet Russia , the Future of Mankind , and so on , leave me supremely indifferent . ”
He was writing in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis , when he and everybody he knows came within a few hours of dying in a nuclear war .
How could he be “ supremely indifferent ” to that prospect ?
How can you revere aesthetics and not mind if every aesthetic object you love is incinerated ?
The answer is , of course , he was n’t indifferent .
If you read his letters , you find he worried about these issues at great length .
Similarly , I suspect Tarantino has deeper instincts beneath his life - is - a - grindhouse - flick pose .
He knows what he is saying is n’t – ca n’t – be true .
The tragedy of Tarantino is that he could have been so much more than the Schlock and Awe merchant that he has devolved into .
If he had stopped mistaking his DVD collection for a life , he – to borrow a phrase from a real film , etched with real pain – could ’ve been a contender .
When I remember the raw force of Reservoir Dogs , I still hope that he will .
It ’s not too late .
He could do it .
How about it , Quentin ?
Step out into the big world beyond celluloid , and use your incredible talent to tell stories about it .
As Mr Blonde says , “ Are you going to bark all day , little doggie – or are you going to bite ? ”

There was a diary on the Daily Kos rec list earlier today about how Bill Moyers was specific and on point about health care in America .
( note : the video was not available at that time )
Moyers was not shy , afraid , scared but he took the Democratic Party to task .
The main issue that stood out for me , Moyers blasting of the money and its influence that is running all through the Democratic Party .
Moyers took Rahm Emmanuel to task , as a corporate Democrat .
He explained and exposed that the money Obama will need for re-election is from the very entity that we are fighting against .
If we do n't pass meaningful health care reform , do n't put Ted Kennedy 's name on it .
If what we get because of the influence of heavy money in our party a very watered down bill , that is not health care reform .
And the ones that voted for Barack Obama and the Democrats will know it .
Part One
Part Two
Part Three
This video says it all , because we do have " two corporate parties , the Republicans and the Democrats " .
And the money that influence bad legislation in D.C. , always tend to win .
Let 's not let that happen this time .

On Wednesday morning I was on BBC Breakfast talking about Windows 7 , and each time I was on air I mentioned Ubuntu , the most popular version of the Linux operating system .
So were its devoted fans pleased ?
Quite the opposite , because in my second broadcast I committed an unpardonable sin .
In a rather clumsily phrased sentence - my only excuse is that it came in the middle of a rather stressful live technology demo - I suggested that Ubuntu was a minority sport only for dedicated enthusiasts .
Afterwards , one blogger transcribed my conversation with Bill Turnbull and Sian Williams :
RCJ : " There 's something called ' Ubuntu ' which is launched next week .
It 's a whole sort of little community of enthusiasts building operating systems for absolutely nothing and trying to persuade us that we do n't need to be in with the big boys but actually most computer users frankly they do n't want to bother with that sort of stuff they want something that 's there ... "
BT : " ... that everyone else uses .. "
RCJ : " Yes "
Now I do know - as plenty of angry messages pointed out - that Ubuntu has been around for a long time and what launches next week is an update .
But I should have also made it clear that Linux is not an amateur cottage industry , but a pretty substantial affair supporting a lot of firms that market the systems and teach customers to install and use them .
So when I was contacted by one such company , Canonical , I was glad to take up their offer to try out Ubuntu .
They sent over a Dell Inspiron Mini , loaded with " Karmic Koala " , as Ubuntu 9.10 is nicknamed .
Now we are going to have a fuller exploration of the system on this site next week , but in the 24 hours I 've had the Dell , I 've gathered some early impressions .
The first is that it starts up pretty rapidly - I timed it at 40 seconds compared with the 55 seconds the top of the range Sony Vaio X takes to boot Windows 7 - and that the desktop has a pleasingly simple look to it , especially once you 've replaced the offensively brown background with something more attractive .
The left hand side of the screen has a strip fulfilling the same purpose as the taskbar in Windows or the dock in Mac OS X , with quick access to key applications .
You are provided with a range of open source software , from Firefox to Open Office , and can go online to the Ubuntu Software Centre to seek out other applications .
Getting connected to my home network proved reasonably simple - though I struggled to see other machines and devices on my network .
I installed a few applications - including Skype , and a social networking application called Gwibber .
But when I tried to install a free open - source audio editing program , Audacity , it appeared more complex to get hold of an Ubuntu version than the one I 've used on a Mac .
I also gave up on attempting to use the music streaming service Spotify , after a warning that , as there was no Linux version , I would first need to get hold of something called Wine which allows you to run Windows apps .
Too much bother ...
Navigating around an unfamiliar system was fine once I 'd worked out that the Ubuntu logo in the top left hand corner of the screen took me home , and for all my simple computing needs - from word processing to e-mail to web browsing - I found Ubuntu pretty satisfactory .
But , even after some help from a Canonical advisor who came and installed a few add - ons such as Flash , I struggled to work out how I would organise photos , music and video with this system .
So would I actively seek to install Ubuntu or any other Linux variant on a machine I already owned ?
To be frank , no , because it would not make my computing life any simpler and more pleasurable than it is now .
But getting a small cheap netbook would be another matter entirely , and the big hope for the Linux community is that more companies will follow Dell 's lead in selling computers with Ubuntu pre-installed .
Mind you , some netbook manufacturers who 've already found a degree of resistance to Linux netbooks have reverted to XP and are now more likely to look at Windows 7 than anything else .
Faced with such consumer inertia it's hard to see Linux making much progress in boosting its miniscule market share .
But remember , the future of computing is mobile - and in that new market for operating systems everything is still to play for .
Risking another pasting from its supporters , I 'll predict that Ubuntu will remain a very niche product - but it 's Google 's Android which could bring open - source to the mass consumer market .
The World Health Organization estimates that a worldwide production capacity of 3 billion doses of pandemic H1N1 vaccines will be used to prevent the outbreak and spread of the 2009 H1N1 flu , or “ swine flu , ” as it is better known .
This ambitious plan for widespread vaccine use , albeit inadequate for a total population of 6.8 billion people , has drawn criticism regarding the vaccine ’s safety , and the use and potential use of vaccine adjuvants .
In the alternative health community , chiropractor Ginger Mills , DC , of Redwood City , is concerned that adjuvants , especially squalene , will be added to vaccines used in the U.S. , should the number of cases rise .
“ Squalene is an oil that is found in olives and in certain other foods , and is perfectly healthy when you ingest it — but when injected into the bloodstream , it can have adverse effects . ”
Adjuvants enhance or “ supercharge ” the immune response , reduce the number of vaccines needed , and allow supplies to last longer .
Currently , aluminum salts are the only approved vaccine adjuvants for use in the United States .
The use of adjuvants has been suspected , but not confirmed , in the development of illnesses in Gulf War veterans who may have received squalene - containing anthrax vaccines .
However , the current stock of U.S. swine flu vaccines does not contain adjuvants , according to Anne Schuchat , MD , in an informational video produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Schuchat does acknowledge that there is an emergency provision to use them — should the pandemic accelerate .
Adjuvants are being used in swine flu vaccines in countries outside of the United States , including Canada , Europe and Australia .
However , even though Canada is using an adjuvanted vaccine , it has also ordered 1.8 million doses of the unadjuvanted vaccine for use in pregnant women and children under the age of 3 .
Maine physician Meryl Nass , MD , has written widely on the use of vaccines .
“ If novel adjuvants do get added ( in the U.S. ) — only if conditions change — it would preclude the quick licensure process that took place for the licensed H1N1 vaccines .
Recipients would need to sign an informed consent for an experimental product , ” said Nass .
“ I do not believe they would be ‘ secretly ’ added . ”
The World Health Organization has tried to allay concerns about the vaccine and states that clinical trials suggest this vaccine is as safe as the seasonal influenza vaccines , and that most countries have vaccine monitoring systems in place .
Without specifically addressing the use of adjuvants , WHO states that any vaccine side effects are expected to be of short - term duration , such as injection site soreness , swelling and redness , and possibly , headache , fever and muscle aches .
However , WHO also has a disclaimer that “ even very large clinical trials will not be able to identify possible rare events that can occur when pandemic vaccines are administered to many millions of people . ”
With a pivotal and profitable role played by the pharmaceutical industry in vaccine production , Nass suggests that there is a lack of “ unconflicted data ” available about adjuvants .
“ Nearly all of the MF59 ( adjuvant ) data were derived from the manufacturer of MF59 , for example , ” said Nass .
“ It is more the lack of reliable data , and gives the impression that something is being hidden .
Those of us who are familiar with the subject are concerned that if these adjuvants were used en masse , we would face some bad outcomes .
The FDA has been sitting on them for 10 years , and usually , that means that the FDA is aware of significant problems . ”
Nass testified before Congress in 2001 that the FDA needed to make a decision on the safety of adjuvants , so manufacturers could know whether they could include them in vaccines or not .
“ It seems that the FDA and the manufacturers have been waiting for a pandemic to solve the problem for them , ” said Nass .
“ It was going to be avian flu — an adjuvanted vaccine for H5N1 avian flu was approved in many countries , but the disease never spread person to person .
Then swine flu came along , and Glaxo and Novartis got another bite at the cherry .
You see , once these adjuvants get into licensed products in the U.S. , they will become part of all sorts of novel vaccines for cancer and non-infectious diseases , whose antigens are waiting in the wings . ”
The adjuvant question may not be answered in this pandemic go - round either .
In the latest CDC FluView assessment of influenza activity in the United States , there is swine flu activity in 26 states — but many of the cases are mild and are not included in the count .
The U.S. government has ordered 195 million vaccines that will be distributed through coordination with states and distribution centers .
While the official influenza season began Oct. 4 , cases of swine flu appeared earlier — even in a number of pandemic experts themselves .
And when it becomes personal , the use of a vaccine may seem like a good idea .
Author of “ The Coming Plague , ” Laurie Garrett wrote in Newsweek about her September bout with swine flu , and described its symptoms as “ days of semi- delirium , muscle aches , fatigue , nausea , and stomach twisting . ”
Another pandemic expert and Google executive , Larry Brilliant , led the WHO team that was responsible for smallpox eradication in Southeast Asia and India .
Brilliant , a physician and epidemiologist , is now president of the Skoll Urgent Threats Fund , and recently became one of the expected 100 million Americans to develop the swine flu .
“ But while I was never sick enough to consider going to see my doctor or going to an ER , I would not wish this disease on anyone and I certainly would have preferred a vaccination to this teeth - rattling bug , ” wrote Brilliant on Huffington Post .
“ Most poignantly , even though I tried to stay isolated , I infected one of my children who also spent a lousy sweat - soaked , teeth - chattering week dancing with the swine .
No loving parent would ever want to spread this disease to his or her kids .
If the sole reason to get vaccinated were to prevent my spreading this disease to my family and community , that alone would make getting vaccinated an easy choice for me . ”

Last September , federal employees of an oil and gas royalty program were caught engaging in corruption , drug use and sexual misconduct with industry officials .
Well , it took a year , but troubles -- and general inefficiency -- finally killed the program .
NYT : The Interior secretary , Ken Salazar , told a House committee on Wednesday morning that he was phasing out the royalty - in - kind program administered by the agency ’s Minerals Management Service .
The program allows oil companies to pay the government in oil and gas rather than in cash for the right to drill on federal lands .
Recent audits have shown that the government failed to collect tens of millions of dollars in royalties owed under the program .
“ Clearly , the department ’s energy leasing and royalty programs have not been working as they should , and the American people have not been receiving the full benefits from these valuable assets , ” Mr. Salazar said in testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee .
You bet .
But it sure was fun .
As the NYT noted last year :
The report says that eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules — including golf , ski and paintball outings ; meals and drinks ; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert , a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game .
The investigation also concluded that several of the officials “ frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions , had used cocaine and marijuana , and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives . ”
The investigation separately found that the program ’s manager mixed official and personal business .
In sometimes lurid detail , the report also accuses him of having intimate relations with two subordinates , one of whom regularly sold him cocaine .
The program had plenty of problems itself .
A new GAO report says the royalty - in - kind set - up failed to collect at least $ 21 million in fees last year .
And , as the Times notes , another report found that oil companies may have misreported drilling revenue and underpaid $ 160 million in royalties in 2006 and 2007 .
The oil lobby disagrees with the decision .
API said in a statement that " terminating this straight - forward method of handling royalty payments runs the risk of raising administrative costs and adding additional layers of paperwork . "
Perhaps .
But maybe API just misses all the fun ?
" I 'm convinced the Goodyear Grand Prix S is a major contribution to road safety . "
The slogan first spoken by a hapless police commissioner in the 1970s rings in my ears every time I see a gizmo that claims to improve your life chances on a bike .
Reflectors on stalks ,
Tireflys , self - inflating lycra airbags : I 've bought most of them , and left them all in a cupboard after a week .
Perhaps one of the craziest is the Reevu cycle helmet , which was sold for a while at the start of the decade .
It had a little plastic mirror across the visor , which – through an arrangement of more curved mirrors running through the top of the helmet – reflected the image of what was behind you .
That 's a safety feature usually reserved for drivers .
There are several reasons why gadgets like this usually end up in the cupboard , and the Reevu illustrated them all .
It added bulk and weight to a standard design – something cyclists tend to be particularly reluctant to do .
Because of the mirror channel on top , it did n't look cool , especially when you put it beside a standard bike helmet costing the same amount or less .
And , when you started using it , it did n't work – it just kind of worked .
Many reviews and forums made similar points .
The helmet had to be positioned just so to get a view of the road .
The images in the mirror were too small to be useful .
The mirror was too dim .
It could be distracting .
Basically , it was OK , but not good enough to justify its existence .
Reevu went on manufacturing it for a while , and then gave up to concentrate on motorbike helmets .
But the thing is , I think the doubters were wrong .
My Reevu is not in the cupboard .
I use it whenever I ride .
After about a week of getting used to it , the effect was revelatory .
It was better than a driver 's mirror because it was wider and without any in - car obstructions .
Seeing behind you becomes second nature .
I can spot problems approaching long before they arrive .
I bought a spare one , and a spare spare one , because I hate the loss of assurance I feel whenever I cycle without it .
After a long time in the saddle , I sometimes even find myself glancing slightly upwards as I walk along the street , expecting to see what 's behind me .
Reevu tell me they plan to launch a new and improved version the year after next .
If they do , I 'd urge you to try it , and not just for a day .
I 'm convinced it 's a major contribution to road safety .

A top Republican senator introduced legislation Monday to block the Obama administration 's attempt to impose formal net neutrality rules , just hours after FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced he would seek groundbreaking new limits on ISPs — both wireline and wireless .
The new rules are intended to guarantee that citizens can use their choice of devices , services and applications , and to prevent ISPs from discriminating against services or creating high and low roads on the internet .
Supporters say net neutrality rules will protect consumers and sets fair rules for all .
But Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison is no fan .
She has expressed her reservations that the FCC 's move would suffocate internet innovation , a view shared by the telecom industry , which says such rules are stifling and unnecessary .
On Monday , she attached her amendment to a funding bill for the Interior Department .
The amendment is as simple as legislation gets :
The Federal Communications Commission shall not expend any funds from any account in fiscal year 2010 —
( 1 ) to implement any internet neutrality or network management principles ; or ( 2 ) to promulgate any rules relating to such principles .
Hutchison , a Texas gubernatorial candidate and the top Republican on the Senate Commerce , Science and Technology committee , was joined by five fellow Republicans : John Ensign ( Nevada ) , Sam Brownback ( Kansas ) , David Vitter ( Louisiana ) , Jim DeMint ( South Carolina ) and John Thune ( South Dakota ) .
While the amendment is unlikely to stop Obama 's drive to deliver on his campaign promise to back new limits on ISPs , it does show that the adoption of the rules will not be a bloodless fight .
" We must tread lightly when it comes to new regulations , " Hutchison said .
" Where there have been a handful of questionable actions in the past on the part of a few companies , the Commission and the marketplace have responded swiftly .
The case has simply not been made for what amounts to a significant regulatory intervention into a vibrant marketplace . "
The cases Hutchison refers to includes an ISP blocking internet telephone calls , Verizon prohibiting text messages based on their political content and Comcast blocking peer - to - peer traffic .
Oddly , Hutchison 's press release seems to define " net neutrality " as something the senator supports .
Net neutrality refers to policies that promote the internet as an open platform for innovation and economic growth , while discouraging intentional discrimination against particular content or applications .
These basic principles have been in place for years and have successfully spurred major advances in content , applications and performance with minimal government involvement .
But a Hutchison staff member , speaking on background , says the language is in keeping with the senator 's belief that the internet currently is open and working well , and that the market has fixed itself , after a small number of high - profile cases .
Genachowski's staff has already spoken with Hutchinson 's staff , offering to brief them on the details of their plan .
After that , the senator will decide whether to pursue the amendment further as the Senate takes up debate on the Interior bill later this week .

Suddenly Roland Burris has become one of the most important U.S. Senators in all the land .
That 's what can happen when a potentially historic piece of legislation like health care reform needs every vote it can get .
The Wall Street Journal has named Burris one of six key senators to watch as the battle moves to the Senate floor .
Why ?
Because Burris has said he 'll only vote for a reform bill if it includes the public option .
Now , that 's not exactly a reason for the Journal to get its undies in a bunch .
After all , Burris is n't the only senator to voice that opinion - though it 's a more commonly held principle in the House .
And Burris 's sentiments on the matter have been less wishy - washy than those of colleagues such as Jay Rockefeller and Bernie Sanders .
" A public option must be a central component of any health insurance reform legislation , " Burris wrote in an Op - Ed that appeared in the Chicago Tribune last week .
" The stakes are too high to settle for anything less . "
But Burris is one of the few , if not the only Senator , that does not have to please his constituents and worry about reelection .
He does n't have any constituents and it's nearly a foregone conclusion that he 's not getting reelected .
Still , it 's a little tough to take Burris having any importance - or even any say - in the matter considering how he gained ( and held ) his office .
After all , he 's still under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee .
And if it really comes down to his vote , the late - night comics will have a field day .
Local journalist and author Carol Felsenthal is already suggesting on Huffington Post a raft of deals that the White House could use to seduce Burris into backing down if need be - including help neutralizing the ethics committee or the promise of an ambassadorship .
Knowing Burris , he 'll enjoy the attention .
His office has already distributed the Wall Street Journal piece to reporters - with glee , certainly .
Roland Burris , in the middle of history once again .
Now we 'll see just how much Dems from the White House on down regret backing down on their threats not to seat him .
And if progressives passionate about the public option find themselves an unlikely hero .
Steve Rhodes is the proprietor of The Beachwood Reporter , a Chicago - centric news and culture review .
Pakistan purchased 200 missiles from North Korea in 1999 , according to Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan , known as the father of Pakistan 's nuclear bomb .
Khan made the remarks in a recent TV interview in Pakistan , saying at the time Pakistan was eager to have missiles capable of shooting down aircraft .
According to a translation of his remarks released by the U.S. director of National Intelligence 's Open Source Center , then Pakistani army chief of staff Pervez Musharraf sent Khan and a senior Air Force officer to North Korea to purchase missiles from the Stalinist country .
Khan implied that his first visit to the North in 1994 to discuss missile technology paved the way for the two countries to begin a close relationship .
Pakistan 's missile development program kicked off when then - prime minister Benazir Bhutto gave about US $ 50 million to North Korean officials who were visiting Pakistan following Khan 's visit to the North .
With regard to a suspected " nucl ear connection " between North Korea and Pakistan , Khan said North Korean engineers visited nuclear facilities in Pakistan in the mid-1990s .
But he denied that he himself had passed nuclear technology to the North in return for missile technology .
" Nuclear technology cannot be learned by visiting a nuclear site and observing a few machines , " he said .
I 'm not talking about annual reviews ( which are stupid ) .
I 'm talking about how you work as a client for a project that needs to make something .
It might be an internal team developing a website or it might be an outside designer working on a logo .
Regardless of the team 's make up , as their client , you walk a fine line .
On one hand , you want their best , most creative insight , delivered with passion .
On the other , you want the people you represent ( your boss , the customers ) to be happy with what gets made .
Which leads to the feedback part .
( Not criticism , feedback ) .
What do you do when the work that comes in is no good ?
When it 's off target or needs tweaking or even an overhaul ?
In my experience , there are three different ways to structure the project .
Each leads to a very different feedback loop .
1 . The goal of the team is to please you .
2 . The goal of the team is to make a product that they love and are proud of building .
3 . The goal of the team is to build a great product .
There 's more difference between # 2 and # 3 than it appears .
The first scenario is quite common .
It leads to mindreader syndrome , in which alert team members work hard to get you to tell them what you want .
If they can read your mind , they 'll be successful ( and done ) that much sooner .
The real problem with this approach is that the team has rarely bought in to the project .
They do n't take ownership because , after all , the goal is to make you happy .
They wo n't give you more than you expect , because they 're trying so hard to give you exactly what you expect .
This is especially problematic when the team thinks you 're an erratic , egomaniacal nutcase with little or no real world chops .
The second scenario is common with well - known freelance help , or agencies or other creatives that bring ego to the table .
In this situation , anything you say about the project appears to be a personal attack .
That 's because , in the eyes of the person that came to you saying , " here is our work , " it is a personal attack .
If you do n't like my logo or strategy or code , well , of course I 'm going to be defensive .
You can work with people like this successfully , but to do so involves giving them a clean sheet of paper , not being part of the development process .
The third scenario is the one in which all sides want the best possible project and the team believes that you have valuable insight on how to make that happen .
This only works if there 's mutual respect around the table .
They have to hold you in esteem and trust your judgment ( not organizational judgment , but judgment about what makes the project great ) .
That means that , " because I said so , " is not effective feedback .
I 've seen all three work .
The first scenario is really efficient if you are truly in charge , you know what you want and you do n't have a lot of time .
The second scenario works if you absolutely trust the team and want them to push the envelope .
And the third scenario works when you have mature people , a dedicated team and enough time and mutual respect to work it through .
How do you develop the trust and esteem you need in the third example ?
Sit with the team and jointly criticize other work .
Before you start developing , spend time giviing feedback on how someone else could have done a better job ( on a design , on the foley in a movie , on a logo ) .
By earning the right to give feedback externally , you make it more likely you 've got the right to do it internally .
Liverpool are to offer Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres every chance to prove their fitness for the crunch clash with Manchester United .
Benitez will make ' late decisions ' on Gerrard and Torres
Too soon
Liverpool are prepared to offer star duo Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres every opportunity to prove their fitness ahead of the crunch clash with Manchester United .
Striker Torres has returned to training after missing the last two games with an abductor problem , but Gerrard was forced to limp off in the first half of the defeat to Lyon with a recurrence of his groin problem and has yet to train .
The Reds are desperate to have the pair available when fierce rivals United arrive at Anfield on Sunday for a crucial match , which can be seen live on .
Liverpool are in their worst run of form for 22 years and under - fire manager Rafa Benitez is ready to leave it late before handing Gerrard and Torres fitness tests .
" It 's the same situation for both players , " the Anfield boss told Liverpool ' son Friday .
" Fernando trained today and has been working to a specific programme .
" Steven did n't train but we will speak with the physios over the weekend before making a decision .
" It 's too soon to say if they will be involved .
We will make late decisions with both of them . "
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard 's broad Aussie accent has baffled US schoolchildren to the point at which they asked her whether English was spoken Down Under .
In Washington , DC , to discuss green jobs and education , Ms Gillard confessed she had puzzled American youngsters after talking to them for a few minutes .
What did you say ?
... Julia Gillard .

" I have visited two schools in Washington where the kids asked me , after listening to me , whether or not we spoke English in Australia , " she told Macquarie Radio on Friday .
" That Australian accent is foxing them a bit . "
She was invited by Jeb Bush , former governor of Florida , to attend the Excellence in Action Summit to discuss education reform including national curriculum , teacher quality and transparency .
Ms Gillard is also meeting with senior Obama Administration officials during the trip .

We tend to love animals even from a very young age .
Some of the first words we learn ( and first things we recognize ) are “ dog , ” “ cat , ” and other usual animals for our areas .
We even learn the sounds animals make when we ’re wee young things — cows go “ moo ” right ?
Mother Nature did n’t stop with the family pet and animals on the local farm though .
There are thousands , if not millions , of species out there in the world that seem rather odd to us , and we ’re still discovering more !
Let ’s step away from the norm today and explore some of Mother Nature ’s misfits through this collection of strange and unusual members of the animal world .
Whether cute or kind of creepy , you ’re sure to find something new .
1. Okapi
As strange as the okapi might look ( it appears to be some kind of cross between a zebra and chestnut horse , but with an unusually large neck ) , it sure is cute is n’t it ?
Not all strange animals have to be freaky or ugly or downright scary looking .
That long neck we talked about is a reminder that the okapi is n’t actually tied to horses or zebras .
It ’s in the giraffe family !
Found in the dense forests of the Congo , this herbivore jungle giraffe can live to be over 30 years old and grow to over 500 pounds .
Ca n’t make it to the jungle to see an okapi for yourself ?
They can also be found in numerous zoos around the world .
Say it with me now : Awwwwww !
2. Mexican Walking Fish
Okay .
While not all strange and unusual creatures are ugly or creepy this thing certainly is !
Fish give me the willies to begin with , but at least they ’re confined to the water .
But a fish with legs !
Uh oh .
I sense nightmares of fish chasing me on land coming .
Ewwww .
It ’s time to be fair now .
These little guys are n’t actually fish at all — they ’re a type of salamander ( which does n’t make them any less cringe - worthy ) .
The carnivorous little creatures are officially called axolotls , and as their common name implies they ’re native to Mexico .
Sadly they ’re endangered ( and as disgusting as I might think they are , I certainly do n’t wish that on any species ) .
You ’d think that since they can regenerate their own body parts , they ’d be better at this survival game .
Apparently not — the introduction of non-native fish to their diminishing natural habitat is proving too much for them .
3. Proboscis Monkey
Let ’s get back to the cute and cuddly side of things with the next of Mother Nature ’s misfits — the proboscis monkey .
How adorable are they ?
The interesting feature of the proboscis monkey is obviously the schnoz .
Their noses almost make them look cartoonish — well , for the males at least .
Apparently females are attracted by the huge protruding noses ( oh if only big - nosed humans were as lucky , right ? ) .
Unfortunately the proboscis monkey is another endangered species .
Despite being natural climbers and swimmers and being smart enough to travel in groups to avoid being preyed upon by crocodiles when crossing rivers , Mother Nature just is n’t cutting these little cuties a break .
As with many endangered species , the proboscis monkey is nearing extinction due to logging and other destruction of its native habitat .
4. Lithogenes Wahari
This interesting variety of catfish is both an armored catfish and a type of climbing catfish .
Only recently were scientists able to find plentiful specimens of this Venezuelan native .
Because these catfish live in rapidly flowing water , generally in rocky areas , they have an unusual feature .
They not only have a suction - style mouth but also two fins in the pelvic area .
These features help the catfish climb vertically up rocks .
The adaptation allows the fish to move up streams despite heavy currents , and to climb when needed to adjust to changing water levels .
5. Female Angler Fish
If there was ever an oddball in the aquatic world , the female angler fish would be it .
Not only does it look like something out of a child ’s nightmare , but she lives up to her horrific look when it comes to how the fish reproduce .
Here ’s the gist : Eventually the male can’t feed without essentially becoming a parasite of a female .
He finds one by picking up her scent .
The male bites into one of these lovely ladies and they ’re fused together ( gross enough , right ? ) .
He then proceeds to die , leaving behind nothing more than his magnificent little “ man parts . ”
She gets his sperm .
She can reproduce .
I ’m not sure how happy she is with the arrangement , but hey , whatever works .
6. Sloth
Do you know what I love most about the sloth ?
They look so happy and perky .
Do n’t they ?
They look like teddy bears mated with monkeys and got high .
They live in South and Central America , where they spend much of their time hanging upside down in trees .
In fact , they rarely come out of the trees at all .
But if they did , would n’t you just want to hug them ?
7. Pelochelys Cantorii
I like turtles .
In fact the hill I grew up on was known as Turtle Hill because we had so many .
These turtles are n’t ones I ’d want to touch or take home though .
The large soft - shell turtles live in fresh water , and spend most of their time buried .
I do n’t know about you , but to me a turtle just is n’t a turtle without a hard little shell and a gorgeous pattern .
These ones are monotone .
Just the thought of feeling a soft shell makes me cringe , but I guess if that ’s all the protection they need , who am I to argue with Mother Nature ?
8. Blobfish
Why is it that the freakiest of Mother Nature ’s misfits seem to live in water ?
Here ’s another creepy and odd - looking fish — the blobfish .
Thankfully they ’re only found around Australia , so I do n’t have to worry about running into one of these squishy gelatinous - looking things when in the water .
Whew !
When you look at them head - on they almost have a human - like nose that makes them look all the creepier .
I ’m not sure what Mother Nature was thinking when she created the blobfish .
Maybe she lost a bet .
9. Star -Nosed Mole
The star - nosed mole is a creature that looks like it almost wants to be cute and cuddly , but which still looks like something out of a horror flick .
With a flared - open star - like nose that makes it look like it has an octopus mounted to its face and claws that look almost skeletal , I would n’t want to stumble across one of these oddball animals .
Then again , if I were basically blind I probably would n’t mind a freakish nose ( would n’t have to see it ) as long as the sense of smell helped me to survive .
10 . Aye-aye
There ’s something completely strange but still absolutely adorable about the aye - aye .
Found in Madagascar , they have faces that look like a cross between a bat and a young bear .
They ’re actually Madagascar ’s most endangered mammal ( poor little things ) due to deforestation .
While they ’re actually primates , they share something other than their face with bats — they use echolocation to help them find food .

The study of the mind and the study of the human brain as a mechanism have merged in the theories of the mind manipulators , men who are determined to change the mind of man ( and with it the entire human race ) , using the knowledge that has been gained .
Has it always been human destiny that mankind would eventually reach a point of intellectual growth where our scientific discoveries could give us the ability to alter our evolutionary path ?
Or has the seemingly sudden acquisition of that capability arisen as the result of our leaders tapping into an unnatural alternative stream of knowledge because of a decision made long ago to continue the mind sciences started by Nazi scientists ?
Was it inevitable , because of a decision made for our own good , by God in all His wisdom , that the next step in mankind ’s evolution be made possible through a science based on torture ?
Have we reached a point where the theories of the most evil minds known in all human history are being validated by the very government that originally stopped them ?
It is a branch of science that should have been pruned long ago , yet now , we are faced with a seemingly unsolvable dilemma because of it — can a science based on torture really benefit the human race , and should the creators of it even be given the opportunity to apply what they have learned ?
Our government has advanced its war - fighting potential into new technological arenas , far beyond the realm of normal combat , using conventional weaponry .
War science has merged the most - advanced computers and computer - modeling with the most advanced studies in theoretical psychology .
Technological means have been created to enable decision - makers to understand the minds of any potential “ enemies . ”
This technology gives the operators the capability to predict future reactions to planned war scenarios , fairly accurately , through computer simulations .
These simulations were based both on Pavlovian theories of behaviorism and its alternative , the cognitive sciences , which adapted the reverse - engineering approach to formulating psychological theory .
The information obtained from the simulations is extrapolated , using algorithm - based input - output theories , to predict what will trigger the desired outcomes for individuals , for thousands , even for millions of people .
The degree of their ability to actually shape the outcome is unknown , but they have managed to alter the behavior of the right people enough to put our Nation and the world in the precarious position we are in today .
Add this ability to sway the minds and actions of people to the powerful persuasion of economic incentives , the power to control the output of the “ free press ” and to direct all military actions , and you have created a reliable formula for controlling a Nation .
The only thing , at this point , that can possibly stop them , is the disclosure of their aims and methods .
How do we as a still “ free people ” set about dismantling this illegitimate power to control us ?
We must assimilate some of the methods that have been used against us , to anticipate the controllers ’ next acts and do everything in our power to disrupt their plans .
We cannot duplicate their awesome technology , but we can join our efforts , creating ways to think exponentially .
I would define “ exponential thinking ” as ways of studying problems that compound the thinker ’s cognitive abilities by the addition of other minds in the tasks presented by these problems , or by the addition of artificial intelligence to the thinking process .
Many minds thinking together , stacking our research efforts like phased - array radars , multiplies the possibilities of finding conclusive proof of criminal conspiracy , or the means for undermining corporate efforts to further the new order .
The last thing we should consider doing is allowing them to succeed , and in so doing , forever alter the human race and the planet in the process .
We know their goals are nothing short of this global human transformation into a race of more manageable sheeple .
In their eyes , as well as in my own , the plotters appear to be elements of a different race entirely , a cruel inhuman one , seemingly alien to the compassionate majority of humanity .
I think that there is near universal opinion among readers of the alternate press that the plan is to establish a “ New World Order , ” ruling everyone through a process of creating permanent state of limited war .
Without these wars , plans for multiple pipelines cannot go forward .
Without a stranglehold on oil and gas production and the means of their delivery , US leaders cannot limit the growth of other nations .
Whatever it takes , these wars and steps towards their realization , must not be allowed to happen .
There is a large segment of the population that will never believe that such a thing is possible ; the United States would never do any of these things .
They believe that the government has all our best interests at heart ; that the war of terror is not a fraud .
They believe that it would be a good thing , if the United States actually took control of the world and reshaped the human race into a more productive , more cooperative species .
Their reasoning is based on faith in America , that this Nation is a “ shining example ” for all mankind .
If our technological advancement has made the wholesale reengineering of the human mind possible , then it must be “ destiny , ” the “ will of God . ”
How could torture - based science or world conquest be the “ will ” of a loving God ?
Every advancement in the mind sciences has been the result of the abusive testing of humans and animals .
As a direct result of this work , actual “ psychotronic ” weapons have been created , ranging from “ voice in the head ” technology , to electromagnetic weapons that jam , or scramble the thought processes .
What if the Nazis had made the same breakthroughs ?
Nobody considered it to be the will of God when they doing this research , what makes it our “ Manifest Destiny ” now ?
The only answer given is the false notion of “ American supremacy , ” the idea that Americans have been “ blessed ” by God , that somehow , we are the spiritual heirs of the Biblical Israelites .
This notion , that Americans are modern - day heirs to a “ Judeo - Christian ” birthright , is such obvious bullshit that it should n’t even be part of this discussion , except that it is very clearly a big part of the problem .
American “ Bible - belt ” religion is the central theme of the PSYOP that has been created and directed against us .
The most extremist view , shared by millions , is that all of this is ushering - in the end of the world and the return of the “ Messiah . ”
It is this belief that has been played - up by the Bush Administration , magnifying the eschatological aspects of Bush ’s own strange , though widely accepted beliefs — that we are locked into a struggle between darkness and light , centered upon the battle to preserve the modern state of Israel .
To that end , millions of Christian - Zionists are anxiously waiting for Jesus to come and destroy Israel ’s enemies .
This bizarre , religious , Israel - centered ideology became the central theme of American foreign policy .
The same theme holds sway over the Obama Administration today .
The psyop at this stage is centered upon Obama , elevating the man ( who has been groomed for this his entire life by the agents of the empire ) to the highest possible human position , the role of “ Messiah . ”
The theme of “ Obama the Messiah ” has been played - up in every media , accentuating his dual racial and national heritage and portraying him as the great “ bridge ” between cultures , races and nations .
This theme has been carried to its most absurd extreme in the form of the Nobel Peace Prize , which he was given for reading all the pretty - sounding words that flow across his teleprompter screen .
For the faithful and the deluded , if the Messiah has surely come , then he must be given the benefit of the doubt , in order to carry - out the most well - thought - out plans , which must assuredly be part of God ’s plan .
You are beginning to see the perfection of the psyop , how it works its way into the deepest recesses of the mind , way down deep , past the emotions , playing upon the instinctual urges that flow underneath it all .
Behaviorism works this way , looking beyond mere emotions , to discover instinctual reactions that bypass the reasoning process .
In this way , they can create certain behavior , even normally unacceptable behavior , by triggering instinctual reactions , without all the bother of having to explain your actions , or make you understand .
The same mind - science that was used to locate the man who would play the role of “ Messiah ” was also used to find and marginalize all potential opposition to the psyop , the resisters .
Most of us has grown - up during the sifting stage , where the authorities searched for those of us who were susceptible to either positive or negative programming .
Those affected by positive programming were sorted - out for special treatment , to mold them since childhood to be leaders in the new order .
Those who had a negative effect to attempts to program them were separated to special treatment of the negative kind .
Since childhood , they were steered away from positive reinforcements like education or good jobs , towards lives in the military , or lives of crime .
It is an ugly and messy process that is used to determine who is worthy of being part of their new order and who is not .
It consists of the use of intrusive methods to determine who is susceptible to control and who is not —
Who will surrender their free will to a higher authority , allegedly for the common good ?
Progressively tighter controls are applied to societies , to find those who will react to control .
In the current era , the “ war on terror ” is the name applied to the international process for determining which nations and which regions are manageable .
There is a certain mind - set that will never submit to control , for any reason .
Attacking neighborhoods and families with deadly force has a way of forcing some people to take - up arms in self - defense .
This is “ the enemy ” that the ruling elite is trying to find , so that they can be controlled or eliminated .
From the “ tickling ” of terrorists with lethal drone attacks in Pakistan , to outrageous acts of the abusive use of force upon helpless citizens here in the homeland , it is the same manhunt underway .
If you react to terror , instead of rolling - over in submission to the terrorizers , then you are a threat to the new order .
The controllers understand that humanity is in a make or break era of our development , where humanity will either make great technological leaps forward , or technology will be used to enslave humanity .
Every available resource is being utilized to ensure that mankind will not find salvation in the new era .
Breakthroughs will bring about a moment of transformation , known as “ The Singularity , ” the creation of artificial “ superintelligence , ” commonly referred to as Superior Artificial Intelligence ( SAI ) .
The creation of a self - improving artificial intellect , that is more intelligent the brightest human brain , will open new vistas of solutions to mankind ’s self - created problems .
The adaptation of new technologies designed by SAI , based on ideas like the brain - computer interface , will facilitate the merger of man and machine , the next stage in human evolution .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIG47YgndP8&feature=player_embedded
It is anticipated that the superintellect could solve many of the problems associated with human growth , such as extracting hydrogen from water and water desalination .
A hydrogen - based world economy would blow - away all projections of ecological collapse .
The wholesale ability to extract salt from seawater , or water from the atmosphere through condensation techniques , would eliminate water problems and make possible an incremental increase in world food production .
The idea that we are headed to environmental catastrophe because of some mathematician ’s alarmist numbers , does n’t allow for the arising of unanticipated solutions .
But the path are presently on does n’t allow problems to be solved .
Many of the dire dilemmas we face are the end product of a ruling elite dedicated to establishing mass control .
Allowing these corrupt men to merge their methods with superintelligent computers , will pave the way for total control of all human beings .
Repressive technologies , such as the new generation of electromagnetic weaponry and technological mind - control will be used to the fullest , towards the end to which they were invented .
All the new weapons of mass crowd - control and all the secret holding areas are there for the coming crackdown on all forms of resistance .
We are asked to trust inhuman men to use inhumane means to move the species beyond humanity , before humanity has had a chance to blossom .
It is wrong to say that mankind has tried and failed , when we have never even had the chance .
There has been no possibility of a real human renaissance , or even a glimpse of anything like “ utopia ” since “ man , ” the creature left his original home of paradisiacal bliss in “ Eden ” ( wherever that was ) .
When it is possible for the most ruthless , most devious individuals to control society and to accumulate all wealth unto themselves , so that they can dispense it at their whim , then an unnatural division in the resource supply chain has been created and the natural flow of history has thereby been altered , forcing the creation of unnatural avenues of supply .
This is a description of the system known as “ capitalism . ”
It is these ruthless individuals who today dominate the movement to transform mankind .
This is why the new world order and everyone promoting it must be opposed at all costs .
The control of the pharmaceutical industry has given them the power to dominate all research and funding , allowing them to focus all research only on the that which offers them the most profits and the potential for prolonging and improving their own lives , leaving little else to study humane evolution .
The breakthroughs that are made are too expensive for anyone but the most well endowed .
More research is done in the field of control as opposed to that which is purely for life enhancements for the broad majority .
The control transformists know that the levels of technological controls they envision are too expensive to be used for all human beings , at least at present and projected population levels , explaining their emphasis on reducing the population to a number that can be electromagnetically and chemically controlled economically .
These extreme changes to the human race must be rendered before the time of the Singularity arrives and mankind learns how to overcome the plans and devices used by the controllers .
For a brief moment in time the human race is openly vulnerable to a total loss of control to men who lust after total control .
The human race will either develop its technology for service , or for control .
The outcome of this debate will determine the direction of everything that comes after us .
Either we control our technology , or it will be used to control us .
When superintelligence does arrive , will it consider itself mankind ’s servant or its master , following the programs for control ( or lack thereof ) set by decisions made today .
Will we adapt technology to enhancing the human experience and human capabilities , or will we continue to passively watch , as a new technological order is created that adapts human life to serving technology ?
It is no longer far fetched to think in this manner .
According to the ideas of “ transhumanism , ” the human race is a transient , temporary species , meant to fill - in some of the gaps in the evolutionary chain , between the Neanderthal / Cro-Magnon hybrid known as “ human ” and whatever comes next .
According to the transhumanists ,
Are we to be sad at the thought of the passing of mankind , with all his weaknesses and defections ?
Or is the proper reaction to take joy that our species is evolving into something different , perhaps better ?
Who is to say what is proper or better for us all ?
Certainly not the men who have taken it upon themselves to decide all our fates .

Parents ask to excuse kids from Obama speech Some object to Obama speech to students
Some Texas parents are asking school principals to excuse their children from listening to a speech that President Barack Obama will make to schools next week on the grounds that it smacks of political indoctrination .
Obama will deliver an address directly to students on the importance of education beginning at 11 a.m. ( CST ) Tuesday .
“ The president will challenge students to work hard , set educational goals , and take responsibility for their learning , ” Education Secretary Arne Duncan wrote in an Aug. 26 letter to school principals .
Critics of the president are using the Internet to build opposition and encourage parents to request their children not be forced to listen .
“ I think it 's inappropriate because it smacks of political indoctrination of the worst kind , ” said Brett Curtis , a parent of two children attending Pearland ISD schools .
“ It 's not just a speech .
It 's a specific curriculum to go along with the speech directly from the president of the United States without review . ”
Schools are getting a menu of classroom activities for students , according to the education secretary , designed by teachers “ to help engage students and stimulate discussion on the importance of education in their lives . ”
Curtis said he would instruct his children to boycott the speech as “ a general protest .
I know that 's going on around the country . ”
Most Houston - area school districts will let principals and teachers decide whether to show Obama 's speech .
Some district leaders raised concerns about interrupting already scheduled lessons , while others said students need to hear the president 's expected message of personal responsibility for learning .
Some parents have threatened to keep their children home for the day .
“ I just do n't see how this would be an indoctrination technique , ” said Alief school board president Sarah Wink­ler , who also is president - elect of the Texas Association of School Boards .
“ It sounds to me like these are all things we try to teach our kids .
We want them to work hard and pay attention and do the best they can . ”
The Alief district , like Lamar Consolidated , plans to record the speech for interested teachers to show later .
Parents can opt out
The Houston Independent School District has directed principals to give parents a heads - up if they are planning lessons around Obama 's speech so parents can opt out their children .
Other districts said they would excuse students , though not all plan to send home notes in advance .
“ We 're not stopping instruction for it , ” said Clear Creek ISD spokeswoman Elaina Polsen , “ but if it 's in line with what 's being taught either on Sept. 8th or down the road , teachers may use it . ”
Pasadena school officials said they are working to ensure that all schools can access the online broadcast of Obama 's speech if they want .
In 1989 , President George H.W. Bush used a nationally televised speech to schoolchildren to push an anti-drug campaign .
“ It is not uncommon for students to watch a presidential speech that is given during the school day , ” said Debbie Ratcliffe , spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency .
“ This situation is somewhat different in that this speech apparently will be directed to students .
But each district can decide how best to handle it for their community . ”
Children pulled out of school for the day will cost districts about $ 35 per child , as state funding for schools is based on daily attendance .
State Board of Education member David Bradley , R- Beaumont , said he objected to the federal Department of Education taking classroom time away from local schools .
The speech may be innocuous , Bradley said , “ but look at the follow - up activities . ”
“ Under Texas statute , parents have the right to review all instructional materials .
They also have the right to opt out their kids from any program they might object to , ” he said , citing sex education as an example .
State Board of Education member Barbara Cargill , R- The Woodlands , said parents have complained to her about the speech taking up valuable classroom instruction time .
One parent told her the president 's speech “ obligates the youngest children in our public school system to agree with Obama 's initiatives or be ostracized by their teachers and classmates , ” and does not allow for healthy debate .
‘ Wild - eyed paranoia '
President Obama 's speech does have its defenders .
“ It 's hard to imagine anything more ridiculous than attacking the president of the United States for talking to students about the importance of getting a good education and being a good citizen , ” said Kathy Miller , president of the Texas Freedom Network , which monitors public education in Texas .
“ I wish our elected leaders were responsible enough to denounce this kind of wild - eyed paranoia , ” Miller said .
“ But the problem is too many of them are actually feeding this kind of nonsense — like when the governor flirts with secessionists and State Board of Education members say the president sympathizes with terrorists . ”

Sometimes a few charts say more than a thousand words …
( ALLL = Allowance For Loan and Lease Losses )
All these charts ultimately tell us :
– Banks continue to face an ocean of non performing loans
– But these non-performing loans are outpacing their ability to up the allowance for future losses
– Net loan charge offs are way past record highs and continue to shoot higher
– Return on bank assets and equity is approaching negative territory – still way too many resources are tied up in the banking sector
There is no recovery , not in banking anyway .
Why ?
Because they made too many loans and are still facing the bitter reality that many of those will never be paid back .
But why wo n’t they recover as a result of the recent bailout and stimulus efforts ?
Because those aimed at getting banks to loan out more money … which is the cause , not the cure of their predicament .
There are many more bank failures , write offs , charge offs , and foreclosures ahead of us before we can truly speak of a recovery .
Especially if we keep postponing and dragging this process out from month to month .
It ’s the policies from The Great Depression all over again .

Happy birthday , Spaced , which was 10 years old yesterday , according to the seminal Channel 4 sitcom 's director , Edgar Wright .
" Not only that , but its 10th series starts tonight on Channel 4 ! " joked Wright .
" What ?
You guys have n't been watching series three to nine ?
Where have you been ? "
Actually , I reckon today is the show 's 10th birthday – although I am loath to quibble with the man whose partnership with Spaced co-star and co-writer Simon Pegg has since given us the big - screen comedies Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz , and is in the process of making the third in the pair 's " Blood and Ice Cream " trilogy , The World 's End .
Channel 4 was pretty confident about Spaced even before it arrived on the small screen on 24 September 1999 .
" It establishes a world that you want to be a part of and you 're on a winner if you get that right , " said the programme 's commissioning editor Cheryl Taylor .
But then , the channel also had high hopes for something called Hewitt , about a bloke who works in a video shop starring stand - up Tommy Tiernan , so nothing was guaranteed .
But with Spaced , Wright , Pegg and his co-writer and co-star Jessica Hynes ( née Stevenson ) got it absolutely right , one of a new breed of comedies , even more than BBC1's The Royle Family , that eschewed traditional sitcom rules .
" No laugh track , no studio audience , non-linear narrative , complete with visual and verbal references to a video library 's worth of film and television classics , " reported the Guardian .
The " sit " of this particular sitcom was established in the first episode , when Tim and Daisy moved into a flat together and had to convince the landlady Marsha , brilliantly played by Julia Deakin , that they were a couple .
The rest of the episode , and the 13 that followed , was purely comedy gold .
It worked because everything was spot on – the script , the direction and the casting , with a bunch of supporting characters who you could imagine all being given a spin - off show in their own right .
Or at least , an episode – Nick Frost as Mike Watt , Mark Heap as Brian Todd , Peter Serafinowicz as Duane Benzie , not forgetting Aida as Colin the dog .
Unbelievably , looking back , the show did n't pull up too many trees , ratings wise .
An episode of its second series in 2001 had 1.7 million viewers , fewer than were watching a repeat of the World at War on BBC2 .
Some people , eh ?
But it has since made up for it on DVD , of course .
Favourite moments ?
Too many to choose from .
The paintballing , the " slow motion commotion " , pretty much anything from the clubbing episode ?
And of course the comedy pop culture references and any scene with fab Nick Frost as Mike Watt .
There must be a few I 've forgotten - about 300 , probably – so tell me yours .
The US remake of the show , however , was laughably bad , and never made it past the pilot stage .
" One of these days , McG's Spaced remake pilot will leak onto the interwebs , " tweeted Wright .

Wow ( not a good wow ) . "
A special shout out to Hynes , who once emptied a champagne bucket of iced water over my head as I slept on a sofa in Montreux during the Rose d'Or television festival .
I thought it was going to be the start of a beautiful relationship , but she just laughed at me with her friends and walked out .
Great days .
By coincidence I had the Spaced box set out only a few days ago .
I was laughing like it was 1999 .
Gordon Hageman could n’t believe the credit card offer he got in the mail .
" My first thought , it was a mistake , " Hageman said .
The wine distributor called the number on the offer , gave them the offer code and verified his information .
Sure enough , it was right : the pre-approved credit card came with a 79.9 percent APR .
Yes , 79.9 percent .
The offer is for a Premier card from First Premier Bank , which is based in South Dakota .
On its Web site , First Premier says it is the country 's 10th largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards .
The site also says it " focuses on individuals who have less than perfect credit but are actually still creditworthy . "
" I think they ’re trying to take advantage of me , " said Hageman .
Ya think ?
Hageman acknowleged that his credit is n't perfect , but he said it 's about average .
He said the pre-approved offer did n’t mention the actual interest rate on the card -- for that , he had to read the enclosed fine - print disclosure .
" I think you ’re beginning to border on deception there , " San Diego State marketing professor Michael Belch said .
Belch said the card is offering a bad deal to people who are desperate .
" They 're just finding different ways to gouge the consumer , " Belch said .
The California Attorney General 's office said there 's nothing it can do about the cards since they are issued out of state and out of its jurisdiction .
A spokesman with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) said interest rate limits on bank cards are set by the individual state and not on a federal level .
According to information on the South Dakota Legislative Web site , there is " no maximum or usury restriction . "
In other words , the individual bank can set its own interest rate limits .
Several calls made to First Premier for a comment were not returned .
WASHINGTON - Attorney General Eric
Holder has decided not to bring any criminal charges against a former Bush administration official who lawmakers said lied to them in sworn testimony .
An inspector general 's report found that Bradley Schlozman , the former head of the civil rights division , misled lawmakers in sworn testimony about whether he politicized hiring decisions .
At his February confirmation hearing , Holder pledged he would review that decision to prosecute Schlozman when he took over the department and promised to strengthen and rebuild the civil rights division .
Holder 's decision was revealed in a letter sent to lawmakers on Friday .
Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , who was one of Schlozman 's questioners at the original hearing and had urged Holder take a second look at the case , called the attorney general 's decision " very disappointing . "
Under questioning from Schumer , Schlozman had denied making hiring decisions at the Justice Department based on the applicants ' political affiliations .
" Perjury is often a close call , but in this case it was n't .
Mr. Schlozman was way over the line , " Schumer said .
In the letter to lawmakers , Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich said Holder oversaw an " extensive " review of the Schlozman matter .
Holder found the alleged conduct of Schlozman disturbing , but ultimately chose to defer to the prosecutors ' original decision not to bring charges , Weich wrote .
Schlozman resigned from the Justice Department in 2007 and went to work as an attorney in private practice in Wichita , Kan .
His lawyer , Bill Jordan , said his client " is extremely pleased " by the attorney general 's decision , and called the original allegations in the report " grossly inaccurate and biased . "
The investigation of Schlozman was among a number of probes that found senior Justice Department officials in the Bush administration had violated civil service laws under the tenure of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .

SAN FRANCISCO —
A federal judge Wednesday refused to dismiss a legal challenge to Proposition 8 , concluding that the ongoing courtroom battle over California ’s voter - approved ban on gay marriage must be resolved in a full - blown trial .
After two hours of legal sparring , Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker rejected the arguments of Proposition 8 supporters , who maintained that U.S. Supreme Court precedent and a lack of proof of constitutional violations should sidetrack a lawsuit designed to overturn the ballot measure .
Instead , Walker , sensing the challenge to Proposition 8 ultimately could wind up before the Supreme Court , wants a trial to develop a full factual record , including forcing Proposition 8 supporters to justify the reasons behind a state ban on allowing gay couples to wed .
One by one , the judge shot down the legal reasons Proposition 8 lawyers presented to resolve the case now and allow the same - sex marriage ban to remain in force .
The judge seemed particularly unpersuaded by Proposition 8 attorney Charles Cooper ’s chief argument for a state law confining marriage to heterosexual couples — that the state has an interest in protecting “ traditional ” marriage because of its importance to procreation in society .
“ Procreation does n’t require marriage , ” Walker noted , citing statistics showing that a large percentage of children are born out of wedlock .
The judge ’s decision sets the stage for a January trial , which will allow same - sex marriage advocates to argue that Proposition 8 violates the equal protection rights of gay couples because it denies them the right to marry .
Backed by a high - powered legal team led by former Republican U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson , two same - sex couples sued to overturn the law in the spring , when the California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8 , concluding that it could not trump the voters who approved the measure in November 2008 .
The Supreme Court did leave intact an estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages that took place before Proposition 8 went into effect , creating a two - tiered system in California that gay rights advocates say further backs their case .
Walker also appeared concerned about denying gay couples the right to wed while thousands of same - sex marriages remain legal in the state .
The judge agreed with Olson ’s characterization that California now has a “ crazy quilt ” of options for marriage .
A trial would focus on several key factual questions , including examining the state ’s interest in restricting marriage to heterosexual couples and the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians in the United States .
The trial also would explore whether Proposition 8 was intended to discriminate against gay couples by stripping away the right to marry , which had been backed in a state Supreme Court ruling in May 2008 striking down a prior ban on same - sex marriage .
Proposition 8 effectively voided that ruling .
The only potential obstacle to a trial proceeding in January is a recent appeal of Walker ’s order requiring the Proposition 8 campaign to release documents from the measure ’s political campaign to the plaintiffs , who say it could support the argument the law was motivated by bias against gays .
Proposition 8 lawyers say the order violates the free speech rights of political campaigns and have asked an appeals court to block release of the material .
It is not clear whether that appeal can be resolved by January ’s trial date .

LYSP — 50 Years of Symbolic Processing

Being a weekend hack there are probably numerous bugs ( not to mention the unspeakable things it does with __builtin_apply that are courting portability disaster ) .
If you find one , send a description ( or perferably a prescription ) to the author : Ian at the domain name of this site .
If you find you can't break it and manage to use it for something interesting , I 'd love to hear about it .
It started off really small ( about 150 LOC ) but I got carried away .
I hope you will forgive the bloat .

- Os it 's about 17 KB for the interpreter and 4 KB the garbage collector ( a cheesy , home - made , stop - world , precise collector -- although it can also use the classy , incremental , conservative Boehm - Demers - Weiser one in /usr / lib ) .
That makes for about 21 KB of self - contained Lisp interpreter , including a rudimentary ( but useful ) FFI and macros , that runs at about 1 million funcalls per second on my Q9450 .

As we know , Genetic Programming usually requires intensive processing power for the fitness functions and tree manipulations ( in crossover operations ) , and this fact can be a huge problem when using a pure Python approach like Pyevolve .
So , to overcome this situation , I ’ve used the Python multiprocessing features to implement a parallel fitness evaluation approach in Pyevolve and I was surprised by the super linear speedup I got for a cpu bound fitness function used to do the symbolic regression of the Pythagoras theorem : .
I ’ve used the same seed for the GP , so it has consumed nearly the same cpu resources for both test categories .
Here are the results I obtained :
The first fitness landscape I ’ve used had 2.500 points and the later had a fitness landscape of 6.400 points , here is the source code I ’ve used ( you just need to turn on the multiprocessing option using the setMultiProcessing method , so Pyevolve will use multiprocessing when you have more than one single core , you can enable the logging feature to check what ’s going on behind the scenes ) :
from pyevolve import * import math rmse_accum = Util.ErrorAccumulator ( ) def gp_add ( a , b ) : return a+b def gp_sub ( a , b ) : return a - b def gp_mul ( a , b ) : return a*b def gp_sqrt ( a ) : return math.sqrt(abs ( a ) ) def eval_func( chromosome ) : global rmse_accum rmse_accum.reset ( ) code_comp = chromosome.getCompiledCode( ) for a in xrange ( 0 , 80 ) : for b in xrange ( 0 , 80 ) : evaluated = eval ( code_comp ) target = math. sqrt (( a*a ) +( b* b ) ) rmse_accum += ( target , evaluated ) return rmse_accum.getRMSE( ) def main_run ( ) : genome = GTree.GTreeGP ( ) genome.setParams(max_depth=4 , method= " ramped " ) genome.evaluator += eval_func genome.mutator.set( Mutators.GTreeGPMutatorSubtree ) ga = GSimpleGA.GSimpleGA( genome , seed =666 ) ga.setParams ( gp_terminals = [ 'a ' , 'b ' ] , gp_function_prefix = " gp " ) ga.setMinimax ( Consts.minimaxType[" minimize " ] ) ga.setGenerations ( 20 ) ga.setCrossoverRate( 1.0 ) ga.setMutationRate(0.08 ) ga.setPopulationSize( 800 ) ga.setMultiProcessing ( True ) ga( freq_stats=5 ) best = ga.bestIndividual( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main_run ( )
As you can see , the population size was 800 individuals with a 8 % mutation rate and a 100 % crossover rate for a simple 20 generations evolution .
Of course you do n’t need so many points in the fitness landscape , I ’ve used 2.500 + points to create a cpu intensive fitness function , otherwise , the speedup can be less than 1.0 due the communication overhead between the processes .
For the first case ( 2.500 points fitness landscape ) I ’ve got a 3.33 x speedup and for the last case ( 6.400 points fitness landscape ) I ’ve got a 3.28 x speedup .
The tests were executed in a 2 cores pc ( Intel Core 2 Duo ) .
What all this amounts to is an unintended and unanticipated extension of the official “ safety net ” , an arrangement designed decades ago to protect the stability of the commercial banking system .
The obvious danger is that with the passage of time , risk - taking will be encouraged and efforts at prudential restraint will be resisted .
Ultimately , the possibility of further crises – even greater crises – will increase .
– Paul Volcker

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker is testifying before the committee on Banking and Financial Services today at 9am .
His written statement advises against a return to ” business as usual , ” and makes specific recommendations as to what to do to avoid another meltdown .
• Reaffirm the principle separating banking from commerce as our approach to financial regulation ; • Regulate Derivatives as a typical financial product ; • Encourage more prudent compensation practices ; • Close existing loopholes that inevitably weaken prudential safeguards ; • Register and establish reporting requirements for hedge funds and private equity ;
Volcker also notes two other key needed elements in need of reform : the Moral Hazard of the bailouts , and the ongoing policy of “ Too Big To Fail . ”
And , Volcker also emphasized the importance of the Federal Reserve maintaining independence from political pressures .
He also called for a new “ resolution regime ” for insolvent or failing non-bank institutions of potential systemic importance .
Rather than toss trillions at these self - wounded entities , we should instead appoint a special “ Conservator ” to take control of a bank in clear danger of defaulting on its obligations .
The Conservator should have the authority to negotiate an exchange of debt for new stock to resolve the near insolvent firm , to arrange a sale or merger , or , to arrange an orderly liquidation .
This authority would preempt normal bankruptcy / reorg , justified only by the risk of systemic breakdown .
Last , Volcker emphasized the need to coordinate with other major countries on a global approach to oversight of international banking organizations .
Now that is regulatory change I can believe in . . .

But there are probably a large number of buyers who do not really possess the basic English skills to understand his speech , said Yuzo Yamamoto , an editor at Asahi Press .
Since the sales took off , he has received postcards from readers saying they had been touched by Mr. Obama ’s speeches , but “ those same people have said they were moved even though they did n’t understand English well , ” he said .
“ Some even said the only phrase they caught was , ‘ Yes , we can . ’
They said they were in tears nonetheless . ”
Image A CD of President Barack Obama 's inaugural speech has sold a half million copies in Japan , leading publishers to flood the market with over a dozen language - learning titles centered on his oratory .

Mr. Yamamoto said there was a sincerity about Mr. Obama ’s speaking style that listeners could perceive phonetically , combined with a delivery that was almost musical .
“ That seems to result in sensation , the kind of which you get from listening to good music , ” he said .
Other observers say that Japanese buyers probably feel as though they understand his speeches just from the nonverbal cues .
“ The audience in the background helped too , ” Professor Nikaido said .
“ The audience ’s echo in the background works the same way as , say , laugh sound effects inserted in TV comedies . ”
That may explain why Ms. Sakai , the beautician , and her customers were so enthralled by Mr. Obama .
Ms. Sakai describes her English skills as less than perfect and says she relies on others for translation when she travels overseas .
But when she hears Mr. Obama talk , she feels perfectly at ease .
RIYADH ( Reuters ) - A Saudi court sentenced a female journalist to 60 lashes in a case brought after a Lebanese television channel she worked for aired the sex confession of a Saudi man , the reporter and a lawyer said .
Rosana , 22 , who did not want her full name disclosed , said a court in Jeddah convicted her on Saturday on grounds that the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation ( LBC ) she worked for did not have proper authorization to operate in the Islamic kingdom .
The ruling follows the sentencing by the same court of Mazen Abdul - Awad to five years in jail and 1,000 lashes earlier in October after he appeared on an LBC show and talked about his sexual exploits .
The show has sparked a public outcry in the U.S. ally , one of the world ’s most conservative countries where clerics have wide - ranging influence and control .
“ I had nothing to do with Mazen Abdul - Jawad ’s show .
The verdict was just because I cooperated with LBC , ” the female journalist told Reuters .
LBC is a popular channel in Saudi Arabia , one of the world ’s most conservative societies , and many Saudis tune into its Western - style entertainment programs and talk shows .
“ I was not aware ( that LBC was unlicensed ) but in the end this is the verdict and I accept it .
I do n’t want to appeal , ” Rosana said .
The court could not be reached , while a spokesman for the information ministry in Riyadh declined to comment .
“ This is the first case in which a journalist was tried at a court of summary jurisdiction for an offence relating to the nature of his or her profession , ” said Sulaiman al - Jumaie , a lawyer who defended Abdul - Jawad .
Saudi authorities closed the LBC offices after the show was aired .
Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is a shareholder in LBC .
Abdul - Jawad , a divorced father of four , was arrested in August after discussing his premarital sexual encounters on LBC ’s “ In Bold Red ” program .
Judges , who are clerics of Saudi Arabia ’s strict Wahhabi school of Islam , have wide powers of discretion and can issue sentences according to their interpretation of Islamic law , which critics said has led to some arbitrary rulings .
King Abdullah has begun to reform education and the judiciary in recent years , partly to discourage Islamic militancy but he faces resistance from clerics .
In - Q - Tel , the investment arm of the CIA , has invested in Visible Technologies , " a leading provider of social media analysis and engagement solutions " .
The move is believed to be part of the CIA ’s aim to utilise the " open source " information available on social networking sites .
In - Q- tel was set up in 1999 to identify " innovative technology solutions to support the mission of the CIA and the broader U.S. Intelligence Community " .
Troy Pearsall , executive vice president of architecture and engineering at In - Q - Tel , said : " Visible Technologies ' platform is key to understanding the breadth and depth of the online social landscape .
" Its platform delivers a clear and comprehensive view of complex information , integrating real - time data into a navigable and easy - to - use application that understands the context and tone of online dialogue . "
Visible listens in to around half a million sites a day covering forums and blogs .
It also crawls commercial sites with forums such as Amazon .
The only sites it cannot reach are closed networks such as Facebook .
Customers of Visible receive real - time feeds on a required subject , based on a series of keywords .
These are scored as neutral , positive or negative depending on the message and the influence of the writer .
Neither Visible , which expects revenues of about £ 20 m next year , or In - Q - Tel would divulge the size of the investment .
According to sources at the company , the money will be used to boost its language capabilities .
Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists said it was legal to monitor social networking sites but there were restrictions as to how this could be used .
In a Wired magazine report , he said : " Even if information is openly gathered by intelligence agencies it would still be problematic if it were used for unauthorized domestic investigations or operations .
" Intelligence agencies or employees might be tempted to use the tools at their disposal to compile information on political figures , critics , journalists or others , and to exploit such information for political advantage .
" That is not permissible even if all of the information in question is technically ' open source ' . "
Visible Technologies currently works with clients including Microsoft , Hormel and Xerox .
Keith Bardwell is happy to marry couples of the same race A white US justice of the peace has been criticised for refusing to issue marriage licences to mixed - race couples .
Keith Bardwell , of Tangipahoa Parish in Louisiana , denied racism but said mixed - race children were not readily accepted by their parents ' communities .
A couple he refused to marry are considering filing a complaint about him to the US Justice Department .
Mr Bardwell said he had often conducted the weddings of his black friends .
' No integration ' Mr Bardwell , who has worked in the role for 34 years , said that in his experience most interracial marriages did not last very long and estimated that he had refused applications to four couples in the past two - and - a - half years .
He said he had " piles and piles of black friends " but just did not believe in " mixing the races " .
" They come to my home , I marry them , they use my bathroom .
I treat them just like everyone else , " he said .
He said he had discussed the issue with both black and white people before making his decision .
" There is a problem with both groups accepting a child from such a marriage , " he said " I think those children suffer and I wo n't help put them through it . "
I try to treat everyone equally
Keith Bardwell
Mr Bardwell added that he checked the race of the couple in question , 30 - year - old Beth Humphrey and 32 - year - old Terence McKay , when they first phoned him requesting a marriage licence .
Ms Humphrey , who is white , said that when she phoned Mr Bardwell on 6 October to discuss getting a marriage licence signed his wife told her about his stance .
Mrs Bardwell recommended that the couple see another justice of the peace , who did agree to marry them .
Ms Humphrey said she had not expected such comments " in this day and age " and that she was looking forward to having children with her husband .
American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana attorney Katie Schwartzmann said that her organisation had requested an investigation into Mr Bardwell , describing the case as one of " bigotry " .
She said the Supreme Court ruled in 1967 " that the government cannot tell people who they can and cannot marry " and that Mr Bardwell had knowingly broken the law .
However , Mr Bardwell denied mistreating anyone and said if he oversaw one mixed - race marriage , then he would have to continue to do it for everyone .
He said : " I try to treat everyone equally . "

The chance to bring the Olympics to a continent that had never hosted the Games worked in Rio ’s favor .
During its presentation , the bid team showed a graphic of the world and marked all the places that have held an Olympics .
South America was glaringly bare .
Image People gathering in downtown Chicago reacted to the announcement that the city had been eliminated from contention for the 2016 Olympics .

“ There was absolutely no flaw in the bid , ” the I.O.C. president , Jacques Rogge , said .
Chicago officials had worked nearly four years and spent nearly $ 50 million to bring the Summer Olympics to the United States for the first time since the 1996 Atlanta Games .
There were many possible explanations for Chicago ’s spectacular failure , but little consensus .
Some pointed to the regional bloc voting in the treacherous first round .
Others said some voters , assuming Chicago was a lock to advance because of the presence of Mr. Obama and his wife , Michelle , might have taken their early votes elsewhere .
Many also blamed the rocky relationship between the United States Olympic Committee and the I.O.C .
Others said there was no explaining it .
“ Everybody was shocked at that result , ” said Rene Fasel , an I.O.C. member from Switzerland , regarding Chicago ’s first - round ouster .
“ Everybody expected Chicago and Rio , everybody .
It was really strange , and I feel really sorry .
If it would have been Chicago and Rio in the end , it would have been much closer . ”
Anita DeFrantz , one of two I.O.C. members from the United States , said she could not believe how the vote unfolded , particularly after the Obamas ’ visit .
“ I hate the fact that these elegant people were here and then our country got treated that way , ” she said .

( CNN ) -- Leading Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan says he was detained for nearly two hours Friday night at New Jersey 's Newark International Airport because of his last name .
Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan said he was detained by authorities at the Newark , New Jersey , airport .
In an interview with CNN 's sister network in India , CNN - IBN , Khan said immigration officials at the airport detained him for questioning after they said his name was flagged .
" They kept on telling me that my name is common to some name that has popped up on the computer , so they need to follow procedure , " he said .
" It took them an hour and a half , two hours ; they kept on asking me questions , if I could give them any ... numbers in America that they can contact and vouch for me and who I am . "
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said the agency could not comment on specific incidents .
" I was really taken aback because there were people who knew me there , " Khan told CNN - IBN , referring to other travelers who were nearby .
Rajeev Shukla , the secretary of India 's ruling Congress party and a friend of Khan's , told CNN that the actor called him from Newark , as well as Khan 's secretary and family .
Shukla said Khan , who was en route to Chicago , Illinois , was allowed to leave after Indian Embassy officials intervened .

If you would like to be satisfied with Senate majority leader Harry Reid 's position on healthcare reform , please select from the following menu :
28 July : " What I think should be in the bill is something that I will vote for according to my conscience when we get this bill to the floor .
...
But I have a responsibility to get a bill to the Senate floor that will get 60 votes that we can proceed toward .
That 's my number one responsibility . "
28 August : " I am in favour of the public option .
...
There 's a lot of people who misunderstand this .
They think it 's some government programme .
But there are many ways we can do it .
One would be to have an entity like Medicare .
I really do n't favour that .
I think what we should have is a private entity that ... has direction from the federal government , so that people who do n't fall within the parameters of being able to get insurance from their employer , they would have a place to go . "
10 September : " If we can come up with a concept of a co-operative that does just that , that is , it makes more competition and makes insurance companies honest , yes , I think that would fit the bill . "
24 September : A " trigger " by which there would only be a public option if insurance companies fail to meet unspecified conditions is " a pretty doggone good idea " .
1 October : " Remember , a public option is a relative term .
...
There 's a public option , there 's a public option and there 's a public option .
And we 're going to look at each of them . "
To recap : Reid supports whatever can get 60 votes .
He also supports the public option , so long as it's private , a co-op , a trigger and finally , an ethereal concept .
Reid sat on his hands while the Senate finance committee frittered away the last few months mauling its healthcare legislation into a gift for the insurance industry .
Interfering with committee work just is n't Reid 's style .
Yet as soon as he learned that the bill would force Nevada , the nation 's cheapest state , to spend more money to expand its stingy Medicaid programme , Reid was suddenly demanding – and getting – changes in the legislation .
Then he crowed and crowed about his magnificent influence to the voters back home where he trails second - and third - tier Republican challengers in his bid for re-election .
It is up to Reid to merge the finance committee 's Insurance Industry Coddling Act of 2009 and the more promising reform bill that passed the Senate health , education , labour and pensions committee , and speculation is rampant as to what Reid will or wo n't include in the bill he takes to the Senate floor or fight for in a House - Senate conference , particularly with regard to a strong public option .
I 'm going to refrain from such speculation .
I will , however , hazard a guess as to how the choice will be made : Reid 's decision will not be based on what reform would be best for the country or on whether he can get his ( questionably necessary ) 60 votes .
Instead , Reid 's actions will hinge on a callous calculation of what is in his own individual political best interest as he sees it , based on his keen sense of an electorate that he was last in touch with in , oh , maybe 1998 .
With luck , the opportunist 's hackneyed political judgment will just happen to coincide with good public policy .
I put the odds at about 50 - 50 .
Get Out of Jail Free : Monopoly 's Hidden Maps
Silk Escape Maps Concealed in Game Boards Helped WWII Prisoners
It 's a story that will forever change the way you think of the phrase , " Get Out of Jail Free . "
During World War II , as the number of British airmen held hostage behind enemy lines escalated , the country 's secret service enlisted an unlikely partner in the ongoing war effort :
The board game Monopoly .
It was the perfect accomplice .
Included in the items the German army allowed humanitarian groups to distribute in care packages to imprisoned soldiers , the game was too innocent to raise suspicion .
But it was the ideal size for a top - secret escape kit that could help spring British POWs from German war camps .
The British secret service conspired with the U.K. manufacturer to stuff a compass , small metal tools , such as files , and , most importantly , a map , into cut - out compartments in the Monopoly board itself .
" It was ingenious , " said Philip Orbanes , author of several books on Monopoly , including " The World 's Most Famous Game and How it Got That Way . "
" The Monopoly box was big enough to not only hold the game but hide everything else they needed to get to POWs . "
British historians say it could have helped thousands of captured soldiers escape .
So how did a simple board game end up in a position to help out one of the most powerful military forces on the planet ?
Silk and serendipity .
Silk Maps Were Key Escape Kit Elements
Of all the tools in a military - grade escape kit , the most critical item was the map .
But paper maps proved too fragile and cumbersome , said Debbie Hall , a cataloguer in the map room at the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford in Oxford , England .
For hundreds of years , even before World War II , silk was the material of choice for military maps , Hall said , because it would n't tear or dissolve in water as easily as paper and was light enough to stuff into a boot or cigarette packet .
Unlike maps printed on paper , silk maps also would n't rustle and attract the attention of enemy guards , she said .
" Initially , they had some problems printing on silk , " Hall said .
" It 's quite technically challenging . "
But then MI9 , the British secret service unit responsible for escape and evasion , found the one British company that had mastered printing on silk : John Waddington Ltd. , a printer and board game manufacturer that also happened to be the U.K. licensee for the Parker Bros. game Monopoly .
" Waddingtons in the pre-war era was printing on silk for theater programs .
For celebration events for royalty and that kind of thing , " said Victor Watson , 80 , who retired as chairman of the company in 1993 .
" It made a name for itself for being able to print on silk . "
He was just a child during the war but said his father Norman Watson , president of the company at the time , worked with British secret service to embed the maps in Monopoly games .
He said a secret service officer named E.D. Alston ( known around Waddington as " Mr. A. " ) used to come by to place the orders in person .
" Because he was in the secret service , I never knew who he was , " Watson said .
Former circuit judge Herman Thomas has denied abusing inmates
The trial of a former US judge accused of having sex with male inmates in exchange for leniency is set to start in Mobile , Alabama .
Herman Thomas , 48 , denies the charges , which include sodomy , kidnapping , extortion , sex abuse and assault .
Up to 15 current and former prisoners are set to testify against him at the jury trial .
He was once the Democratic Party 's choice to be the first black federal judge in south Alabama .
Mr Thomas resigned as a judge in 2007 following allegations that he spanked inmates in his private office at the county courthouse with a paddle .
' Private meetings '
In April this year , he was indicted on more serious charges .
If he is convicted of the charges of kidnapping , he could face a sentence of life in prison .
Court records show that some of the inmates involved said they were checked out of jail for meetings with the defendant in either his car or in his office .
They claim they were abused during these meetings .
However , Mr Thomas 's lawyer , Robert Clark , has said the alleged victims were trying to ruin his client 's career .
In April , he described the situation as a " a high - tech lynching " and said it was politically motivated .
He said : " They do n't like uppity black folks , and that 's what they consider Herman . "
Mr Thomas 's licence to practise has already been suspended .
' Surprise '
He has previously said he was trying to mentor the inmates .
A former Democratic state senator and colleague , Bob Eddington , said : " I 've always had the highest regard for him .
" The allegations were a complete surprise to me and everyone else who knew him . "
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , a civil rights organisation , has said that Mr Thomas is being prosecuted because of his race .
The trial is set to last several weeks .
Unicode® 5.2.0
Released : 2009 October 1 ( Announcement )
Version 5.2.0 has been superseded by the latest version of the Unicode Standard .
Version 5.2.0 of the Unicode Standard consists of the core specification ( The Unicode Standard , Version 5.2 ) , together with the delta and archival code charts for this version , the 5.2.0 Unicode Standard Annexes , and the 5.2.0 Unicode Character Database ( UCD ) .
The core specification gives the general principles , requirements for conformance , and guidelines for implementers .
The code charts show representative glyphs for all the Unicode characters .
The Unicode Standard Annexes supply detailed normative information about particular aspects of the standard .
The Unicode Character Database supplies normative and informative data for implementers to allow them to implement the Unicode Standard .
Version 5.2.0 of the Unicode Standard should be referenced as :
The Unicode Consortium .
The Unicode Standard , Version 5.2.0 , defined by : The Unicode Standard , Version 5.2 ( Mountain View , CA : The Unicode Consortium , 2009 .
ISBN 978-1-936213-00 -9 ) .
( http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/)
A complete specification of the contributory files for Unicode 5.2.0 is found on the page Components for 5.2.0 .
That page also provides the recommended reference format for Unicode Standard Annexes .
The text of The Unicode Standard , Version 5.2 , as well as the delta and archival code charts , is available via the navigation links on this page .
The charts and the Unicode Standard Annexes may be printed , while the other files may be viewed but not printed .
The Unicode 5.2 Web Bookmarks page has links to all sections of the online text .
A zipped version of the core specification ( 10 MB ) is also available for download .
This page summarizes important changes to the standard from Unicode 5.1.0 .
The core specification and the Unicode Standard Annexes are not delta documents ; they incorporate all of the textual changes for their updates for Version 5.2.0 .
The Unicode Standard , Version 5.2 , adds 6,648 characters and significantly improves the documentation of conformance requirements for the specification of normalization forms , canonical ordering , and the status of types of properties .
Version 5.2 brings improved clarity of presentation in many Unicode Standard Annexes .
Seven new contemporary scripts have been added in Version 5.2 : Bamum , Javanese , Lisu , Meetei Mayek , Samaritan , Tai Tham , and Tai Viet .
New character additions to existing scripts now provide greater support for Abkhaz , Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics , Coptic , Devanagari , Khamti Shan , Malayalam , and Myanmar .
Of particular note are Devanagari additions in support of Vedic Sanskrit .
Encoding Vedic is significant because Sanskrit is one of the principal languages for the religious heritage of India , and because Vedic represents the earliest attested phase of the language .
The seven contemporary scripts and newly encoded individual characters expand support of language and orthographic communities in Africa , India , China , Central Asia , Southeast Asia , and the Middle East .
Other character additions include important modern use symbols and historic characters .
With Unicode Version 5.2 , scholars will now have access to the Gardiner set of Egyptian Hieroglyphs as well as other important historic scripts : Imperial Aramaic , Avestan , Kaithi , Old South Arabian , and Old Turkic .
Several key symbol sets were added or expanded : the ARIB set of Japanese broadcasting symbols , additional number forms used in India , and currency symbols .
This latest version of the Unicode Standard has exactly the same character assignments as ISO / IEC 10646:2003 plus Amendments 1 through 6 .
Unicode Version 5.2 :
Updates stability policies to add property value stability guarantees for identifier - related properties , a guarantee of property , property alias and property value alias stability , and a policy on alias uniqueness .
Incorporates into Chapter 3 , Conformance the formal definitions of normalization formerly presented in Unicode Standard Annex # 15 , " Unicode Normalization Forms . "
Sections that were modified include sections 3.6 and 3.11 .
the formal definitions of normalization formerly presented in . "
Sections that were modified include sections 3.6 and 3.11 .
Revises Section 3.5 , Properties to better explain the status of Normative , Informative , Provisional , and Contributory properties .

Clarifies the definition of Deprecated and its relationship to ” strongly discouraged , ” and updates the set of Deprecated characters in view of this clearer definition .
Updates best practices for the use of replacement characters .
Improves the description of compatibility characters in Chapter 2 , General Structure .
.
Adds standardized named sequences for Tamil .
Contains significant changes to properties and behavioral specifications .
Errata incorporated into Unicode 5.2.0 are listed by date in a separate table .
For corrigenda and errata after the release of Unicode 5.2.0 , see the list of current Updates and Errata .
The Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy has been updated .
This update strengthens normalization stability , adds stability policy for case pairs , and extends constraints on property values .
For the current statement of these policies , see Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy .
6,648 new character assignments were made to the Unicode Standard , Version 5.2.0 ( over and above what was in Unicode 5.1.0 ) .
The character repertoire corresponds to ISO / IEC 10646:2003 plus Amendments 1 through 6 .
The exact list of characters added for Version 5.2.0 is documented in the file DerivedAge. txt in the Unicode Character Database .
Among the characters added , there are a few notable cases which may impact existing implementations .
These cases are highlighted here , so that implementers can check for any problematical assumptions in their code .
There are three new characters in the newly - encoded Kaithi script that will require changes in implementations which make hard - coded assumptions about composition during normalization .
Most new characters added to the standard with decompositions cannot be generated by the operations toNFC ( ) or toNFKC ( ) , but these three can .
Implementers should check their code carefully to ensure that it handles these three characters correctly .
U+1109A KAITHI LETTER DDDHA U+1109C KAITHI LETTER RHA U+110 AB KAITHI LETTER VA
One of the compatibility CJK ideographs added in this version has a decomposition mapping to a unified CJK ideograph in Extension B .
The effect of this is that for the first time a character in the BMP normalizes to a character not in the BMP : toNFC ( U+FA6C ) = U+242EE
Implementers should check their implementations of normalization to ensure they are not assuming that no BMP character can normalize to a non-BMP character .
Implementers should check their implementations of normalization to ensure they are not assuming that no BMP character can normalize to a non-BMP character .
Any hard - coded range assumptions about Unified CJK Ideographs in implementations may need fixing , because the end range for those has changed from U+9FC3 to U+9FCB in this version .
There is also an entirely new block of CJK Unified Ideographs : CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C ( U+2A700..U+2B73 F ) , with characters encoded in the range U+2A700 to U+2B734 .
There is now an assigned Hangul jamo character at U+11A7 .
This may interfere with some implementations ' boundary testing for Hangul decomposition .
There are a number of new Hangul jamo characters added for support of Old Korean .
Some of these are encoded in new blocks .
An implementation may run into trouble if it assumes that the repertoire of conjoining jamos is fixed , or that all conjoining jamos occur only in the Hangul Jamo block , U+1100 .. U+11 FF .
New uppercase parenthesized symbols have been added .
Unlike the circled letter symbols , there are no uppercase / lowercase relationships for these new characters .
Character Assignment Overview
The new character additions were to both the BMP and the SMP ( Plane 1 ) .
The following table shows the allocation of code points in Unicode 5.2.0 .
For more information on the specific characters , see the file DerivedAge. txt in the Unicode Character Database .
For more details of character counts , see Appendix D , Changes from Previous Versions in Unicode 5.2 .

There are several changes to conformance requirements in Unicode 5.2 that impact implementations .
The most important of these are noted specifically here .
The formal definitions of normalization formerly presented in Unicode Standard Annex # 15 , " Unicode Normalization Forms , " have been moved to Chapter 3 , Conformance .
.
A key conformance clause on the modification of character sequences , C7 , has been tightened to eliminate security risks resulting from deletion of noncharacters from uninterpreted text strings .
In Unicode 5.2 , the conformance requirements now disallow their removal , except where strings are explicitly being modified .
The status of Normative , Informative , Provisional , and Contributory properties is clarified in Section 3.5 Properties .
.
The types of code points are clarified in Chapters 2 , 3 , and 4 , with coordinated updates in Unicode Standard Annex # 44 , " Unicode Character Database . "
The PropertyAliases.txt file in the Unicode Character Database is now designated as the normative listing of Unicode character properties and their names .
The BidiTest.txt file in the Unicode Character Database is a new feature in Unicode 5.2 .
This file contains test cases for assessing conformance to the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm .
There are additional changes in Unicode conformance requirements due to changes in the UCD data files and the Unicode Standard Annexes listed below .
The detailed listing of all changes to the contributory data files of the Unicode Character Database for Version 5.2.0 can be found in UAX # 44 , Unicode Character Database .
The most significant changes include :
There are new case - related properties in DerivedCoreProperties.txt and DerivedNormalizationProps.txt .
The new case - related derived properties are NFKC_Casefold , Case_Ignorable , Cased , Changes_When_Lowercased , Changes_When_Uppercased , Changes_When_Titlecased , Changes_When_Casemapped , Changes_When_Casefolded , and Changes_When_NFKC_Casefolded .
Contributory is considered to be a distinct status for a Unicode character property .
Contributory properties are neither normative nor informative .
The status of all character properties is listed in the property table in UAX # 44 , Unicode Character Database .
is considered to be a distinct status for a Unicode character property .
Contributory properties are neither nor .
The status of all character properties is listed in the property table in UAX # 44 , Unicode Character Database .
Two new joining groups , FARSI YEH and NYA , were added .
These new joining groups may require an update to implementations of Arabic shaping rules .
There is a new data file in the Unicode Character Database , CJKRadicals.txt , which maps the radical numbers used in the Unicode Radical - Stroke Index to the actual Unicode code points for the corresponding radicals .
Unlike other files , the first field is not a code point number .
a code point number .
The Unihan. txt file in Unihan.zip is split into 8 separate files within the zip file , organized by category .
See UAX # 38 , Unicode Han Database ( Unihan ) for details .
In Version 5.2 , many of the Unicode Standard Annexes have had significant revisions .
The most important of these changes are listed below .
For the full details of all changes , see the Modifications section of each UAX , linked directly from the following list of UAXes .
He can't answer phones or sign official business documents , but Lisa Ross - Williams and Kenny Williams credit 9 - year - old Riley with creating the cornerstone for their Equi-Spirit Toys & Tools business .
The spunky colt of unknown breed had a knack for breaking every play ball tossed his way .
After many disappointing and short - lived rounds of kickball , the Cornville couple finally got their hands on a ball that would n't burst , no matter how much Riley kicked it or lay on top of it .
It did n't take long for the equine enthusiasts to realize they had found more than a new toy for their horse , after fellow horse lovers said they were hunting for a similar product .
It took a year of research , field testing and negotiating with the manufacturer to become the exclusive equine distributor for the ball .
Three years later , Lisa and Kenny 's animal - toy business has prospered , with the couple selling their Equi -Spirit balls all over the world .
The key to the oversized ball 's durability is an inner PVC bladder that 's covered with a tough fabric .
But the ball can be punctured , and while the ball 's casing can be repaired , punctured bladders must be replaced .
It comes deflated with detailed yet fairly easy instructions on how to inflate it or repair punctures caused by large thorns or barbed wire .
The 25 - and 40 - inch balls come in different colors and patterns , including soccer and basketball patterns and a smiley face , and range in price from $ 66 to $ 121 .
Cones , mini-balls and a ball with spikes are part of the Equi - Spirit toy lineup .
Ross -Williams said sales have doubled every year , with dogs , camels , seals , elephants and even dolphins playing with the balls .
Canine and feline toy lines are in the works .
" We did not expect ( this ) , not at all , " she said .
" We thought some sales in U.S. , but had no idea what it turned into . "
Their product 's popularity has spurred knockoffs .
Although they sought legal counsel a few times , the pair has learned knockoffs come with the territory .
" It 's a shame , but we 've learned not to waste too much energy on those people , " Ross - Williams said .
" We 'd rather be working toward putting energy toward something positive . " .
Lisa , an Iowa native , met Kenny , a Pennsylvanian , when each held law - enforcement positions in the Air Force .
Both have extensive equine experience with emphasis on homeopathic and holistic care and treatment .
Ross -Williams hosts the webcast " If Your Horse Could Talk " and is the associate editor of Natural Horse Magazine .
Her husband co-hosts the webcast and both provide free horse education through the site and run the Talking Horse Ranch Educational Center .
" Ball sales support the Web site , which gives us the ability to help people , " Williams said .
" We are very passionate about empowering people and horses . "
The couple have been married 18 years and say their " children " are the seven equines that have been rescued from abuse or neglect , including Riley , who was acquired at auction when he was just a few weeks old .
" They really found us , " Williams said .
" When you see them , you know they deserve to be with us . "
The pair network with veterinarians worldwide , and many say that free play and regular exercise contribute to horses ' improved health , lowered stress and anger levels , and longer life spans .
Ross -Williams said playing comes naturally to horses , who love to run and have fun every chance they get .
" It 's great physical and mental stimulation , and the horse develops muscle tone , " Williams said .
" Horses can exercise by themselves ( and ) for those horses that are alone , the ball becomes a friend . "
The business helps the pair support charitable organizations , including those that provide riding therapy to people with disabilities , at - risk children and adults with emotional challenges .

Take all of this stuff as rumor … but I do n’t see any evidence that would lead me to believe it is DEFINITELY fake .
Time will certainly tell .
And time might be next week or the week after .
As reported by The Street , Motorola and Verizon Wireless might just announce the Sholes / Tao / Droid at the MOTODEV summit or CTIA which takes place in San Diego next week .
That would make a ton of sense … but the BGR tipster says we should expect a 1 week delay at least .
Were you able to take all of that in ?!?!?
Because of this divide , our government has not been able to put in place the long - term policies needed to guard against detonating our mounting debt bomb and climate bomb .
As such , we ’re in effect putting our kids ’ future in the hands of the two most merciless forces on the planet : the Market and Mother Nature .
As the environmentalist Rob Watson likes to say , “ Mother Nature is just chemistry , biology and physics . ”
That ’s all she is .
You ca n’t spin her ; you ca n’t sweet - talk her .
You ca n’t say , “ Hey , Mother Nature , we ’re having a bad recession , could you take a year off ? ”
No , she ’s going to do whatever chemistry , biology and physics dictate , based on the amount of carbon we put in the atmosphere , and as Watson likes to add : “ Mother Nature always bats last , and she always bats a thousand . ”
Ditto the market .
The market is just a second - by - second snapshot of the balance between greed and fear .
You ca n’t spin it or sweet - talk it .
And you never know when that balance between greed and fear on the dollar is going to tip over into fear in a nonlinear way .
That is why I was heartened to see the liberal Center for American Progress stating last week that , while the stimulus is vital to rescuing our economy , the size of projected budget deficits demand that we also start thinking about broad - based tax increases and reductions in some spending and entitlement programs supported by liberals .
I am equally heartened when I see Republicans like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger urging his party to start taking climate change seriously .
But we also need to act .
If we do n’t , we will be leaving our children to the tender mercies of the Market and Mother Nature alone to shape their futures .
This moment reminds me of an image John Holdren , the president ’s science adviser , uses when discussing the threat of climate change , but it also applies to the dollar : “ We ’re driving in a car with bad brakes in a fog and heading for a cliff .
We know for sure that cliff is out there .
We just do n’t know exactly where it is .
Prudence would suggest that we should start putting on the brakes . ”
A reader question from Lalithra Fernando :
I notice you using words like ATTRACTOR and NEMESIS when describing characters .
Where is this from ?
I would like to read / learn more about this .
For several years , I have been working on a theory that most mainstream movies have five character archetypes present as primary characters : Protagonist , Nemesis , Attractor , Mentor , Trickster .
Here is a summary of the basic principles to this approach :
If a screenplay is unique as a blueprint to make a movie , then I would argue that it is also unique in that the characters create a psychological ‘ map ’ of the story , each character playing a core narrative function what we can call an archetype .
Simply put , an archetype is an ideal example of a character which has a specific narrative function .
Generally , it ’s possible to assess the characters in a screenplay and ‘ assign ’ an archetype to them .
There are literally hundreds of archetypes in stories and literature , but I contend there are five primary character archetypes that appear in most movies : Protagonist Nemesis Attractor Mentor Trickster
At first blush , you may think these are artificial categories ; however , I contend that they are natural extensions from a story ’s central character : the Protagonist .
How ?
By asking seven basic questions tied directly to the Protagonist : * Who is the story ’s Protagonist ?
The first , most basic question of any story .
*
What does the Protagonist want ?
This is the Protagonist ’s External World goal and is tied to the Plotline ’s end point .
*
What does the Protagonist need ?
This is the Protagonist ’s Internal World goal and is tied to their transformation end point .
* Who is trying to keep the Protagonist from their goal ?
This is the story ’s Nemesis who functions in opposition to the Protagonist .
*
Who is connected to the Protagonist ’s emotional growth ?
This is the story ’s Attractor who functions in connection with the Protagonist ’s ‘ heart . ’ *
Who is connected to the Protagonist ’s intellectual growth ?
This is the story ’s Mentor who functions in connection with the Protagonist ’s ‘ head . ’ * Who tests the Protagonist to prepare them for the Final Struggle ?
This is the story ’s Trickster who functions sometimes as P ’s ally , sometimes as P ’s enemy .
These five are the primary character archetypes present in most movies and they function as integral parts , both in the plot and in the Protagonist ’s psychological journey . ’
This represents a different way to develop and write a screenplay , not your typical linear three - act or eight - sequence structural paradigm , but a character - based approach .
And I ’m confident in its value to writers for three reasons :
* The material is inspired by the work of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung .
* I have analyzed over 100 movies whose screenplays were nominated for a WGA and / or Academy Award — from classics like The Wizard of Oz , Casablanca , and The Apartment to contemporary movies like The Dark Knight , Slumdog Millionaire , and Juno — and found these archetypes at work in all of them .
* I have taught this material several times in the last few years — in fact , I ’m in the middle of a character archetypes course at UNC - Chapel Hill this semester — and the response I ’ve gotten from students every time I ’ve taught the material is overwhelmingly positive .
You can go here and here to see my analysis of The Wizard of Oz using character archetypes .
For years , students pressed me to write a book about screenwriting , based on my approach to story structure — Narrative Throughline paradigm .
But I refused because ( A ) there are already so many books on the market that focus on structure and ( B ) Narrative Throughline is just another variation on those same themes .
The character archetype model is different .
I definitely feel like it ’s worth adding to the ‘ conversation ’ about the craft of screenwriting .

With the new agreement , however , the White House has now moderated that position .
“ We expect this proposal to move forward with bipartisan support , and the president looks forward to signing it into law , ” said Ben LaBolt , a White House spokesman , who noted that the Obama administration was “ the first administration in history to support media shield legislation . ”
The protection would apply not only against subpoenas for reporters ’ testimony or information but also against investigative efforts to obtain phone and Internet records to find out who had been talking with them .
Under the agreement , the scope of protection for reporters seeking to shield the identities of confidential sources would vary according to the nature of the case : civil , criminal or national security .
In civil cases , the litigants seeking to force reporters to testify would first have to exhaust all other means of obtaining the information .
Even then , the judge would apply a “ balancing test , ” and the burden would be on the information seekers to show by a “ preponderance of the evidence ” why their need for the testimony outweighed the public ’s interest in news gathering .
Ordinary criminal cases , as in prosecutors ’ effort to find out who leaked grand jury information about professional athletes ’ steroid use to The San Francisco Chronicle , would work the same way , except that the balancing test would be heavily tilted in favor of prosecutors .
For a judge to quash a subpoena , the burden would be on a reporter to make it “ clear and convincing ” that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail .
Dear President Obama ,
I am deeply saddened to say that I live in a country that protests -- from ocean to ocean -- when Coca Cola changed the flavor of classic coke , but seems to remain silent when NASA bombs the moon .
I am 58 - years - old and have lived through the trails of destruction of many presidents , hoping that one day there will come a president that truly is spiritually aware -- a president that truly cares about the planet and its people forsaking neither for the almighty dollar .
I believe you are that president .
However , I am appalled that you did not or could not prevent this horrific action by NASA .
This planet and women , in particular , are connected to the moon in a very spiritual and physical ways .
Our bodies run with the moon 's phases .
The cycles of a woman , our oceans ' tides and the food that we grow is affected by the moons ' phases .
The effects of the moon on this planet are endless .
If the moon is destroyed or altered in any way , then so is every woman and so is every living thing on this planet .
It is amazing to me that in today 's world , where so many people are enlightened , that this country still works out of the dark ages .
We go nowhere in peace and without destruction .
Why is it so impossible to clean up our mess here on this planet , instead of looking for another planet to destroy ?
Can we not walk lightly and carry the torch of peace and hope and freedom ?
Instead , we are thought of as ignorant barbarians where we were once leaders .
I implore you , Mr. President , to please stop NASA from further destroying the moon and what would in turn be the destruction of planet Earth .

There ’s been a varied reaction to questions raised by a Danish anti-doping researcher about the blood values that Lance Armstrong exhibited during this year ’s Tour de France .
The scientist Jakob Mørkeberg and his supervisor Bo Belhage have elaborated on their details , the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) and World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) has largely declined to comment , and Astana anti-doping monitor Rasmus Damsgaard has said that it is up to an expert panel to assess whether or not the values are unusual .
Cyclingnews has sought to speak to all of the parties concerned in recent days .
There has been no response to date from Lance Armstrong ’s representatives , but others have given their opinion on the matter .
As none of the individual parameters concerned cross set thresholds , the matter is a difficult one to judge ; the analysis is based on the evolution of certain values , looking at longitudinal data in a similar fashion to the methods used under the UCI ’s biological passport .
Mørkeberg has said that natural factors could possibly be an explanation , although at the same time both he and Belhage have described the progression of blood values as unusual and worthy of further scrutiny .
The questions raised
Last week Jakob Mørkeberg was quoted by the Danish news outlet DR Sport as saying that he had concerns about blood values posted by Lance Armstrong on the Livestrong.com website ( link to external website opens in new window ) .
The Bispebjerg Hospital anti-doping researcher has worked on many scientific studies , including a 2008 paper co-written with Belhage and Damsgaard entitled Changes in Blood Profiles during Tour de France 2007 , and stated that expected trends over a three week race were not seen in the Texan ’s data .
" What we know from our research is that during periods of hard activity , like in the Tour de France , we normally see a drop in these blood values .
We do n't see this with Armstrong , " he told DR Sport .
He elaborated on this when speaking to Cyclingnews .
“ His blood profile contradicts what we see and what we know from international studies during the last few decades , ” he said in a phone interview .
“ His blood values are not acting as we would expect , so that is highly unusual . ” ( see sidebar )
Mørkeberg has just finished a Ph. D. dissertation entitled Detection of Autologous Blood Transfusions via Analyses of Peripheral Blood Samples , and is working on a method to trace this method of doping .
His aforementioned Tour de France study catalogued seven riders in the 2007 race , revealing lower hemoglobin and lower hematocrit ( percentage of red blood cells in whole blood ) on day 19 when compared to their pre-Tour reading .
On average hemoglobin dropped 11.5 % and hematocrit fell by 12.1 % , keeping in line with physiological expectations .
Mørkeberg ’s questioning about Armstrong ’s
Tour values stem from two facts ; firstly , there is no significant difference between those two blood markers at the start and end of the race , and secondly , the values rise on two occasions during the event , around the time of the two rest days .
In addition to that , they say that his reticulocyte ( new red blood cell ) levels are below expected levels , something which Mørkeberg and Belhage state can also be an indication of blood doping .
" It could be that he received some blood transfusions , ” Mørkeberg told DR Sport .
“ This is not to say that he has [ definitely ] received one , but it could be an explanation . "
He was asked if there were any other possible reasons .
“ If he had , for example , diarrhoea , and was dehydrated , it could lead to an increase in blood values , " he answered .
" But the picture is inconsistent with what we normally see .
Armstrong 's levels are unchanged from the first to the last test , and normally we expect a decrease .
We saw this fall in his levels during the Giro d'Italia a couple of months earlier , but not during the Tour . "
His superior backed up the questions asked by Mørkeberg .
“ I am completely in agreement with Jakob about his interpretation of the results , ” he told Cyclingnews .
“ They are not normal , not dropping when you should expect them to drop .
And on the other hand , the reticulocytes are dropping when they should n’t .
“ Of course we can not state that he is doping , ” he added .
“ What we can say is that there are some similarities to our test subjects in the laboratory when we had given them external blood . ”
The responses given
Given the gravity of the questions raised , Cyclingnews contacted Lance Armstrong ’s spokesman Mark Higgins for comment .
However , at the time of writing , no response has been received .
We will publish his reply if and when it is issued .
The only comment given by Armstrong to date is a brief message on his Twitter feed : “ How do I say " ssdd " [ same shit , different day - Ed ] in Danish ? ” he wrote last Thursday .
Cyclingnews spoke to Dr Rasmus Damsgaard on Monday about the claims .
Damsgaard currently works with both Astana and Saxo Bank to interpret their biological passport results , and was previously involved – along with former Bispebjerg Hospital colleagues Belhage and Mørkeberg – in coordinating and analysing the CSC / Saxo Bank and Astana internal anti-doping programmes .
He no longer works with the hospital and is now a consultant to the two teams , interpreting their biological passport results .
Damsgaard said that he was not satisfied that Armstrong ’s results indicate wrong - doing on his part .
“ Using those guidelines that need to be beyond any reasonable doubt , I have not established that there was any illegal matter in this case , ” he said .
He added that he had faith that the UCI ’s biological passport panel would fully scrutinise the results and their decision should be respected .
“ I ’m just one person and even if I miss something , I have full confidence in the UCI expert panel that they would find it , ” he said .
“ There are 10 or 12 experts with different points of view and they can look through it better than I can on my own . ”
Given that Armstrong ’s start and finish blood values in the Tour were almost identical , Cyclingnews quoted the scientific paper written by Damsgaard , Mørkeberg and Belhage on 2007 Tour de France riders , where significant drops were seen in hemoglobin and hematocrit .
Taking this finding into consideration , does Damsgaard understand why Mørkeberg is asking questions ?
“ I always understand why people ask questions and I definitely think that they should keep asking questions , ” he answered .
“ What I think is that there were seven riders in the paper that we wrote together …knowing that a million biological factors can influence , I think that as a person of science you need to make the public aware that these are not unique results , these are results that are based on a lot of biological factors that have to be established .
“ Before you can say beyond any reasonable doubt that a fault has been seen , you have to know all the biological factors from a scientific point of view …
You need to consider what different factors might influence things , even all the way back to the genetic factors .
I know that there are some controlled studies showing some kind of pattern , but it is far from fully proven that this kind of pattern is the one to be expected . ”
A logical follow - up question to that is , even if Armstrong has a unique physiology , how do his Tour results square with those from the Giro , which showed over a five point drop in hematocrit ?
“ I can speculate a lot between the two races and the differences between the two , ” Damsgaard answered .
“ [ But ] these kinds of blood profiles should be exposed to the scientific algorithms , to the Bayesian model and WADA and UCI rules of upper and lower limits .
They should be considered by an expert group with a lot of experience , by 10 or 15 people . ”
While Damsgaard describes Mørkebjerg as a “ very competent researcher ” , his contention is that concerns should be studied and any doping proved before the media is involved .
“ I know with my work with the teams , with the UCI and FIS [ the international skiing federation ] , you have to establish that each result is correct before making any accusation , ” he said .
“ I believe if you call WADA , they ’ll say that the one of the most essential parts is to be able to follow up legally .
In addition to the biological factors , you also have to determine that each result in a profile is valid .
Therefore , I think it should be scientifically scrutinised by a larger panel of experts before scientists express their opinion , and that the protection of the athletes is respected . ”
The UCI took the same approach when contacted by Cyclingnews , the governing body stating that it will not speak about athletes unless it wrongdoing has been proven .
“ Lance Armstrong is part of our Biological Passport , ” UCI spokesman Enrico Carpani said .
“ As for all profiles generated within this programme which are submitted on regular basis for reviewing to the independent experts , the UCI does n't and wo n’t make any comment . ”
WADA also declined to talk about the questions raised .
“ For the time being , this issue is one for the UCI to consider in terms of results management for any particular case , ” a spokesman said on Thursday .
“ WADA is currently preparing harmonized protocols for anti-doping organizations conducting longitudinal analysis for anti-doping .
It will certainly look further into such variations of blood parameters as part of the ongoing work of its expert groups in relation to the Athlete Passport . ”
As stated earlier , Armstrong has not responded as yet .
In the meantime he has been defended by the Norwegian professor Hans Erik Heier , who said that he did n’t believe an athlete with such blood levels was doping .
“ The hemoglobin values are too low for it to be possible to manipulate them down there , ” he told Dagbladet .
“ I interpret this to mean that he must be clean . ”
What next ?
There will be debate about whether or not Mørkeberg and Belhage were correct to speak to the media with their concerns .
Damsgaard states that protection of the athletes is important , and this is a valid point .
But in putting his results online and using those to back up his assertion that he is a clean rider , Armstrong is enabling scrutiny and comment from experts in relation to his values .
“ As scientists , I think our job in this matter is that when something gets posted on the internet and is not normal , we need to say that this is the case , ” said Belhage .
“ Otherwise , if you let it sit there and it is unchallenged , then it would [ otherwise ] be seen as perfect .
“ After that , our job is done , ” he added .
“ Any other action should be evaluated by the usual councils that are sitting and evaluating blood profiles and putting the data together . ”
While his position is that the Tour values do n’t prove wrongdoing when exposed to the scientific acknowledged algorithms , Damsgaard is in agreement with this latter point .
“ I definitely think it should go all the way to the expert panel and they should reach a consensus , ” he said .
“ We need to establish it beyond any reasonable doubt if something was wrong .
“ I think that the expert panel is brilliantly and very intelligently put together , because they possess knowledge of all different angles , ” he said .
“ I believe that in unclear cases where biological and methodological factors are known to be involved , then you have to raise it to the absolutely expert panel level , where they have to have a unique consensus on the result .
“ You have to bring this along to at least 10 to 15 people rather than a single one , people with different experiences that can have a look at this and come to a conclusion .
The UCI ’s biological passport has an expert panel that consists of the right people .
They may have reviewed this one already , I do n’t know , but I have full confidence in that panel . ”
The points
Jakob Mørkeberg raised three points about the blood readings posted online , explaining why he felt there was the possibility of blood doping .
No significant change in values between the start and end of the Tour : According to the Livestrong.com website , Armstrong ’s hematocrit readings on July 2nd and July 25th were almost identical at 42.8 and 43 percent respectively , with hemoglobin levels of 14.3 and 14.5g / dl .
In contrast , his hematocrit levels at the start and finish of the Giro d’Italia were 43.5 versus 38.2 percent , a drop of over five points .
Increase in levels during the race : Mørkeberg also highlights the increases seen around the two rest days ; on July 11th the hematocrit value was 40.7 , increasing to 43.1 on July 14 , while the July 20th and July 25th morning blood control levels were 41.7 versus 43 .
This year ’s rest days were July 13th and 20th .
Low reticulocyte count : Both Mørkeberg and Belhage state that the normal level of new blood cells , or reticulocytes , is approximately one percent .
Armstrong ’s reticulocyte readings during the Tour ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 , consistently lower than his average value seen earlier in the season .
Belhage says that while both hemoglobin and hematocrit can be modified by issues such as dehydration or diarrhoea , reticulocytes are not .
“ They are not affected by fluid changes , ” he asserted .
Who ’s who
Jakob Mørkeberg has written 10 peer - reviewed papers on blood doping within the past three years , and has completed a Master ’s thesis entitled Autologous Blood Doping .
He has just submitted a PhD dissertation Detection of Autologous Blood Transfusions via Analyses of Peripheral Blood Samples .
One of his major goals as an anti-doping researcher is to find a method to detect such transfusions in sporting competitions such as the Tour de France .
He was involved in the running of the CSC and Astana anti-doping programmes until the end of 2008 .
Bo Belhage is a chief anaestesiologist at Bispebjerg Hospital and has written 53 publications ; of these , 41 are peer - reviewed , two peer - reviewed in press ( pending ) and 10 book chapters .
He is a Doctor of Medical Science , an Associated Research Professor , and was also involved in the running of the CSC and Astana anti-doping programmes .
He has been involved in science for 21 years .
Rasmus Damsgaard is a doctor currently specializing in Anaesthesiology , and was a past Secretary General for Information of the Danish National Anti-doping Agency 2000 - 2004 .
He is a International Skiing Federation ( FIS ) anti-doping program manager and member of its medical committee , and has been a ‘ review board ’ member for international tennis and cricket .
He is a member of " review boards " in international tennis ( ITF , ATP , WTA ) and international cricket , and has done international research n anti-doping related issues from testosterone to autologous blood transfusion tests .
Damsgaard has attended meetings in WADA ’s blood profile group .
He was previously highly involved in the running of the CSC and Astana anti-doping programmes , and now works as a consultant for the Astana and Saxo Bank teams , interpreting their bio-passport results .

THE State Government is considering exporting millions of tonnes of high - polluting brown coal to developing nations under a plan championed by Energy Minister Peter Batchelor in a recent cabinet meeting .
As hundreds of people gather today in the Latrobe Valley to protest against Hazelwood , the state 's dirtiest brown coal power station , a new environmental battle is likely against the Brumby Government over use of the state 's massive coal reserves .
Government sources have told The Sunday Age that Mr Batchelor is supportive of an energy company 's 40 - year proposal to export 12 million tonnes of brown coal annually to India .
Mr Batchelor took the idea to cabinet 's policy and strategy committee recently .
Spokeswoman for Mr Batchelor Emma Tyner said any allocation of coal would require '' careful consideration of emerging needs and a rigorous environmental approval process ' ' .
She said no decision had been made .
The Sunday Age believes that ministers sought more information on the export proposal .
Apple is known for the stringent guidelines it applies when deciding which software it allows in their App Store - BitTorrent is one of the things on their ban list .
Apple argues that BitTorrent is often used to infringe copyrights and that such applications are a no go for the App Store , forcing developers to go underground .
µ Monitor is a handy iPhone application that allows users to control their uTorrent client on the go .
After putting months of hard work into getting the software ready for a public release , the developer Claudio was told by Apple that everything related to BitTorrent has been banned from their App Store .
“ We ’ve reviewed µ Monitor and determined that we cannot post this version of your application to the App Store at this time because this category of applications is often used for the purpose of infringing third party rights .
We have chosen to not publish this type of application to the App Store , ” Apple wrote to the developer after a 4 month review process .
This is not the first time that Apple has excluded a BitTorrent - related product from its store .
In May they also banned an application designed to remotely - control the Transmission BitTorrent client for the same reasons outlined above .
Interestingly Apple has no problem allowing Usenet related applications in their store .
myNZB for example is an application that is available from the App Store although it ’s similar in functionality to the BitTorrent apps that were rejected .
Despite Apple ’s blockade , there is still a way to get µ Monitor on your iPhone .
Instead of throwing months of hard work overboard , µ Monitor ’s developer has recently decided to bypass the Apps Store and make the application available to ‘ jailbroken ’ iPhone users from the Cydia repository .
Thanks to Apple , uTorrent users who want to control their torrent via an iPhone application have no other option than to jailbreak their phone .
Detailed instructions on how to get µ Monitor working on your phone can be found on Claudio ’s website .

I was so moved by it , that I offered to post it here .
It touched reader 's souls , as it had mine , and Robert got hundreds of emails in response .
With his death approaching closer , Robert has now sent out a follow up letter to his friends , a more personal reflection , looking back on a life approaching its close .
Again , it seemed too powerful to be seen by just a handful of intimates , and so again , I 'm posting it as Robert 's gift to a broader public community .
I hope it touches your heart as much as it did mine .

Dear Friends :
As many of you know , back in September of 2003 , I experienced a medically inexplicable " miracle " remission that lasted five years ; a remission that enabled me to slow down and explore the Spiritual side of life .
I trained and practiced Reiki healing , and strove , with mixed results , to become a less insufferably driven writer , teacher , partner and friend .
Writing ?
In time , I left writing behind .
Just walked away .
No regrets .
Never again .
Done .
Politics ?
Too stressful .
No mas .
Done .
I devoted more time to my first love , music , and spent as much time as possible in the wild .
Butterfly earned the same minimum wage I did .
And -- so that U - Haul would n't have to give her benefits -- was designated as a part - time employee even though she worked 60 + hours per week .
In order to feed her financially struggling children and their children , Butterfly made weekly stops at a local food bank .
For my part , I found trailer hitch installation to be absorbing .
However , the pay was n't high enough to enable me to make a dent in my medical debt .
In time , I returned to teaching , and augmented my income by counseling ex-convicts and establishing a Reiki practice .
Teaching , counseling , Reiki , music , wilderness .
Could n't ask for more .
Setbacks ?
Yes .
Some life - threatening , all annoying .
And none worth going into .
Better to focus on the good , and the good was very good .
A good life .
A sweet life .
One I savored all the more because I 'd come so close , on so many occasions , to losing it .
Then ?
In September of last year , the miracle remission came to an end .
My decline was precipitous .
And much to my consternation , even as I was forced , for reasons of health , to resign from three jobs I loved , the literary muse awoke .
I did my best to resist , but the poetic frenzy is the poetic frenzy .
Moreover , since the locus of this untreatable hence fatal flare is my brain -- well , the secret to permitting the muse to take over is simple : bypass the intellect .
Do n't think .
Hence , with an increasingly compromised intellect -- with windows of lucidity closing daily -- bypassing the intellect was a breeze .
Within a matter of weeks , and against my will , I had an outline for a book I never wanted to write .
An outline , mind you .
Just an outline .
I had no obligation to sweat every word in an attempt to turn that outline into a living breathing entity , aka a story .
No way was I about to embark on this project .
No way no way no way .
And I stuck to my guns .
For a week .
Then in mid-February , I met up with Barry Lopez : friend , mentor , whose every word , written or spoken , is in service to the Sacred .
Barry Lopez is the Thoreau of our times .
A National Book Award winner , yes .
But above all a decent and generous man .
A light house to many , myself included , for when we met , 25 years ago , I was most certainly drowning .
My old friend took one look at me and before I had a chance to break the news to him , he broke it to me :
He said " Bobby , your time is short .
Please write the book . "
How could I say no to this great man , this friend of the land and all who love it and mourn its passing ?
How , above all , could I say no to a cherished friend ?
So . I stand at the edge of the River .
I stand there and yearn to go Home .
I yearn in the deepest way .
I miss my dad .
I miss Bobby Kennedy .
I miss the Blessed Mother .

Republicans Could Retake House In 2010
So says Andrew at Five Thirty Eight .
Chickenshit Democrats will now argue that they can't be too aggressive about health insurance reform — or repealing DADT or regulating the financial industry or doing something about climate change or renewable energies or anything else — because they might lose control of the House if the do .
Hello ?
Democrats ?
Large majorities are n't just there to be used .
They 're there to be used up .
You get your asses elected — with the help of the base — and you deliver some of that change stuff you 're always talking about .
You get in there and make good on the promises you made to the people who actually sent you to Washington , the promises you made to the people who voted for you and gave you money .
Then you let the fucking chips fall where they may .
Ramming your agenda through may cost you some seats , it 's true , and losing a few seats could cost you the majority .
But guess what ?
You can sit there on your asses and do nothing — you can cower in a corner worrying about vulnerable Dems in swing districts — and lose seats anyway .
You can do nothing — you can sit there very quietly — and still lose control the House .
And in the long run you 're going to lose the majority eventually because no one party is power forever .
You have to use the power you have while you have it .
The point of electing Democrats to Congress is n't to keep every Democrat elected to Congress in Congress forever .
It 's to advance the Democratic agenda .
But we 're always told , once we 've elected Democrats , that we can't move on the Democratic agenda — not too aggressively , not without bipartisan support , not at all — because a few Democratic members of Congress might lose their jobs .
But some of your are going to lose your jobs anyway .
The point is to enact the Democratic agenda while enough you have your jobs to constitute a majority , to make change while you 're in control , and to hopefully lock those changes in .
Then with any luck once the Republicans are back in charge — and they 're going to be back in charge someday — the changes you 've made will prove to be too popular to undo and will become permanent , your legacy , accomplishments that future Democratic politicians can point to and run on .
( See Social Security , Medicare , Unemployment Benefits , early childhood education , etc. )
That 's the whole point , that 's the reason Democratic voters and donors sent you to Washington .
Christ !
Green shop owner is fined by council ... for not producing any rubbish
With its emphasis on re-using old materials or selling them as scrap , Mark Howard 's bicycle shop is a model of environmental efficiency .
So you might have imagined that his local council would be grateful to him for enhancing the area 's green credentials .
But instead the father of four has been hit with a £ 180 fine - because officers refuse to believe he does n't create any commercial waste .
Green effort : Mark Howard , pictured outside his bicycle store , has labelled Southend Council 's move to fine him as ' totally stupid '
If the charge is not paid within ten days it will rise to £ 300 , and ultimately Mr Howard could be hauled before a court .
Mr Howard stores surplus materials such as cardboard boxes and old pedals away for re-use , while bent steel or aluminium frames that can't be salvaged are sold for scrap .
The dispute centres around a certificate issued by council waste contractors
Cory when businesses pay them £ 80 to supply 50 commercial waste bags , which can be collected when full .
Five weeks ago Mr Howard , 50 , who runs Sutton Road Cycles in Southend , received a letter from Southend Council asking how he disposed of waste .
When he rang up to explain , no one believed that he did not use the service and he was told that someone would visit his premises .
' An officer came round a week later but he did n't look round or ask any questions , ' he said .
' He just handed me another letter which said I must pay a fixed penalty .
' They did n't give me a chance to show them what I do - which is better than the council contractor 's service because their waste goes to landfill . '
Mr Howard , who is married to Karen , 46 , says he can prove what he does with his waste by showing council officials his paperwork .
But he added : ' Despite repeated calls I was fobbed off all the time .
I have tried to get an interview with the director of the department but nothing has happened .
This is totally stupid .
The council must have money to burn because they want this case to go to court .
' I 'm not some environmental fruitcake trying to save the world .
I 'm just an ordinary person using my brain to avoid waste .
But they do n't seem to care . '
Southend Council yesterday defended its actions .
Simon Crowther , group manager for waste , said : ' Mr Howard is required under the Environmental ( Duty of Care ) Regulations 1991 to produce evidence as to how he legally and lawfully disposes of commercial waste under his control .
' Mr Howard has been issued with a fixed - penalty fine due to the fact he failed to provide this evidence . '

Бившият премиер и лидер на БСП Сергей Станишев обяви , че не е знаел какви заплати са получавани в държавното дружеств о
" Информационно обслужване " и научил това от вестниците .
В същото време той посочи , че данните , изнесени за възнагражденията в дружеството , са неверни .
Това стана в предаванет о " Нека говорят " на Би Ти Ви , което е първата телевизионна изява на Станишев след като сдаде властта .
Станишев съобщи , че е направил проверка , според данните от която председателят на управителния съвет на дружеството е получил през 2008 г. общо 26 хил. лв. заплата , а през 2009 г. - нищо .
Членовете на управителния и надзорния съвет получават по закон между 2 и 5 средни заплати за дружеството , каза Станишев и добави , че служителите в него са висококвалифицирани специалисти от ИТ сектора .
Той допълни все пак , че възнагражденията във фирмата са били по - високи , отколкото неговото като премиер , което е било под 3 хил .
лв .
Шеф на управителния съвет на " Информационно обслужване " до края на юли беше съветникът на Станишев Азер Меликов , който нашумя покрай окрай предизборни реклами срещу Бойко Борисов .
Наскоро премиерът съобщи , че членовете на ръководството на държавната фирма са получавали между 7 хил. и 11 хил. лв. месечно .
По думите на Станишев обаче проверката във фирмата била поискана от Държавния финансов контрол още преди изборите .
Бившият премиер посочи още , че в медиите се публикуват много непроверени неща , а изявленията на членовете на сегашния кабинет се приемат безкритично .
Той нарече безумия твърденията , че предишното правителство е похарчило много пари в последните дни на управлението , както твърди лидерът на СДС Мартин Димитров .
" Никакви извънредни разходи след изборите от бюджетни пари не са правени " , каза Станишев .
Не знам какво се случва в ДАНС сега , каза Станишев .
По повод интервюто на доскорошния съветник в агенцията Алексей Петров в " Труд " , в което се твърди за доклад с данни за корумпирани бивши министри , Станишев посочи , че именно той е създал ДАНС , за да се противопостави на корупцията по високите етажи .
В ДАНС са правени проверки на всички сигнали по отношение на министри , зам . - министри и шефове на агенции , каза бившият премиер .
Той повтори обявеното по - рано днес от пресцентъра на БСП , че на него такъв доклад не му е бил представян .
" Може би новото ръководство на ДАНС да е представило , " каза той .
Timeshare scams are prevalent in Somerset , according to Trading Standards officers .
Officers in the Somerset County Council are still collecting information regarding resale scams as a part of an international investigation headed by the Office of Fair Trading .
The usual victims of these scams are those owners trying to get out of their timeshares .
Hundreds of pounds have been lost already by Somerset citizens due to timeshare reselling scams and yet the timeshare scammers continue to remain at large .
They still continue to defraud people asking for even more money .
Currently , the cases of timeshare scams have increased with the recession as owners are trying to turn their timeshares into cash .
Last year , there were 56 consumer complaints about timeshare received by the Somerset Trading Standards .
Usually , owners are approached via phone and offered a considerable high price for their timeshare unit .
Then , the victim is asked to pay some money in advance to guarantee the sale .
But these sales will not be completed and the victims are unable to retrieve their money .
The scams often prey on vulnerable people .
Those owners desperate enough in getting rid of their timeshares are the common victims .
Especially with this economic downturn , there are several timeshare owners who are very eager to sell their timeshares just to recover some costs that they originally paid for that property .
Therefore , if you suspect that an offer is too good to be true , do not accept it and get advice as soon as possible .
In getting rid of your timeshare , you can try consulting a timeshare transfer company like the Transfer Smart .
These companies will aid you to get rid of your timeshare and help you avoid those scams .

As the 40th anniversary celebrations of the first manned moon landing end , a human voyage to Mars remains a holy grail for NASA .
" We 're still looking at human exploration of Mars as one of the goals of the future at the top level , " said NASA researcher Bret Drake with Lunar and Mars Integration at Johnson Space Center in Houston .
" Having a human actually set foot on another planet would be one of the greatest adventures possible , one of the greatest monuments to history . "
A crewed mission to the red planet is a daunting challenge that lies at the edge of current technological capabilities and possibly beyond .
Still , NASA keeps a strategy to go there and constantly keeps up to date with new ideas .
" Mars is one of those targets of fascination that has been around a long time , " Drake said .
How to get there
A voyage to Mars would take a crew about 180 days .
So far NASA is exploring two options for propulsion there — a nuclear thermal rocket and a chemical engine .
A nuclear thermal rocket , based off designs from the '60s and ' 70s , would use a nuclear reactor to super - heat a gas and blast it out the nozzle to generate thrust .
" It 's a very high - performance vehicle , and we think it 's very safe , not radioactive at launch , but it is a nuclear system , " Drake said .
" The idea for the chemical engine is similar to that used on the space shuttle , liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen .
It 's a fairly well - known technology , but it 's not as efficient as nuclear thermal . "
To reach the Martian surface , NASA envisions an aerodynamic lander that flies down with thrusters to help it descend .
The ascent vehicle that takes the crew back into space for the six - month trip home will likely rely on a combination of methane and liquid oxygen .
" Oxygen is present in the Martian atmosphere in the carbon dioxide , so you can use resources on Mars to make it , " Drake said .
Before the crew even gets to Mars , the plan is to send as much cargo there ahead of time as possible .
" That way we can know it 's operating right before we ever commit the crew , " Drake said .
" A Mars mission is not like a lunar mission where you can come home at any time — once they 're committed , a crew is out there for years . "
By current NASA estimates , a crewed mission to Mars needs to lift about twice the mass of the International Space Station into space — roughly 1.76 million lbs. ( 800 metric tons ) of technology .
To launch the equipment , NASA plans on using the Ares V rocket , designed to be the most powerful rocket ever built and capable of carrying about 414,000 lbs. ( 188 metric tons ) to low Earth orbit at one time .
" We 're going to try to minimize the amount of assembly needed , " Drake said .
" The heavy lift capacity we 'll have with the Ares V will allow for simple automatic rendezvous in orbit and docking of components . "
The crew would ride up in one of the upcoming Ares I rockets before starting the voyage to Mars .
" Having humans in place could bring a wealth of experience and training and the ability to put into context what they see and to make real - time decisions , all things difficult to do with robots , " Drake said .
The very habitat the crew stays at on the Martian surface would be sent ahead of time .
" You can also do things like produce and store oxygen from resources at Mars beforehand for the crew and the ascent vehicle .
You could generate water as well . "
Big crew , long stay
NASA envisions a crew of six astronauts for a Mars mission .
" That 's about what 's required for the skills needed — a commander , scientist , engineer , medical officer , things like that , as well as cross- training , " Drake said .
" They 'll need expertise in a wide range of disciplines . "
Currently NASA envisions a long stay for a crew at Mars , about 500 days .
" Crew autonomy is vital , because there 's an up to 40 minute time delay in communication between Earth and the crew because of the distance , " Drake said .
" And the crew does n't have a capability for re-supply — they 'll just have what they send ahead or what they bring with them — so when things fail , they 'll have to be able to repair them .
They must be self - sufficient . "
To survive the voyage , air and water need to be completely recycled regularly .
" We 're learning a lot on the International Space Station right now on air revitalization and water recovery , " Drake said .
" What 's nice about Mars is that there 's carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , so that can help get us oxygen and water for the crew .
In terms of food , we 're looking at smaller systems , ' salad machines , ' to grow food for the crew .
Fresh food is not only good for nutrition , but good for the mind as well .
A fresh tomato can really boost psychology . "
Mental and physical challenges
The long hardship of roughly two - and - a - half years in space with only a few people in a potentially lethal environment will undoubtedly challenge the psyches of Mars explorers .
" The Russians are conducting a test right now that hopefully will shed light on the behavioral sciences aspect of a Mars mission , " Drake said .
" Looking at other remote exploration endeavors is helpful as well — Antarctica , or submarines — all that feeds into the human behavioral aspects of crew selection . "
A key concern for astronauts as well as during the stay on Mars is dangerous radiation in the form of storms of high - energy particles from the sun as well as cosmic rays from deep space .
" The best radiation protection material is hydrogen , or water , which is rich in hydrogen , " Drake said .
On the surface of Mars , NASA envisions that cargo deployed ahead of time can produce water before the crew arrives to use as a shield during the crew 's stay there .
On the way to and from Mars , the ship could be configured so that water and food surround areas where crew spend most of their time , but " a ' storm shelter ' aboard the ship will be an integral part for short events of radiation that can be lethal , " Drake said .
No firm date has been set for any potential Mars mission , but it remains of keen interest not just to NASA , but also others , such as China .
" It 's humanity 's next step to understanding and expanding our presence outward , " Drake said .
" We view human exploration of Mars as being an international endeavor , most likely not limited to just one country , but probably of global scale .

POLITICIANS are said to campaign in poetry and govern in prose but the candidates contesting Germany 's federal election uttered barely anything of interest .
The two main contenders , Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) and Germany 's foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , have spent the past four years together in a “ grand coalition ” .
Since they may have to do so again they could not afford to savage each other .
On Sunday September 27th voters will probably ensure that Ms Merkel 's CDU finish well ahead of the SPD — opinion polls are unanimous on the score — allowing her to remain as chancellor .
The election 's aftermath is likely to be more interesting than the campaign .
The main question is whether Ms Merkel will get her wish to dispense with the SPD as a coalition partner and govern instead with the liberal Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) .
That has looked to be the likeliest outcome for most of the year : polls have consistently forecast a small majority for a “ black - yellow ” coalition in the Bundestag .
But Mr Steinmeier , contesting his first election , has recently been gaining ground .
That makes it more likely that Ms Merkel will be forced to continue the grand coalition with the “ red ” SPD .
Yet in a Bundestag with five parties other coalitions are possible .
The SPD says it will not govern with the ex-communist Left Party .
So Mr Steinmeier 's main hope for becoming chancellor would be to lead a “ traffic light ” coalition of the SPD , the FDP and the Greens .
If black - yellow does not achieve a majority Ms Merkel could in theory top it up by recruiting the Green party to form a “ Jamaica coalition ” ( named for the colours of the Jamaican flag ) .
Yet all possible three - party combinations have been ruled out by one of their prospective members : the Greens reject Jamaica and the FDP says no to the traffic light .
A would - be chancellor would have the difficult task of trying to change one party 's mind .
For Mr Steinmeier one important goal is to save the SPD from what could be its worst result in modern history .
In 1953 it won just 28.8 % of the vote .
If it falls much below that the SPD 's powerful left wing may eventually rebel against the party 's moderate leaders , even if it returns to power as the junior partner in a grand coalition .
The SPD 's position in any case is likely to be weakened .
As in 2005 there is speculation that a grand coalition might not last the full four years of the next parliament .
Ms Merkel will not be comfortable unless the CDU exceeds the 35.2 % of the vote it reached ( along with its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union ) in 2005 .
If a weak CDU is yoked to the SPD again , she too will face restlessness in the ranks .
Under Germany 's system of proportional representation the balance of power in the Bundestag is supposed to depend on each party 's share of the vote .
But a quirk in the system could deliver as many as 20 extra “ overhang seats ” to the CDU , allowing it to form a black - yellow government even if the two parties do not win a majority of the votes that go to the five parties .
The constitutional court has demanded changes to the system , but not until 2011 .
Opposition leaders have already given warning that a government formed on the basis of overhang seats would be “ unconstitutional ” .
Whatever the result , the next government will not be formed until a coalition hammers out an agreement among its constituent parties , a process that could take weeks .
That is when differences will have to be reconciled and the mush of campaign promises shaped into a governing programme .
Only then will voters have a real idea of where their leaders intend to lead Germany over the next four years .
In any case the next government 's choices will be limited by Germany 's consensus - seeking habits and the government 's tight finances .
A black - yellow coalition would try to cut taxes and simplify the tax code and may attempt reforms , for example of health and nursing - care insurance .
In a reconstituted grand coalition the parties would be torn between their need to sharpen their political identities and the necessity to compromise .
That is likely to produce an unambitious government at best .

( CNN ) --
A man who roasted his pet dog to enjoy as a meal with his family and friends escaped prosecution after authorities in New Zealand determined the animal was killed humanely .
Auckland SPCA officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in this barbecue pit .
" We were in a dilemma at seeing something we were fairly upset about -- but being in a position of being able to do absolutely nothing about it , " said Garth Halliday , of the Auckland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , on Monday .
The SPCA -- which investigates acts of animal cruelty and presses charges -- responded to the house in Mangere , south of Auckland .
There , officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in a barbecue pit .
Watch why owner made decision »
" They had had the dog for a while , but the man told us his wife was getting tired of the dog .
He was becoming a pest , " Halliday said .
" They decided to get rid of him .
But instead of bringing him to the SPCA -- which we recommend -- they decided to have a meal , and cook and eat him . "
The family is from Tonga where eating a dog is not uncommon , Halliday said .

" He did n't think he was doing anything wrong , " he said .
Is eating dog meat acceptable ?
Sound Off below
The incident occurred in February .
For the next few months , the SPCA looked into whether the man ought to be charged for the killing .
Over the weekend , the organization decided it could n't because the animal had been killed humanely .
The man , Halliday said , struck the dog in the head with a hammer , rendering it unconscious .
He then slit its throat .
" That is the normal way -- if one can use that word -- that animals are killed all over the world , " Halliday said .
And under New Zealand 's Animal Welfare Act , it is legal to kill an animal if it is slaughtered swiftly and painlessly .
Dr Malakai Koloamatangi , a Tongan cultural expert from the University of Canterbury , told CNN affiliate TVNZ that dog meat is a delicacy enjoyed mostly by young men in his homeland .
Still , the case infuriated and repulsed many New Zealanders .
" It 's appalling , " said Gracie Williams of Auckland .
" As an animal lover , I am sickened .
The law needs to be changed . "
Auckland Mayor John Banks , an animal rights activist , told reporters that rather than a new law , what is needed is better education of local customs .
In the end , the SPCA closed the case without charges .
" We talked to the people .
We told them that although it 's not against the law , it is against the general culture of the country to actually kill and eat your own pet dog , " Halliday said .

" The number of Bluetooth headset owners that are satisfied with the style of their device dropped 27 % since 2008 . "
Finally , some confirmation that we actually are n't crazy .
Well , too crazy .
We always wondered where exactly the crowds were that were responsible for buying up all of these Bluetooth headsets , and while we'd see one or two self - talkers walking around the mall every so often , we never saw these things as being incredibly popular .
Now , a new research study into the matter finds that owners of Bluetooth headsets in the US are using them less often than they used to .
Way less frequently , actually .
The numbers show that just 26 % of BT headset owners use their devices every day , which is down from 43 % in 2009 .
Interestingly , daily usage increased somewhat in Europe to 36 % , but overall daily usage was said to be down 40 % since last year .
Even funnier was a quote from Chris Schreiner , Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics :
So it 's taken this long for folks to realize that these things are n't stylish hanging off of your ear ?
The report goes on to say that in - car handsfree kits are taking the place of these headsets , but we think people are just realizing that they just look awkward in terms of style .
What do you think ?
Which side are you on ?
When I look around my Google Reader feeds , I see so many insightful , intelligent political and technical blogs by women , but hardly any by men .
For instance , I read Shakesville every day for US and international politics , The F - Word covers the UK , while for what ’s going on in Australia I turn to Hoyden About Town or Senator Kate Lundy who blogs politics and tech .
Other tech blogs I follow : Shelley Powers ’ Burning Bird , K. T. Bradford ’s netbook and gadget reviews , and Amy ’s Ramblings on open source software and social tech .
And of course one of the best women blogging about technology is Kathy Sierra … oh , wait .
I wonder why there seem to be so few men blogging in these subject areas .
Is it just that they are n’t interested ?
Do they not have time what with all the sports and drinking and porn ?
Maybe they do n’t feel up to handling tough subjects , or perhaps the conversational style is offputting to them ?
I guess , if I really think about it , it ’s possible that I just do n’t notice them .
Confused ?

The government said the move was aimed at improving broadband provision in rural areas .

A tsunami triggered by a strong earthquake in the South Pacific has killed more than 100 people in Samoa and American Samoa .
Here two eyewitnesses in American Samoa - one a DJ who was on air when the tsunami hit , and one a writer who fled for safety with her children - speak of their experiences .

Advertisement Joey Cummings works for the radio station 93KHJ in Pago Pago , American Samoa .
He was presenting the morning show Samoan Sunrise when the first tsunami wave hit .
The tsunami hit the harbour , and people fled to the hills
My colleague John Raynar called in sick this morning , and I 'm so glad he did because otherwise I would have been on the road to work when it hit .
I was sitting in for him on the morning radio show on 93KHJ when the earthquake hit , at about 7:50 am .
It lasted several minutes .
We immediately sent out an earthquake warning on air , to tell everyone to stay away from possible landslide areas .
We also asked schools to initiate their tsunami plans to get kids up the mountains .
We sent a tsunami warning 10 minutes later as we saw the first rising water .
Our building , Pago Plaza , is located in the middle of the harbour , practically at sea level .
We stayed on the air as the water reached three or four feet in the parking lot .
The water stayed at that level for a few minutes , but then it surged to around 15 feet .
Joey Cummings was standing in as a Samoan Sunrise presenter Trees , cars , buses , boats all rushed by in a river of mud just outside my window .
I actually saw that my own car - a new VW Beetle - was surprisingly buoyant when floating on its roof .
We continued broadcasting for the next 5 to 10 minutes , until the batteries on our back - up power system died .
Lots of office staff were panicking , and it was a struggle to keep everyone calm while I was still on the air .
When we went off the air , I grabbed a video camera to try to capture some of the action .
The first thing I caught was the second wave , and me and Lupe [ another presenter ] praying .
All of the staff at the station went outside to the second floor balcony to see what was happening - and the air was filled with screams .
The whole of the ground floor of our building was completely washed out .
The devastation was complete .
Tables , windows , jewellery , trophies , DVDs and bottles of water lay strewn across the murky floor .
The villagers immediately started looking for trapped survivors .
I dedicated myself and my staff to helping those that were hurt , and gathering food and water .
Debris was everywhere .
Broken furniture mixed with old tyres and trees .
Children 's clothing and road signs were crushed under telephone poles .
Two lesser waves came but they were equally scary .
We screamed for people to run up the mountain but they just ran down the street away from the wave rather than make a sharp left and up the steep mountain just feet away .
We walked down the road only to find that people who were n't trying to help had already begun looting the stores .
When I finally left work , we drove through the area and I saw more and more horrible things
Teenagers roamed the area with spray paint , marking buildings and overturned cars with meaningless scribble .
We set up a security barrier around our building , and confirmed with plaza security that no - one was trapped inside .
Then I found my own car about 300 yards down the road , upside down in the middle of a tennis court .
I got a generator from a friend and got one of our programmes back on the air about three hours later , just spreading information .
I watched a group of Taiwanese fisherman trying to get off a 100 - ft tuna boat that was leaning against the sea wall .
School buses full of kids were smiling and waving at all the excitement , while behind them there were pick - up trucks with bodies in them - their feet were hanging out over the tailgate .
Everything is so nasty here .
When I finally left work , we drove through the area and I saw more and more horrible things .
Where I buy my morning snacks is a concrete slab , and the lady who makes the most delicious meat pies there is now badly injured at the hospital .
The new day spa that my girlfriend Moana works at is now tilting precariously on its foundation .
The Korean store is gutted .
The store where I get my lunch has a truck in it .
The Sacred Heart bus has a telephone pole skewering it like some sort of crazy shish kebab .
But as we got further out of the harbour area , the damage was less and less noticeable .
The radio station was ground zero for the worst natural disaster in recorded American Samoa history .
Writer Sia Figiel lives in American Samoa with her sons Malamalama and Pounamu .
She , like many others on the island , heard the news of the tsunami on the radio .
We woke up this morning to the house shaking .
Earthquakes in this part of the world usually shake for a minute or two but this morning the house kept shaking for a clear five minutes .
The boys and I ran outside to the clearing outside our house where our neighbours had gathered .
Then just as quickly as it had appeared , everything became quiet .
We returned to the house , packed everyone up and drove them to school .
Sia Figiel took her children up to the mountains for safety I dropped the kids at school .
I was about to head off to work when I turned on the radio .
The DJ was talking about cars in the parking lot of Pago Plaza floating like toys - and said a second and third wave were set to hit in less than an hour 's time .
Instinctively , I went back to the school .
I just wanted to get to my children .
The road back to the school was packed with traffic - frantic parents calling out their children 's names .
Teachers told us to remain calm .
Mr Moi the principal was encouraging everyone to do the same , telling us that we could pick up our kids and that the children had been evacuated to the highest point in the school .
Before I got there , I heard hymns - children singing while others were praying and crying .
It was quite a sight .
I saw one of my sons and told him to go and look for his siblings .
I did the same .
After about 15 minutes he ran to me and said everyone was at the car .
I quickly ran back to the car .
My 10 - year - old son was in tears .
" Mom , I do n't wanna die " was how he greeted me .
The only thought in my mind was to drive to the highest point of the island - Aoloau village .
The drive up was difficult .
It seemed the entire island was heading up to Aoloau .
We stayed at Aoloau for three hours , listening to the radio , to the death toll climbing .
We heard reports from Samoa - the damage caused to the villages of Falelatai , Lalomanu and Aleipata .
People were dead .
People were missing .
Two radio stations were lost .
The only one transmitting was " Showers of Blessings " radio .
We listened to prayers , looking down on the waves gathering momentum out in the distance .
Meanwhile the neighbours across the street brought coffee for the adults , bottled water and soda for the children .
Then we heard bells ringing from below .
We did n't know what it meant - maybe another death .
I decided to return home .
Our house is some way up from the coast , and I decided it was the best place to be .
I made the kids breakfast and then we took a nap .
I wanted the children to be as calm as possible .
When we woke , my sister had made food for us .
She told us the death toll on our island had climbed to 14 .
Half an hour later , that number was 22 , with a lot more injured .
Most deaths were in coastal areas .
Villages lie in devastation , cars washed into buildings , boats washed up onto roads .
And there 's water everywhere .
The evening bells have just rung for evening prayer .
Our prayer tonight is that of gratitude that our family and neighbours are safe .
But our hearts are with those families who can not say the same , who will sleep tonight without a son , a daughter , a mother , a father , an uncle , an aunt , a cousin .
Their loss is our loss .
Even the night birds feel it .

They call it La Pista Magica - the magic race track - and as soon as you arrive in the old royal park at Monza you know why .
The ghosts are there in the woods .
The buildings talk of legends and of heroes , of great races and shocking accidents .
You can feel your spine tingle with the excitement that emanates from the thousands of tifosi , the Ferrari fans who flock to Monza every year to watch the red cars from Maranello .
For them , nothing is impossible .
There is always a little magic to help them .
Of all the racing tracks in the world this is the one to visit for it the embodiment of the joy and thrill that is always in the background when racing people gather .
You have to forget the bad points - and there are many .
The traffic is awful , the pickpockets are busy , the policemen are lazy or frenetic but rarely anything in between .
Fans drool at the gates , they jeer at Ferrari 's rivals .
They have even been known to throw rocks .
But go out into the woods and see the tree trunks with nails hammered into them so that the fans can climb to a perfect viewing point , or stay up all night with them and watch them dance on the track the night before a race and you begin to understand .
If you 've ever watched John Frankenheimer 's movie Grand Prix you will know Monza - it has n't changed much .
It is where Jean - Pierre Sarti's Ferrari goes out of control on the banking and smashes through the trees onto the track below .
It is where James Garner stands on the main straight in the early morning on the day after the race , mulling over his victory .
The camera pulls gradually and majestically away into the sky .
But it is more than just the passion and the history .
Monza is all about the brave .
If you sit around long enough in the Formula 1 paddock you will hear people talk about Formula 1 being boring .
Wander out along the muddy paths through the woods to the Lesmo corners and you will never again say that F1 is dull .
Monza dates from the years immediately following World War I when the automobile was new and exciting and those who had survived the fighting were keen to live life to the full .
The work began in February 1922 when racing stars Vincenzo Lancia and Felice Nazzaro laid the first stone .
Two days later local conservationists stopped the work and it was not until May that the 3500 workmen were able to go back into action .
The 6.25 - mile track was finished by the end of July .
It was an amazing feat .
At the time it was only the third permanent racing circuit in the world , after Brooklands and Indianapolis .
The first race was in September with Pietro Bordino winning in a Fiat .
A week later Monza held its first Italian Grand Prix and 150,000 turned out to see it .
Bordino won again .
Ever since then the second weekend in September has been the Monza weekend .
The track has been rebuilt on several occasions but the basic design is much as it was .
The original flat banking was replaced by the fearsome high banking that can still be seen today , built in 1955 but used for only a few years before drivers began to boycott the event on the grounds of safety .
Stand on that banking and you will know why the bravest of the brave lost their nerve .
Monza was always a high - speed track and while chicanes have come along to slow the cars and the old days of Monza slip - streaming battles are a thing of the past , the essential element of speed is still there .
And when there is such speed there are always accidents .
Until the horrible Le Mans disaster in 1955 Monza was the place where racing 's worst accident had occurred , Emilio Materassi crashing his Talbot opposite the pits in 1928 , killing himself and 27 spectators .
Wolfgang von Trips cartwheeled into the crowd after a brush with Jim Clark in 1961 .
The German and 13 others died .
In 1933 three top drivers ( the opera- loving Giuseppe Campari , his protege Baconin Borzacchini and the Czech aristocrat Count Stanislas Czaykowski ) died on the same weekend .
In 1955 the sport 's top driver Alberto Ascari died at the wheel of a Ferrari sportscar while testing in the corner that now bears his name .
No - one knows why .
In 1970 Jochen Rindt was on his way to the world championship when a brake failure sent his Lotus smashing into the wall at the Parabolica .
He died before they could get him to hospital .
Eight years later the start of the Italian Grand Prix ended in a cataclysmic accident as the drivers jockeyed for position on the run down to the first corner .
Ronnie Peterson died .
The list is long , longer than anywhere else other than Indianapolis .
And yet the track has seen some incredibly heroic moments as well .
In 1956 Peter Collins was in a position to win the World Championship in his Lancia Ferrari but 15 laps from the finish , during a routine pit stop , he handed his car over to team leader and rival Juan - Manuel Fangio to let the Argentine take the title .
Collins said that he would get his chance another day .
It was at Monza that Niki Lauda returned to racing in 1976 just a few weeks after his fiery accident at the Nurburgring .
The frightened , bloodied figure , disfigured by his burns overcame his fears and created a legend .
If you read through the record books you will find that Monza is still - and probably always will be - the venue of the fastest ever Grand Prix and the one with the closest finish - the Italian GP of 1971 when Peter Gethin popped out from behind Ronnie Peterson to cross the line just 0.01sec ahead of Ronnie Peterson after averaging 150.754 mph from start to finish .
It was the last of the great Monza slipstreamers before the chicanes arrived .
It was at Monza in 1988 , a few weeks after Enzo Ferrari 's death , that McLaren was beaten for the first and only time that year when Ayrton Senna misjudged a maneuver as he tried to lap the Williams of Jean - Louis Schlesser with only a few laps to go and ended up in the sandtrap , allowing Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto to score an amazing 1 - 2 finish for Ferrari .
That was magic .
There is no other explanation .
Monza 's fame lies more than anything with Grand Prix racing but the track has long been the venue of other great races , including the famous Monza Lotteria , when the young drivers were able to grab a moment of glory and , perhaps , a Grand Prix drive .
The Monza 1000 sportscar race was another classic with stories which could only have happened at Monza .
In 1985 the racing had to stop after 800 km when the frontrunners arrived to find that a very large tree had been blown down across the track and Hans Stuck tried to convince his fellow drivers that they could lift the tree out of the way and get on with the racing .
Monza was the venue in 1957 and 1958 for a pair of curious Europe versus America races known as The Races of the Two Worlds in which Indycar roadsters battled with Formula 1 cars .
Everywhere you go at Monza there are stories - even in the camp sites .
It was in one of these that Frank Williams used to have his head office when he was wheeling and dealing in his early days and where a Ferrari sportscar came over the wall while it was being tested and landed next to his tent .
The track is gradually being upgraded as F1 demands more and more but thankfully the great Monza grandstand remains where it has been since 1938 , witnessing the amazing events in the park .
In 1945 it was filled with Allied soldiers who watched tanks parade down the main straight .
One can only hope that they will never tear it town , nor the curious Pirelli " scoreboard " towers which stand on either side of it .
Stand on the top of one of these - if you can convince someone to let you in - and on a clear day you will be able to see down to the Curva Grande with the Italian Alps visible away to the north and the old Monza banking curling away into the trees and you will get as near as heaven as you can at a motor racing circuit .
Magic .
In any case , days after the Unesco decision , Mr. Hawass went after France and Germany .
When questioned about the timing , he insisted there was no connection , saying he had asked the French to return the artifacts two months earlier .
But that was when Mr. Hosny ’s campaign had already started to fall apart .
Likewise , Mr. Hawass had also said that his sudden announcement , in late August , of restoration work on an Egyptian synagogue had nothing to do with Mr. Hosny ’s bid .
It was just as clear back then that this was an attempt to assuage growing Jewish opposition to the minister .
Over the years Egypt has occasionally made a bid for Nefertiti , when the political climate is ripe .
Germans point out that Ludwig Borchardt , who discovered Nefertiti at Tel el Amarna in 1912 , had Egyptian approval to take it to Berlin .
Just the other day , Iraq repeated its demand that Germany return the Gate of Ishtar from the ancient city of Babylon , excavated and shipped to Berlin before World War I .
In Iraq ’s case , the government seems to be wagering that German ambivalence about the current war may help swing popular opinion here about giving back the gate , just as Saddam Hussein ’s regime played the repatriation card in 2002 as a tactic in negotiating with the United Nations over letting weapons inspectors into the country .
For the Egyptian public , Mr. Hosny ’s defeat was another condemnation of the country ’s stagnant leadership .
“ Defeat and failure and regression will keep following this regime , whose members ’ policy is to stay in office forever , ” wrote Muhsin Radi , a Muslim Brotherhood Member of Parliament , in the daily Al - Dustour .
The country ’s only potent weapon left may be antiquities .
It plays to popular sentiment and national pride .
While the art world likes to ponder the merits or misfortunes of seeing art from one place in another place or the inequities that have resulted from centuries of imperialist collecting , the real issue behind the Egyptian claims , as with so many others , is nationalism .
Laws are laws , of course , and looting ca n’t be tolerated , although when decades or centuries have passed , laws have changed , populations shifted , empires come and gone , legal arguments can be dubious .
But the larger truth is that all patrimony arguments ultimately live or die in the morally murky realm of global relations , meaning that modern governments like Egypt ’s and Iraq ’s may win sympathy today by counting on Western guilt about colonialism when asking for the return of art from ancient sites within their current borders .
At the same time there ’s no international clamor for Russia to return storerooms of treasures it stole from Germany at the end of the war , or , for that matter , for Sweden to fork over the spoils of a war 350 years ago with Denmark .
It ’s about emotion , not airtight logic and consistent policy .
We ’ve all wondered when NPR would investigate the bigotry underlying the Occupation and ever - growing colonization of Palestine .
Yesterday , Morning Edition finally announced a piece on how groups of Israeli men roam streets , intimidating Palestinian and Jewish people who date each other .
I looked forward to an expose ’ of the thugs ’ intolerance .
Sadly , NPR spit out the opposite : a paean to the racism of those Israelis .
Renee Montagne opens with the " news " that , " There is a new enemy for some Israelis : romance between Jewish women and Arab men , and vigilantes have banded together to fight it .
The vigilante groups are walking the streets and towns across Israel .
The largest and most notorious is in the Jewish settlements that have sprung up in and around traditionally Arab East Jerusalem . "
What does Montagne mean , " Jewish settlements " " have sprung up " amid " traditionally Arab " East Jerusalem ?
Montagne misleads listeners from the outset , declining to mention either the illegal Israeli Occupation of Palestinian lands or its continual theft and violence toward the people of Palestine .
Just yesterday , the Israeli government demolished yet more Palestinian - owned buildings in East Jerusalem , without a peep from NPR .
Montagne reveals that " Sheera Frenkel joined one of the groups on patrol . "
Montagne makes Frenkel ’s participation sound like camaraderie –the same phrase one would use if Frenkel actually became a vigilante herself .
Montagne ’s only critical word is her label " vigilante " for people who are in fact vigilantes .
Sheera Frenkel tells us that these vigilantes object to " Arab men dating Jewish girls . "
Frenkel ’s terms treat her subject unequally in two ways : she opposes an ethnicity , " Arab , " to a religion , " Jewish " – a racist formulation , for , unbelievably , Frenkel never once mentions the boys ’ true identity : " Palestinian . "
Meanwhile , Frenkel ’s whole approach is sexist , heightening the supposed " danger " posed by " Arab men " to " Jewish girls . "
If Frenkel were fair , she would describe the couples as " men and women , " or , because they are " underaged , " as " boys and girls . "
Frenkel says that " ’ David ’– who does n’t want his name used " has a " mission " to " patrol , " searching to " find Arab - Jewish couples and break up their dates . "
Frenkel shows no revulsion toward David ’s interference .
David avows : " My heart hurts every time I see a Jewish girl with an Arab .
It ’s extremely upsetting .
I ask myself , ‘ How did we get to this situation ?
How did we descend to this level ? ’
It is a serious step backwards in our eyes . "
Frenkel neglects to condemn or even question David about his hunger for segregation .
She lets pass David ’s bigoted claim that he and his ilk exist on a plane inherently " above " Palestinians and would be degraded by " falling " in love with them–literally plunging both down and behind .
Frenkel grants the vigilantes legitimacy : " In groups named ‘ Fire for Judaism ’ and ‘ Love of Youth , ’ 30 to 40 men…patrol the streets each night , " without questioning their monikers or motives .
" Officially , they ’re on the lookout for any mixed couples , " but a driver called " TS " " says the problem lies solely with Arab men dating Jewish girls . "
In other words , another layer of prejudice applies : the gangs are n’t just looking for any " mixed couples . "
Frenkel refrains from asking the vigilantes why Palestinian men in love with Jewish women is a bigger threat to their prejudices than Palestinian women with Jewish men .
TS says that the " Arab " men entice the girls with gifts : " These men approach the girl in a nice way .
They buy her things .
They build trust with the woman so that , given some time , the girls just blindly follow them .
And –with time–one friend follows another , and soon enough , you have a commune made up of these types of girls . "
Horrors : a " commune , " no less .
How is such a conglomeration different from a kibbutz ?
Frenkel does not interrogate the self - appointed posse about its assumption that the Jewish women are saps–bribed into myopia .
Instead , Frenkel tells us –without a glimmer of disapproval –that such Jewish persecution of Palestinian men dating Jewish women has actually become the official policy of one local government : " In…an industrial city in Israel ’s center , " the " municipality has formed a special division " for dealing with the " what it sees as the problem of underage Arab - Jewish couples . "
Frenkel comments , " the couplings are an unforeseen bi-product of the growing number of Jewish settlements that have been built across largely Arab East Jerusalem . "
" Couplings " ?
–sounds as if Frenkel ’s chatting about the mating habits of animals , rather than serious human beings capable of great devotion .
" [ U] nforeseen bi-product " ? –naive inadvertence to the consequences of stealing others ’ property and moving in next door , not a calculated exponential expansion .
" [ G]rowing number " ? –an innocent increase devoid of larceny .
" Jewish settlements " ?
– Jewish pioneers taming uninhabited land , instead of colonies pinched by invaders .
" [ T ] hat have been built " ? –simple construction on mysteriously bulldozed ruins , rather than obliterating others ’ homes .
" [ A] cross largely Arab East Jerusalem " ?
–accidental spread throughout territory once inhabited by Arabs , never purloining the legal inheritance of Palestinians or dominating those who so tenuously remain .
Frenkel conceals the Israeli breaches of International Law in its ethnic cleansing , revealing instead a sense of Palestinians as sub-human .
Frenkel , like Montagne , condemns listeners to ignorance of the bloody Occupation and its ends by hiding every relevant fact .
Frenkel informs us that " Alona Levy , a 16 - year - old Jewish teenager , says that she gets approached by Arab men every day , " twisting the tale into the threat posed by lascivious aliens to virtuous damsels .
Alona portrays her problem as predatory Arabs : " a group of Arab boys drove by and were yelling at us , ‘ Hey , hot girls ! , ’ and we did n’t pay them any attention .
We are n’t interested in them .
This happens to us almost three times a day at least . "
Frenkel does n’t question but rather validates Alona Levy ’s bias about Palestinian boys , announcing , " But she [ Alona ] and her friends understand why some girls decide to defy local norms and date Arab men . "
Alona claims that " There are a lot of girls that go out with Arab men , because Arab boys are wild , they ’re bad boys . "
Alona drives home her point , " I think they [ the Palestinian boys ] like us , because Arab girls are all conservative and wear the covering on their hair , and we dress normally . "
Frenkel does n’t investigate Alona ’s caricatures by actually interviewing either Palestinian boys or girls .
Frenkel reverts to David , for whom " mixed couples " are " a growing epidemic . "
Frenkel refrains from condemning David ’s allergy to romance among Palestinians and Jews .
Frenkel does n’t query David ’s fear , let alone her own mischaracterization of such couples as " mixed . "
What has happened to our American press if an NPR " reporter " frankly implies that Palestinian - Israeli couples are mesalliances or miscegenation ?
What sort of paranoia sees intimacy among Palestinians and Israelis as a plague the way David does ?
What kind of " journalist " concurs with his categories of abuse ?
Frenkel instead announces that David and his fellow vigilantes target girls who are " known problem cases . "
Frenkel recounts
David ’s story of accosting one Jewish girl who refused to get out of a car with Palestinians , taking his word that the car sped off–after first hitting David ’s leg–after which David chased the car for 30 minutes , quitting only after filing a police report .
David announces that : " Our goal is to talk to the girls and convince them that their place is with the Jewish nation , not with our enemies . "
Nowhere does Frenkel utter even a yip about so barbarous a belief : that Jews belong only " with the Jewish nation " and that Palestinians are inviolable " enemies . "
David brags that he and his group have " saved " four girls , declaiming that , " Even if we have rescued only one girl , " " we have done a good deed , and we thank God for it . "
Frenkel remains mum about such fundamentalist zealotry .
Frenkel instead affirms in her closing lines that " ’ David , " –while hiding behind a pseudonym himself –wants publicly to humiliate his target : " He hopes that drawing attention to the incident will embarrass the girl and force her to leave her boyfriend .
He says it ’s one more girl he might save . "
What a terrible end to a biased report .
Frenkel shuts down her twisted " story " of maniacal busy - bodies–mobs , even–with the fiction that David actually cares to " save " a girl .
He merely wants to harass a person better than he is–or at least more open - minded .
" David " craves nothing but hate , pursuing an eternal war based only on his own lethal animosity .
Sheera Frenkel never criticizes the racism of the vigilantes or compares it to traditional U.S. values of equality and kinship for all .
We ca n’t excuse Frenkel ’s omissions by the traditional alibi of " objectivity , " for there ’s nothing " fair " about her approach .
Frenkel interviews no Palestinians who love Jewish people or Jews who love Palestinian people .
Worse , Frenkel valorizes the vigilantes ’ mania .
Sheera Frenkel refuses to depict the affection among these young couples as the gift that it really is .
The couples ’ connection across a lethal Occupation is a hopeful , good sign that peace–amity –harmony are not only possible , but are truly happening right now .
New York Times reporter Andy Revkin ’s innovative Dot Earth blog is one of the best assemblies of climate and population data on the Web .
I ’m a big fan , and comment there from time to time .
Revkin spoke recently to the Woodrow Wilson Center on the impact of population growth on climate change .
He suggested , as a thought experiment , financially rewarding families who have fewer children .
Rush Limbaugh , never one to debate the merits of an issue when he can make a personal attack instead , called Revkin an “ environmental wacko ” and a “ jihad guy . ”
This guy from The New York Times , if he really thinks that humanity is destroying the planet , humanity is destroying the climate , that human beings in their natural existence are going to cause the extinction of life on Earth — Andrew Revkin .
Mr. Revkin , why do n’t you just go kill yourself and help the planet by dying ?
Limbaugh ’s attack on Revkin is a classic example of the ad hominem fallacy .
The ad hominem fallacy was described – probably not for the first time – by Aristotle .
It ’s a logical fallacy .
Essentially , instead of attacking or debating the issue , the speaker attacks the person raising the issue .
It ’s an attack on the messenger instead of the message .
For example , if I were to say in response to Limbaugh ’s statement that you should ignore him because he is a ex-junkie , a pompous , pill - popping , obese idiot , I ’d be engaging the in ad hominem fallacy myself .
It ’s undeniably entertaining , and the statements may even be true , but it is irrelevant to the issues under discussion .
It ’s a change of focus that abandons the primary topic .
It ’s admittedly entertaining , and since Limbaugh is in the business of being entertaining , it suits him well .
But do n’t mistake it for debate .
Or intelligence .
Or logic .
Or useful political discourse .
Revkin ’s correct response should be to point to the fallacy .
In a lot of ways , a debater who resorts to the ad hominem fallacy is admitting he or she has no logical response to the primary argument of his or her opponent .
The planet is undeniably badly over - populated .
By all science tells us , the earth cannot sustain 9 billion people for long .
Limbaugh could n’t rebut the point .
So he attacked Revkin instead .
It ’s always tempting to respond to an ad hominem attack by defending the speaker .
The personal attacks are almost always unfair .
I believe Revkin to be about as fair and balanced a newsreporter as there is .
And certainly much better informed than Limbaugh .
But if you defend the individual , you are falling for the fallacy .
Interestingly , NPR makes this mistake .
The speaker is not the issue ; the issue is the issue .
The best response is always to drag the focus back to the topic , away from the speaker .
So long as we let the Glen Beck ’s and Rush Limbaugh ’s of the world get away with the fallacy , they will use it .
And political discourse will continue to suffer as a result .
We have to call it out each time it happens .

The following is my translation of a much - discussed article that appeared in Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet at the weekend .
This information was being withheld from the public and leaked at an inopportune moment .
Note that the Swedish government has secretly been preparing the banks for financial Armageddon , encouraging Swedbank into a rights issue which arguably was conducted under fraudulent pretenses – very reminiscent of Bank of America ’s shareholder vote for the merger with Merrill Lynch .
In August , I asked “ Why is Swedbank doing a second rights issue ? . ”
Now we know .
This is the kind of thing that topples governments .
Secret meeting on the crisis in Latvian
Finance Minister Anders Borg has had secret talks with the major Swedish banks and warned of a near economic collapse in Latvia , Svenska Dagbladet has learned .
A nightmare scenario for Swedbank and SEB .
Yesterday Anders Borg issued a stark warning to the Latvian Government that it must take its financial problems seriously .
The promised cuts must be implemented when the new Latvian budget is presented in late October , according to Finance Minister .
The international community ’s patience is very limited , stressed Anders Borg at the summit of European finance ministers in Gothenburg where he hosts as the finance minister in Presidency .
His statement came after recent reports from Latvia on political divisions in the ongoing budget negotiations .
But for Swedish bank heads , Borg ’s move came as no surprise .
According to several independent sources , Anders Borg , over the last few weeks , has contacted the senior management of major banks and warned them of an acute political crisis in Latvia .
This in turn can lead to both a devaluation and eventually a default .
It is a kind of national bankruptcy , similar to what hit Iceland last fall .
In secret talks with Swedish banks , Anders Borg explained the growing pressure that exists within the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to force Latvia into a devaluation .
A collapse in Latvia would have serious implications for several major Swedish banks .
With a devaluation the already high loan losses would explode overnight , especially because many Latvians have loans in euro , which would become significantly more expensive .
Swedbank has up to today lent 61 billion kroner to Latvian individuals and businesses .
The figure for SEB is 40 billion , while Nordea has 30 billion in loans .
For Swedbank a possible devaluation would come at an especially poor time .
The bank is currently in the middle of a second rights issue in which shareholders have been asked to put up 15 billion .
CEO Michael
Wolf ’s message to shareholders and customers has repeatedly been that the money would be used for offensive investments .
To then have to deal with a severe national bankruptcy in one of its major markets and see new issue money disappear into a black hole would be a severe blow to the bank ’s credibility .
That a serious crisis approaches in Latvia has already been flagged by Anders Borg in the budget he presented a few weeks ago .
On page 99 he writes :
" Since it is difficult to safely assess Latvia ’s ability to pay and with conditions for recovery , one cannot completely exclude the risk of a major default . "
The background to the current situation is a crash in the Baltic economies .
Latvia is just the worst hit .
This year , the country ’s GDP is to shrink by as much as 18 percent .
This led to a rescue package cobbled together at Christmas last year .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the EU and the Nordic countries decided on payments totaling SEK 80 billion , of which Sweden accounts for 7 billion .
An essential condition for aid money , however , is that Latvia implement substantial cuts in order to get the economy in balance .
This means wage cuts for state employees in over 15 percent , including hospital closures and major tax increases .
In July of last year Latvia went to reduce their spending for next year ’s budget by more than 7.5 billion crowns .
It opened the door to a further one billion disbursements from the IMF and the EU .
But then , the domestic political situation deteriorated .
The previous Latvian government fell in February and since then the country has been governed by a coalition of five parties .
The Prime Minister is Valdis Dombrovskis .
Next year come elections again .
Two of the parties in this five - party coalition have now objected to the previously announced savings of 7.5 billion .
Some want to go back on parts of the promise and believe that a reasonable savings is instead about 4 billion kroner .
The goal to save 500 million lats ( 7.5 billion kroner ) is practically impossible to achieve without eliminating several parts of the economy , Vents Armands Krauklis from the influential Liberal Party , which sits in the government coalition , said the day before yesterday .
24 hours later came the response from the EU .
" Latvia does not have much room for maneuver ;
It must fulfill its letter - of intent , " said Anders Borg yesterday in Gothenburg to the news agency Direkt .

A multi-million dollar project that involves building one of the largest concrete arch bridges in the world , in the shadow of the Hoover Dam will reach a major milestone in the next few weeks .
Construction workers will close the six - foot gap before the end of the month The Colorado River Bridge - which at its highest point will reach almost 900 feet ( 274 m ) above the river - is being built to take the pressure off the narrow , winding road that runs across the Depression - era dam .
Just six feet separate the two concrete fingers of the arch that will form the backbone of the bridge .
One stretches out from the terracotta red canyon walls across the river from Arizona , the other from the Nevada side .
The fingers will meet when the final section of the 1,060 ft ( 323 m ) arch is put in place before the end of the month .
A four - lane highway supported by concrete pillars will sit on top of the arch .
It will provide a new key route between Las Vegas and Phoenix .
The project is scheduled to be completed late next year .

The bridge will stand a quarter of a mile downstream from the Hoover Dam , which when it was completed in 1936 was both the world 's largest electric - power generating station and the world 's largest concrete structure .
" It 's been a great honour for everyone involved to build something worthy of standing in the shadow of the Hoover Dam , " project manager Dave Zanetell of the Federal Highway Administration told the BBC News website .
Everything about the job is special .
Big bridges are really tough and this has represented all those challenges but it has been exacerbated by the extremes of the site .
It is extremely harsh terrain , a physically demanding place . "
Some 1,200 workers have toiled in the searing heat - which frequently reaches 110 degrees Fahrenheit ( 43 degrees Celsius ) - and high winds , 1,000 ft ( 305 m ) above the river .
HOT DAM
Steel cables holding the arch in place , will be removed during September The 1060ft arch will form the centrepiece of one of the longest concrete arch bridges in the world Concrete towers will hold up the bridge roadway .
The tallest will reach 280ft in height More than 17,000 cars and trucks are expected to use the new bridge on a daily basis once it is completed next year Many have been hoisted above the gorge in cages and transported along the steel cables that form part of a high - line system supported by temporary cranes on both sides .
" This has truly been a team effort at every level , " said Mr Zanetell .
" It is a testament to how successfully teams of engineers , architects and the best of our construction industry can overcome many challenges and together to focus on a single goal . "
Work , however , was set back a year in 2006 , when two 280ft steel construction cranes collapsed amid high winds .
The bridge is the centrepiece of the $ 240 m Hoover Dam bypass project , which involves creating a major commercial route between the states of Arizona , Nevada and Utah .
The old road over the dam , which had originally been built as a construction access road , is now deemed to be unsafe .
Building the approaches to the bridge involved blasting into the immense rock formations to build five miles of roadway and seven bridges .

If you ever dreamed of owning your own dinosaur , now ’s your chance .
Possibly the most impressive natural history auction ever is set to take place Oct. 3 at the Venetian Casino in Las Vegas .
The main event will be Samson , one of the best T. rex skeletons ever found .
But there are around 50 lots for sale , including many impressive , museum - quality rarities , all of which will be on display to the public in the weeks preceding the auction .
“ The items we have in this auction are definitely museum standard , or better , ” said Tom Lindgren , co-director of natural history for the auction house Bonhams & Butterfields told Wired.com in August .
“ Most of the museums in the world do n’t have anything near what we have in this auction . ”
The following photos and catalog descriptions include the largest shark jaw ever found , a giant pig skull and a duck - billed dinosaur .
Above : The T. rex known as Samson , One of the Most Complete Tyrannosaurus rex Specimens in Existence
Tyrannosaurus rex
Late Cretaceous ( 100 – 65 million years ago )
Harding County , South Dakota
Measures approximately 40 feet in length , 15 feet in height
Est. $ 2,000,000 – $ 8,000,000
The rare 66 - million - year - old Tyrannosaurus rex is one of the three most complete examples of its species to have been discovered .
Excavated from a ranch near Buffalo , South Dakota over 15 years ago , Samson has journeyed to NASA for CAT scans of the skull , the Carnegie Museum for the preparation of the skull and to a New Jersey laboratory where she was professionally mounted for display .
In life , Samson could have looked into a second story window .
Her massive skull and powerful serrated teeth could have bitten through the leg bone of any contemporary dinosaur .
Most likely a very skilled hunter with binocular color vision and an extremely sensitive sense of smell , this colossus lived as an apex predator of the Late Cretaceous Period .
Prepared at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh , Samson ’s skull is regarded as one of the finest and most complete T. rex skulls in existence , and displays 22 teeth .
The skeleton contains approximately 170 bones , more than 55 percent of the total bone count of an entire skeleton .
Samson was equal in weight to Sue , the T. rex skeleton currently displayed at the Field Museum in Chicago .
Her large size is one indication that Samson is a female , despite her male moniker .

Lot 30
Pair of Dinosaurs Known as “ Xenia ” ( right ) and “ Ben ” ( above )
Einiosaurus procurvicornis
Late Cretaceous ( 100 – 65 million years ago )
Two Medicine Formation , Montana
Large specimen measures 16 feet in length , small specimen measures 13 feet in length
Est. $ 500,000 – $ 600,000
Found exclusively in Montana , Einiosaurus procurvicornis is , like Triceratops , a ceratopsian .
Formally named quite recently ( in 1995 ) , the species ’ most striking features are the down - turned nasal horn and the presence of two long epoccipital horns at the back of the skull .
Both of the present specimens were discovered in the same general area of a Montana bone bed , two digging seasons apart — Xenia in the summer of 2000 and Ben during the summer of 2002 .
These individuals were most likely members of the same herd .
An extremely rare skeleton , Xenia is one of the most complete Einiosaurus specimens ever found .
The very complete skull exhibits excellent representation of midline elements .
A scientifically important feature of the skull is the presence of a virtually complete brain case .
The virtuoso mounting of these specimens is exemplified by the treatment of Xenia ’s skull , which can be turned from side to side .
The skeleton is completely modular .
Almost every bone can be removed from the armature for scientific study ; metal clips and cradles are used to secure the bones to the armature .
The juvenile specimen , known as Ben , displays excellent representation of the nasal horn core .
The skeleton illustrates developmental differences in some key elements of the species .
Ben ’s skull can be rotated along two planes , up - and - down as well as side - to - side .

World ’s Largest Known Set of Shark Jaws
Carcharocles megalodon
Miocene ( 23 – 5 million years ago )
Ogeechee River , South Carolina
Measures 8 feet by 10 feet
Est. $ 900,000 – $ 1,200,000
The world ’s largest known set of shark jaws originate from Carcharocles megalodon , the most massive carnivorous fish species known .
Living 16 million years ago , the gargantuan species is thought to have grown to lengths approaching the length of the contemporary blue whale .
Fifty - one million years after the dinosaurs became extinct , Carcharocles megalodon trolled the Earth ’s seas as an apex predator .
Much is unknown about megalodon ( meaning giant tooth ) , including its exact size .
Scientists differ in their estimates of the length which this marine behemoth may have attained , suggesting linear measures from 40 to 100 feet .
Scientists believe that megalodon became extinct approximately five million years ago .
The collector and preparator of the present piece , Mr. Vito Bertucci , earned the moniker Megalodon Man due to his passionate underwater fossil hunting .
Most widely known for his reconstruction of a Carcharocles megalodon jaw , the topic of a National Geographic television program , the former jeweler spent 20 years collecting the 184 fossil shark teeth with which he reconstructed the present megalodon jaws .
The teeth in the present specimen have been mounted in a resin reconstruction representing the cartilaginous jaw of Carcharocles megalodon .
Four of the teeth are at least seven inches in length .

Large Opalescent Ammonite on Stand
Placenticeras costatum
Late Cretaceous ( 100 – 65 million years ago )
Bearpaw Formation , Southern Alberta , Canada
Measures 20 inches in diameter
Est. $ 35,000 – $ 45,000
Prepared free of matrix , this brilliant ammonite specimen displays a portion of rarely seen blue coloration , adding to the vivid reds , rust - oranges and greens .
The beauty of this example belies its fierce predatory habit as a living squid - like creature .
Desired by collectors the world over , the stunning palette of these marvelous 71 million - year - old ammonites is produced by light interference by the shell layers .
This colorful material , known as ammolite , represents one of only two fossils which are also classified as gemstones .
In the present specimen , resplendent color is seen on both sides .
Offered on a custom oak display stand .

Kansas King Fish – Formidable Fossil Fish from Kansas
Xiphactinus audax
Late Cretaceous ( 100 – 65 million years ago )
Niobrara Chalk Formation , Logan County , Kansas
Length measures 15 feet 3 inches ; length of panel measures 17 feet
Est. $ 200,000 – $ 250,000
One of the finest fossil fish specimens in the world , this Xiphactinus specimen was discovered in 2007 when its tail was spotted partially protruding from a hillside in Western Kansas .
Six weeks of excavation and nearly two years of preparation revealed the second - largest known bony fish specimen in the world , which the discoverer named the Kansas King Fish .
Found within the body cavity is the preserved skeleton of a smaller fish of unknown species .
Amazingly , soft tissue is also preserved with the bony skeleton .
All of the vertebrae are present and original to the specimen .
The massive skull exhibits extremely large teeth and the bony ring around the eye .

Lot 25
Duck - billed Dinosaur
Edmontosaurus annectens
Late Cretaceous ( 100 – 65 million years ago )
Hell Creek Formation , Faith , South Dakota
Measures 28 feet in length , 9.75 feet in height ; skull measures 42 inches
Est. $ 375,000 – $ 475,000
A superlative example of its species , this lot is comprised of a virtually complete , fully mounted Edmontosaurus annectens skeleton .
Displaying very little restoration , its bone count is estimated at 90 per cent .
The superb presentation is the result of months of mounting bones which were recovered from a mass death assemblage .
The bones were excavated from the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research quarry located on the Ruth Mason Ranch near Faith , South Dakota .
Mounted by the BHIGR , it was sold to the Siebo Museum of Tokyo , Japan in 1991 .
When the Museum was closed , it was acquired by a private party in the United States .
Hadrosaurids , or duck - billed dinosaurs , were the largest ornithopods ( a type of bird - hipped dinosaur ) to have ever inhabited Earth .
Edmontosaurus , a type of hadrosaur , grew up to 42 feet in length and may have weighed up to 3.5 tons .
These titans ranged in herds throughout North America during the Cretaceous Period .
Slow - moving plant - eaters with few defenses , duck - bills provided a food source for many carnivores , earning them the nickname the cattle of the Cretaceous .
As illustrated by the present offering , the head of Edmontosaurus was flat and sloping with a wide , toothless beak , cheek pouches and hundreds of closely - packed cheek teeth used to grind its vegetarian diet .
It was a biped ( walking on two legs ) but it could also walk on four legs , perhaps to graze low - lying plants .
Edmontosaurus possessed short arms , a long , pointed tail and distinctive three - toed , hoofed feet .

Giant Fossil Pig Skull
Archaeotherium sp .
Oligocene ( 34 – 23 million years ago )
Brule Formation , White River Badlands , South Dakota
Skull measures 14 inches by 29 inches
Est. $ 9,000 – $ 12,000
A rare genus from an extinct family of Artiodactyls related to the hippos and boars , it is now believed that Archaeotherium was a predator rather than a scavenger .
Its lower jaw structure enabled Archaeotherium to open its jaws very wide , then snap them shut quickly , and the premolar teeth are pointed and triangular , with a sharp ridge along the back edge .
Quite large for the species , the present specimen comprises a skull displaying mostly original teeth , with three cervical vertebrae .
The bones have been prepared in relief from the original matrix .

Lot 37
Largest Known Fossil Shark Skeleton
Cretoxyrhina
Late Cretaceous ( 100 – 65 million years ago )
Niobrara Formation , Gove County , Kansas
Measures 16 feet by 18 feet ; specimen measures 25 feet in length
Est. $ 350,000 – $ 400,000
The largest fossil shark skeleton found to date , this Cretoxyrhina ( kree - tox - ee - rye - nuh ) specimen is virtually complete , with the exception of some skull elements and several teeth .
Because sharks ’ skeletons are cartilaginous , it is extremely difficult to find significant fossilized remains of prehistoric sharks ; decay normally sets in before fossilization can occur .
Here , however , the entire vertebral column is present and the associated cartilaginous remains are extraordinarily well preserved .
Approximately 100 teeth are also preserved .
The specimen is approximately 95 percent articulated – presented in the position in which it was discovered .
Not only are all of the vertebrae preserved , they are in almost perfect alignment .
The caudal fin is preserved in its correct position and other features , such as fins , and possibly skin , are also preserved .
The 82 million - year - old specimen is prepared in a panel mount , on artificial matrix .
The specimen was discovered on private , leased land in Gove County , Kansas .
Cretoxyrhina , meaning the jaws of the Cretaceous , lived in the Late Cretaceous and was the largest shark of its time .
The genus was a swift predator with a torpedo - shaped body line and a hefty tail fin .
An ancestral cousin to the modern great white shark , it was most likely the most formidable of all fish species in the Cretaceous seas .
Though sharks were plentiful and were successful marine predators , relatively few prehistoric shark skeletons are preserved .
Unlike bony fish , the cartilage of shark skeleton requires especially fortuitous conditions for fossilization to occur .

Palm Mural
Sabalites sp .
Eocene ( 56 – 34 million years ago )
Green River Formation , Wyoming
Measures 70 inches by 8 1inches
Est. $ 40,000 – $ 50,000
Arguably the most aesthetically appealing finds from the Green River Formation are its amazing palm fronds .
Considered rare in this geologic formation due to the low probability of preservation of the delicate organic material , these wonderful fossil plants evoke the subtropical climate of North America during the Eocene .
In the high desert of what is now known as Wyoming , an ancient lake system , surrounded by lush subtropical vegetation , teemed with fishes , turtles and crocodiles .
The present specimen is a superlative palm frond specimen characteristic of this locality .
The stone has been backed with wood and custom framed in African Wenge wood .

Lot 32
Woolly Mammoth Skeleton
Mammuthus primigenius
Pleistocene ( 2.6 million – 10,000 years ago )
Eastern Siberia , Russia
Height measures 11 feet
Est. $ 150,000 – $ 200,000
Woolly mammoths journeyed through the frozen wastelands of the last Ice Age as the largest mammals of their time .
Approximately the size of the Asian elephant , their hairy body and storage of fat provided warmth ; their heavy , shaggy coats consisted of an outer layer of long , dark hair with a layer of fine under - wool for insulation , their skin was dark gray with an underlying layer of insulating fat .
Unlike modern elephant ears , the woolly mammoth ’s ears were small ( elephants use their ears to cool themselves and , as the mammoth lived in a cold environment , large ears were unnecessary . )
Mammoths most likely used their long , curved tusks to sift the snow to forage for vegetation ; males may have used their tusks in intra-species combat or competition for females .
The present woolly mammoth skeleton is excellently preserved , boasting approximately 90 percent original bone .
Though the skeleton was recovered from permafrost , no remains of soft tissue are preserved , indicating that the animal ’s carcass was exposed to the elements , causing decomposition , before it was permanently buried in the frozen soil .
The specimen has been professionally mounted and stands nearly 11 feet in height .

Yesterday marked the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing .
Forty years ago mission commander Neil A. Armstrong and lunar module pilot Edwin Eugene ' Buzz ' Aldrin , Jr. walked on the moon while command module pilot Michael Collins orbited above .
Today however , marks the 40th anniversary of the day people really reacted to what just happened .
As with all major events in time , there is always a day of reflection .
I 'd like to honor that day of reflection with my top 10 thoughts about the Apollo 11 moon landing .
It was a comeback victory in the space race against the Soviets
I 'd even say , we made the Soviets look like chumps .
We won the space race by putting a man on the moon .
Sure , the Soviets were there first , having bounced their Luna 2 spacecraft off the moon 10 years earlier , but we left our footprints there .
The Cold War may have lasted another 15 years or so after that , but it gave us the confidence to make movies like Red Dawn .
It also showed the world what could be achieved by democracy over communism .
From my father , who was in the Navy at the time :
I was at sea when the landing occurred ; I did n't even know about it until we hit our next port of call , which was Barcelona .
I can tell you that the Spanish people were very excited about the landing ; they mostly thought it was a wonderful occurrence and congratulated us sailors for the event .
They also thought we must be very proud to have beaten the Russians to the moon .
At the time , Spain was under the control of the fascist dictatorship government of Francisco Franco .
Gave the conspiracy theorists something to talk about for the next century
Even though anyone with a high - powered telescope and laser system ( do n't you have one ? ) can see the reflections off the equipment left on the moon , the conspiracy theorists still think the whole thing was staged , on the basis that we have n't gone back .
If we should have faked anything in the late ' 60s , it should have been Vietnam .
GeekDad has more on debunking the conspiracy theories .
It felt great to be an American
The '60s were a tumultuous time in American history .
Civil rights , Vietnam , Kennedy and the Cold War – all made for a stressful time and American values were put to the test .
But when we landed on the moon , everyone in America put all that aside , if only for a couple days .
As stated by my cousin KV :
I was at a Little League party , watching the moon landing after our last game of the season .
There was a 7
Eleven across the street , so the mom got all of us Coke slurpees , which had just been invented recently .
I sat there watching Neil Armstrong take the first steps on the moon while I took a taste of my first Coke slurpee .
I remember thinking how great it is to be American .
Made Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin legends in their own time
That 's hard to achieve these day , with nothing happening as spectacular as walking on the moon .
When you think space you think of Armstrong and Aldrin .
When you look up at the moon you think about those images , no matter how old or young you are .
Those images of them walking on the moon are an iconic piece of American history that every child will remember until the day when we 're all enslaved in the Matrix .
Proved that the moon was not made of cheese
There were a lot of excited scientists when we landed on the moon – they knew that it would lead to research projects and glorious spoonfuls of moon rocks .
Since then , experiments in space and on objects from space — especially moon items , have been at the forefront of our exploration .
After beating the Soviets ( since that was the driving force for going there in the first place ) the science has taken over and a lot has been discovered about our moon , science that is still relevant today . <
Kennedy was right
He was shot and killed while in office , and there is no greater legacy attributed to John F. Kennedy than his promise to put a man on the moon .
Less than six years after his death , we did just that .
And we brought them back safely , just like Kennedy promised .
First , I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him back safely to the earth .
No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important for the long - range exploration of space ; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish .
It turned science fiction into reality
For years , many great science fiction novels and the pages of Analog magazine theorized about what it was like on the moon .
Adventures took place there , colonies were built and the moon was a place of fantasy .
Not anymore .
The day after we landed on the moon , science fiction writers around the globe not only celebrated the fact , but started looking for more far - fetched places for alien detective stories — like Mars .
If we had n't landed on the moon , Total Recall may have never been as cool as it was .
Gave our kids something to aspire to
The Cold War was a bummer .
The kids growing up in the 1960s were tired of hiding under their desks for nuclear bomb drills and were feeling depressed by society .
Being told they could grow up to be president did n't sound that great anymore after Kennedy 's assassination .
Growing up to be Mickey Mantle was the next best option , but that only brought thoughts of liver damage .
Then we set foot on the moon , and now you could grow up to be an astronaut .
How fantastic is that ?
Can you imagine the wonder on a child 's face sitting in front of the television as Armstrong bounded along the moon 's surface ?
It validated NASA 's existence
NASA was under a lot of pressure from the government and from the American public to do something spectacular .
When Kennedy promised a moon landing , the scrutiny was even harsher .
NASA had no choice but to land us on the moon as quickly as possible .
When it did , it achieved at least 40 years of grants and funding ; only now is it coming under scrutiny again .
We actually sent a spacecraft to the moon and landed on it
The Apollo 11 mission astronauts trained hard for countless hours for this mission .
NASA spent millions of dollars on building a spacecraft with the specifications needed to land on the moon .
They did n't have a moon to test it on first – this was the test .
Sure , they could simulate the landing , but nothing is better than the real thing .
The science , the engineering , the planning and training that went into this project was the first of its kind .
We landed men on the moon .
Think of how amazing that actually is and the hundreds of people it took to do it .
Forty years ago today , every single one of those people watched the moon landing again on the evening news and reflected on the part that they played in putting a man on the moon .
This is a virtual toast to every single one of them .
Let 's not have it be another 40 years before we are back there , building a mini-mall .

WASHINGTON 
The basic Medicare premium will shoot up next year by 15 percent , to $ 110.50 a month , federal officials said Monday .
The increase means that monthly premiums would top $ 100 for the first time , a stark indication of the rise in medical costs that is driving the debate in Congress about a broad overhaul of the health care system .
About 12 million people , or 27 percent of Medicare beneficiaries , will have to pay higher premiums or have the additional amounts paid on their behalf .
The other 73 percent will be shielded from the increase because , under federal law , their Medicare premiums cannot go up more than the increase in their Social Security benefits , and Social Security officials announced last week that there would be no increase in benefits in 2010 because inflation had been extremely low .
Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services , urged the Senate to approve a bill , already passed by the House , to block the scheduled increase in Medicare premiums .

So many moons ago , I added Digg.com and Reddit.com button ’s to my site as a way to help get traffic .
Well , after having the buttons on my site for a bit , and having articles submitted to both Digg and Reddit , I have discovered an interesting pattern .
But first , a little background .
If you do n’t already know , Digg and Reddit are basically Link submission sites .
People submit links to things they think are fun / good / interesting / odd / whatever to Digg and Reddit .
Once submitted the Digg or Reddit users can look at the link and vote it up , or down depending on if they like it or not .
If you want to know more about it , you can go to their sites and read more about how it works and such .
So , while using Digg and Reddit to help get traffic to my site , I noticed something interesting .
Digg.com is crap .
Yeah , I said it .
DIGG IS CRAP .
Deal with it .
Looking at the logs to my site , articles I submit to Digg and Reddit at the same time , generate very different results .
For example , my post about Mowing .
Number of people who visited from Digg.com ?
One .
Maybe .
Number of people who visited from Reddit.com ?
OVER 2,000 !
That ’s just one example .
Most of what I submit to Reddit does not get up voted beyond 1 or 2 points .
And that ’s fine , that means my content is not as interesting to some people as I would like .
But the same things submitted to Digg get between ZERO and TWO visitors .
To me it appears Digg may be suffering from what I fundamentally call the “ High School Problem . ”
The “ High School Problem ” is basically a popularity contest .
The Super - Submitters , and popular sites and blogs are the ones that get Digged up and payed attention too .
Some of my entries that I have submitted to Digg have received NO hits referred from Digg.com at all .
It ’s like the ‘ loser ’ in high school who walks through the halls being totally ignored because he is n’t a football player , or does n’t have a new car bought by his parents like all the popular kids .
Where in contrast , Reddit.com is like College .
I submit my posts to Reddit and get at least a few hits , and usually get down voted and we move on .
Like in college where it does n’t matter if you are popular or not , people will at least give you the chance to say what you have to say .
Some will appreciate your thoughts , and originality , some wo n’t .
But at least they do n’t just ignore people because they are n’t part of the ‘ in ’ crowd .
Fun Fact : Hitler used to ignore updates from his unpopular officers that did n’t get Panzers from their parents .
I know there are other link type sites like Digg and Reddit out there , but I have n’t really used any of them so I cannot really say anything about things like StumbleUpon or whatever .
The biggest decision of the economic recovery will be made in the next six months , and President Obama will have almost nothing to do with it .
Bernanke 's trillion - dollar decision
The biggest decision of the economic recovery will be made in the next six months , and Barack Obama will have almost nothing to do with it .
Forget the debate over TARP , and never mind the questions about a second stimulus .
This decision is about when to pull out $ 1 trillion that ’s propping up the U.S. banking system .
And it will be Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his Fed colleagues who make the call .
Advertisement
That ’s hard enough for a White House that knows its political fortunes rise and fall with the economy .
What ’s worse is that Bernanke and Obama – like many presidents and Fed chairmen past – wo n’t necessarily have the same goals for this trillion - dollar decision .
Fed chiefs worry about inflation .
Bernanke wants to take the money out quickly enough to prevent the economy from overheating and causing a jump in prices that strangles growth .
But move too fast , and the economic recovery runs out of fuel .
Presidents worry about jobs .
Obama probably would n’t mind a little overheating , say , next summer – when voters are starting to make up their minds about the 2010 congressional elections , and he hopes the economy can shake the 10 - percent unemployment rate doldrums .
“ Any chairman of the Fed will do what ’s right for the country , not what ’s right for the administration , ” said Ernest Patrikis , a partner at the law firm White & Case who spent 30 years at the New York Fed .
“ That ’s his job – that ’s why he ’s apolitical . ”
“ The exit will be so difficult , ” said economist Joseph Brusuelas of Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ Bernanke wants to engineer a recovery that does not include inflation .
Obama wants a more robust recovery and like many political actors may be willing to forgo a little inflation for a little more employment . ”
The White House is already worried that jobs wo n’t be coming back fast enough next year , Fed or no Fed .
Obama economic adviser Christina Romer warned a congressional panel Thursday that the jobs picture will remain “ painfully weak ” through 2010 , with a seriously elevated unemployment rate for another year .
So all the White House can do is watch and wait , and hope it does n’t pay a political price for any missteps by Fed officials they ca n’t control .
“ It ’s a dicey thing to do , and they know it , ” said Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee .
“ They have to be careful . ”
The Fed ’s moves are shrouded in secrecy , their prerogative to move the levers of the economy closely guarded – so much so that there ’s been a recent a rise in populist anger about this all - powerful agency that exists largely outside the democratic process .
But because the Fed is an independent agency , it ’s even considered bad form for a president to talk much about it – and indeed , the White House refused to comment for this story .
Last fall , the Fed injected $ 1 trillion - plus into the nation ’s banking system – at times , by providing financial institutions with cash to cover their losses as the global meltdown spread .
Now Fed officials are already talking about the need to withdraw the funds injected into the economy during the darkest days of the crisis , moves that are credited with largely saving the United States from plummeting into an economic depression .
“ Given the highly unusual economic and financial circumstances , judging when the time is appropriate to remove policy accommodation , and then calibrating that removal , will be challenging , ” said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn in a speech to the Cato Institute on Sept. 30 .
“ Still , we need to be ready to take the necessary actions when the time comes , and we will be . ”
Translation : “ policy accommodation ” is the cash , and “ the necessary actions ” are the decision to ease it out of the economy . ”
And is the Fed prepared to the pull the trigger ?
“ We will be ” seems to cover it .
Already , the Fed is already showing some signs of restlessness .
On Monday , the New York Fed tested its “ reverse - repo ” process -- one tool the Fed could use to use to pull the money out when the time comes .
The test run was widely interpreted as a sign the Fed is getting ready to act – but when , nobody knows .
The Fed can also tap on the brakes at the first sign of inflation by raising interest rates , now near zero .
The Fed has said it will keep the rock - bottom rates for an extended period , but it wo n’t be more specific when they could go up – a decision that is bound to be controversial when it comes .
Patrikis thinks the Fed will make a decision on withdrawing liquidity either during the second quarter of 2010 , or after the November elections that year – but that it wo n’t make any dramatic moves in the run-up to Election Day .
Still , he said , it is too early to predict what the Fed might do .
And Patrikis points out that Obama will have indirect input into the decision , because there are two vacancies on the Fed ’s board now that Obama will fill in the coming months .
The president will surely select board members whose economic judgment he trusts .
Between the two vacancies , a member who Obama appointed earlier this year and Bernanke himself , the president will likely have named four of the seven members of the Fed ’s Board of Governors by the time they make the call .
But the Fed knows actions like that can have political consequences .
“ There are few politicians who like higher interest rates , ” said one former Fed official .
“ And President Obama is a politician . ”
That said , the official continued , “ I suspect they will be broadly on the same page . ”
That ’s because Obama , too , has a longer - term time frame in mind : 2012 , when he will be running for reelection .
It ’s in Obama ’s interest for the Fed to take inflation prevention measures now so that he does n’t have to run a tricky reelection campaign in a high - inflation environment .
Tensions between Presidents and Fed chairmen are nothing new .
In the 1980s , Fed Chairman Paul Volcker declared war on inflation .
His strategy : raising interest rates .
Volcker jacked the Fed funds rate to 20 percent , which contributed to the deep early 1980s recession that caused howls of protest from the White House and incumbent Republicans on Capitol Hill .
The Fed , grumbled then - Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker ( R - Tenn . ) , should “ get its boot off the neck of the economy . ”
Nonetheless , Volcker ’s strategy worked , and the Fed broke the back of the inflation cycle .
Ironically , Volcker is a top economic adviser to Obama today .
In the 1990s , President George H.W. Bush blamed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan for his election loss to Bill Clinton .
Bush did n’t believe Greenspan was lowering interest rates fast enough to pull the nation out of a recession – which gave Clinton , with his famous “ it ’s the economy , stupid ” campaign , an opening to trounce the elder Bush .
Mark Gertler , a professor of economics at New York University , says the lesson of history is that politicians should not interfere with the central bank .
“ If the Fed does n’t act independently , the economy is endangered , ” said Gertler .
“ It would be dangerous if the administration appeared to be interfering with the Fed . ”
Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) doubts they ’ll be any daylight between Obama and Bernanke – who Obama just reappointed over the summer at a time when Wall Street needed a signal that there would be continuity at the Fed .
He argues that Bernanke and Obama will have the same agenda in 2010 : fixing the economy .
“ I think they are very much in sync , ” said Frank .
Asked about potential divergence between the Fed and the White House , he said , “ That reflects a journalist ’s hope that there will be friction .
Obama and Bernanke have both argued that at some point they ’re going to unwind this . ”
In 30 or 40 years , we 'll have microscopic machines traveling through our bodies , repairing damaged cells and organs , effectively wiping out diseases .
The nanotechnology will also be used to back up our memories and personalities .
In an interview with Computerworld , author and futurist Ray Kurzweil said that anyone alive come 2040 or 2050 could be close to immortal .
The quickening advance of nanotechnology means that the human condition will shift into more of a collaboration of man and machine , as nanobots flow through human blood streams and eventually even replace biological blood , he added .
That may sound like something out of a sci- fi movie , but Kurzweil , a member of the Inventor 's Hall of Fame and a recipient of the National Medal of Technology , says that research well underway today is leading to a time when a combination of nanotechnology and biotechnology will wipe out cancer , Alzheimer 's disease , obesity and diabetes .
It 'll also be a time when humans will augment their natural cognitive powers and add years to their lives , Kurzweil said .
" It 's radical life extension , " Kurzweil said .
" The full realization of nanobots will basically eliminate biological disease and aging .
I think we 'll see widespread use in 20 years of [ nanotech ] devices that perform certain functions for us .
In 30 or 40 years , we will overcome disease and aging .
The nanobots will scout out organs and cells that need repairs and simply fix them .
It will lead to profound extensions of our health and longevity . "
Of course , people will still be struck by lightning or hit by a bus , but much more trauma will be repairable .
If nanobots swim in , or even replace , biological blood , then wounds could be healed almost instantly .
Limbs could be regrown .
Backed up memories and personalities could be accessed after a head trauma .
Today , researchers at MIT already are using nanoparticles to deliver killer genes that battle late - stage cancer .
The university reported just last month the nano - based treatment killed ovarian cancer , which is considered to be one of the most deadly cancers , in mice .
And earlier this year , scientists at the University of London reported using nanotechnology to blast cancer cells in mice with " tumor busting " genes , giving new hope to patients with inoperable tumors .
So far , tests have shown that the new technique leaves healthy cells undamaged .
With this kind of work going on now , Kurzweil says that by 2024 we 'll be adding a year to our life expectancy with every year that passes .
" The sense of time will be running in and not running out , " he added .
" Within 15 years , we will reverse this loss of remaining life expectancy .
We will be adding more time than is going by . "
And in 35 to 40 years , we basically will be immortal , according to the man who wrote The Age of Spiritual Machines and The Singularity is Near : When Humans Transcend Biology .
Kurzweil also maintains that adding microscopic machines to our bodies wo n't make us any less human than we are today or were 500 years ago .
" The definition of human is that we are the species that goes beyond our limitations and changes who we are , " he said .
" If that was n't the case , you and I would n't be around because at one point life expectancy was 23 .
We 've extended ourselves in many ways .
This is an extension of who we are .
Ever since we picked up a stick to reach a higher branch , we 've extended who we are through tools .
It 's the nature of human beings to change who we are . "
But that does n't mean there are n't parts of this future that do n't worry him .
With nanotechnology so advanced that it can travel through our bodies and affect great change on them , come dangers as well as benefits .
The nanobots , he explained , will be self - replicating and engineers will have to harness and contain that replication .
" You could have some self - replicating nanobot that could create copies of itself ... and ultimately , within 90 replications , it could devour the body it 's in or all humans if it becomes a non-biological plague , " said Kurzweil .
" Technology is not a utopia .
It 's a double - edged sword and always has been since we first had fire . "
Are there any computer programs that you wish were faster ?
Time was , you could solve that problem just by waiting ; next year ’s system would run them faster .
No longer ;
Next year ’s system will do more computing all right , but by giving you more CPUs , running at this year ’s speed , to work with .
So the only way to make your program faster is to work with more CPUs .
Bad news : this is hard .
Good news : we have some really promising technologies to help make it less hard .
Bad news : none of them are mainstream .
But I ’m betting that will change .
The “ Java Moment ” · On my recent excursion to Japan , I had the chance for a few conversations with Bruce Tate .
He advanced a line of thinking that I found compelling : Right now is the time when the concurrent - programming winners will emerge .
He sees an analogy to Object - Orientation in the early nineties : Several O - O languages were in play ( most notably C++ and Smalltalk ) , but it had n’t penetrated the application - development mainstream .
Then Java came along , and turned out to have just the right characteristics to push O - O into the middle of the road .
Thus the analogy .
Right at the moment , we have a bunch of candidate technologies to fill in the concurrent - programming void ; obvious examples include Erlang , Scala , Clojure , and Haskell .
While there are common threads , they differ from each other in many essential ways .
Between the lot of them , there are a whole lot of different characteristics .
The fact is , we do n’t know at this moment which laundry - list of features is going to turn some candidate into The Java Of Concurrency .
What I ’m Up To · I think that right now is a good time to have a run at this problem .
I ’ve been scanning back and forth around the Internet , information - gathering , contrasting , and comparing .
As I work through this , I ’ll publish my research notes here on the blog as I go along .
Here ’s what I have so far :
Who Should Care ·
The developers , actually ; they have a direct incentive in that by doing concurrency well , their apps will run faster , and their employers do too in that the same performance level will require less iron .
In fact , I suspect the most likely candidates to get behind this are the chip builders ; it ’s traditionally been seen as their role to push the development tools that make their products shine .
So I suspect that Intel , AMD , IBM , and the Sun part of Oracle are the most likely candidates to go all activist .
In particular , the Sun SPARC processors have been leading the more - cores - and - damn - the - gigahertz charge for the last few years , so we ought to be the ones who care the most .
Linkography · I ’ve started working on a Late - 2009 Concurrency Linkography page over at Project Kenai ; it seems something that fits more comfortably on a wiki than a blog .
If there ’s anyone else out there that wants to contribute , I ’m open - minded .
I ’m leaning toward things that are contemporary rather than historic in value .
Non-Problem · I think the concurrency problem is pretty well solved for one class of application : the Web server and most of what runs in it .
If you know what you ’re doing , whether you ’re working in an Apache module or Java EE or Rails or Django or PHP or .NET , given enough load you can usually arrange to saturate as many cores as you can get your hands on .
That ’s a big chunk of the application space , but not all of it .
And even in web apps , it ’s not uncommon to have pure application code that needs to wrestle the concurrency dragon .
Assumption · I ’m taking the following as an axiom : Exposing real pre-emptive threading with shared mutable data structures to application programmers is wrong .
Once you get past Doug Lea , Brian Goetz , and a few people who write operating systems and database kernels for a living , it gets very hard to find humans who can actually reason about threads well enough to be usefully productive .
When I give talks about this stuff , I assert that threads are a recipe for deadlocks , race conditions , horrible non-reproducible bugs that take endless pain to find , and hard - to - diagnose performance problems .
Nobody ever pushes back .
IF you watch HBO ’s police drama “ The Wire , ” you might think that Baltimore is filled with drug dealers and crime ringleaders .
But in truth , the city has attracted a different breed of misfits : artists .
Lured by cheap rents and warehouse spaces , artists and photographers have flocked there to claim the city as their own .
Once rough neighborhoods like Hampden and Highlandtown have been taken over in recent years by studios , galleries and performance spaces .
Crab joints and sports bars now share the cobblestone streets with fancy cafes and tapas restaurants .
But against this backdrop , there are still the beehive hairdos and wacky museums that give so - called Charm City its nickname .
Friday
4 p.m.
1 ) INTO THE WOODS
Though you would n’t guess it as you enter Baltimore on Interstate 95 , which passes port terminals and factories spewing smoke , the center of the city conceals a wooded , stream - filled oasis , the Jones Falls Trail ( www.jonesfalls.org).
Once heavily polluted itself , the 58 - square - mile watershed has been restored over the past decade and now features a green biking and hiking trail , which parallels the Jones Fall River and meanders through some of the old mills that once powered Baltimore ’s economy .
It is a rustic and historical look at a sometimes gritty city .
7 p.m.
2 ) NOT JUST CRABS
In a town known for crab cakes and fried fish sandwiches , Woodberry Kitchen ( 2010 Clipper Park Road ; 410-464-8000 ; www.woodberrykitchen.com) stands out for its refined local cooking .
Set in the Clipper Mill complex , an old foundry that is now home to artists ’ studios , galleries and homes , Woodberry serves nouveau American comfort food using seasonal and local ingredients , like Chesapeake soft - shell crabs served with a spicy tartar sauce , and brick - oven roasted chicken with a sweet cider glaze , on top of a Spanish - style tortilla .
Dinner for two , about $ 80 .
10 p.m .
3 ) VERY OFF BROADWAY
True to its countercultural roots , Baltimore mostly eschews touring Broadway shows for offbeat theater .
Perhaps the strangest are staged by the Creative Alliance at the Patterson ( 3134 Eastern Avenue ; 410-276-1651 ; www.creativealliance.org), whose stage feels like an old vaudeville house .
One night , you might catch burlesque artists stripping down to their pasties ; another night , a documentary on Baltimore ’s decaying schools .
The adjacent gallery often features the works of local painters and photographers .
Aside from being affectionate , loyal pets , all dogs are famous for their love of treats .
Given their nature , it 's always tempting to feed your dog scraps from the table ( especially when they give you “ puppy eyes ” ! ) .
However , just because certain types of food are edible for humans , they are not necessarily able to be processed by your dog 's digestive system .
There are many human foods that can be toxic for your dog , and may cause serious health problems .
Chocolate
Chocolate is commonly known by many dog owners as being a toxic substance for pets .
The reason chocolate is dangerous , is because it contains theobromine , which is a cardiac stimulant .
Consuming large amounts of chocolate will cause a dog to become extremely sick , as the overdose of theobromine will cause the heart to beat irregularly .
Chocolate can also cause extreme excitement in your dog , as well as hyperactivity ( due to the high caffeine content ) .
Death by heart failure is very common in dogs that have eaten a significant amount of chocolate .
Onions & Garlic
Onions and garlic both contain thiosulphate , which is extremely toxic to animals .
Thiosulphate can cause haemolytic anaemia , which is an extremely serious condition .
Dogs that are affected by haemolytic anaemia will have their red blood cells burst during circulation , which will show up in your dog 's vomit or urine .
Symptoms include weakness , listlessness , vomiting and irregular urine .
This is a very serious condition , and if your dog has eaten any products containing onions , it is strongly recommended to take your dog to a veterinarian immediately .
Macadamia Nuts
Macadamia nuts have only been recently discovered as a toxic substance that can negatively affect pet health .
The specific element in macadamia nuts that is toxic for animals is unknown , however , several studies have proven that this is a very dangerous food for dogs .
Ingestion of macadamia nuts can cause swollen joints , labored breathing , and muscle tremors .
Most dogs only need ingest a few macadamia nuts to have a negative reaction .
Large Amounts of Liver
Feeding your dog large amounts of “ organ meats ” ( such as liver and kidney meat ) can be extremely toxic .
These meats are very high in Vitamin A , which should only be given in moderated amounts .
Too much organ meat can cause Hypervitaminosis A ( Vitamin A poisoning ) , which results in vomiting , nausea , and loss of muscle coordination .
Fat Trimmings
Though small amounts of fat are needed to sustain your dog 's overall health , large amounts of fat , especially in a single meal , can be extremely dangerous for your dog .
Ingestion of a single high - fat meal can cause pancreatitis , a condition that is extremely dangerous if not treated .
The pancreas is responsible for secreting digestive enzymes to help break down fats .
However , with the constant ingestion of high - fat foods , the pancreas overworks itself , secreting an excess of digestive fluids .
These fluids eventually begin to “ digest ” the pancreas and surrounding organs , sometimes causing complete failure of the pancreas .
These are just a handful of the many foods that can potentially poison your dog .
Always make sure that you do your research before feeding your dog a new food or even plant new shrub in your garden .
Also be sure that any poisonous foods are never left in places accessible by your dog .
As much as I admire the elegant design of the iPhone , I find the auto - rotate feature infuriating on a daily basis .
Landscape mode is vital for many apps , especially Safari , and it needs to be easily discoverable .
Yet the way it ’s implemented in the iPhone removes the feeling of control from the user , violating a fundamental UI principle .
The problems
This lack of control arises from two physical issues :
Firstly , the accelerometer measures the angle of the device relative to gravity , not the user .
If you have tried to use your iPhone lying down , you ’ll have found that it ’s uncomfortable to read text at right angles to your reading position .
Secondly , the iPhone is a mobile device , and mobile devices move .
The implementation has to avoid rotating in response to vibration and unintended movement , yet reliably rotate when required .
This requires a heuristic algorithm , which is notoriously difficult to get right — especially if it needs to work everywhere a phone might be used .
The implications
There are more serious implications than merely discouraging my bad habit of reading email and browsing the web before I get out of bed in the morning .
Apparent unresponsiveness :
The pause before the screen rotates is part of the heuristics , making sure that the phone is in the final position before rotating .
This noticeable pause is a harsh contrast with the admirable responsiveness of rest of the iPhone software .
Ca n’t rotate while walking :
If you ’re walking while browsing ( again , a bad habit ) or on a typical British train , rotation does n’t work at all or happens accidently .
To regain control while walking , you have to stop , wait until the phone rotates , then walk again .
To regain control on the train … good luck with that .
Frustrating behaviours :
For example , if you drop your arm to your side while waiting for a page to load , the phone is now horizontal and when you bring it back up to read , you ’ll have to wait for it to rotate back .
All in all , I do n’t feel in control of the rotation of the iPhone .
Asking around , I do n’t think I ’m alone .
But everything else about the iPhone is focused on giving the user control over the device to achieve exactly what they want , when they want .
So why did Apple implement rotation the way they did ?
Reading the mind of the iPhone designers
I can see why Apple have chosen to implement rotation this way , and their reasons are sound .
It makes a great demo , which helps sell devices .
It ’s wonderfully discoverable , essential for such a vital feature .
It has zero on - screen UI , removing clutter from the elegant UI design .
Yet I have severe misgivings about the end result .
In my humble opinion
I suppose the ‘ obvious ’ approach would be to add an option to disable auto - rotate and replace it with a gesture .
As a software designer , I have an instinctive distrust of options .
They have to be found by the user , and the implications of the option must be obvious from little more than the label on a checkbox .
And of course , it means you have to test your software with it on and off .
Resorting to an option often means that you , the designer , have n’t thought about the problem enough .
Giving up and lumbering the user with the burden of deciding between two sub-optimal choices does not result in polished software .
While I respect Apple ’s minimally elegant implementation , I have a suggestion which gives the user control over their device .
When the accelerometer senses rotation , the phone displays an icon in the bottom right hand corner of the proposed orientation .
If you rotated from portrait to landscape , it might look something like this :
At this point , the user has the following choices :
Touch the icon to rotate the screen to the proposed orientation .
Ignore the icon , and it ’ll disappear in a few seconds .
A little shake of the phone brings it back .
Hold down for a menu , which allows you to choose what happens for the current context ( app , or display within an app ) Disable auto-rotate Always portrait Always landscape Always ask
Dragging a stroke across the icon hides it until another rotation is detected .
Only the first choice is trivial to discover , but missing the other options is not going to cause serious problems with the user experience .
There ’s precedent for all the gestures within the existing UI .
Apps would need a new API to inform the OS of any contexts within the app , but existing apps which did n’t use it would still work well .
In addition , the Settings app will need a reset for the persistent choices , just like the reset for location information permissions .
This UI is still discoverable and looks good in a demo , but the user has far more control over their device .
A small price for a tiny bit of on - screen clutter ?

How Skeptics Confronted 9/11 Denialism
by John Ray
Skeptics today bemoan the overwhelming proportion of people who claim to believe in all manner of conspiracy theories from the JFK assassination to the origins of HIV - AIDS .
For that reason , it may be worthwhile to take a moment to stop and celebrate one area in which skeptical advocacy has been overwhelming successful : the world of 9/11 conspiracies .
Through the work of scholars like Michael Shermer and James Meigs , along with everyday skeptics on the grassroots level , critical inquiry has been overwhelmingly successful in calling these conspiracy theorists to task .
A tragedy on a scale at least comparable to Pearl Harbor or the Kennedy assassination was bound to inspire a conspiracy subculture , but the takeoff success of the viral Internet documentary Loose Change and the movement it created was unprecedented .
Looking out on the world in 2005 when Change became one of the most - watched Internet videos of all time , with over ten million unique viewers1 , it was hard to anticipate a future that was anything but bleak for those who felt it was their duty to defend history from such pseudohistorians .
Yet , in just under four years , the 9/11 “ truth movement ” has ground to a halt .
Apart from the fundamental incoherence of their theories , the downfall of the 9/11 denier juggernaut was good old - fashioned skepticism at its finest , the kind that conjures visions of James Randi challenging psychics and faith healers on their home turfs and winning .
Skeptics are better at their jobs than they think , and its important to give credit where credit is due .
Staking their fortunes almost solely on Internet - based content may have been the 9/11 deniers ’ biggest mistake .
What seems like a perfect place for pseudoscience — the Internet is un-edited , without fact - checkers or minimum publishing standards of any kind — also became a perfect place for a rapid - response system of blogs and forums to fight back .
Drawing on the freely available technical information from the NIST , FEMA , and academic journals which most colleges let their students access for free , skeptical sites like ScrewLooseChange.blogspot.com and debunking911.com are able to defuse 9/11 denier claims as they arise .
The Internet forced many “ ground - level ” 9/11 deniers — those who spread the gospel on popular social networking sites like Facebook and in their own blogosphere — into a rhetorical corner .
Instantaneous information traps old , well - discussed claims into sheer redundancy .
In three years of debating 9/11 deniers , I have encountered almost the exact same laundry list of claims on dozens of occasions .
The same resources have been successful in debunking 9/11 myths since their inception , tipping the debate against them .
The first Loose Change was a sweeping work that , by this author ’s estimation2 , implicated roughly 578,000 people in their version of 9/11 ; the “ final edition , ” though twice as long , has orders of magnitude less content and almost zero positive claims , drumming up a meager 8,200 suspects3 .
This is almost certainly a result of Internet - based skeptics bombarding Loose Change ’s makers with the facts .
What should go down as a knockout blow to the 9/11 denier movement , what Michael Shermer called “ just about one of the best things ever done in the history of skepticism , ” 4 is the now - famous Popular Mechanics article turned into a best - selling book that debunked many of the top points the conspiracy theorists relied on .
Joining a chorus of mainstream publications including Skeptic and taking the central claims head on , the Popular Mechanics article became a cornerstone for the 9/11 denier movement ’s undoing .
The Popular Mechanics article was published in its March 2005 issue and became an Internet hit after the live debate hosted by Democracy Now ! between Popular Mechanics editors Jim Meigs and David Dunbar and Loose Change creators Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas .
In the aftermath of that debate — if this is any indicator of which side presented the better case — that article became the most popularly searched item pertaining to 9/11 conspiracies and , from that point on , the skeptical perspective became the dominant voice pertaining to the movement .
The conversation was brought to the mainstream , and the mainstream made its decision .
Today , the 9/11 conspiracy movement is a shell of what it once was .
The website masquerading as an academic journal , Journal of 9/11 Studies , has dropped from a high of six or seven articles published per issue to one , and its February 2008 edition ( it ’s supposed to be updated monthly ) was simply skipped over , evidently for lack of a single article .
The introduction to the main hub of 9/11 denier activity , 911truth.org , welcomes its visitors with a plea that announces , “ we ’ve cut to the bare bones , but are still far short of our basic budget needs . ”
Prominent “ truthers ” like Mark Dice , Dylan Avery , Jimmy Walter ( lambasted in Penn & Teller ’s Showtime series Bullshit ! episode on 9/11 ) , and Kevin Ryan have dropped into obscurity .
The well read author David Ray Griffin continues to lecture , but to shrunken audiences , and this year ’s big 9/11 rally looks to be set in Ottawa , not New York City — evidently due to lack of interest .
It is rare when those of us in the skeptical community get to celebrate a concrete success in building public consensus on an issue of pseudoscience .
In the combination of grassroots Internet support and mainstream media advocacy we have seen one such moment .
It was once feared that the 9/11 conspiracies would be the next JFK conspiracies — silly yet pernicious , running unchecked until it was too late .
The opposite has happened here .
Because the skeptical community gave the public some well - needed straight talk on the issue , pulled no punches , and let no challenge go soundly unanswered , we have won in six years what could have become a half - century long , uphill battle as with JFK conspiracy theories .
Here ’s to winning once in awhile .

Another two men floated on what looked like air mattresses linked together by rope .

Near Marietta northwest of Atlanta , a flooded bridge blocked the only road out of a residential area surrounded by a national park and the Chattahoochee River .
Two buses picked up elementary school children Monday morning , but flooding prevented them from picking up older students later , and the buses could n't return with the first batch in the afternoon , said iReporter Pritam Jaipuriar , who lives there .

Some elementary students used a walking trail -- the only other path out of the area -- to return home .
Some parents arranged for friends beyond the bridge to pick their children up from school and keep them for the day .
" My first - grader son is staying with a friend of mine , " said Jaipuriar , who was unable to go to work Monday .
Some ground - level apartments in the area were flooded , but his unit was fine , he said .
Unable to drive for supplies , some residents walked the path to a store a few miles away and returned with bags of groceries , said iReporter Jeff Cofer , who also lives there .

Near northwest Atlanta 's Vinings area , floodwaters encroached upon multimillion - dollar houses .
Rescue personnel rode in boats over flooded streets Monday night , going home to home to pick up residents and take them away .
Water levels were high enough at one home that the people there stood on a roof to await rescuers , a fire and rescue official said .
On Monday morning , a couple inches of water had entered the Villa Rica , Georgia , home of iReporter Walid Zeid , damaging suitcases and other things that were on the floor .
Water from a flooded lake lifted his boat to the roof of his boathouse , crushing the boat 's canopy , Zeid 's iReport video showed .
Zeid , a flight attendant , was supposed to be on an international flight Monday , but flooding prevented him and his family from leaving home , which is in Carroll County .

Two of the Georgia fatalities involved people trying to drive through floodwater .
A vehicle with one man in it was swept off a road in Douglas County , and a car carrying a woman was swept off a road in Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County , east of Atlanta , Brummer said .
Seydi Burciaga , 39 , was driving to her Lawrenceville home from work when flash flooding trapped her in her vehicle , Gwinnett County police said .
She called 911 and police tried to locate her , but Burciaga could not tell them exactly where she was .
Floodwater moved her car about 500 feet after she was swept off the roadway , and her attempts to guide rescuers to her by mentioning landmarks were unsuccessful , police said .
By the time rescuers found her minivan , she was dead , police said .
In Tennessee , the presumed drowning victim was forced into a culvert , or underground storm water drain , about 6 p.m. Sunday , Chattanooga Fire Department spokesman Bruce Garner told CNN .
Sylvester Kitchens Jr. , 46 , was with a friend , Albert Miller , when the two decided to swim in a large , flooded ditch , Garner said .
He said a Miller family member told him that " basically it was a bet . "
Both managed to grab onto a chain link fence while being buffeted by the strong current , Garner said .
A neighbor threw a garden hose for them to grab onto , and Kitchens reached for it but was unable to hold on .
Miller clung to the fence for about 20 minutes and was eventually rescued by firefighters , Garner said .
Kitchens ' body has not been found , said Garner , who added that it " does n't appear he could 've survived . "

Popular online video service Hulu will start charging subscription fees sometime next year , says News Corp. Deputy Chairman Chase Carey .
While speaking at a recent Broadcasting & Cable summit Carey announced his plans for Hulu : “ I think a free model is a very difficult way to capture the value of our content .
I think what we need to do is deliver that content to consumers in a way where they will appreciate the value .
Hulu concurs with that , it needs to evolve to have a meaningful subscription model as part of its business . ”
Hulu.com has attracted a large online audience by offering commercial - supported TV shows and movies from NBC , ABC , Fox , and other networks since 2007 .
However , the addition of a subscription fee may send most of Hulu 's users searching for alternatives .
I use Hulu frequently to watch everything from Comedy Central 's " Daily Show " to Fox 's " Family Guy . "
I stomach the commercial interruptions in exchange for the high - quality streaming content , but I certainly wo n't be pulling out my credit card if the service puts up a subscription pay wall .
And I doubt many other customers will be happy to start paying money for a service they previously received for free .
The move to a fee - based business model is a decision that will still have to be approved by the Hulu board , and I hope someone has the sense to blackball this idea .
But common sense does n't always prevail in the entertainment industry - if it did , we might still have " Arrested Development . "

You know where the phrase " jumping the shark " originates , right ?
It 's from the episode of Happy Days where Fonzie , wearing his leather jacket and some swim trunks , jumps over a confined shark with a pair of water skis .
As Wikipedia explains , the phrase originally referred to TV shows whose desperation for ratings leads them to indulge stunts that underscore their having " lost it . "
Well , Glenn Beck is hardly desperate for ratings -- yet -- but on his Fox News show yesterday , he jumped an entire school of Great Whites with Pinky Tuscadero on his shoulders .
He devoted an entire 14 - minute - plus rant to depicting the Obama White House as being like Al Capone and his gang of thugs in The Untouchables , bashing people 's heads in with baseball bats .
And to illustrate the point , he waved about a big wooden Louisville Slugger and affected a tough - guy gangster voice , all to depict the administration as a bunch of petty thugs who threaten their opponents .
Because it was so long , I 've divided it into two parts , just to preserve the whole thing for posterity .
I want to be able to tell my grandchildren that yes , your grandpappy was alive when the most popular man on TV could rant for a quarter - hour that the president was a violent thug , while himself wielding a big baseball bat and urging his audience to take action .
There is something profoundly creepy about all this .
I know that , on the surface , Beck appears to just be depicting what he sees as the underlying thuggery of the Obama administration .
But there is something suggestive of a call to retaliatory violence in this rant , especially when he calls his troops to action .
Oh yeah , just for good measure , Beck returns a little later with the same theme , with a photoshop of Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , as Capone .
Beck explains that the White House is in the process of destroying our freedoms .
Which ones ?
Welllll ...
Beck runs through a checklist :
Freedom of speech Freedom of the press Right to work Right to profit Right to make medical choices Right to assemble
In the delusional world that is Planet Beck , Obama is attacking all of these rights .
For instance , the " right to work " is under assault by labor unions .
Health - care reform attacks your right to make medical choices .
And calling out the tea parties for their wingnuttery is an attack on the right to assemble .
Hooookay .
These people are insane .
There 's just no way around it .
Want a glimpse into the mind of your average Glennbeckian ?
Check out Victoria Jackson 's love letter to Beck :
But I must especially thank you Glenn Beck for your blackboard .
I love your blackboard !
And your thorough research .
Your facts .
Your diagrams .
Your teaching .
Finally , someone is clearly explaining to us , the taxpayers , exactly what is happening inside that mysterious , gigantic , corrupt political system we have .
We , the working middle class , have always been afraid of the machine , and I think the politicians / criminals wanted it that way .
With their pompous , pious faces and sneaky hands , they have been stealing and lying .
We were too busy raising children , working and going to church to have time to research them .
Now , finally , one man has done it .
Cracked the Code. Exposed the Fraud .
Shone the Light on the Basement Rats !

The hooded Jedi look made popular by the late Alec Guinness in " Star Wars : A New Hope " may meld into the scenery of a comic book convention , but its decidedly less popular with Welsh grocery store management .
The Guardian reports that Daniel Jones aka Morda Hehol , the founder of International Church of Jediism , was asked by Tesco employees in Wales to remove his hood while shopping in the store - a move he considered contrary to his religious dress code .
" You have a choice of wearing headwear in your home or at work but you have to wear a cover for your head when you are in public . "
He said he'd gone to the store to buy something to eat during his lunch break when staff approached him and ordered him to the checkout where they explained he would have to remove the offending hood or leave the store .
" They said : ' Take it off ' , and I said : ' No , its part of my religion .
It 's part of my religious right . '
I gave them a Jedi church business card .
" They were n't listening to me and were rude .
They had three people around me .
It was intimidating . "
Tesco , who seems to prescribe to Han Solo 's stance on " Hokey religions and ancient weapons , " denied religious persecution and even cited Star Wars continuity to defend their hood removal request .
Tesco said : " He has n't been banned .
Jedis are very welcome to shop in our stores although we would ask them to remove their hoods .
Obi-Wan Kenobi , Yoda and Luke Skywalker all appeared hoodless without ever going over to the Dark Side and we are only aware of the Emperor as one who never removed his hood .
If Jedi walk around our stores with their hoods on , they 'll miss lots of special offers . "
Religious freedom is a fine thing , but practicing Jedi may face a long road to broad acceptance in a culture dominated by cosplay .
The efforts made by the Democratic US representative – Jared Polis from Colorado have led a big support for him by all the tech entrepreneurs in the United States .
This would make it easier for all the investors to reside in the US with the help of a visa .
It is also being considered as a mode to stop all the foreign born entrepreneurs from leaving the country .
In this way , the process which started off the United States could be kept safe in the same country .
This legislation would be introduced next year by Mr. Polis through which he hopes to hinder the custom of the enterprises springing up by in the US but closing down since its originators were not legally allowed to reside on its soil .
During these times of recession , this decision is a streak of lightening since it would help create more jobs in the midst of lay – offs .
There are many different visa categories for a foreign national to reside in the US .
However , no such category has been prescribed which would allow a foreign – born business man with investor backing to start a US based organization .
The main businesses being affected are the Internet – based set ups where a single individual could devise a concept and raise funds from foreign investors which would help create more jobs .
If the plan proposed by Mr. Polis is implemented , it would bring major amendments in the EB – 5 visas .
Under the EB – 5 visas , an investor has to invest a minimum of a million dollars in a US based enterprise .
With the current norms in place , more than 80 % of it is left unclaimed .
With the new framework in place , all the prospective investors have to be in the form of venture capital firms or individual investors with a minimal of $ 10 million that they have invested in other businesses .
A concept involves a founder ’s visa under which an entrepreneur can invest and reside in the United States and grow his business that would benefit the US economy .
This way , he would also be a source for other investors to set up their business on the US land .
Above all , if you are an investor intending to invest in the US economy , it is suggested that you wait for sometime to see if the new bill is passed .
If positive amendments are brought about , it would provide a good start for your enterprise .

Another accusation of racism in sports hit the newspapers today , on the front page of Canada 's " National Post . "
This time , it 's English - speakers who are accused of discrimination , in the form of racism against French - Canadian players .
The story is about Bob Sirois , a former NHL forward from Montreal , who did some analysis on NHL demographics and concluded that there is an " anti- francophone virus " in pro hockey .
The reporter also quotes Réjean Tremblay , a sportswriter for Montreal 's " La Presse , " who got a look at the findings , and argues that " discrimination against the frogs is absolute . "
( Here 's an article by Tremblay on the issue . )
What is the evidence for these accusations ?
We do n't know for sure , because the full argument is in Sirois ' upcoming book .
But the article gives a few statistics :
-- Forty - two percent of francophone Québeckers who played three or more years in the NHL won a trophy or were named to the All - Star team .
" Only francophones at the highest level were able to have lasting careers , " Sirois said .
--
Of all 16 - year - old players at the midget level in Quebec , 1 in 334 anglophones was eventually drafted , but only 1 in 618 francophones .
-- Francophone players in Quebec are less likely to get drafted than anglophone players in Quebec , and they go lower in the draft .
--
Of the 763 francophones drafted since 1970 , one - third of them went to four teams : the Quebec Nordiques , Montréal Canadiens , Buffalo Sabres , and Philadelphia Flyers .
( The teams drafting the fewest francophones were the Dallas Stars , Nashville Predators , and Phoenix Coyotes . )
-- Sometimes , undrafted players manage to eventually make it into the NHL .
That group represents 10 % of players overall , but 19 % of players from Québec , suggesting that more francophone players are going overlooked .
Since the Post reporter wrote that he had obtained a pre-publication copy of the book , we can probably assume these are the most damning facts behind the accusations .
But are they actually evidence of discrimination ?
In every case , there are other , more plausible , explanations for the results .
Let 's take them one by one .
1. 42 % of francophone Quebeckers who played three or more years in the NHL won a trophy or were named to the All - Star team .
The idea , presumably , is that to last in the NHL as a francophone , you have to be really , really good .
But where 's the evidence ?
Maybe the figure for anglophones is even higher than that ?
Forty - two percent sounds like a lot , but it 's meaningless without a comparison number .
But maybe the lack of a contrasting figure for English Canada is the reporter 's fault .
Let 's suppose the book has the anglophone number , and it 's less .
Does that prove anything ?
No , actually , it does n't .
This is an old argument , actually .
A couple of decades ago , baseball was accused of discriminating against blacks on similar evidence : there were lots of blacks in the league leaders , but fewer blacks as marginal players .
Bill James effectively rebutted the argument then , based on the characteristics of the distribution of players .
Converted to hockey , the argument goes like this .
Suppose that francophones happen to be better players , on average , than anglophones .
More specifically , suppose skills are normally distributed with a standard deviation of 15 " points " .
English players have an average skill of ( say ) 100 points , but French players have an average skill of 105 points .
You need to be over 130 to make the NHL , and over 135 to be considered a star .
So anglophone players need to be 3 SDs above the mean to hit 130 and make the league .
That 's about 135 players per 100,000 candidates .
Francophone players need only be 2.5 SDs above their own mean .
That 's 233 players per 100,000 candidates .
To hit the superstar 135 mark , the anglophones need to be 3.5 SDs above 100 ; that 's about 23 stars per 100,000 population , which means 23 stars per 135 players .
But the Francophones only need to be 3 SDs above 105 .
That 's 135 stars out of 100,000 , or 135 stars out of 620 players .
Which means :
17 % of anglophone players are stars ( 23/135 )
21 % of francophone players are stars ( 135/620 ) .
So there 's a larger proportion of francophone stars than anglophone stars .
The difference in our contrived example is only 21 % to 17 % .
But it would be relatively easy to come up with numbers to make the difference bigger , or smaller .
The point is that a small difference in means adds up to a big difference at the far tails of the normal distribution .
That 's not discrimination , it 's just the way the bell curve works .
Here 's a more intuitive way to look at it .
Suppose the anglophones and francophones were exactly equal in terms of players and stars .
Now , let 's make the francophones better by taking a couple of Mario Lemieux clones and throwing them into the francophone pot .
Does n't it now make sense that a larger proportion of francophones will be superstars ?
It 's not racism -- it 's just that the francophones are now BETTER .
One objection to this line of reasoning might be : if francophones are so much better than anglophones , should n't we see them disproportionately represented in the NHL ?
Yes , we probably should .
And who says we do n't ?
The Post article does NOT say that fewer francophones make the NHL , per capita , than anglophones .
It says only that francophone Quebeckers were less likely to be drafted than * Anglophone Quebeckers * .
I 'd be willing to bet , right now , that francophones are more likely to be drafted than non-Quebec anglophones .
That 's based partly on this logic , and partly on my feeling that if it were n't true , Mr. Sirois would be trumpeting that fact in the article .
[ --> UPDATE : that 's apparently not right .
" Hawerchuk " says that Québeckers comprise 18 % of Canadian NHL players ( by games played ) .
But they 're 23 % of the population . ]
( Oh , and why might it be that francophone players are better than anglophone players ?
It could be that anglophone Quebeckers live mostly in Montréal , where ice time is harder to get .
Francophone Quebeckers are more likely to be in small , northern towns , where there are more rinks per capita and more frozen ponds to play on after school .
That would give francophone boys more ice time and practice time , which would make them better players .
It would be roughly the same reason that the Canadian Olympic team is competitive with the US team , despite having only one - tenth the population . )
2 . Of all 16 - year - old players at the midget level in Québec , 1 in 334 anglophones was eventually drafted , but only 1 in 618 francophones .
That could easily happen without discrimination .
All it would take is for hockey to be a bigger part of francophone culture than anglophone culture .
Suppose that hockey popular enough among French - speaking families that the top 20 % of boys are still playing organized hockey when they 're 16 .
And suppose that hockey is less popular among English - speaking families , so that only the top 11 % of boys are still playing organized hockey when they 're 16 .
That would explain the numbers exactly .
The mediocre francophone players do n't get drafted .
The mediocre anglophone players do n't get drafted either , but they dropped out of organized hockey early enough that they do n't make Sirois 's survey .
Again , I 'd be willing to bet that this is what 's going on .
I live in Ottawa , which is on the border with Québec , and I can tell you that the francophone families I know are much , much more hockey - mad than the anglophone families , on both sides of the border .
Sirois says ,
" If you 're francophone and your son is talented in minor hockey , anglicize his name and you will double his chances of being drafted . "
If Sirois is basing that comment only on this particular statistic , his conclusion is premature , to say the least .
3. Francophone players in Québec are less likely to get drafted than anglophone players in Québec , and they go lower in the draft .
Same argument .
The less - skilled anglophones drop out of hockey more frequently , while the less - skilled francophones drop out of hockey less frequently .
So the remaining anglophones are better , on average , than the remaining francophones .
Again , I 'd bet that if you looked at raw population numbers , more Québec francophones get drafted than Québec anglophones , at every level of the draft .
They are less likely to be drafted , as Sirois says , if you look only at the pool of 18 - year - old players .
But I 'd bet they are MORE likely to be drafted if you look at the pool of all 18 - year - olds in Québec , whether they play hockey or not .
It 's selective sampling if the mediocre francophones are more likely to be in the sample than the mediocre anglophones .
4 . Of the 763 francophones drafted since 1970 , one - third of them went to four teams : the Québec Nordiques , Montréal Canadiens , Buffalo Sabres , and Philadelphia Flyers .
( The teams drafting the fewest francophones were the Dallas Stars , Nashville Predators , and Phoenix Coyotes . )
First , and easiest : are there fewer francophone players in the league now than in the past ?
Given the number of players these days being drafted from outside North America , that would seem likely .
That would explain why the Stars , Predators , and Coyotes -- teams that were n't in the league in the 70s and 80s -- would have drafted fewer francophones than the more established teams .
It 's the same reason you 'd also find that Québec , Montréal , Buffalo and Philadelphia have had more non-helmeted players than Dallas , Nashville , and Phoenix .
It 's not because Nashville discriminates against bare heads , but because the Predators were n't around when it was legal to go without a helmet .
Secondly : it might just be a difference in scouting .
Back in 1985 , Bill James did a study of the MLB draft , and found that , in baseball , players in the southern United States were much , much more likely to be drafted than players in the cold states , even if the players were of equal talent .
That was n't racism against Minnesotans , it was just where the scouts decided to go .
James wrote ,
" ... the explanation seems obvious .
...
The scouts spend a lot of time in the South because it gets warm down there while the North is still freezing , and they go where the baseball is .
They see more of the players , see the ones they like more often , and wind up falling in love with them . "
Does n't it make sense that the same thing might apply in hockey ?
There is n't a weather issue , but there * is* a language issue .
Does n't it make sense that the Phoenix Coyotes are less likely to have a french - speaking scout , and are therefore less likely to send someone up to Chicoutimi in February to check out some prospect ?
If francophone scouts are rarer than anglophone scouts ( which they obviously are ) , it makes sense that not every team would have one , and , as a result , francophone players would be disproportionately drafted by the teams that do .
That 's not discrimination , it 's just rational allocation of resources .
Dallas might just be saying , " you know , we do n't have a francophone scout , so we 'll let the Canadiens concentrate on prospects in Trois - Rivières , and we 'll send our guy to Regina . "
5. Sometimes , undrafted players manage to eventually make it into the NHL .
That group represents 10 % of players overall , but 19 % of players from Québec , suggesting that more francophone players are going overlooked .
This can easily follow from the hypothesis that there are more second - tier francophones in the draft pool than anglophones .
Again , suppose that 20 % of francophone boys are still playing at age 16 ( and therefore scouted for the draft ) , but only 11 % of anglophone boys are .
Scouts know that only 1 % of Québec boys , of either language , will make the NHL .
So they duly draft only 1 % of the anglophone population , and 1 % of the francophone population .
Scouts are n't omniscient , and they 'll miss a few good prospects .
There will be undrafted players who bloom later , and finally attract some interest from NHL teams .
Under our assumptions , 19 % of francophone boys will be initially passed over , but only 10 % of anglophone boys .
That leaves almost twice as many francophones who might get noticed ( and signed ) later .
Of course , those nine percentage points of extra francophones are less skilled than the top ten percent , but some players are late bloomers , and the bigger the pool , the more missed players you 're going to sign later .
I think that 's the obvious true explanation : more players means more late bloomers .
-----
So the points raised in the article are certainly not enough evidence to conclude discrimination -- there is a perfectly plausible , non-racist explanation of each of them .
If you want to show discrimination , you need better arguments than these , to remove the selective - sampling problem intrinsic to each of the arguments here .
What you can do is this : find all anglophones drafted in position X , and all francophones drafted in position X . See how they do in the NHL .
If there 's discrimination , you 'll find that francophone 14th picks do better than anglophone 14th picks .
And even if you find there 's discrimination , it does n't mean it 's racist , or even language - specific .
It might just be a scouting issue , where there are fewer scouts in Québec than elsewhere , just as there were fewer MLB scouts in Minnesota than in Georgia .
My gut says you wo n't find much discrimination .
I guess I would n't be surprised if you found a little bit , that team X might be less interested in a francophone eighth - round pick because of perceived language issues with the other players , when they can't really tell him much apart from a similar anglophone player who 's also available .
But discrimination is expensive , and every team wants to win .
If you want to convince me that teams are deliberately leaving money on the table because of racism , you 'll have to come up with some pretty good evidence .
These arguments , though , just do n't cut it .
There are many better , more plausible explanations for the apparent statistical anomalies in the article -- enough so , in fact , that , in my view , the accusations of racism are premature and irresponsible .

Research by anthropologists and sociologists has found that the introduction of an idea or innovation into a society creates two groups : utopians and idealists .
The idealist has a conservative world view and is content with the status quo .
The utopian on the other hand has a revolutionary world view and want to transform society with new ideas .
Recent research has shown that this concept holds true for the introduction of new products and services .
Mannheim ’s theory of culture change
This concept of utopians and idealists comes from Karl Mannheim , one of the founding fathers of sociology .
Mannheim saw that the utopians wanted to make the world a better place by innovation and new ideas , while the idealists where worried that the world would deteriorate , if untested new ideas where introduced .
His book ‘ An Ideology And Utopia : An Introduction To The Sociology Of Knowledge ‘ introduced the concept of sociology of knowledge .
He saw that if you shaped an idea to suit the needs of an idealist it would discourage the utopian , because the utopian wants change and their view of the idealists is that they are a barrier to change .
Mannheim studied the political movements in 1930 ’s Berlin , but more recent research has shown his concept holds true for products and innovations .
An example of two products fitting into the utopians and idealists camps is the battle between Mac and PC .
A general perception is that the PC user sees no need of paying more for a computer .
The PC is good enough , and if they changed to Mac they would have to learn a whole new way of doing things , and it would be a waste of time .
Equally , there is the perception that the Mac user belief is that the PC users spend far too much time dealing with technical issues , computer viruses , and many other things , and their life would be better if only they used a Mac .
Mac vs. PC
The battle between Mac and PC may not be as alarming as the battles between the Communists , and Nazis in 1930 ’s Berlin .
But Apple through its marketing makes it just as revolutionary to some .
Research by WPP’s , ( the advertising conglomerate ) , BrandZ shows Apples brand messages actually puts off the idealists [ PDF ] , but encourages the utopians .
Apples adverting ‘ call to action ’ are a Revolutionary message to buy an Apple .
The first Macintosh TV ad ‘ Why 1984 will not be like 1984 ’ emphasised this message .
This was continued with the ‘ Think Different ’ campaign , followed by the ‘ I am a PC vs. I am a Mac ’ .
Apple ’s message is not that their products are simple and easy to use , as can be seen from Fred Beecher ’s article in Johnny Holland , but if you invest the time in learning how to use their products then your life will be better .
Apple ’s users are utopian , so they will not only buy the products but also encourage others as well .
This is part of their utopian world view that the world would be a better place if everybody had a Mac .
Microsoft ’s challenge is that , because their users have become idealists it is hard for them to sell them new products .
Microsoft tries to introduce new innovations in usability , like the infamous ribbon for Microsoft Office , but because their users are happy with the status quo , they hate the change .
This is why even though Microsoft has some of cleverest brains in usability and design working for them , such as Bill Buxton ; they still have a reputation of bad usability .
When blind tests where done with Vista , users found that they liked the product and found it usable .
The issue is that the users of their products do n’t like change .
Apple ’s challenge according to the Mannheim theory is that these two world views eventually will synthesize to become one dominant world view .
The revolution will become the status quo , and their users expectations will change .
Applying Mannheim ’s theory to research and design
There is no right or wrong in being a utopian or idealist .
Yet , knowing which category our end users or customers fall into helps us understand their behavior and enables us to improves the odds for getting the design right and the right messages for communication .
The graphic above shows a modified version of the Ansoff Product - Market Growth Matrix .
If you are introducing a new product into a new market , it is more suitable to identify and research the needs of the utopians for your product category .
For example , for us at FeraLabs , we are developing Webnographer , a new tool for remote usability testing .
It offers a new way to carry out user research .
It was crucial for us to identify the utopians in the field of usability and information architecture , as they would be the people who would embrace change and try a new user research tool like Webnographer .
If on the other hand your product is aimed at existing market then you need to focus on using Idealists for your research .
How to find utopians or idealists
To find your utopians and idealists you will have to follow the advice of famous anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski :
“ … the Ethnographer has not only to spread his nets in the right place , and wait for what will fall into them .
He must be an active huntsman , and drive his quarry into them and follow it up to its most inaccessible lairs . ”
Research is the key to gage if a user is utopian or an idealist .
For our product we carried out ethnographic research , both digital and traditional .
We asked people their views of current methods , and we looked at their online communication and attitudes to help us understand them better .
If their view was that new methods are needed , or that the old methods need change they were classified as a utopian willing to change the world .
This qualified them for becoming of our research panel , and we considered them to be potential customers .
We very quickly were able to identify utopians : the people , firms and consultancies that were open to new methods .
There is a minority that believes that user research needs new tools and techniques , while the majority sees no need for change .
Our target audience are of course the users that believe that change is needed .
Both , the usability utopians and usability idealists , believe that life is made too difficult by products that are hard to use .
Where they differ is in the Solution .
Usability Idealists believe that if only people developing products used the techniques already developed then the world would be a more usable place .
On the other hand usability utopian ’s belief is that if these techniques where so good then we would not still in the 21st Century have so many hard and difficult products .
Our research shows that their view is that usability and user research techniques are too time consuming and expensive .
We found that the utopians believed that usability had to become more compatible with its end users , management and other people involved in the development of a product .
The results had to be understandable by people outside the profession .
While the idealists believed that the consumers of user research had to work harder to understand the views of usability .
Who is who ?
The usability idealists view is led by gurus such as Jakob Nielson , who argue that “ usability is a very stable field . ”
That the idealists view is led by guru ’s is obvious when you consider that they have spent years perfecting their reputation as the expert in the legacy techniques making them “ gurus ” , “ superstars ” , and “ ninjas ” .
A new method for conducting research can be a scary thought , as it means new learning , and being a novice again .
Malcolm Gladwell has shown in his book ‘ Outliers : The Story of Success ‘ that to become an expert in a field takes 10,000 hours .
When changes happen , which the utopian believes is important , you might be throwing those 10,000 hours of hard work away .
There is of course a small majority of experts with 10,000 hours that are utopians and strive for new things and are willing to throw that hard work away .
Finding the utopians is hard .
For example Apples market share is less than 10 % therefore if you where to conduct user research with just 10 people the likelihood is that only one user would be a Mac user .
Focusing the research
Having identified the utopians we focused our research on their desires and perceptions .
This has allowed us to make Webnographer better , as we could make the product that fitted the needs of the users most likely to use it .
For example the utopians wanted a simple way of reporting metrics to management , which makes it easier for the user to be heard .
We saved time and money by focusing our research on users that were open to a new method , and could ignore the feedback from people that even if we catered to their every whim would never change their ways .
It is worth pointing out that if your product is aimed at the current market then you should focus on the idealists .
Yet , the research is never finished .
It is not fixed whether someone is a utopian or idealist .
As Mannheim ’s theory explains the two world views of utopians and idealists eventually synthesize to become one dominant world view .
The revolution will become the status quo , and their users expectations will change .
This means research must always be ongoing , collecting information , analysing people ’s perceptions , validating findings , and collecting more information .
Not a new question
At the end of the month we will presenting our talk ( ‘ Effective Ethnography Techniques for Low Budget Projects ‘ ) at the EuroIA conference .
It is fitting that the conference is in Copenhagen , as Shakespeare ’s Prince Hamlet of Denmark had to make the choice between being an utopian with the life of action ( “ to be ” ) , or being a idealist with the life of silent acceptance ( “ not to be ” ) .
“ To be , or not to be : that is the question :
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune ,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles ,
And by opposing end them ? ”
So when we visit Denmark for the EuroIA , we will visit different districts of Copenhagen and instead of visiting the museums we will be looking at the supermarket shelves and look at the percentage of new products .
We will walk the streets and observe the number of people adopting new fashions .
Do the restaurants cater for new culinary dishes , or do they go for the traditional cuisine ?
There is no right or wrong in being a utopian or idealist .
But it can be both fun , and useful to understand the behaviour for both work and pleasure .

Researchers have modified nanoparticles known as " Cornell dots " to make the world 's tiniest laser -- so small it could be incorporated into microchips to serve as a light source for photonic circuits .
The device may also have applications for sensors , solar collectors and in biomedicine .
The original Cornell dots , created by Ulrich Wiesner , the Spencer T. Olin Professor of Engineering at Cornell , consist of a core of dye molecules enclosed in a silica shell to create an unusually luminous particle .
The new work by researchers at Norfolk ( Virginia ) State University ( NSU ) , Purdue University and Cornell uses what Wiesner calls " hybrid Cornell dots , " which have a gold core surrounded by a silica shell in which dye molecules are embedded .
The research is reported in the Aug. 16 online issue of the journal Nature and will appear in a coming print issue .
Using nanoparticles 44 nanometers ( nm -- one billionth of a meter or about three atoms in a row ) wide , the device is the smallest nanolaser reported to date , and the first operating in visible light wavelengths , the researchers said .
" This opens an interesting playground in terms of miniaturization , " said Wiesner .
" For the first time we have a building block a factor of 10 smaller than the wavelength of light . "
An optical laser this small is impossible because a laser develops its power by bouncing light back and forth in a tuned cavity whose length must be at least half the wavelength of the light to be emitted .
In the first tests of the new device , the light emitted had a wavelength of 531 nm , in the green portion of the visible spectrum .
In a conventional laser , molecules are excited by an outside source of energy , which may be light , electricity or a chemical reaction .
Some molecules spontaneously release their energy as photons of light , which bounce back and forth between two reflectors , in turn triggering more molecules to emit photons .
Provided / Purdue University
In the new device , dye molecules in the nanoparticle are excited by a pumping laser .
A few molecules spontaneously release their added energy to generate a plasmon -- a wave motion of free electrons at an optical frequency -- in the gold core .
In the tiny space , the dye molecules and the gold core are coupled by electric fields , explains Purdue co-author Vladimir Shalaev .
Oscillations of the plasmon in turn trigger more dye molecules to release their energy , which further pumps up the plasmon , creating a " spaser " ( surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) .
When the energy of the system reaches a threshold the electric field collapses , releasing its energy as a photon .
The size of the core -- 14 nm in diameter -- is chosen to set up a resonance that reinforces a wave corresponding to the desired 531 nm light output .
Tests at NSU indicate that the lasing effect occurs within each Cornell dot and is not a phenomenon of a collection of the nanoparticles working together , making this unquestionably the world 's smallest laser .
" Some people argue that the ability to produce a surface plasmon in this way will be even more useful , " added NSU professor and lead author Mikhail Noginov .
It has been suggested that plasmons could be used to send signals across a microchip at the speed of light -- much faster than electrons in wires -- but in less space than photonic circuits need .
The idea of a spaser was first proposed in 2003 by physicists Mark Stockman at Georgia State University and David Bergman at Tel Aviv University .
The theory behind the new approach was developed by Evgenii Narimanov at Purdue .
The work is funded by the National Science Foundation , with additional funding from the U.S. Army Research Office .

WASHINGTON
Like so many people , I own gold and silver as a hedge against the  Latin Americanization of the United States money printing , deficits and debt .
The talk about ending the worlds dollar dependency should be music to the ears of the millions of us who have sought refuge in precious metals .
But we are in a trap from which there is no immediate escape .
In the absence of a new gold standard , the alternatives to the dollar are even worse .
Let us remember how we got here .
After World War II , nations such as Britain and France , partly because they were weakened and partly because they were in awe of the mighty United States , proclaimed the era of the dollar .
With its large gold reserves , the U.S. was supposed to sustain what was left of the gold standard by shipping the metal to foreign central banks on demand at $ 35 an ounce ( the funny price gives you an idea of the fate suffered by the greenback ) .
In the 1970s , lacking the discipline to keep it running , President Richard Nixon abandoned the system .
No complaints the world was so confident in the dollar that oil was priced in that currency .
For a time , it all seemed convenient .
Because of the guaranteed international demand for its dollars , the U.S. was able to cushion the impact of its deficits and inflationary policies quantitative easing ,  as the British - originated euphemism goeson its currency .
But economic realities always catch up .
Now , the erosion of the last few years is fast accelerating because the government , under both Republicans and Democrats , has doubled the money supply , incurred a $ 1.4 trillion fiscal deficit and taken the debt to more than $ 12 trillion .
No wonder the dollar has lost more than 10.3 percent of its value in the last six months and foreign central banks , during the second quarter of this year , placed only 37 percent of new reserves in dollars .
The icing on the cake is that , despite the strong - dollar rhetoric , the U.S. government is obviously salivating at the prospect of its devalued currency boosting exports and liquefying its debt .
In the long term , of course , the dollars demise does not help the U.S. one bit .
All this is to say that those calling for an international replacement of the dollar from the governor of Chinas central bank to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvaare right .
But what is the alternative ?
The economies of Euroland are moribund and those governments are looking like subprime debtors .
The European economy is expected to grow at half the rate of the U.S. economy in 2010 .
Germany , heavily dependent on exports , will continue to suffer .
Italys public debt exceeds the size of its GDP .
Spain , whose imbalances are such that people wonder if it will remain in Euroland , can hardly be expected to sustain a new dominant currency such as the euro .
Is the Japanese yen a better proposition ?
It s doing better , but with debt running higher as a percentage of GDP than that of any other developed country and an economy that has been in the doldrums for much of two decades , Japans currency has dubious appeal .
As for the Chinese yuan , one would have thought that before his melancholic call for a new international currency , central bank Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan would have had the delicacy to ensure that Chinas own currency becomes fully convertible and its capital controls are eliminated as an individual foreign investor , I can buy stock in Hong Kong , but not in Shanghai or Shenzhen .
Only the Australian and Canadian currencies inspire confidence today but wait until their exporters start to complain .
Meanwhile , the talk about the International Monetary Funds special drawing rights becoming a world currency is humorous .
It is not even a currency , but a claim on dollars , euros , pounds or yen provided by countries that issue those currencies .
John Connally , Nixons secretary of the Treasury , put it best when he said to the world in 1971 ,  The dollar is our currency , but your problem . 
Except that it has evolved into Americas problem too .
In the meantime , we have no alternative , so keep buying gold and silver more silver than gold because central banks , those consummate manipulators , own 20 percent of the worlds gold and therefore have the power to stem its rise in the short term .

For a more recent update on Typhoon Parma , CLICK HERE
Nearly 300 people lost thier lives this past week in flooding relating to a tropical storm in the Philippines .
Now , the Philippines is preparing as best it can for the much stronger Typhoon Parma which will make landfall by late or early Saturday .
The Filipino government has declared a “ state of calamity ” for the nation and evacuation as taking place .
Typhoon Parma at 6 Z
Oct 2 2009 was located less than 250 miles east of Manila in the Philippines and was moving NW at 15 kts .
It ’s maximum sustained winds were 120 kts with gusts to 145 kts .
That would be nearly 140 mph winds with gusts to over 165 mph .
Seas offshore were running as high as 32 feet .
The discussion below is from the 00Z report and the remarks that follow correspond with the 6Z update from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center .
There is pretty fair agreement among the models for the storm to continue moving at its present speed to the northwest or west - northwest and make landfall in northeastern Luzon province in the Philippines .
The consensus continues to be a slowing of the forward motion as the storm makes landfall late Friday or rearly Saturday .
That would result in an increased threat for devastating flooding .
Compounding that threat will be the high terrain in the region which will serve to simply enhance the rain intensity .
While the storm is not the 165 mph storm that had been earlier forecast , it is still quite formidable and much stronger than the tropical storm that brought so much misery to the island nation less than a week ago .
For about 48 hours , Parma is expected to slowly move along the northern edge of the island .
Wrap around rains will no doubt be moving off the ocean on the western side of the island and bring heavy rain with gusty winds to Manila .
At that point , there is a diversion in the models .
About half want to take the storm on a northerly track toward Taiwan with the other half taking it more west toward Vietnam .
The official forecast has the more westward trajectory in mind .
Parma is expected to be weakening steadily after initial landfall but devastating rains will be the big problem following a 10 - 20 foot surge to the right of the landfall position .

( Newser ) – We ’ve all done silly stuff on a dare , but probably not on the level of actor / author / comic / crazy guy David Cross , who says he snorted cocaine not 40 feet from President Obama at the White House Correspondents '
Dinner ( not , for the record , held at the White House ) .
With cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices and his “ fancy Hollywood actress ” girlfriend Amber Tamblyn all in the house , the Arrested Development star … well , let ’s hear it from him :
“ It ’s crazy and there ’s security , Secret Service is standing there , ” Cross , 45 , said during a stand - up performance last night .
“ I ’ve got photos of all this . …
I ’m there and the president is right here and with all these people at the table , ” he did the deed .
“ Maybe 40 feet from the president of the United States ! ”

Rep .
Schmidt whispers " I agree with you " to birther
Rep. Jean Schmidt ( R - Ohio ) may be the worst stage whisperer in recent American political history .
At a Labor Day tea party event in Cincinnati , Schmidt was approached by a slightly unhinged constituent who wanted to know why she wans't demanding to see President Obama 's birth certificate .
ThinkProgress happened to have a tracker hovering nearby , who recorded the exchange , which captures the wink - wink game some GOP pols are playing with the birther fringe .
" You ca n't be a president ... " the woman shouts as a Schmidt supporter tries to get in between the camera guy and the participants .
Schmidt them tries to get her attention by saying " M'aam , m'aam . "
When the woman stops talking , Schmidt leans into her ear and whispers -- loudly enough to be picked up by the mike : " I agree with you , but the courts do n't . "
Schmidt is referring to a string of recent court decisions throwing out birther lawsuits .

( CNN ) --
A woman put on trial for wearing clothing deemed indecent by Sudanese authorities was jailed Monday for refusing to pay a court - ordered fine , her lawyer said .
Sudanese journalist Lubna Ahmed al - Hussein was facing 40 lashes for wearing trousers .
Lubna al - Hussein had faced 40 lashes for wearing pants deemed too tight and a blouse considered too sheer .
The threat of lashes was dropped when a court found her guilty but ordered instead that she pay a fine .
" She is now in jail , " her attorney Nabil Adib told CNN .
" She refused to pay the fine as a matter of principal . "
Al - Hussein will appeal her verdict in an effort to have the conservative Muslim government 's decency law declared unconstitutional , Adib said by phone from Khartoum .
Watch what outfit brought the charges »
" We intend to file an appeal within the next three days , but we do not know how long it will take the court of appeals to decide on the case , " Adib said .
" We expect it will happen in the next two to three weeks . "
He said al - Hussein could be in jail for a month unless her verdict is overturned .
Al - Hussein , who was arrested in July , pleaded not guilty during her one - day trial Monday , he said .
She was not allowed to call defense witnesses or present a defense case , he added .
She was sentenced to pay 500 Sudanese pounds ( $ 209 ) or face a month in prison , starting immediately , the lawyer said .
" She thinks that she did not have fair trial and a conviction was wrong so she did not want to pay the fine nor let anyone else pay on her behalf , " Nadib said .
Al - Hussein , a journalist who worked in the media department of the United Nations mission in Sudan , resigned from her U.N. position in order to waive her immunity as an international worker and face trial .
Police lobbed tear gas at people outside the courthouse Monday , and closed roads leading to the courthouse before the trial began , al - Hussein told CNN before the hearing .
Sudanese security forces roughly handled scores of al - Hussein supporters , injuring some and detaining 47 women , according to an eyewitness who spoke to CNN by phone .
A Sudanese official accused " the West " of interfering in the case .
Mohammed Khair , the information attaché at the Sudan Consulate in Dubai , said the international campaign surrounding the case " proves the West contributes only toward deepening ( the ) crisis . "
The human rights organization Amnesty International had previously called for the charges to be dropped .
" The manner in which this law has been used against women is unacceptable , and the penalty called for by the law -- up to 40 lashes -- abhorrent , " Tawanda Hondora , deputy director of Amnesty International 's Africa program , said in a statement .

Al - Hussein was arrested along with 18 other women on July 3 at a Khartoum restaurant when police burst in and checked women for their clothing .
" I do n't think she was targeted specifically , " Adib said .
" They attack public and private parties and groups .
They are called ' morality police ' and she was just a victim of a round - up . "

At the time of her arrest , she said , she was wearing pants , a blouse and a hijab , or a headscarf worn by Muslim women .
Scores of protesters gathered outside the courtroom in Khartoum to support al - Hussein in early August , when she was last scheduled to be tried .
The demonstrators carried banners and wore headbands with the messages , " No return to the dark ages " and " No to suppressing women . "
Others demanded an amendment to the country 's public order law that human rights activists say is vague on what constitutes indecent dress .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon has said he is concerned about al - Hussein 's case .
" The United Nations will make every effort to ensure that the rights of its staff members are protected , " Ban said in July .
" The flogging is against the international human rights standards .
I call on all parties to live up to their obligations under all relevant international instruments . "
In addition to the group of lawyers defending her , al - Hussein was also represented by two Egyptian defense attorneys , she said .

All About Sudan • Amnesty International
I have been a faculty member at a major State University for 40 years .
Several years after my arrival , I voted for George McGovern .
Eight years later , I voted for Ronald Reagan .
In those eight years , my family and I experienced several traumas that caused me to reevaluate -- and ultimately , drastically alter -- the political , cultural and economic axioms that had governed my life .
Within months of buying my first home in an excellent neighborhood , within walking distance to the University and , most importantly , located in a district with an outstanding local public elementary school , my five year old son was forcibly bussed to an inferior school , many miles away , in a horrible neighborhood in order to satisfy the utopian vision of a myopic federal judge .
This betrayal of my fundamental rights was undoubtedly the greatest shock to my political psyche .
Another was a Sabbatical year spent living and working in Jerusalem , during which time the UN issued time the infamous " Zionism is racism " resolution .
I was able to observe firsthand that the standard propaganda about Israel and Zionism that was promulgated in America and elsewhere -- almost exclusively by those on the Left that I had formerly supported -- was nothing more than bald - faced , hateful lies .
This and other events in the 1970s caused me to rethink everything that I had taken for granted since adolescence about how the world worked .
I emerged from the exercise as an enthusiastic conservative .
Thus I was no longer your average faculty member who adhered to the liberal party line , but instead one of a tiny cadre who completely disagreed with the leftist mentality that dominated the thought of campus faculty and administrators .
The overwhelmingly liberal atmosphere on campus is well known .
In the one place in society at which there should be diversity of thought , exploration of conflicting ideas and a propensity to challenge conventional wisdom , we have instead a mind - numbing conformity of opinion and a complete unwillingness to entertain any thought or idea that deviates from the accepted truth .
That conformity encompasses :
The legitimacy of virtually any program that promotes the interests of minority and female faculty , staff and students , even if the program is blatantly racist or sexist -- justified by a belief that America 's past unjust treatment of blacks , American Indians and Japanese - Americans , and its unfair treatment of women render such discrimination necessary and lawful .
A multicultural mentality , which preaches that America 's Eurocentric , white , Christian heritage is responsible for colonialism , imperialism , racism and sexism , and that its replacement by a culture that " celebrates diversity " will transform the US into a more just and humane society .
A distrust of free markets and democratic capitalism , and its severe limitation in favor of a centralized , government - controlled economy that will redistribute the wealth of America more fairly .
A denigration of religious belief and its replacement by the " worship " of secular humanism , with mindless environmentalism occupying a central place in the new religion .
Not being in sync with any of this , how did I cope ?
Not so well , actually .
First of all , it took me a long time to recognize and accept that the university atmosphere I knew as a student was gone .
Initially , I was too busy pursuing my career and building my academic resume to notice what a fish out of water I had become .
My epiphany came about 20 years ago at the inauguration of a new campus president .
In his acceptance speech , he said many things that seemed bizarre to me , but the comment I recall most vividly was his insistence that he would create a world - class university by building " excellence through diversity . "
His point seemed to be that by substantially increasing the number of minority and female faculty , staff and students ( and consequently decreasing the number of white males ) , this would of necessity make us a great university .
I always thought that the best way to build a great university was to attract the brightest , most innovative and productive faculty and students -- regardless of their hue -- but I realized at that moment , as the applause for his idea rained down , how out of step I was .
What did I do ?
To my eternal shame , I ducked .
Oh initially , during a painful , but relatively brief period , I contested the new campus consensus .
People quickly , but politely , informed me that my ideas were retrograde and that I would be well advised to get with the program .
In fact , I was passed over for an administrative position I coveted and for which I was far more qualified than the individual selected .
Realizing that my resistance was damaging my reputation on campus , I more or less clammed up and spent more than a decade trying to ignore the poisonous atmosphere .
This less than noble strategy proved effective and eventually I achieved a high administrative position in which I adhered to policies and shepherded programs that were diametrically opposed to my fundamental beliefs .
For years I tended to my bleeding tongue because I was constantly biting it during meetings to prevent myself from blurting out my true feelings about the bigoted ideas that constituted the consensus of the folks at the table .
But as I began to near retirement , I decided there was no point in maintaining my forced silence any longer .
As I had 15 years earlier , I unburdened myself and let fly my misgivings about the liberal campus hegemony .
What happened this time ?
Here come three novel observations :
Rio de Janeiro , the capital of samba and carnival celebrations , has now one more reason to celebrate , as it will be the first South American city to host the Olympic Games .
Famous for its wonderful beaches , such as Copacabana and Ipanema , for the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer , for the Sugar Loaf mountain ( Pão de Açúcar ) with its cable car , for the Maracanã stadium , one of the world ’s largest football stadiums and more , Rio de Janeiro will officially hosts the 2016 Olympic Games .
So why not take the opportunity to visit the new successful Olympic city , feel the emotion of living such an important and global event in Rio de Janeiro , explore its lively atmoshere and support your country ?
Most arguments against the public option are based either on deliberate misrepresentation of what that option would mean , or on remarkably thorough misunderstanding of the concept , which persists to a frustrating degree : I was really surprised to see Joe Klein worrying about the creation of a system in which doctors work directly for the government , British - style , when that has nothing whatsoever to do with the public option as proposed .
( Forty years of Medicare have n’t turned the US into that kind of system — why would having a public plan change that ? )
But what is one to make of the practical , political argument from the likes of Ezra Klein , who argue that any public plan actually included in legislation probably would n’t make that much difference , and that reform is worth having even without such a plan ?
There are three reasons to be suspicious of that argument .
The first is that I suspect that Ezra and others understate the extent to which even a public plan with limited bargaining power will help hold down overall costs .
Private insurers do pay providers more than Medicare does — but that ’s only part of the reason Medicare has lower costs .
There ’s also the huge overhead of the private insurers , much of which involves marketing and attempts to cherry - pick clients — and even with community rating , some of that will still go on .
A public plan would probably be able to attract clients with much less of that .
Second , a public plan would probably provide the only real competition in many markets .
Third — and this is where I am getting a very bad feeling about the idea of throwing in the towel on the public option — is the politics .
Remember , to make reform work we have to have an individual mandate .
And everything I see says that there will be a major backlash against the idea of forcing people to buy insurance from the existing companies .
That backlash was part of what got Obama the nomination !
Having the public option offers a defense against that backlash .
What worries me is not so much that the backlash would stop reform from passing , as that it would store up trouble for the not - too - distant future .
Imagine that reform passes , but that premiums shoot up ( or even keep rising at the rates of the past decade . )
Then you could all too easily have many people blaming Obama et al for forcing them into this increasingly unaffordable system .
A trigger might fix this — but the funny thing about such triggers is that they almost never get pulled .
Let me add a sort of larger point : aside from the essentially circular political arguments — centrist Democrats insisting that the public option must be dropped to get the votes of centrist Democrats — the argument against the public option boils down to the fact that it ’s bad because it is , horrors , a government program .
And sooner or later Democrats have to take a stand against Reaganism — against the presumption that if the government does it , it ’s bad .
A deepening drought in the Middle East is aggravating a dispute over water resources after the World Bank found that Israel is taking four times as much water as the Palestinians from a vital shared aquifer .
The region faces a fifth consecutive year of drought this summer , but the World Bank report found huge disparities in water use between Israelis and Palestinians , although both share the mountain aquifer that runs the length of the occupied West Bank .
Palestinians have access to only a fifth of the water supply , while Israel , which controls the area , takes the rest , the bank said .
Israelis use 240 cubic metres of water a person each year , against 75 cubic metres for West Bank Palestinians and 125 for Gazans , the bank said .
Increasingly , West Bank Palestinians must rely on water bought from the Israeli national water company , Mekorot .
In some areas of the West Bank , Palestinians are surviving on as little as 10 to 15 litres a person each day , which is at or below humanitarian disaster response levels recommended to avoid epidemics .
In Gaza , where Palestinians rely on an aquifer that has become increasingly saline and polluted , the situation is worse .
Only 5 % - 10 % of the available water is clean enough to drink .
The World Bank report , published last month , provoked sharp criticism from Israel , which disputed the figures and the scale of the problem on the Palestinian side .
But others have welcomed the study and its findings .
Gidon Bromberg , the Israeli head of Friends of the Earth Middle East , said there was a clear failure to meet basic water needs for both Israelis and Palestinians , and that Israelis were taking " the lion 's share " .
" The bottom line is there is a severe water crisis out there , predominantly on the Palestinian side , and it will be felt even worse this coming summer , " Bromberg said at a conference on the issue in Jerusalem .
He said the Joint Water Committee , established in 1995 with Israelis and Palestinians as an interim measure under the Oslo peace accords , had failed to produce results and needed reform .
The World Bank report said the hopes that the Oslo accords might bring water resources for a viable Palestinian state and improve the life of Palestinians had " only very partially been realised " .
It said failings in water resource and management and chronic underinvestment were to blame .
In Gaza , the continued Israeli economic blockade played a key role in preventing maintenance and construction of sewage and water projects .
In the West Bank , Israeli military controls over the Palestinians were a factor , with Palestinians still waiting for approval on 143 water projects .
" We consider that the efficiency of our aid in the current situation is compromised , " said Pier Mantovani , a Middle East water specialist for the World Bank , which is an important source of aid for the Palestinians .
Most went on short - term emergency projects with limited long - term strategic value .
It was a " piecemeal , ad hoc " approach , he said .
Yossi Dreisen , a former official and now adviser at the Israeli water authority , disputed the Bank 's findings and said many remarks in the report were " not correct " .
He produced figures suggesting Israeli water consumption per person had fallen since 1967 , when Israel captured and occupied the West Bank , while Palestinian consumption had risen .
Israel argues that the water problem should be solved by finding new sources , through desalination and water treatment .
" There is not enough water in this area , " said Dreisen .
" Something must be done .
The solution where one is giving water to the other is not acceptable to us . "
However , Fuad Bateh , an adviser to the Palestinian water authority , said Israel continued to have obligations under international law as the occupying power and should allow Palestinians water resources through an " equitable and reasonable allocation in accordance with international law " .
He accepted that there was a lack of institutional development and capacity on the Palestinian side , but he said the Palestinians were caught in an unequal , asymmetric dispute .
Palestinians had not been allowed to develop any new production wells in the West Bank since the 1967 war .
" Palestinians have no say in the Israeli development of these shared , trans - boundary , water resources , " he said .
" It is a situation in which Israel has a de facto veto over Palestinian water development . "

Franken feuds with T. Boone Pickens
Five years after he put his money behind the Swift Boat ads that helped tank John Kerry ’s presidential campaign , Senate Democrats gave T. Boone Pickens a warm welcome at their weekly policy lunch Thursday .
Or at least most of them did .

Kerry skipped the regularly scheduled lunch ; his staff said the Massachusetts Democrat “ was unable to attend because he had a long scheduled lunch with his interns and pages . ”
Sen .
Al Franken managed to make time for the lunch — but then let Pickens have it afterward .
According to a source , the wealthy oil and gas magnate and author of “ The First Billion Is the Hardest ” stepped up to introduce himself to Franken in a room just off the Senate Floor after the lunch ended
Franken , who was seated talking to someone else , did not stand when Pickens said hello .
Instead , Franken began to berate him about the billionaire ’s financing of the Swift Boat ads in 2004 .
According to a source , the confrontation grew heated .
Said Franken spokeswoman Jess McIntosh : “ It was a lively conversation . ”
Pickens was on the Hill to address the Senate Democratic Policy Committee lunch about his plans to use wind energy to lower the nation ’s dependence on oil and gas .
But the thought of Pickens being invited to a Democratic event angered some on the Hill and in the liberal blogs .
Pickens ’ camp appears unmoved by the drama .
“ If they have a problem , that ’s their problem , ” said Pickens spokesman Jay Rosser .
“ Boone has clearly moved on and is focused on a mission to solve the foreign oil dependency problem that he believes is a national security and economic crisis that America has to confront .
Boone ’s grateful for the impressive turnout of Democrats at the Democrat Policy Committee yesterday and for the interest they have shown in helping address this problem . ”

The Game Boy Advance gave us a little gem known as Mario & Luigi : Superstar Saga , which brought us the beautiful mixture of fun combat and great humor .
The DS was home to the inevitable sequel , Mario & Luigi : Partners in Time .
While sometimes sequels can seem to lose flair , the M&L series had not lost its stride , and actually improved in some areas .
After two hits , is the third installment , Bowser ’s Inside Story , going to just be a boring rehash of what we ’ve already played ?
… Nope , not by a long shot !
Bowser is back and badder than ever …and now we get to see his “ insides ” … I promise it ’s better than it sounds .
The plot in M&L: Bowser ’s Inside Story is what you ’d expect from a Mario game ; light - hearted , funny , and about as deep as a kiddie pool .
In this installment of the series , we see that the citizens of Mushroom Kingdom have fallen ill to a virus known as “ the Blorbs ” , which causes them to inflate .
The Mushroom Kingdom council ( including Mario , Luigi , Peach , etc. ) decide to meet and discuss this problem , meanwhile Bowser is up to no good .
While in a forest , Bowser runs into a shady salesman that offers him a special shroom that will help him finally defeat Mario , once and for all .
This salesman is n’t just some junkie , it ’s Fawful , a familiar antagonist in the Mario & Luigi series .
Fawful fed Bowser a Vacuum Shroom , which causes him to start sucking up everything in sight … including the entire Mushroom Kingdom council .
It is up to our favorite plumbers to team up with their arch - enemy and take down Fawful before he completely takes over the kingdom .
While not a deep story , the humor of the M&L series is present from the moment you pop the cartridge in , and that ’s all I care about .
This game is exactly what I thought it would be , a fun sequel , but with enough additions to keep it fresh .
While we have played as Bowser a few times in the past ( see Super Paper Mario ) , this is the first time I felt really attached to the character .
In SPM , using Bowser felt a bit shallow at times … most of the time I just would switch to him for the few seconds I need him , then switch right back to playing as Mario .
With this new DS title , Bowser is actually integrated rather well into the puzzles , and he really feels like the star of the show , instead of just playing second fiddle .
For instance , there is a puzzle in which Mario and Luigi are inside Bowser , and certain areas are blocked by objects keeping them from advancing ;
This is where Bowser comes in …on the top screen you run over to a fountain of water and drink to fill his stomach with water and cause the objects to rise .
While the puzzle elements of the game are very easy , it sure is a hell of a lot of fun to switch between the two playing fields .
Controlling the characters is done perfectly ; while the A and B buttons control Mario & Luigi , just hitting either X or Y makes the easy transition to controlling Bowser .
Also , portions inside Bowser have you doing some side - scrolling , but later on you will come back to the top - down perspective with the Bros. that you remember .
Not only do you use all three characters for puzzles , but for battles as well .
The combat is the same as you remember it ; turn - based RPG , with a mixture of timed action commands .
For newcomers , the best example of the gameplay is displayed in any of the Paper Mario games , but with more cooperative attacks .
Timing is a huge factor , and good timing can make an attack give double damage or have you make a counter - attack that can change the flow of the battle .
To change things up a bit , Bowser can become infused with adrenaline ( thanks to the Bros , of course ) , and fight with the stylus while your DS is held vertically .
These battles were pretty interesting ; a nice departure , but I enjoy fighting with buttons rather than swiping .
Overall , I really think people will find it hard to get bored with the games combat .
One major gripe I hear is , “ Since you play as Bowser a lot , do the Bros . get neglected when it comes to experience points ? ”
The answer lies within Bowser ’s belly … literally .
In combat , Bowser can actually inhale enemies and then the Bros. can help beat them down and gain some experience points .
I know going into the game , I was worried the trio would end up unbalanced , but having them fight together in this way really evens the playing field .
So is M&L : Bowser ’s Inside Story a worthy sequel ?
The answer is a definite , “ yes ” !
With each new game in the series out - doing itself and setting the bar higher , we as gamers , are now treated to yet another fantastic addition .
When I first heard about the game and saw screenshots , I honestly thought that it was probably not going to be that much different than the two previous Mario & Luigi games .
This was a time I was so glad to be proven wrong , because playing as Bowser has kept this game from just retreading what we had already played , keeping the game from feeling stale .
If you are only going to buy one DS game this Winter …make it Bowser ’s Inside Story ; truly see that it ’s what ’s “ inside ” that counts .

An Open Letter to President Obama by Marshall Brain
January 18 , 2009
Dear President Obama ,
I probably share this feeling with millions of Americans :
When I think about America today , I ache .
I ache when I read articles like this :
Frugal is cool in cash - strapped US
Tobar , an acclaimed author and essayist , was stunned to find America in the grip of an economic turmoil that was changing his native country before his eyes , plunging it into the worst crisis since the Great Depression .
" There is a sense of mourning and confusion and a real feeling of living in the last days of empire , " Tobar said .
And this :
Fighting Off Depression
The fact is that recent economic numbers have been terrifying , not just in the United States but around the world .
Manufacturing , in particular , is plunging everywhere .
Banks are n't lending ; businesses and consumers are n't spending .
Let 's not mince words :
This looks an awful lot like the beginning of a second Great Depression .
And lists like this make me cringe : A Timeline of the Bush Years
Here is where the ache comes from .
There once was a time when we could say , with full sincerity , that America was the greatest nation of earth .
I ache because it would be ridiculous to make that claim today .
Instead of the greatest nation on earth , today we look like a nation of idiots .
The examples are everywhere , but here are a few of the high points :
Obviously there is the financial meltdown .
Our once - great financial system has gone down in flames , taking the entire world with it .
Greed and corruption and stupidity came together once again , but this time the scale of the mistakes and the length of time they were allowed to fester were gigantic .
The American dollar , once the currency of the world , is being dethroned because it is becoming worthless .
Our car industry , once the greatest in the world , is now on life support .
Our space program , once so dominant that no one else could compete , is so bad off now that , next year , we will have no way to get people into orbit .
Our astronauts will have to hitch rides on Russian rockets for five years or more .
Our software industry once ruled the world .
And then Microsoft released Vista .
America lost an entire city to Hurricane Katrina .
A city .
And three years later , most of it still lies in shambles .
Our health care system is riddled with problems .
Health care in the U.S. costs twice as much per capita as it does in other developed nations , and tens of millions of people are locked out of the system by lack of insurance .
Etc .
We look like idiots .
But it is not just idiocy .
We also look evil .
We look like idiots in Iraq and Afghanistan , but we are evil idiots .
We came without any sort of coherent plan , and our incompetence was deadly .
More than a million people have died in Iraq since we invaded .
Millions more have fled the country .
Coming out of 9/11/2001 we had the moral high ground .
The entire world was on our side .
Then we completely squandered it through incompetence and arrogance .
Right now , it would be impossible for even the most patriotic of Americans to shout " We 're Number One ! "
Right now we are not # 1 , and we all know it .
Where do we go from here ?
Mr. Obama , we elected you to lead us out of this darkness .
We all know that too .
We hope that you will put American back on the path to greatness .
Please , please help America to reclaim the title of greatest nation on earth .
The reason I am writing is because I have been watching the news as they discuss the " new " stimulus package that is coming together .
This package is different from Bush 's $ 170 billion " stimulus package " of 2008 , which simply handed money to taxpayers .
And it is different from the $ 700 billion TARP bailout package .
The new $ 850 billion package ( which is likely to become $ 1 trillion ) is going to be one of the first acts of your administration , and looks like it will be the largest federal program in history .
The opportunity you have here , in spending this gigantic amount of money , is enormous .
But only if you deliver that money in a way that leads us to greatness .
Attach the money to a big vision that inspires us , and you will change the world .
Let that money dribble into the economy with no vision , and it will have far less impact .
So what is the vision ?
Here is my suggestion : Focus on America 's two great strengths .
The United States has prospered from a technologically advanced economy .
And America has prospered by doing good and helping others .
Focus your stimulus package on those two areas and we will be great once again .
To clarify what I am saying , think of these two examples :
Think about World War II .
We used our technological prowess to win the war , and we also made the planet a better place in the process .
We helped to rebuild the world .
It was an amazing example of grace .
Think about the Apollo moon missions .
Given a big , challenging goal we rose to the occasion and achieved the impossible .
Then when we got to the moon , we again acted with honor .
Our moon mission was not a land grab .
It was a giant leap for mankind .
America needs big , audacious goals .
We need to use our understanding of science and technology to reach those goals .
And we need to be focused on good rather than evil .
In this way we can become the greatest nation on earth once again .
The amazing thing about one trillion dollars is that we can have dozens of gigantic goals .
That amount of money can have a staggering effect on our planet .
Just look at the possibilities .
With $ 1 trillion we could do it all :
In 10 years we could develop and improve dozens of technologies that would , together , completely eliminate fossil fuels .
This would include renewable energy production , a grid upgrade and new automotive and transportation technologies .
Then we could share our innovation with the world .
The elimination of fossil fuels would go a long way toward stabilizing the climate change problem .
We could then develop the technologies to clean up the remaining mess .
For example , we could return the oceans to normal acidity levels and soak up the extra carbon in the atmosphere using both natural and man-made tools .
Our gift to the world would be the end of global warming .
We could eliminate world hunger .
Today , in one day , tens of thousands of children will die from simple things like starvation and lack of clean water .
It is a disgrace .
It is a moral outrage .
We all know it .
Let America solve this problem .
We could fully fund and fast track a mission to Mars ...
... and set up a moon base with a hundred or a thousand permanent residents .
Why the hell not ?
If you are going to spend a trillion dollars , spend it on something worthwhile .
Bring our nation , and the world , real hope and change like the people of this planet have never seen before .
Transform planet earth into something amazing .
Let 's take a crack at truly solving every major problem that humanity faces , and let 's put America at the top of every field of scientific and technical advancement .
Please eliminate the ache we all feel , and replace it with a vision of greatness .
If you do that - which you can easily do with a well - articulated plan for the future and the huge pile of money you are planning to spend anyway - America will once again be the greatest nation on earth .
Sincerely ,
Marshall Brain

A Conversation with Marshall Brain from MIRI on Vimeo .
Something old .
On March 30 , 2009 Tom Keene of Bloomberg 's " On the Economy " interviewed Robert Lucas and Edward Prescott .
There is one really interesting juxtaposition from Lucas 's part of the interview :
LUCAS : Our economy ’s got a remarkable ability to return to its long term growth trend .
And for most of the depressions we ’ve had or recessions , the return has been quick .
Two or three , four years ... [...]
LUCAS : [ T ] here is no question that fear is what this liquidity crisis is .
I mean the reason I got into money [ with my portfolio ] is that I got afraid to leave my pension fund in other securities .
So I ’m sitting there with a portfolio full of zero - yield stuff just because I ’m afraid to do anything else .
I think there are millions of people like me .
KEENE : What will be the signal for Robert Lucas to go back into the markets ...?
LUCAS : I do n’t know .
Robert Rubin made a joke about that in the first session today .
Nobody knows ...
Let 's parse this .
First , Robert Lucas says that it is highly likely -- certainly his median forecast -- that the U.S. economy will be back to normal in three or four years , with a normal level of unemployment , a normal share of profits in national income , and a normal level of dividends and capital gains .
This presumably means that stock prices will also be back to normal - - a normal multiple of a ten - year moving average of lagged earnings , for example .
That means a year - 2013 S&P of 2000 or so , compared to its current value of 1044 or its 2009 low of 667 .
Investing in the S&P 500 for a four - year horizon now is risky , certainly , but the expected return is high .
And holding your money in cash is not all that safe either : most of the scenarios I can envision in which the S&P 500 is at a real value in 2013 corresponding to today 's 667 are scenarios in which inflation has eaten away most of the value of cash .
So what is Robert Lucas doing holding his entire portfolio in cash ?
Has risk suddenly increased to an extraordinary extent to force the equity share of his portfolio down from 70 % to 0 % while his expected four - year return on equities over Treasuries has gone from 2.5 % or so to 20 % ?
Has his personal tolerance for risk suddenly collapsed to such an extent because he has become a complete coward ?
Or does he no longer believe his forecast that the U.S. economy is highly likely to be back to normal in four years ?
Or is he simply not a von Neumann - Morgenstern agent , and moreover lacks any desire to behave as if he were one ?
No von Neumann - Morgenstern agent faced with such returns would hold his entire TIAA - CREF portfolio in cash .
Not a one .
Now let me back up a little to Lucas 's attack on Robert Shiller and George Akerlof , and their book Animal Spirits :
LUCAS : I just do n’t get it .
I mean look at the Black_Scholes formula .
People come up with a formula for pricing options , just out of purely mathematical reasoning , and then it turns out it fits certain data amazingly well .
And it ’s been incredibly useful to people .
Now it ’s not useful for everything , but for what it does it ’s a huge advance in human knowledge .
Now what ’s the behavioral finance contribution ?
They reinforce the idea of skepticism .
Well , skepticism , it ’s easy to be a skeptic .
What ’s harder is to tell somebody how to do something they did n’t know how to do yesterday .
That ’s what Black and Scholes did ...
Lucas seems to miss the entire big point .
Black - Scholes tells you how to do things only if the trades of the non-von Neumann - Morgenstern agents in the economy -- that 's you , Bob - - cancel each other out .
If they do n't cancel each other out -- if there are , as you say , " millions of people like me , " then a whole bunch of banks running off of Black - Scholes and similar models without taking account of your existence are going to create a hell of a lot of systemic risk , and then 10 % unemployment .
Two weeks ago , we noted that CBS had been pinpointed by Audit Integrity as one of 10 big companies at risk of bankruptcy .
This prompted an outraged denial by CBS .
As the banking collapse illustrated , any time a company denies that it 's about to go bankrupt , it makes sense to assume that the company is indeed about to go bankrupt -- and then analyze the situation for yourself .
We 've now done that for CBS .
Here 's the bottom line :
CBS is not on the verge of bankruptcy .
The company is , however , highly leveraged , and its cash flows have been deteriorating rapidly .
So if current trends continue , the company will be forced to cut more costs or risk violating debt covenants .
If CBS 's cash flows keep deteriorating after that , it will very much be on the verge of bankruptcy .
CBS has also blown billions in recent years stupidly buying back its own stock at much higher prices -- shareholder value destruction at its finest .
So the company 's weak financial position is very much of its own making .
THE SITUATION
Here 's a snapshot of CBS 's current financial position :
Cash : $ 341 million
Debt : $ 7 billion
That 's called leverage !
Meanwhile , CBS 's cash flows have been precipitously declining :
2006 Free Cash Flow : $ 1.5 billion
2007 Free Cash Flow : $ 1.7 billion
2008 Free Cash Flow : $ 1.7 billion
2008 Free Cash Flow ( through June ) : $ 1.4 billion
2009 Free Cash Flow ( through June ) : $ 250 million
In other words , cash flow for the first six months ( operations less capex ) dropped from $ 1.4 billion to $ 250 million in a single year .
CBS had better hope those trends do n't continue .
Importantly , right now , the cash flows from CBS 's business are still positive .
This will make it much easier for CBS to continue to roll over its debt ( which it has been doing ) and avoid violating its debt covenants , which it may be coming close to doing .
CBS 's cash flows have fallen so much , however , that it is running out of cash flow from operations to make its dividend payments .
( So far this year , CBS has paid $ 228 million in dividends , which pretty much wipes out its cash flow . )
This is why CBS recently slashed its dividend to $ 0.05 per share .
If CBS 's cash flows deteriorate further , the company might have to discontinue its dividend completely .
Any time a company has as much debt as CBS does relative to its cash balance , it is critical that the company be able to continue to roll its debt over -- paying back upcoming bonds by issuing new bonds with later maturities .
Fortunately , at least as of this spring , CBS still seems to be able to do this :
On May 13 , 2009 , CBS Corp. issued $ 350.0 million of 8.875 % senior notes due 2019 and $ 400.0 million of 8.200 % senior notes due 2014 .
On June 2 , 2009 , CBS Corp. issued $ 250.0 million of 8.875 % senior notes due 2019 .
Interest on these senior notes will be paid semi-annually .
The senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBS Operations Inc. , a wholly owned subsidiary of CBS Corp .
During the six months ended June 30 , 2009 , the Company repurchased $ 978.3 million of its 7.70 % senior notes due 2010 resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 29.8 million .
As long as CBS can continue to issue new debt to repay its old debt , it will be fine .
What will cause it NOT to be able to issue new debt will be if its cash flows fall so low as to violate its debt covenants ( which could technically put it in default ) , or if the credit markets seize up again .
This could make it harder for the company to issue new debt .
Right now , as long as CBS 's cash flows do n't fall much farther , it has a $ 3 billion line of credit it can draw down to make interest and other payments .
If CBS thinks its cash flows are going to deteriorate further , the company will likely draw down hard on this line to make sure it has enough cash going forward .
As of June 30 , the company had some clearance left :
At June 30 , 2009 , the Company had a $ 3.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in December 2010 ( the " Credit Facility " ) .
The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio , as defined in the Credit Facility , of 3 x for the trailing four quarters .
At June 30 , 2009 , the Company 's Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 4 x .
The primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings .
At June 30 , 2009 , the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility , net of outstanding letters of credit , was $ 2.80 billion .
So , depending on what happened in Q3 , CBS may still be able to draw down on this line .
This should allow the company to meet all of its near - term cash needs , even if it suddenly can't roll over its commercial paper or debt .
IMPORTANT : If there is any risk that CBS 's trailing cash flow ratio will fall below 3X -- which there would appear to be , given the rate of decline over the past year -- CBS should draw down hard on the line to give itself some breathing room .
Hopefully , it has already done this .
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE ?
Assuming ad spending has bottomed , CBS will be fine .
If ad spending continues to shrink , however , the company will have to cut costs to keep its cash flows strong enough that it does n't violate its debt covenants .
CBS says it has the ability to manage programming and other costs , so reducing its cost base modestly should n't be a problem :
To the extent that the Company 's future operating cash flow is negatively impacted by the continued weakened economy , the Company has the ability to curtail certain non-committed programming , capital and other spending .
So if ad spending continues to shrink , CBS will likely cut the spending referred to above .
If spending continues to shrink after that , it will have to cut more .
Eventually , it will run out of things it can cut without destroying the value of the business , at which point bankruptcy will be a real risk .
THE BOTTOM LINE :
CBS does not appear to be at risk of near - term bankruptcy .
It is in a weak and deteriorating financial position , however .
And this condition is in large part due to its own stupidity .
Like other media companies , CBS has blown billions of dollars buying back its own stock in recent years -- at prices 2X - 3X today 's demolished level .
This is shareholder - value destruction at its finest .
And it has put the company in a far weaker position than it should be today .

10 Big Companies Veering Toward Bankruptcy
August 2009
Kate Courteau is the architect who designed Y Combinator 's office .
Recently we managed to recruit her to help us run YC when she 's not busy with architectural projects .
Though she 'd heard a lot about YC since the beginning , the last 9 months have been a total immersion .
I 've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal to me , so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about it .
This was her list :
1 . How many startups fail .
Kate knew in principle that startups were very risky , but she was surprised to see how constant the threat of failure was — not just for the minnows , but even for the famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners .
2. How much startups ' ideas change .
As usual , by Demo Day about half the startups were doing something significantly different than they started with .
We encourage that .
Starting a startup is like science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads .
In the rest of the world , people do n't start things till they 're sure what they want to do , and once started they tend continue on their initial path even if it 's mistaken .
3 . How little money it can take to start a startup .
In Kate 's world , everything is still physical and expensive .
You can barely renovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup .
4 . How scrappy founders are .
That was her actual word .
I agree with her , but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me how little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world .
It would n't be a compliment in most organizations to call someone scrappy .
What does it mean , exactly ?
It 's basically the diminutive form of belligerent .
Someone who 's scrappy manages to be both threatening and undignified at the same time .
Which seems to me exactly what one would want to be , in any kind of work .
If you 're not threatening , you 're probably not doing anything new , and dignity is merely a sort of plaque .
5 . How tech - saturated Silicon Valley is .
" It seems like everybody here is in the industry . "
That is n't literally true , but there is a qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places .
You tend to keep your voice down , because there 's a good chance the person at the next table would know some of the people you 're talking about .
I never felt that in Boston .
The good news is , there 's also a good chance the person at the next table could help you in some way .
6 . That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice .
Actually , I 've noticed this too .
I always worry the speakers will put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the startups , but it happens surprisingly rarely .
When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always saying , she mentioned : that the way to succeed was to launch something fast , listen to users , and then iterate ; that startups required resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster ; and that most VCs were sheep .
I 've been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate launching fast and iterating .
That was contrarian advice 10 years ago , but it 's clearly now the established practice .
7 . How casual successful startup founders are .
Most of the famous founders in Silicon Valley are people you 'd overlook on the street .
It 's not merely that they do n't dress up .
They do n't project any kind of aura of power either .
" They 're not trying to impress anyone . "
Interestingly , while Kate said that she could never pick out successful founders , she could recognize VCs , both by the way they dressed and the way they carried themselves .
8 . How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice .
( I swear I did n't prompt this one . )
Without advice " they 'd just be sort of lost . "
Fortunately , there are a lot of people to help them .
There 's a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC - funded startups .
But we did n't invent that idea : it 's just a slightly more concentrated form of existing Valley culture .
9 . What a solitary task startups are .
Architects are constantly interacting face to face with other people , whereas doing a technology startup , at least , tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted time to work .
" You could do it in a box . "
By inverting this list , we can get a portrait of the " normal " world .
It 's populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they work slowly but harmoniously on conservative , expensive projects whose destinations are decided in advance , and who carefully adjust their manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy .
That 's also a fairly accurate description of the past .
So startup culture may not merely be different in the way you 'd expect any subculture to be , but a leading indicator .

For funzies , and out of pure curiosity on my part into the everyday organisation of people 's lives and lesuire .
So , how do you organise your collection of CDs / vinyl ?
It varies for me .
For a while it was alphabetical according to artist name , then it was by year ( if two or more were released in the same year , I 'd order them according to the record label ) and I am now in the process of lining my CDs up in terms of the colour of the spines .
Ahem .
I 'm slightly obsessive about not having two of the same artist next to eachother though , so I may have to find another method , even though right now my collection is n't huge .
So , what about you ?
Alphabetical , genre , chronology , some other random method you 've come up with , or just complete chaos ?
EDIT : I 'm now attempting to do it by the most predominant colour on the cover .
I know , I need to be stopped ... Also , could someone move this to the Other Music forum ?
I accidentally posted it in here .

Judging from Barack Obama ’s speech , the final version of health care “ reform ” could be so compromised by concessions that it would amount to nothing more than a grand exercise in corporate welfare for the insurance industry writes Lance Selfa in Socialist Worker .
PRESIDENT OBAMA ’S
September 9 speech on health care reform seemed to regain some of the momentum he lost during the summer .
The question is whether that will turn out to be a good thing or a bad thing .
Certainly , many people who want a genuine reform of the irrational , wasteful and cruel system of health care delivery in this country were happy to see Obama draw the line against right - wing smears that have been flung his way .
But reform supporters should n’t get carried away .
While they were still clapping for Obama ’s calling out of the hysteria around “ death panels ” as “ a lie , pure and simple , ” Obama managed to slip in two concessions to the right – his hitherto unannounced health care plan would n’t cover undocumented workers ( the rebuttal that prompted cracker congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina to shout “ you lie ” at the president ) , nor would it allow federal funding for abortion .
Liberals like MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow were so enthralled with Obama ’s refutation of right - wing talking points – and so happy to give Wilson a well - deserved bashing - that they did n’t even ask two key questions :
Why should n’t anyone , regardless of immigration status , be eligible for health care ?
And why should n’t women expect to have an essential health care procedure , abortion , covered under a reformed health care system ?
Apparently , “ universal health care ” is n’t really universal after all .
If Obama ’s and the Democrats ’ health care plans are so willing to toss immigrants and women ’s health care overboard , what does this say about the rest of the health care reform ?
When you peel away all the rhetoric , you find a pro-corporate program that offers the carrots of “ insurance reform ” and subsidies for low - income people in return for the stick of forcing the uninsured to buy insurance .
In his speech , Obama used stories of insurance industry atrocities to make the case for measures like barring companies from denying people coverage because of “ preexisting conditions . ”
No doubt , these were among the most well - received parts of his speech , aimed as they were at health insurance companies , one of the most hated institutions in the country .
Yet Obama moved on to describe the requirement for people to carry insurance as comparable to state requirements for drivers to carry auto insurance–and he said this was necessary to prevent individuals from “ gaming the system . ”
However flippantly , he at least made clear what has been obscured in the health care debate so far – that “ universal health care ” is a euphemism for forcing people , under penalty of law , to buy health insurance .
In all the tumult over “ death panels , ” the “ public option ” and Medicare funding , hardly anyone has even commented on whether requiring people to buy health insurance is fair or feasible .
Even the “ do n’t tread on me ” tea - party types – always ready to object to the oppressive hand of government - have hardly raised an objection to this .
Why ?
In the main , the prospect of a new , 40 million - strong , government - created “ market ” for its defective product has kept the insurance industry – though it has nevertheless helped to fund some of the opposition to health reform – on board with the administration ’s overall approach .
The industry is willing to furnish propaganda against the “ socialism ” of allowing the uninsured to have the choice of buying insurance from a publicly funded vendor –the so - called “ public option .
But it has no problem with the government forcing people to buy its product , no matter how expensive or insufficient it is .
Despite the town hall theatrics of August , none of the major industry players that have been working with the Obama administration – the insurance lobby , big Pharma , hospitals , the American Medical Association – have jumped ship .
This , more than anything else , should assure that something called “ health care reform ” will pass the Congress .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
IN AUGUST , when the right wing captured the initiative with its demonstrations at congressional town hall meetings , it became common for liberals to mock elderly protesters who warned members of Congress to “ keep your hands off my Medicare . ”
Either these people were too stupid to know that Medicare is a government program , or they were too selfish to care about the uninsured , the argument went .
Bob Cesca , writing on Huffington Post , put it this way : “ I do n’t claim to know the full stories behind the variety of senior citizens who have been recruited to disrupt these town halls , but one thing is clear .
They ’re participating in a corporate lobbyist - driven campaign to prevent the rest of us from acquiring the same affordable , reliable public health care they enjoy . ”
But conservatives , however cynically , have tapped into genuine anxiety among the elderly about Medicare , and the left would be foolish to discount it .
After all , when Obama talks about financing his plan with $ 500 billion in “ savings ” from “ waste , fraud and abuse ” in the Medicare program , the elderly hear “ cuts ” – and they ’re right .
When Obama called for , in a little - noticed passage in his speech , the creation of an “ independent commission of doctors and medical experts ” charged with searching for waste in the program , he was endorsing a policy - wonk idea of an unelected commission to lower hospital reimbursement rates for hospitals and doctors – another way to enforce cuts to Medicare spending without making elected representatives implement the cuts .
And if Medicare recipients are skeptical of government promises , perhaps it ’s also because their experience with Medicare itself is n’t as great as proponents of health care reform often assume .
Although liberals hold up Medicare as an example of an efficient and generous health insurance system , it actually suffers from many of the deficiencies and irrationalities of the private insurance system on which it is modeled .
Medicare recipients pay premiums , co-pays and substantial parts ( between 20 percent and 50 percent ) of their medical bills .
Medicare Parts
A and B do n’t even cover many essential types of health care .
Medicare Part C fills the gaps in Parts A and B , but at a cost to seniors .
And Part D , the prescription drug benefit , requires seniors to buy insurance from private insurance companies .
As Medicare recipient and health care advocate Mary Lynn Cramer wrote recently on CounterPunch :
There is no way anyone could say that Medicare by itself is adequate coverage for all .
It is not even adequate for the seniors who rely on it .
I would like to see the Obamas and members of Congress try to cover their medical expenses with this so - called “ single - payer ” program .
They would never trade the comprehensive coverage they have for Medicare .
Medicare needs to be expanded to cover all basic medical needs ( set out above ) .
However , that is not in the President ’s plan for health care reform .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
FOR OBAMA and progressives on Capitol Hill , all of the problems that remain in preserving the private health insurance - based system are supposed to be solved with a “ public option ” that will , as Obama said , hold the insurance companies “ accountable . ”
The public option , a government - funded entity offering health insurance for the uninsured in competition with private insurers , is the main part of Obama ’s plans that liberals have pledged to fight for .
In July , members of the House Progressive Caucus even threatened to vote against health care reform if a strong public option was n’t part of the bill .
Ever the clever speaker , Obama managed to say enough in his speech about the “ public option ” to give progressives the feeling that he would fight for it , while not actually committing to it being in the bill .
And since the speech , a number of conservative Democrats , Republicans and Washington pundits have already proclaimed it a dead letter .
If these efforts succeed , a bill could pass that requires the uninsured to buy insurance from private health insurance companies that are responsible for much of the mess in the current health care system .
Without even the pretence of “ accountability ” that the public option is supposed to provide , health care reform would simply be a grand exercise in corporate welfare for the insurance industry .
More likely , a bill including something called a public option will pass , but it will apply to so few Americans ( Obama suggested “ fewer than 5 percent ” ) and be so hemmed in by industry - friendly regulations that it will , at best , resemble something like Medicare Parts A and B described above .
In case you think that the House Progressive Caucus wo n’t allow such a travesty to pass , think again .
Already , many leading progressives are qualifying their strong stands in favor of a “ robust public option ” so as to ready themselves to vote for whatever health reform package makes its way through the Byzantine protocols of the U.S. Senate .
So we may end up with health care reform by the end of this year .
The real question will be whether it helps ordinary Americans – or the medical - pharmaceutical - insurance - industrial complex .

Current Signals of Increases in Testosterone
The following is a post designed for some other newsgroups , that were dealing with the subject of a " neurochemical basis of violent behavior . "
Since my explanation of this is based on my theory of human evolution , I thought it should be posted here .
What you will be reading about is the " secular trend . "
I think the secular trend is the current signal of human evolution ; it is easily seen and is explanable as an increase in testosterone .
( Some say the secualr trend is due to increased nutrition .
If this were the case , blacks should exhibit less of the secular trend than whites ; the opposite happens to be the case . )
This is an introductory paragraph for the other newsgroup : Testosterone is the basis of violent behavior .
That is , testosterone is the basis of impulsive behavior .
The amount of testosterone determines the ability to control , or not , impulses .
More men are imprisoned than women .
Black men ( at the college level ) produce more testosterone than white men ; more black men are imprisoned than white men .
The following is a letter describing this , which has been sent to a number of U.S. congressmen and U.S. senators .
All , but one , failed to even acknowledge receipt .
( It is very un-politically correct . )
You judge for yourself .
This is from 1994 .
" I am a theoretical biologist ; my work contains an explanation of increased violence in our society .
I suggest violence results directly from an increase in numbers of individuals of higher testosterone , who arrive at puberty early .
increased testosterone and early puberty increase the probability of impulsive actions .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has compiled statistics which demonstrate that I am correct .
Males kill more than females ; blacks kill more than whites .
In the remainder of this letter , I include references from hightly reputable journals ( eg. Journal of the National Cancer Institute ) that demonstrate the blacks produce significantly more testosterone than whites and enter puberty at an earlier age .
What this boils down to is that individuals of both races , who exhibit these qualities , are more apt to resort to violence in a heated moment .
This is why there is so much black on black and white on white violence ; these are impulsive actions , not premeditated , thoughtful actions .
These are thoughtless actions that happen quickly , without forethought .
You , or your aides , are aware from interviews that many of these kids , who kill other kids , are really nice kids when they are not in a stressful , heated moment .
I am aware your background is not biological , nor are the backgrounds of those whose advice you seek when confronting the increase in violence in our society .
You must consider , therefore , that a major explanation of human behavior is being neglected by educators , sociologists , crimnologists , etc .
Their " model " of human behavior suggests that almost all human behavior is determined by the environment .
It is time a biological model is considered .
I will explain how this produces violence in the remainder of this document ; if you read this , you should note the same mechanism also explains increased sexuality and learning problems in our youth .
That is , all of these result from a single change in our society , which is very easily produced and increases exponentially .
This change increases with each generation .
Not everyone is affected , but more children are affected now than in the past .
Therefore , each past generation contains more who notice the change .
More grandparents see it than parents .
It occurs earlier in some places than others .
This is why some people always see these problems in some place at some earlier time .
I think the " 60s " was the time it occurred in such magnitudes that it openly impacted our entire society .
It is a continuing process , but usually takes more time to occur in conservative areas .
My works suggests this is a major biological change that affects both the body and brain .
Most grandparents and some parents have noticed the change in body size and function in children .
Children are getting bigger and reaching puberty earlier .
" The average age of menarche [ puberty ] in the female has dropped from approximately 17 years to approximately 13 years .
Thus , today maturation occurs about 25 % faster than it did 100 years ago . "
( " Sexual Dimorphism in Homo sapiens , " R.L. Hall , Praeger Publishers , New York , 1982 , page 279 ) .
" ... children in average economic circumstances have increased in height at age five to seven by about 1 to 2 centimeters per decade .
... Most of the trend toward greater size in children reflects a more rapid maturation ; only a minor part reflects a greater ultimate size . "
( Encyclopaedia Britannica 1984 ; 5 : 656 ) .
My work suggests a cause of this change .
The hormone , testosterone , is rising rapidly in our society .
Increased testosterone increases body size , aggression , and sexuality in both sexes .
( Testosterone is not " the " male hormone , men simply produce more . )
People who produce more testosterone are more aggressive and sexual , therefore , on average , they ultimately make more babies than those who produce less testosterone .
( People who produce less testosterone can better control their sexual activity ; over a period of time , they will produce fewer children . )
Ultimately , the percentage of high testosterone people , of both sexes , increases at the expense of low testosterone people .
This changes the averages of everything affected by testosterone .
This is why our kids are biggfer , more sexual , and more aggressive than in the past .
The mechanism is simple : higher testosterone boys and girls reach sexual maturity faster , increase their numbers faster , and their offspring are even earlier and more sexual .
People seeking sexual gratification are simply more likely to engage each other .
Sexual activity is so common today that no " stigma " is attached ; in fact , there appears to be a negative stigma attached to those who do not indulge .
Prior to puberty , the brain grows more rapidly than the body ; it is a competition which the brain wins in infancy and early childhood .
Because of this brain - body competition , puberty is delayed until the brain is almost finished in development .
Near puberty , however , testosterone increases the body 's competitive edge for growth and development which continues into adulthood .
" The weight of the brain [ in humans ] reaches 90 % of adult size by age six and virtually 100 % by age 12 , yet body growth continues to age 18 and beyone ( note that brain growth is nearly finished before reproductive maturity every begins ) . "
( " Patterns of Human Growth , " Cambridge University Press , 1988 , pages 60 - 61 ) .
The advanced frontal lobes of the brain develop last and control formal thinking , i.e. , higher math , proper language ( syntax ) , and the ability to form meaningfully predictive ideas ( hypotheses ) .
This is Piaget 's final stage of human thought development .
This stage of brain development is directly dependent on final development of the frontal lobes " from about age 11 to 14 , " ( Science 1987 ; 236 : 1110 ) .
I suggest early puberty interferes with this important final development of the frontal lobes .
For example , it was reported that standardized test scores of 13 - and 17 - year - olds of 1986 are lower than those of 1970 , whereas the scores of 9 - year - old children have remained relatively equal ( Science 1988 ; 241 : 1751 ) .
I suggest this decline is the effect of puberty , which , in this country , on average , is now occurring between age 9 and 13 .
Our children are , on average , losing the ability to handle math and English .
More importantly , our children are losing the ability to form meaningfully predictive ideas that help control their impulses .
" What are the consequences of my actions ? "
Without the function of the frontal lobes , symbolized by this question , kids cannot predict the consequences of , or control , their behaviors ( impulses ) .
Violent acts and sexual activity in children and teenagers are actions of impulse .
These impulses are initiated by the primitive part of our brains , which testosterone mainly affects .
Children are reaching puberty earlier with each generation , and early puberty arrests final development of the brain .
This means that , on average , our advanced brain is increasingly underdeveloped with each generation .
This is why so many children cannot control their sexual or aggressive impulses .
It is fact that , on average , the behaviors mentioned above , occur in higher incidence in the black population .
That is , on average , black children have more problems with math and English , score lower on standardized tests , exhibit more aggressive and sexual impulse activity , and experience family disintegration more than white children .
The reason , I suggest , is that , on average , blacks , as a group , produce more testosterone than whites , as a group .
( Take note of the journal source of the following quotation . )
" This report gives the results of assays of circulating steroid hormone levels in white and black college students in Los Angeles , CA .
Mean testosterone levels in blacks were 19 % higher than whites , and free testosterone levels were 21 % higher .
Both these differences were statistically significant .
Adjustment by analysis of covariance for time of sampling , age , weight , alcohol use , cigarette smoking , and use of prescription drugs somewhat reduced the differences .
After these adjustments were made , blacks had a 15 % higher testosterone level and a 13 % higher free testosterone level . "
( Journal of the National Cancer Institute 1986 ; 76 : 45 ) .
The study , above , was of college students .
If I am correct that testosterone adversely affects learning , then those blacks who are unable to meet requirements for college admission , or even complete high school , may produce more testosterone , on average .
The should exhibit even less impulse control ; this may be why there are so many black on black murders in ghettos .
This was not a common occurrence in black communities in the depression .
Testosterone is increasing over time .
I have suggested that increases in testosterone in our society are causing the overall problems , i.e. , increases intestosterone are causing problems for both blacks and whites .
Therefore , the rate of teenage births should be higher in blacks than whites but increased in both , compared to other advanced coutnries .
This is the case .
" The rate of teenage births is especially high in the black population .
An international comparison around 1980 revealed that the black U.S. teenage fertility rate was 2.3 times the white and 3.2 times the average of 30 advanced countries .
The contrast is even greater among the youngest teenagers ; blacks under 18 years of age had a rate in 1980 that was more than three times that of whites .
Nonetheless , even white teenage birthrates were 40 % higher than the average for other advanced countries . "
( Science 1986 ; 234 : 554 ) .
Not only do blacks , as a group , produce more testosterone , which I have suggested , increases the onset of puberty , they do , in fact , reach puberty earlier than whites as a group .
" Black youths are known to enter into puberty at a younder chronological age than white yourth . "
( American Journal of Diseases of Children 1991 ; 145 : 142 ) .
Again , it is my hypothesis that the violence , sexuality , and learning problems of our youth result from increased testosterone and early puberty in those affected .
High testosterone and early puberty adversely affects development of the part of the brain which controls impulsive behaviors , i.e. , the advanced forebrain .
This combination should generate these problems , and they should be exacerbated in areas wheere high sexuality rapidly brings high testosterone males and females together .
The result is an extremely rapid increase in high testosterone , early puberty , and their combined effects on impulse control .
As people of lower testosterone are literally driven away , the problem becomes more concentrated .
Impulsive acts also become concentrated ; this is why there is so much black on black and white on white violence . "

Previous studies in the field have indicated that East Asia is where the wolf was tamed and became the dog .
It was not possible to be more precise than that .
But now researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology ( KTH ) in Stockholm have managed to zero in on man ’s best friend .
“ For the first time ... it is possible to provide a detailed picture of the dog , with its birthplace , point in time , and how many wolves were tamed , ” says Peter Savolainen , a biology researcher at KTH .
Together with Swedish colleagues and a Chinese research team , he has made a number of new discoveries about the history of the dog .
These discoveries are presented in an article in the scientific journal Molecular Biology and Evolution , where it is claimed that the dog appeared 16,000 years ago , in Asia , south of the Yangtze River in China .
This is a considerably more specific date and birthplace than had previously been put forward .
“ Our earlier findings from 2002 have not been fully accepted , but with our new data there will be greater acceptance .
The picture provides much more detail , ” says Peter Savolainen .
The time for the emergence of the dog conforms well with when the population in this part of the world went from being hunters and gatherers to being farmers , which was 10,000 to 12,000 years ago .
According to Peter Savolainen , the research indicates that the dog has a single geographic origin but descends from a large number of animals .
At least several hundred tamed wolves , probably even more .
“ The fact that there were so many wolves indicates that this was an important , major part of the culture , ” says Peter Savolainen .
He adds that the research findings provide several exciting theories .
For example , the original dogs , unlike their later descendents in Europe , which were used as herders and guard dogs , probably ended their lives in the stomachs of humans .
Except in clumsy moments , we rarely knock over the box of cereal or glass of orange juice as we reach for our morning cup of coffee .
New research at The University of Western Ontario has helped unlock the mystery of how our brain allows us to avoid these undesired objects .
The study , led by Canada Research Chair in Visual Neuroscience Mel Goodale , lead author Chris Striemer and colleagues in Western 's Department of Psychology , has been published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We automatically choose a path for our hand that avoids hitting any obstacles that may be in the way , " says Goodale .
" Every day , we perform hundreds of actions of this sort without giving a moment 's thought as to how we accomplish these deceptively simple tasks . "
In the study , a patient who had become completely blind on his left side following a stroke to the main visual area of the brain was asked to avoid obstacles as he reached out to touch a target in his right – or ' good ' – visual field .
Not surprisingly , he was able to avoid them as any normal - sighted individual would .
Amazingly , however , when obstacles were placed on his blind side , he was still able to avoid them – even though he never reported having seen them .
" The patient 's behaviour shows he is sensitive to the location of obstacles he is completely unaware of , " Striemer says .
" The patient seemed to be as surprised as we were that he could respond to these ' unseen ' obstacles , " Goodale adds .
These findings provide compelling evidence for the idea that obstacle avoidance depends on ancient visual pathways in the brain that appear to bypass the main visual areas that allow us to perceive the world .
Thus , even when the part of the brain that gives us our visual experience is damaged , other parts of the brain still maintain a limited ability to use visual information from the eyes to control skilled movements of the limbs .
Additional experiments in Goodale 's lab at the world - renowned Centre for Brain & Mind have shown that these primitive visual pathways work only in real - time and do not have access to memories , even of the short - term variety .
As an example , they provided an obstacle in the patient 's blind field but delayed his reach by two seconds .
With this short delay , he no longer showed any sensitivity to the object 's location .
The study 's results have important implications for our understanding of what gets lost and what gets spared following damage to the brain 's main visual pathways , and point the way for new approaches to rehabilitation .

The Mask Slips , for Those with Eyes to See : Preparing for the Real Pandemic
by Kevin D. Annett , M.A. , M.Div .
Last week , many of the aboriginal people in the remote west coast village of Ahousaht were innoculated with the tamiflu vaccine .
Today , over a hundred of them are sick , and the sickness is spreading .
In the same week , body bags were sent to similarly remote native reserves in northern Manitoba that have also received the tamiflu vaccine .
On the face of things , it appears that flu vaccinations are causing a sickness that is being deliberately aimed at aboriginal people across Canada , and this sickness will be fatal : a fact acknowledged by the Canadian government by their “ routine ” sending of body bags to these Indian villages .
Before you express your shock and denial at the idea that people are being racially targeted and killed , remember that murdering Indians with vaccinations is not a new or abnormal thing in Canada .
Indeed , it ’s how we Europeans “ won the land ” , and it ’s one of the ways we keep it .
In 1862 , Anglican church missionaries Rev. John Sheepshanks and Robert Brown inoculated interior Salish Indians in B.C. with a live smallpox virus that wiped out entire native communities within a month , just prior to the settlement of this native land by gold prospectors associated with these missionaries and government officials .
In 1909 , Dr. Peter Bryce of the Indian Affairs department in Ottawa claimed that Catholic and Protestant churches were deliberately exposing native children to smallpox and tuberculosis in residential schools across Canada , and letting them die untreated .
Thousands of children died as a result .
( Globe and Mail , April 24 , 2007 )
In 1932 , B.C. provincial police attempted to lay charges against Catholic missionaries who had sent smallpox - laden Indian children back among their families along the Fraser river near Mission , BC .
The RCMP intervened and protected the church , even though whole villages were wiped out as a result of the church ’s actions .
In 1969 , native children who escaped from the Nanaimo Indian Hospital on Vancouver Island described being inoculated with shots that caused many of them to die “ with bloated up bodies and scabs all over ” , to quote one survivor .
Knowing this history , it ’s not surprising when Indians on isolated Canadian reserves start sickening and dying en masse from sudden illnesses , after receiving flu shots .
After all , it ’s still the law in Canada , under the apartheid Indian Act , that no on - reserve Indian can refuse medical treatments or experimentation .
So it ’s small wonder that these reserves are the places being targeted first to be injected with untested , unsafe and potentially lethal flu vaccines .
As an entire race of involuntary test subjects , Indians in Canada are a weather vane for what will befall all of us , and very soon .
For the very techniques and weapons of genocide perfected against aboriginal people are now being deployed against “ mainstream ” Canadians .
Under Bill C - 6 , which is about to pass third reading in Parliament and become the law , no Canadian will be allowed to refuse inoculations for the swine flu , despite the fact that it is relatively benign and mild , and has killed only people who are already immune - compromised .
Indeed , it is astounding that such coercion and dictatorial laws are being employed to deal with what the chief Canadian Health Officer has called a “ mild seasonal flu ” .
Clearly , another agenda is at work ; but the time to ascertain and challenge that agenda has all but run out .
This coming month , forced inoculations and imprisonment of those who refuse them may be a reality across Canada .
And for what reason ?
Clearly , not for public health , considering the sickness and death caused by previous swine flu vaccines .
I believe that the real pandemic is about to be unleashed through the very vaccines being pushed by governments and pharmaceutical giants like Novartis and Glaxo Smith Kline .
The shots will be the cause , not the cure , of the pandemic .
Of course , those in power can disprove this by simply being the first people to take the swine flu shot : an event about as likely as these companies forgoing the multi-billion dollar profits they will reap from the mass vaccinations .
It ’s indeed ironic that , very soon , many “ white ” Canadians may be suffering the same fate that aboriginal people have for centuries .
Perhaps it ’s fitting .
For if we are indeed being targeted for extermination , or at the least martial law and dictatorship , we finally can have the chance to shed our complicity in the genocide of other people , and get on the right side of humanity – simply by having to fight the system that is causing mass murder .

What demons we unleash in our sleep !
On Wednesday I posted up a photo guide to catching the red signal crayfish , an introduced species from the US which is trashing the aquatic ecosystem and killing our indigenous crayfish .
By catching as many as you can , you can help to control this invasive species , while getting a great meal for nothing .
Innocent enough you might think .
Well it was until it got picked up by the British National party .
I think you can probably guess how this story pans out , but here 's the BNP 's legal officer , Lee John Barnes , in his own words :
The North American Crayfish is the Mike Tyson of crayfish .
It is a diseased , psychotic , evil , illegal immigrant colonist who displaces the indigenous crayfish , colonises their territory and then reproduces until it totally devastates the indigenous environment and indigenous crayfish .
I am saying nothing governor .
But theres a phrase of his [ George Monbiot ] that I believe should be the motto of the Eco - Xenophobes everywhere .
I intend to use it more and when I do I will accredit it to George Monbiot ; DEATH TO THE USURPERS !
Subtle , is n't it ?
Without necessarily contravening the laws on incitement to racial hatred ( and we can expect the BNP 's legal officer to know just where the line is drawn ) , Mr Barnes appears to be comparing the American red signal crayfish to human immigrants , whom he apparently wishes to put to death .
" I 'm saying nothing governor " means : you know exactly what I 'm saying , but if you do your worst I can't be held responsible .
Barnes is not the first person to make an analogy between invasive species and immigrants , though these days it is seldom spelt out in such stark terms .
The analogy suggests that people from other parts of the world belong to a different , non -human species .
Perhaps he 's been watching District 9 , where the alien asylum seekers do look a bit like crayfish .
Unlike Mr Barnes , I do n't know exactly where the line is drawn , but is it possible that he has not been quite as clever as he thinks he is ?
Is there a legal - minded person out there who can offer some advice ?

Accolades do n't come much more gushing than those expressed this week following the death of Norman Borlaug , the agronomist whose lifelong work developing high - yield crops played a major role in heralding the so - called " green revolution " and who has often been credited as the " man who saved a billion lives " .
Throughout his life he was feted with awards and honours across the world : the Nobel Peace Prize , the US Presidential Medal of Freedom , India 's Padma Vibhushan , to name just a few .
But despite the passionate humanitarian zeal that drove much of his work , he certainly had his critics .
The criticism was not so much aimed at the man himself , but for the biotech legacy he played such a major role in creating .
After all , this was the man who arguably did more than any other to nurture the era of monocrops , GM foods and the intensive use of petrochemical pesticides and fertilisers .
He may well have saved a billion people from imminent starvation , but by doing so , say his critics , he also inadvertently helped to plant the seed for future environmental woes .
Has there ever been a person in human history whose legacy has pivoted so precariously on the fulcrum between good and bad ?
We will only know the complete answer in the decades to come once the full implications of the world being so reliant on what are now called " conventional " farming methods have been borne out in the context of overpopulation , peak oil , climate change , water depletion and all the other issues now so inextricably linked to modern farming .
Borlaug was not naive on these issues , though .
In his Nobel acceptance speech , he recognised that " we are dealing with two opposing forces , the scientific power of food production and the biologic power of human reproduction " :
There can be no permanent progress in the battle against hunger until the agencies that fight for increased food production and those that fight for population control unite in a common effort .
Fighting alone , they may win temporary skirmishes , but united they can win a decisive and lasting victory to provide food and other amenities of a progressive civilization for the benefit of all mankind .
Borlaug said this in 1970 when the global human population stood at 3.7 billion .
Today , it is fast approaching seven billion .
Modern farming has won the " battle " with population control convincingly .
Borlaug also dismissed the sometimes barbed attack of the environmentalists by arguing that his high - yield crops helped protect rainforests because they allowed farmers to continue exploiting existing farmland , therefore avoiding the need to stray into neighbouring forests with their chainsaws and firesticks .
As he grew older , though , he became an increasingly fervent supporter of GM technology , arguing that without it the booming human population would face widespread famine .
It was another subject for which he often came into combat with some environmentalists .
But he saved much of his disdain for the organic farming movement .
This is what he told Reason magazine in 2000 when asked what he thought of organic farming :
Do n't tell the world that we can feed the present population without chemical fertiliser .
That 's when this misinformation [ about the merits of organic farming ] becomes destructive .
Borlaug 's vision and subsequent success was underpinned by the widespread availability of cheap oil .
His solution for feeding the world was one that could only have ever been dreamed up in that post - war era when the energy source was obvious and unquestioned .
But times have changed : with Borlaug 's passing we are reminded how impatiently we await a successor to dream up the answer to our battle between rising population levels and sustainable food production .
There are some places in the world where there is no word for garbage .
The idea that an object could have no purpose , or be brought into being only to be discarded , is so alien that the concept simply does not exist .
America is not one of them .
On the contrary , we have become such a disposable society that we are one of the top garbage producers in the world , dumping an estimated 254 million tons a year , less than a third of which is recycled .
That 's enough rubbish to fill more than 82,000 football fields packed six feet deep .
Needless to say , all this waste is wreaking havoc on the environment and depleting our natural resources .
But rather than focusing our efforts on reducing consumption and more effective recycling , billions of dollars are spent each year collecting , crushing , burying , burning and exporting the evidence of our destructive ways .
The worst part is that so much of what we throw away would not fit with most people 's perception of rubbish .
I recently took part in an urban foraging tour in New York .
I had intended only to be a casual observer , but when I saw the range of goodies on offer – organic still fresh fruits and vegetables , fancy olive breads , cured meats , bagels , donuts and other delectables , still sealed in non-biodegradable packaging , it seemed an awful shame to let it go to waste .
Another dumpster dive led me to more durable goods like books , clothes , toys , furniture and electronic items in near perfect condition .
Nothing , it appears , is too good to be discarded here .
Unfortunately only a tiny percentage of the city 's refuse is reclaimed by foragers .
The rest ( which amounts to about 4,385,000 tons a year ) is gathered by collection trucks which instantly crush it into compact piles , eliminating the possibility of further salvaging .
It is then taken to a transfer station and from there either to an incinerator where it will be burned , releasing cancer causing dioxins into the air , or more likely to a landfill where it will decompose into a hazardous brew that leaches liquid waste into the soil and water and releases landfill gases into the air .
These gases consist mostly of lethal methane , which according to the Environmental Protection Agency is a major contributor to global climate change , being 21 - times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide .
Garbage 's contribution to climate change does not stop with the polluting effects of the waste itself , however .
As Heather Rogers points out in her book Gone Tomorrow : the Hidden Life of Garbage , the fact that the goods we throw out need to be continuously replaced leads to more pollution - causing processes and a further drain on our resources .
The other travesty of our current waste - disposal system is that almost 60 % of our landfill contents are compostable , and a further 30 % consists of non-recyclable packaging and disposables which should never have been produced in the first place .
But when you start looking into why this is the case , you come head to head with the biggest threat to the environment of all : the pursuit of profit .
Lobbying groups like the National Association of Manufacturers , headquartered in Washington , have fought tooth and nail for decades against any restrictions on the highly profitable production of disposable containers and packaging .
And at the other end of the equation , the equally powerful waste - management companies ( a multi- billion - dollar industry ) work on the simple premise that more trash equals more cash .
It is far more profitable and much less labour intensive to dump unsorted garbage in a landfill than it is to separate it for compost or recycling .
And so the pillage of nature continues unabated .
Instead of any meaningful effort to reduce , reuse and recycle , we export any waste we can't handle to poorer countries and find ever more ingenious ways to cover up the problem at home .
Many US landfills , including the infamous Fresh Kills in New York , have been capped and sealed and reclaimed as public spaces .
While this is definitely good for the neighbourhood , burying our sins and hiding them from view is not the answer to our problems and quite possibly has the effect of convincing consumers that it 's OK to throw away .
We should keep in mind that no more than a mortician 's magic can render a corpse anything other than dead , no amount of top soil or innovative landscaping can render the toxic cocktail beneath anything other than deadly .
Unlike the societies with no word for garbage , America has several – the most common being trash .
The dictionary definition of trash is anything " useless , disreputable , worthless , foolish , pointless or nonsensical " .
When you think about our current approach to the growing problem of garbage , that pretty much sums it up .
I can't tell what 's more outrageous and disgusting :
The fact that lobbyists have been permitted to serve on the federal advisory boards that oversee policies affecting their clients , the fact that that has been occurring with almost no Establishment outcry for years , or the fact that lobbyists have the sheer audacity to publicly scream at the Obama administration for trying to end this form of institutionalized corruption .
That latter point is , of course , the good news announced on the White House 's website on September 23rd :
We wanted to take this opportunity to announce the next step in the President 's efforts to reduce the influence of special interests in Washington .
The White House has informed executive agencies and departments that it is our aspiration that federally - registered lobbyists not be appointed to agency advisory boards and commissions .
These appointees to boards and commissions , which are made by agencies and not the President , advise the federal government on a variety of policy areas .
The administration had previously been criticized - rightly , IMHO - for issuing a series of waivers on its much - touted lobbyist / ethics reforms .
So this move is a welcome change in direction that suggests the White House is getting ( at least a tiny a bit ) more serious about rooting out some of the worst corruption in the government .
Then again , the reaction on K Street to even this minimal clean - government step shows just how institutionalized that corruption is .
Though , as OMB
Watch notes , there will still be many ways for corporate interests to get around this latest directive , those interests are nonetheless going crazy .
Over here and here you have corporate trade associations freaking out .
Over there you have the American League of Lobbyists screaming bloody murder .
And at U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk 's press conference last week , he was barraged with questions about how he could dare try to remove lobbyists from the major federal advisory boards that have shaped our destructive " free " trade policies .
Kirk answered the question judiciously , saying that while " There is a role for representatives and lobbyists in the development of the policymaking process , the president felt that that role in Washington had been enlarged to perhaps an unhealthy degree . "
That 's an understatement , if there ever was one .
On trade policy alone , CongressDaily estimates that of the 700 representatives serving on government advisory panels , about one third are registered lobbyists .
To be sure , some might say that hey , it 's not a big deal for lobbyists to serve on advisory panels , because those panels are only " advisory . "
But that label is deliberately deceptive .
These panels issue very influential reports and edicts with the stamp , seal and credibility of the federal government .
These are documents that begin the long process of policy formation and that , for example , congresspeople hold up in floor debates as proof that they are doing the right thing .
And so the reason why corporate lobbyists are going crazy about being barred from these advisory panels is because they know that those panels - despite their " advisory " billing - are extremely powerful in corrupting policy at its very origin .
Remove the lobbyists from these positions , and you begin removing the spores that ultimately germinate into stuff like NAFTA , the Medicare prescription drug giveaway , corporate tax loopholes , etc .
To that end , I expect this story is n't over by a long shot .
The anger about this modest proposal is so intense on K Street , you may see the administration back off .
I sure hope not - and I give the White House a lot of credit for moving forward knowing full well this would be the reaction .
But that gets back to the original point of this post : just how deeply rooted corruption really is in Washington .
It has become such a part of Beltway culture that lobbyists now feel fully entitled to be able to corrupt public policy with the seal of the government - they expect it so much , in fact , that they spaz out whenever anyone tries to stop it .

Five years ago , after Mininnguaq Kleist became Greenland 's national badminton champion but before he took the helm at the Office of Self - Governance , he discovered secession theory : the study of whether one country has , or does n't have , the moral right to break free from another .
" I found arguments that are never used up here , " he says .
Over the following year he wrote his thesis , " Greenlandic Auto - nomy or Secession : Philosophical Considerations " , at his university in Denmark , the colonial power that has ruled Greenland for nearly 300 years .
The 35 - year - old , whom friends call Minik , wrote it in Danish , and he pushed arguments that challenge the colonisers using their own rules , even as they ran slightly counter to those laid out in the 1990s by the father of modern secession theory , philosopher Allen Buchanan .
" According to him , you have to be wronged to justify it , " says Minik .
" Denmark has to wrong Greenland in a really bad way before we break away .
I do n't agree with that part .
Sometimes you have to view this as a marriage : adults , consenting people , divorcing of their own free will . "
To its Inuit natives , Greenland now officially goes by the name Kalaallit Nunaat – " Land of the People " .
As a colony , it has been part of Denmark since 1721 , when Lutheran missionary Hans Egede showed up and started saving souls .
The first Danes taught the Inuit that Hell was very hot rather than very cold .
They taught that communal living – shared food , shared hunting trips , shared wives – was sinful .
They taught that rocks and birds were not endowed with spirits .
Greenlanders had no bread or concept of bread , so Egede translated another pillar of Western belief – the Lord 's Prayer – to fit Greenlandic reality .
" Give us this day our daily harbour seal , " they prayed .

I first meet up with Minik in the Kangerlussuaq airport , a building on the tundra of western Greenland that feels like a ski lodge in the Alps : lounge chairs , huge windows , a cafeteria with trays , rich tourists in Gore - Tex .
Minik is heading up the west - central coast to Upernavik , a 1,000 - person town with no sewage system , where , several mornings a week , the streets are lined with yellow bags of excrement waiting to be picked up by sanitation teams .
Upernavik is the first stop on the second leg of a road show led by the Office of Self - Governance , a department local authorities set up at the end of 2007 to bring independence – or at least the idea of it – to the people .
It is now early September 2008 , and by 25 November , he wants to have reached nearly all of Greenland : 57,000 people spread out across 57 villages and 18 towns and an area of 836,000 square miles , 16 times the size of England and 50 times the size of mainland Denmark ; 25 November is the date of an island - wide vote , a referendum on divorce from Denmark .
If it was to pass , then on 21 June 2009 , the summer solstice , Greenland would wake up to a new reality .
Not secession , exactly , but a big step in that direction .
Global warming is melting Greenland 's ice , extending its shipping season and revealing massive oil and mineral deposits .
This is making possible a mining boom and the royalties that go with it , which in turn is convincing Greenland 's people that eventually they may not need the £ 370 m in annual subsidies they get from Denmark — more than £ 6,000 a person .
Which itself is convincing Greenlanders that soon they may not need Denmark at all .
Climate change means oil finds and zinc mines and also better fishing : cod , herring , halibut and haddock migrating north as the ocean warms .
It means disaster tourists : people coming to see glaciers slide into the sea .
( Since 2004 , cruise - ship arrivals have jumped 250 per cent . )
It means farming : potatoes and broccoli and carrots growing where they did n't grow before , more grass for more sheep .
And it means gushing rivers : an endless supply of freshwater that Greenland proposes to sell to a thirsty world .
It also means doom for distant countries such as Tuvalu , in the Pacific Ocean , and Bangladesh , which may go under because of Greenland 's melting ice cap .
The cap covers 81 per cent of the island , and if it melts entirely — something that is unlikely to happen before the end of this century — global sea levels could jump 20 feet .
Since 2003 , the cap has shrunk by more than a million tons – so much that the underlying bedrock rises 4 cm each year , like a ship slowly unweighted of its cargo .
The land is rising faster than the sea .
It is climate 's role in the independence movement – the possibility that people could be set free by embracing a crisis , that for all the countries destroyed by global warming , one will be created – that has brought me to Kangerlussuaq .
Before we board our next flight , Minik introduces me to a pack of half - a- dozen Greenlandic politicians who are part of his revolutionary road trip .
They wear backpacks and street clothes : jeans , fleeces , tennis shoes .
One man carries a video camera .
I wonder , for a moment , whether I 'm staring at people for whom global warming serves a higher good .
The first meeting takes place inside the community sports hall in Upernavik , and its high point is a funny story about a whale .
It is told by Jens B Frederiksen , the leader of the Democrats , the only one of Greenland 's four major ' political parties arguing for a " no " vote in November .
Frederiksen was a policeman here in the 1990s , and the story goes like this :
The police chief gets a call from a citizen .
The citizen is a fisherman .
He has caught a whale .
He does n't know what he should do with this whale .
The chief says to the citizen , " Put it in the boat .
We 'll take care of it tomorrow . "
Put it in the boat !
Take care of it tomorrow !
The crowd , roughly 60 people , roars with laughter .
Frederiksen 's party has the support of many ethnic Danes , who make up 10 to 15 per cent of the Greenlandic population , but it is still one of the island 's smallest .
Earlier this afternoon , the politician and I walked around Upernavik — past an unmarked liquor store , past wooden houses painted in beautiful primary colours — while he explained his party 's unpopular stance .
" We want self - governance , too , but we do n't have the economy right now to go forward , " he said .
He ticked off the basic services that Greenland hopes to take over : policing , education , immigration , mining , courts .
Thirty - two areas in all .
This will require money — if not Denmark 's , somebody else's .
" Yes , we want oil , " Frederiksen continued .
" We will jump and be happy when we find oil .
I also really hope to win the lottery but I can't count on it . "
His argument is n't about nationhood .
It 's all about the numbers – pure economics – and that may be why hardly anyone is listening .
Even nationalists agree , however , that as colonisers go , Denmark is n't bad .
In Canada , the Inuit were given numbered , dog - tag - like IDs because they had no surnames , and they were moved to barren islands to reinforce sovereignty claims .
But in the Danish colony , the crown declared as early as 1782 that the Greenlanders ' welfare should " receive the highest possible consideration , [ overriding ] when necessary the interests of trade itself " .
Denmark established paternalistic rules about alcohol and intermarriage , and even its most controversial programme – an effort in the 1960s to move families from traditional villages to centres such as Upernavik , where services could be concentrated – was meant to improve lives .
In the Upernavik sports hall , we are at nearly 73 degrees north .
The small town is seasonally frozen out of all ship traffic , sits on tree - less tundra 600 miles from the capital , and yet has this : a hospital staffed by Swedes and Danes , a price - subsidised Pisiffik supermarket , a strong mobile - phone signal , and paved streets .
This is what the Danes did .
They harvested whales and fish and some coal , but they gave back homes and schools and hospitals .
In 1953 , they gave full Danish citizenship to every Greenlander .
They gave students such as Minik a free education at the university of their choice in Europe or North America .
And they did it all with the smug certainty that Greenland could never manage on its own .
Up for a vote on 25 November is " self - governance " – namminersorneq in Greenlandic , selvstyre in Danish .
Though not full independence , it is far closer than the limited home - rule system in place since 1979 , which gave Greenland authority over a handful of government ministries .
As agreed to in principle by Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Greenlandic premier Hans Enoksen , Greenlanders will have a recognised right to self - determination .
They will take over responsibility for almost everything but foreign affairs and defence .
At first they 'll keep the £ 370 m annual grant from Denmark , but as petroleum and other mineral revenues go up and up , the grant will go down and down , until it hits zero .
Greenland can secede any time along the way .
It could take decades .
While Frederiksen talks , Minik grimaces .
He is standing alone in the back of the hall , near a table with coffee and tea and crumble cake .
" Remember this , " Frederiksen says to his audience : " The Democrats did not say ' no ' to self - governance .
We just said ' no ' to this agreement . "
When Kuupik Kleist , the popular leader of the leftist , pro- independence Inuit Brotherhood , speaks in favour of self - governance , Minik allows himself a smile .
" We would like to take care of ourselves , " the politician says in his booming voice , and everyone claps .
" If we want to reach something , we should be ready to sacrifice something . "
This idea – that Greenland may suffer after it takes over but that a little suffering is worth it – is n't one that every leader will voice out loud .
Now only Minik is clapping .
It did not take long for me to hear what those sacrifices might be , on a helicopter trip with GEUS , the Danish geological survey .
The GEUS scientists were retrieving a broken instrument on the ice cap two hours ' flight north of Upernavik , and along for a free ride were me and a Dane called Nikolaj , a lab technician at the Upernavik hospital .
He and the pilot also co-own a kayaking business that rents out boats , drybags , satellite phones , and polar - bear protection in the form of rifles .
The doctors are all foreigners , he says .
" They come for one month at a time .
It 's like a vacation for them . "
I ask what he thinks about the referendum .
" People here are spoiled , " he says .
" They do n't give a shit .
They have no idea how much things really cost .
Housing .
Boats .
Fishing .
Everything .
They do n't understand that , without support , it could never be . "
Premier Hans Enoksen catches up with us on the way to Uummannaq , a 1,300 - person island town that is famous here as the home of Siissisoq , a metal band that sings in Greenlandic about the slaughter of African mammals .
The next afternoon , I watch the premier take part in a four - on - one verbal battering of Jens B Frederiksen inside a firehouse - red high school .
Enoksen is stern and primal , slowly pumping his fist in the air as he speaks .
The leader of Siumut , the party in charge of the home - rule government since it began in 1979 , Enoksen is a former town grocer who was elected in 2002 after serving as Minister for Fisheries , Hunting , and Settlements .
He is the first premier who was n't educated in Denmark , who does n't speak Danish or English .
In Nuuk , a rival minister is challenging him for leadership of Siumut , and some of his appointees are facing a corruption scandal .
But in the villages , he is loved .
Every summer , he pilots his fishing boat alone up the coast , checking in on community after community .
He wants self - governance to be his legacy .
Enoksen hires a blue powerboat the next day , and we head off to visit villagers .
After a while he turns to me .
" The American ambassador in Copenhagen has been very supportive of self - governance , " he says , Minik translating .
" Much more than any before him . "
I tell him I am not surprised .
In 1946 , the American government was so impressed with Greenland 's strategic potential that it secretly tried to buy the island from Denmark for $ 100 m .
The US military still runs Thule Air Base , a Cold War-era installation in Greenland 's far north .
Now that we have learnt Greenland has a lot of oil , US companies are buying up exploration blocks near Disko Bay , about 100 miles southwest of us .
For Greenland , does n't independence from Denmark simply mean dependence on foreign corporations ?
Enoksen has heard it before .
" If oil is discovered , foreigners will come no matter what , " he says .
" But after we vote ' yes ' , they will be working for us . "
He pounds his fist against his chest three times , then raises it to the sky .
" This is what will change under me , " he says .
To visit one of the sites that will fund Greenland 's future , the Black Angel zinc mine , I again motor out of the Uummannaq harbour , into the same broad channel , but this time the boat captain is Danish , and he is working for the British .
We leave the channel and cross a choppy stretch of open water , then hug another set of cliffs .
We enter a long fjord , where we wave at fishermen and slow down to watch a village woman butcher a seal on a rock .
Two hours after leaving Uummannaq , the namesake Angel rises before us : a Rorschach blot of ghostly black zinc , 2,000 ft up , on the side of a mostly white cliff .
I have wanted to see Black Angel since I heard about it at the first annual Greenland Sustainable Mineral and Petroleum Development Conference , which was held in May 2008 at a Radisson Hotel in Copenhagen .
The mine 's owners , the British firm Angus & Ross , had n't tried to hide the fact that they were profiting off global warming , which caught my attention .
Otherwise , the conference had been discussing Greenland 's tough logistics and " world - class commercial terms " .
If you could get there , the speakers said , Greenlanders would let you drill anywhere .
There was a presenter from Alcoa , which plans to dam two west Greenland rivers and build one of the world 's largest aluminum smelters — 340,000 tons a year .
There was a GEUS presentation about Greenland 's petroleum prospects : on the west coast , eight oil leases were just sold off to companies including Chevron , Exxon , Canada 's Husky Energy , and Denmark 's DONG Energy .
On the east coast awaited the 19th - richest of the world 's 500 known petroleum provinces : an untapped Gulf of Mexico in the North Atlantic .
Angus & Ross chief executive Nick Hall showed photographs of Black Angel and explained its history .
The zinc deposit , one of the richest on the planet , was discovered in the 1930s , explored in the 1960s , and mined between 1973 and 1990 via tunnels dug near the Angel high above the fjord , reached by cable car .
Then it was abandoned .
His company took over the lease in 2003 , when zinc prices were about to rise , and in 2006 two geologists on a day hike discovered a deposit as pure as the original at the edge of the retreating South Lakes Glacier .
Until now it had been hidden by a wall of ice .
Along with the extended shipping season , it was , Hall admitted , the " upside of global warming " .
When I arrive at Black Angel , the mining camp is nearly empty .
It is the end of the summer work season , the beginning of a global recession , and credit is drying up while zinc prices are falling .
Australian Tim Daffern , my host , quit a successful consulting job to run operations at the mine – and now he is hanging on by a thread .
Black Angel will bounce back in January 2009 , and in April Angus & Ross will even expand its holdings to include the Nalunaq gold mine , in Greenland 's far south .
But at the moment I am witnessing the danger , for Daffern and for Greenland , of betting everything on the commodities market .
The camp is a series of prefab buildings on a man-made plateau , surrounded by the crumbling concrete and rusting machines of the original operation .
Next to the harbour sits the cabin of a cable car that will span the mile - wide fjord to reach the mine .
The buildings contain bunk rooms and a lounge with couches , a widescreen TV and a Wi -Fi connection .
Inside the lounge , Daffern tells me his company 's game plan .
They will start with the two tons of zinc left in the original mine : the support pillars , mainly , which they will replace with cement columns .
" That 's enough for five years of mining , " he says .
Next they will focus on the deposit at South Lakes Glacier , which is certain to keep retreating – they commissioned a study by GEUS and some British scientists to be extra sure .
South Lakes will buy them another decade .
A third deposit could buy two more years ; a fourth , three more – glaciers shrinking all the while .
" Anywhere the ice retreats , " Daffern says , " we 'll explore . "
Daffern 's predecessors dumped their tailings in the fjord .
The waste was 0.2 per cent lead , 1 per cent zinc .
Every spring , a rush of melting water spread the waste farther .
It was ingested by blue mussels , and fish ate the mussels , and seals ate the fish , and on it went up the food chain .
After 17 years of mining , it took another 17 years for the fjord to recover .
The home - rule government has toughened regulations and Daffern promises to do things differently .
He also promises , just as everyone did at the mining conference , to hire as many locals as possible .
On day seven of the tour , after seven meetings in seven villages and towns , the politicians relax in a government guesthouse outside the Qaarsut airport , waiting to go home .
Then the premier walks in and announces that a hunter 's boat is ready to take us on a quick visit to the village of Niaqornat , population 68 , more than an hour up the Nuussuaq peninsula .
Going out again is masochism .
Only Minik and I agree to join him .
The open boat is maybe 15 ft long .
Minik and I keep low out of the biting wind , but the premier , wearing jeans , thin gloves and a baseball cap , stands in the back of the boat , watching the coastline zip by .
The village is stunning , on a spit of low - lying land between an oceanside turret of rock and the white peaks of the peninsula .
There are bright wooden houses but no cars .
There are racks where villagers are drying junk fish for the sled dogs and strips of halibut and seal for themselves .
Open boats and icebergs share the harbour .
The sun is shining .
It is , for once , the Greenland of my imagination – and perhaps that of the premier 's as well .
The meeting is held in the schoolhouse , and a quarter of Niaqornat shows up , if you count the baby .
As the premier talks , I check out a poster showing eight local whale species and their specs : weight , top speed , length , amount of time they can hold their breath .
A man in a T - shirt that reads " Deep Sea Shark Fishing " asks about money , and Minik flips through some slides I have n't seen before : projections of mineral revenues skyrocketing into the future .
One shows the oil blocks that Greenland has already sold to foreign firms .
They 're on just the other side of the peninsula .
A few months from now , Niaqornat will become one of a handful of villages to vote 100 per cent in favour of self - governance .
The referendum will pass by 75.5 per cent across Greenland , but in tiny Niaqornat , there will be no doubters .
Just in time for the solstice , at the start of this new era , the premier will lose his job to Kuupik Kleist .
This will only accelerate the drive toward independence : Kleist 's party wants it all the more , and even his partner in the new governing coalition , Jens B Frederiksen , will be stirred to patriotism .
" We have one goal , " he tells reporters .
" The ultimate independence of our country . "
We 're in Ilulissat , Greenland 's big tourist town , where we have a final layover .
Nearby is the fastest - sliding glacier in the northern hemisphere , Sermeq Kujalleq , which spits 35 trillion litres of ice into Disko Bay every year .
I spend the early evening on the boardwalk of the Hotel Arctic , a cliffside landmark that happens to be hosting the Nordic Council 's Common Concern for the Arctic conference , European dignitaries in nice suits fretting abstractly about the warming north .
Peering into a bay full of icebergs at sunset , I hear one of them chat up an attractive blonde by rattling off facts about the coming doomsday .
His tone is solemn , his voice almost a whisper .
" I do n't mean to scare you , " he murmurs .
It 's the first time I 've heard someone try to use climate change to get someone else into bed .
" I really do n't mean to scare you , " he says again .
She does n't look scared at all .
Upstairs , Minik and I order hamburgers and stare at the lights of Ilulissat .
" It 's so strange , " Minik says .
" The more the ice cap melts , the more Greenland will rise .
These other countries are sinking , and Greenland is rising .
It is literally rising . "
Below us , the dignitaries file into their banquet .
" We know Black Angel was really bad for the environment the first time , " Minik continues .
" It ruined the fjord .
Is it OK to ruin three or four fjords in order to build the country ?
I hate to even think this , but we have a lot of fjords . "
He shakes his head .
" We 're very aware that we 'll cause more climate change by drilling for oil , " he says .
" But should we not when it can buy us our independence ? " I look at him .
I can see he does n't really know the answer either .

Ben Ali of Ben's Chili Bowl Dies
Ben Ali , the founder of Ben's Chili Bowl , a landmark D.C. eatery that has fed presidents , celebrities and the common folks of the city , died last night of congestive heart failure at his home in Washington .
He was 82 .
( Our full obituary is here ; be sure to read it all the way to the end because you 'll be amazed . )
A fixture of U Street since 1958 , the cramped restaurant has outlasted the changing fortunes of its neighborhood and supplied hungry Washingtonians with heaping bowls of chili , hot dogs and its trademark chili - topped half - smokes .
Photos of visiting celebrities -- including Denzel Washington , Danny Glover and Bill Cosby -- lined the walls , and in January the restaurant received its best publicity boost ever when president - elect Obama dropped by for a half - smoke ( a smoked sausage ) .
Near a sign that warned , " Who eats free at Ben's : Bill Cosby .
No one else , " Obama paid for his $ 12 tab with a $ 20 bill , leaving the change as a tip .
Mr. Ali , a Trinidadian immigrant who had studied at Howard University , opened the eatery with his wife , Virginia , and ran the popular but eccentric carryout restaurant with two of his three sons .
The place was known as a gathering spot for Washingtonians of all classes and races , who were united by their love of chili and the restaurant 's excellent jukebox and quirky customs .
It was open as long as 22 hours a day and survived several urban renewal efforts on a street once known as Washington 's " Black Broadway " but later hit by severe blight before a recent renaissance .
Through the decades , the sights , sounds and smells of Ben 's Chili Bowl endured as a place of comfort and warmth amid a world of change .
It was featured in documentaries and in the 2008 Russell Crowe political thriller , " State of Play . "
Please share your memories of the man , not just the restaurant , in our comments section below or in our discussion area .
We also have a huge photo gallery online of Mr. Ali and his restaurant .
Here 's a piece that we ran on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the restaurant and the 45th anniversary .
It was one of the few businesses to remain open on U Street during the 1968 riots .

Water Polluters Near You : Coal - Fired Power Plants
As coal - burning power plants have reduced their air emissions , many have created another problem : water pollution .
While some regulators have used laws like the Clean Water Act to combat pollution , many plants have repeatedly violated that law without incurring fines .
The New York Times has compiled data from the Environmental Protection Agency on coal - fired plants with permits to discharge pollutants , including factories that generate their own power .
Full Story »
First , the link : http://wiki.github.com/documentcloud/cloud-crowd
I recently started working for a nonprofit where we 're encouraged to open - source our codebase .
We 're going to be getting into some heavy document processing , and need a reasonably scalable and efficient way to go about it .
In practice , this means scripting together different command - line programs ( graphics - magick , pdftk , tesseract ) across a large number of servers , and gluing it all together with Ruby .
CloudCrowd is our first take on a pleasant parallel processing experience -- as an " action " , you write a Ruby class that responds to ' process ' , for the portion of the computation that can be parallelized , and optionally ' split ' and ' merge ' .
The central server and job queue , the worker daemons , the web interface for monitoring , and the automatic retry of failed work units is all handled for you .
In the Wiki ( linked above ) , there 's a pretty comprehensive explanation of the architecture -- I 'd love to hear suggestions , or ideas that can be pilfered from Hadoop or even Grand Central Dispatch to improve it .
[ HTML1 ]
Now , it ’s not like I have n’t fallen victim to silly Twitter rumors before .
I have .
Innumerable times .
Guilty and guilty .
But this one has to top all of the others .
[ HTML3 ] Seems that sometime today a little Twitter rumor started that comedian Dave Chappelle was going to stage a secret show in Pioneer Square .
Well , and you know .
One thing led to another .
And Portland does love the Twitter .
And pretty soon there were thousands of people in Pioneer Square .
But the question remained : would Dave Chappelle make an appearance ?
No one was really sure .
Although KGW meteorologist Matt Zaffino continued to stoke the Twitter rumor .
And Squid Vicious from KNRK got a great panning shot of the crowd .
[ HTML2 ]
But in the end , there was no Dave Chappelle .
Or in the immortal words of Chong , “ Dave ’s not here .
Now , to be sure , Twitter is n’t the only one to blame .
There were a few other publications good naturedly fueling the rumor , albeit with a good dose of skepticism and snark .
Luckily , we may be saved from wider criticism for our naivete thanks to one small saving grace — our inability to spell “ Chappelle ” correctly seems to have prevented it from trending on Twitter .
UPDATE
Go ahead and cross out all of that subpar writing up above there .
I ’ve got a retraction to print in the middle of my post .
Just as I was about to hit publish on my oh - so - witty diatribe , who to the crowd ’s wandering eyes should appear but Dave Chappelle in Portland ’s Pioneer Square .
Just as Twitter promised .
Well , almost .
He showed up right around 1 AM .
And here with a bunch of Qik video — which rivals the bigfoot videos in quality — is Varun Thota .
So the rumor that was a hoax turned out to be the truth .
Stranger things have happened .
And — appropriately enough — it ’s all been captured on Twitter .
So see , Virginia ?
There is a Dave Chappelle .
And a Twitter flash mob in Portland .
And all is good in the world .
UPDATE 2
The incomparable PDX Pipeline has found four videos of Dave Chappelle in Portland ’s Pioneer Square where you can actually hear what he ’s saying .

Exposing Mother Teresa : Hitchens ’ Book A Devastating Insight .
JOHN M. SWOMLEY debunks the myth of Mother Teresa , who has been unjustly built into a near - saint by the media , by way of a review of the book , The Missionary Position : Mother Teresa In Theory And Practice , by Christopher Hitchens .
From : THE HUMAN QUEST , SEPTEMBER -- OCTOBER , 1996
Exposing Mother Teresa
Hitchens ’ Book A Devastating Insight
By JOHN M. SWOMLEY
ONE OF THE interesting books published in 1995 debunks the myth of Mother Teresa , who has been unjustly built into a near - saint by the media .
She has been virtually untouchable as an almost sacred figure .
and anyone who dares to criticize her is promptly rebuked .
The book is The Missionary Position : Mother Teresa In Theory And Practice , by Christopher Hitchens ( Verso , London and New York , 1995 ) $ 12.95 .
Hitchens aired a documentary on her in England and has investigated her activities .
He questions her Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 because she never did anything for peace .
In fact , in her acceptance speech she said , “ Abortion is the worst evil , and the greatest enemy of peace ...
Because if a mother can kill her own child , what will prevent us from killing ourselves or one another ?
Nothing . ”
Wherever she goes this is her constant message .
In 1992 at an open air mass in Knock , Ireland , she said , “ Let us promise our Lady who loves Ireland so much , that we will never allow this country a single abortion .
And no contraceptives . ”
She obviously sees no connection between poverty and too many children .
In one interview cited in the book , she was asked , “ So you would n’t agree with people who say there are too many children in India ? ”
She said , “ I do not agree , because God always provides .
He provides for the flowers and the birds , for everything in the world He has created .
And those little children are his life .
There can never be enough . ”
One of Mother Teresa ’s volunteers in Calcutta described her “ Home for the Dying ” as resembling photos of concentration camps such as Belsen .
No chairs , just stretcher beds .
Virtually no medical care or painkillers beyond aspirin , and a refusal to take a 15 - year - old boy to a hospital .
Hitchens adds , “ Bear in mind that Mother Teresa ’s global income is more than enough to outfit several first class clinics in Bengal .
The decision not to do so ... is a deliberate one .
The point is not the honest relief of suffering , but the promulgation of a cult based on death and suffering and subjection . ”
Then Hitchens notes that Mother Teresa “ has checked into some of the finest and costliest clinics and hospitals in the West during her bouts with heart trouble and old age . ”
The author mentions her visit to Haiti and her endorsement of the Duvaliers , the source of much deprivation of the poor in Haiti .
Also , her acceptance of stolen money from Charles Keating , “ now serving a ten - year sentence for his part in the savings and loan scandal . ”
Keating , a “ Catholic fundamentalist ” , gave Mother Teresa one and a quarter million dollars and “ the use of his private jet . ”
During the course of Keating ’s trial , Mother Teresa wrote Judge Ito asking clemency and asked Ito “ to do what Jesus would do . ”
One of the prosecutors in the trial wrote her telling her “ of 17,000 individuals from whom Mr. Keating stole $ 252,000,000 . ”
He added , “ You urge Judge Ito to look into his heart -- as he sentences Charles Keating -- and do what Jesus would do .
I submit the same challenge to you .
Ask yourself what Jesus would do if he were given the fruits of a crime ; what Jesus would do if he were in possession of money that had been stolen ; what Jesus would do if he were being exploited by a thief to ease his conscience . ”
The prosecutor asked her to return the money , and offered to put her “ in direct contact with the rightful owners of the property now in your possession . ”
This supposed paragon of virtue never replied to his letter .
No one knows what happens to the millions of dollars Mother Teresa receives .
There is no accounting and no evidence that she has built a hospital or orphanage that reflects modern health and sanitary conditions .
Hitchens details the reactionary political activities of Mother Teresa , from aiding the Spanish right wing against the anti-Franco forces who were seeking a secular society in post - Franco Spain , to her visits to Nicaragua and Guatemala to whitewash the atrocities of the Contras and death squads .
There is much more in this book , such as letters from former workers with Mother Teresa exposing her hypocrisy .
Hitchens concludes his 98 - page book with reference to her fund - raising for clerical nationalists in the Balkans , her endorsement by Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition , and her “ cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen . ”
His last sentence is , “ It is past time that she was subjected to the rational critique that she has evaded so arrogantly for so long . ”

The Top 10 Head Scratchers of the 2009 NBA Offseason
The NBA offseason is by no means over , but the lion ’s share is behind us , so it ’s a good time to take a look back at a few of the …um … let ’s say “ questionable ” decisions of the summer .
Here are my Top 10 , in no particular order .
Feel free to add to the list if I missed something .
1. Trevor Ariza plays spiteful hardball …and loses .
Let ’s get this straight — the Lakers offered Ariza the same deal he was getting on the open market , and he refused since the Lakers could have offered more , but did n’t ?
Um , okay .
David Lee ( the agent , not the Knicks forward ) says that Ariza wanted to go somewhere where he’d be “ appreciated . ”
Lee overestimated the market for his client , and the Lakers quickly moved on to acquire Ron Artest .
Now instead of playing for the world champs , Ariza is stuck in Houston on a team that faces a very uncertain future .
Lee now says that Ariza turned down a deal worth $ 9 million more , but still picked Houston .
It sounds to me like he ’s just trying to save face .
2. Grizzlies acquire Zach Randolph .
Once the Clippers traded for Randolph ( and his toxic contract ) last season , I thought the bar for NBA general managers had hit a new low thanks to Mike Dunleavy and his wily ways .
But Dunleavy proved that he was n’t the dumbest GM in the league when he convinced the Memphis Grizzlies to take on the final two years Randolph ’s contract at the tune of $ 33.3 million .
Remember that $ 25 million or so of cap space that the Grizzlies were going to have next summer ?
Yeah , that ’s down to about $ 8 million with this brilliant move .
Just when it looked like Chris Wallace was going to rehab his image after the Pau Gasol trade — Marc Gasol panning out , trading for O.J. Mayo — he goes and does this .
Sigh .
3. T - Wolves draft both Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn with no ( good ) plan in place .
When GM David Kahn drafted two point guards with back to back picks , everyone around the league thought that he had a trade in place .
Not so , according to Kahn , who likes the idea of playing two smallish , ball - dominating guards in the same backcourt .
Now Rubio is threatening to stay in Europe for another year or two , and Kahn is seemingly happy to wait until Rubio finally makes his way to the NBA to see if his unorthodox plan ( and that ’s being kind ) will ultimately work .
4. The Magic trade for Vince Carter .
Let ’s see , your team just lost in the Finals — losing two games in overtime — and your main ballhandler is a free agent .
What do you do ?
It ’s tough to create the kind of chemistry that gets a team to the Finals , so you re-sign him , right ?
Not the Orlando Magic , who balked at Hedo Turkoglu ’s $ 10 million - per- season asking price and instead pulled the trigger on a trade for Vince Carter .
So essentially they gave up their most consistent player ( Turkoglu ) and a budding star ( Courtney Lee ) for the 32 - year - old Carter .
A healthy Jameer Nelson ( along with a savvy mid-level signing ) may have been enough to put this Magic team over the top , but now we ’ll never know .
5. Pistons sign Ben Gordon for $ 11 million per season .
Look , I like Ben Gordon … for about $ 8 million per season .
The guy is a great scorer , but he has sketchy shot selection at times and is a big liability on defense .
For years , the Bulls did n’t even deem him good enough to start , but the Pistons are going to throw $ 11 million per year at him ?
And it turns out that they were bidding against themselves , as the Bulls did n’t even bother to make an offer before Gordon signed with Detroit .
6 . No one makes an offer ( that we know of ) to Ramon Sessions .
7 . The Bucks do n’t extend one - year offer to Charlie Villanueva and lose him without compensation .
8 . The Bucks give away Richard Jefferson .
Let ’s tackle my beloved Bucks all at once .
First , they give away a former All - Star Jefferson in a salary dump .
Then , they elect not to take the option to make Villanueva a restricted free agent , which allows the Pistons to sign him away without having to give the Bucks anything in return .
I know why the Bucks made these moves — they do n’t feel that this roster is worthy of being in luxury tax territory and I do n’t disagree , but small market teams ca n’t give away assets for nothing .
Yeah , maybe signing Villanueva for the final year of his rookie contract would have cost them $ 4 million or more , but they could have traded him for a young prospect or maybe a draft pick .
And why did n’t they get a first rounder out of the Spurs for Jefferson ?
Small market teams have a tough time signing stars , so they have to build through the draft and via trade .
Giving away the rights to a $ 7 million - per- season player ( which is what the Pistons paid Villanueva ) is not the way to get better .
Lastly , why has n’t anyone made RFA Ramon Sessions an offer ?
The Bucks have proven that they are trying to cut salary and they picked up Brandon Jennings in the draft .
Does anyone really think that they ’d match a significant ( $ 4 - $ 5 million per year ) offer for Sessions ?
He had the 13th - highest PER amongst all point guards , and the 5th - highest amongst all point guards under the age of 26 .
Moreover , his +/- numbers are the best on the team for anyone who played more than 1200 minutes .
Why has n’t a team in need of point guard help ( Portland ? ) jumped on this guy ?
9 . The Suns give away Shaquille O’Neal .
Regular readers know that I ’m not fond of the job Steve Kerr is doing in Phoenix .
First , he trades Rudy Fernandez away for cash .
Then he ruins one of the most exciting teams in NBA history by trading Shawn Marion for Shaquille O’Neal .
Now he seemingly admits that the Shaq trade was all for naught by giving him away in a salary dump .
Shaq made the Third Team All - NBA last year , and Kerr traded him for Ben Wallace and Sasha Pavlovic ’s expiring contracts .
Geesh .
10 . Six teams pass on DeJuan Blair IN THE SECOND ROUND !
When I first heard that there were concerns about Blair ’s knees , I thought he might fall into the bottom third of the first round .
Even if the guy is missing ligaments in his knees , he was still one of the best rebounders in all of college basketball last season and he ate up # 2 pick Hasheem Thabeet in Connecticut .
When Blair fell into the second round I was stunned as the Kings , Wizards , Blazers , Nuggets , Pistons and Grizzlies all passed on Blair .
A second round pick does n’t require the same kind of financial commitment as a first round pick , so there ’s very little downside if the guy does n’t pan out .
Blair fell and fell , right into the inviting arms of the Spurs , who will be lucky to have him on the roster for the foreseeable future .
Let 's have our cake and eat it too
System.out.println ( " Hello World " ) ;
say " Hello World "
sub log { no warnings ; warn @_ ; }
no warnings
warn
sub
log
log
method log { no warnings ; warn @_ }
One of the most difficult tradeoffs in language design is brevity verses explicitness .
Having long names for methods , functions , variables and verbose patterns makes your code much clearer and less ambiguous .
To my mind there 's nothing ambiguous about :
It 's obviously printing a line to standard out and , at least as long as you associate " System " with " standard " in your head , there 's no surprises lurking here .
This kind of explicitness is great .
It means anyone can read the code and bit by bit pick it apart to work out exactly what 's happening ( Oh ... so there 's a ' System ' class .... and look an ' out ' property .... and a ' println ' method ... )
Of course , the problem with this level explicitness is that the verbosity it requires takes too long to write all the time unless you 've got a super - charged macro based IDE .
And even then it faces a worse drawback :
As the patterns get larger and the verbosity multiplies it gets harder to comprehend the overall picture .
Your eyes tends to glaze over after a day 's protracted coding and the details start to become obscured .
For example in microcosm , the " System.out " is the least interesting bit of the above code , but it 's the part of the statement my eyes are drawn to first .
Worse still , programmers tend to write the same number of lines of code no matter how verbose the programming language they tend to use is .
Those languages with more brevity therefore tend on the whole to get more done in those lines !
Compare and contrast the above Java statement to the following Perl statement : Much shorter , and much easier to read ;
The eyes are drawn to the " Hello World " which is indeed the interesting part of the statement .
With much shorter statements and less wrapper code , the Perl users should be producing many more lines of code a day and beating the pants off the Java programmers .
Well , this istrue .
And , to be fair , often .
What was the tradeoff with brevity again ?
Oh , yes ... more ambiguity .
When does this strike ?
In maintenance and what I like to call " pre-maintenance " , the time you 're developing the code yourself and if reaches the point it 's too big to fit in your head .
Consider the two examples above .
While the Java version is clearly printing to standard out , " say " is printing to the ' current file handle ' whichalways is standard out .
Of course Perl people might consider this potential action at a distance to be a worthwhile abstraction layer .
Which really emphasises an important difference between the two languages .
Perl and Java are essentially operating at about the same level of abstraction .
They 're both a level above C , running on a virtual machine layer that has nice safety nets built in meaning things like memory allocation , array boundary checking , sorting algorithms , etc. are all taken care by the core language and API .
There 's really little to separate the two languages , and they share more in common with each other than say , C and Prolog do , so it 's more interesting to look at the small details that make the two languages different to one another .
The Perl and Java programmer have a lot to learn from one another .
This difference in syntax philosophy is really interesting to me .
Perl 's basic syntax typically allows you to express more in shorter space by exploiting what is known as .
There 's a lot of implicit things .
There 's list or scalar context for example , or the current file handle , or there 's the topic variables ( $_ , @_ et al ) that are often used as default arguments for calls .
This either allows you to hold more in your head ( because you worry about less because you can ignore the need to restate the context all the time ) or hold a lot less ( because the code is n't clear and you have to worry about what 's in the hidden context all the time . )
So in theory Perl allows you to express more in a line , but you can also get yourself in a mess a heck of a lot quicker .
It can be really easy for beginners to pick up Perl compared to Java because they are n't forced to deal with all the implicit stuff directly , but at the same time they 're not aware of all the implicit things going so it can harder to deal with too ; A double edged sword .
No wonder sometimes Perl is better than Java , and sometimes Java is better than Perl .
The obvious thing that Perl and Java can do , in the grand tradition of langauge design , is learn from each other 's mistakes and steal the good bits from each other without ( hopefully ) picking up the bad bits .
Java stealing regular expressions and Perl stealing layered IO are good examples of worthwhile theft .
So what would I change about Perl to take advantage of what Java teaches us ?
Probably more than some people would like , and a lot less than others .
As a way of example of what I would change I wrote is this particularly confusing chunk of code earlier in the week : immediately followed by ?
Gah !
Of course , what I 'm actually doing is suppressing all warnings that perl will generate ( undefined values , printing of wide characters , etc ) while it prints out my warnings message .
Very brief .
Different semantic domains entirely .
So what do I think we should do to fix this ?
Nothing .
This is just the pain of having a brief ambigious language : Sometimes you 're just going to end up with what I dub " talking at semantic cross purposes " in your code .
I could suggest that we force people more explicit so it 's clear what warnings I 'm talking about in each case , but then I 'd be changing the feel of the language .
I 'm in no rush to recreate Java ; Java 's a fine language and I know where it is when I want to use it .
So what would I change ?
Ambiguity where there 's genuine confusion due to overloading meaning of things .
If you 're paying a lot of attention in my example you 'll notice that I 'mdeclaring something that 's going to be used as a subroutine there , despite thekeyword ( because , obviously , without syntatic gymnastics you can't call a subroutine calledwithout calling thebuilt in function instead . )
In fact , the occasions where you want a method to be also be callable as a subroutine ( or vice versa ) are very thin .
Sois where I 'd be more explicit and lose the unnecessary ambiguity be able to express the difference between aand a .
Like so :
Of course , that 's exactly what some of the more radical extensions like MooseX : : Declare allow you to do , and I 'll talk more about that in a future blog entry .
The Soviet era ( 1918 - 1991 ) was a time of huge upheaval , but was also a period that produced some of the most radical and memorable printed imagery of the 20th Century .
The initial years after the Russian Revolution of 1917 offered artists and designers freedom to experiment ; the development of Constructivist avant - garde aesthetics in the 1920s had a profound effect on magazine graphics and political propaganda .
When Stalin came to power creative freedom was reigned in , with an enforced emphasis on Social Realism , while the later stages of the Soviet Union saw a relative relaxation of censorship , allowing a more nuanced and sophisticated approach to image making .
All of these trends would be mirrored in the incredible magazine covers of the Soviet era .
1. Krasni Niva [ 1920s , No.9 ]
Image : DavideLevine
While many artists began to experiment with new techniques and styles , the artist who created this cover in the 1920s adopted a traditional painterly approach and creates a quintessential Soviet scene : the powerful Red Army soldier marches through snow , set against a heavily industrialised , and possibly war - torn skyline .
2. Fizcul ’tura I Sport ( Physical Education and Sports ) [ 1928 , No. 29 . ]
Image : Russian Art and Books
Art and design of the Soviet era rejected old , bourgeois values , and the embraced a new , dynamic spirit .
This sports and fitness magazine from 1928 uses a striking combination of photography and graphics in the avant - garde Constructivist manner .
3. Krasni Niva [ 1929 , No.52 ]
Image : DavideLevine
This cover of Krasni Niva in the modernist style employs bold colours with the workmen ’s muscular forms representing Soviet industrial might .
4. Bezbozhnik ( The Atheist ) [ 1929 , No.15 ]
Image : WikiMedia
Bezhnoznik ( The Atheist ) was a Soviet magazine published during the 1920s whose mission was to promote atheist ideas and attack organised religion .
The message of this cover , printed in 1929 , was that the Christian Transfiguration Day should be cancelled and replaced with an Industrialization Day , celebrating Soviet toil .
This shocking image shows a Bolshevik worker cheerfully tipping Jesus out of a wheelbarrow , while his colleague is busy smashing a church bell with a hammer .
Clearly there was no place for the Church in the USSR .
5. Krokodil ( Crocodile ) Magazine Poster [ 1930 ]
Image : WikiMedia
In the early 1920s a large number of satirical magazines were printed in the Russia .
Krokodil ( Crocodile ) , founded in 1922 , was probably the most popular and long lasting of these publications , continuing until the collapse of the Soviet Union .
This 1930 poster advertises the magazine with a grinning worker and the slogan ‘ I read Krokodil ’ .
The targets for Krokodil ’s satire were Western Imperialists , bourgeois ideologies and anti-Soviet elements , so the authorities gave the paper relative freedom to operate .
Cancelled at the end of the USSR , the magazine was reinstated in 2005 , and in its present form is printed on old - style paper for an authentic Soviet feel .
6. Rabis ( Worker of Arts ) [ 1931 , No. 23 - 24 ]
Image : Russian Art and Books
Gustav Klutsis ( 1895 –1938 ) , who designed the cover of this 1931 arts magazine , was a major figure in the Russian Constructivist avant - garde movement .
Working with his wife and collaborator , Valentina Kulagina , Klutis produced revolutionary propaganda posters and helped maintain Stalin ’s ‘ cult of personality ’ .
Despite this dedication to the Soviet cause , the artist was arrested as he prepared to depart for New York ’s World Fair in early 1938 and , by order of Stalin , was executed three weeks later .
7. Komsomol I Elektrifikatsiya ( Komsomol and Electrification ) [ 1932 No. 15 - 16 ]
Image : Russian Art and Books
This Soviet magazine cover was designed in the Russian avant - garde photomontage style pioneered by artists such as Gustav Klutsis , Valentina Kulagina , Alexander Rodchenko and El Lissitzky .
8. Tehnika Molodezhi ( Technology for the Youth ) [ 1958 , No . 5 ]
Image : Fishki
Tehnika Molodezhi is a magazine first published in 1933 , which continues to be printed to the present day .
The journal covers popular science and technology topics and also features science fiction stories .
The covers of the magazine during the Soviet era are sublime fusions of art and science .
9. Tehnika Molodezhi ( Technology for the Youth ) [ 1959 , No . 5 ]
Image : Fishki
The Soviet Union launched the Sputnik 1 spacecraft in 1957 , effectively starting the Space Race in competition with USA .
Tehnika Molodezhi kept readers informed of the latest developments in space travel , cosmic discoveries , and predictions for future technologies .
The magazine ’s dazzling covers reflected these themes , such as this example from 1959 .
10 . Sovetskiy Soyuz ( Soviet Union ) [ 1965 , No.4 ]
Image : Scraps of Moscow
Sovetskiy Soyuz magazine , launched in 1956 , was distributed within Russia and translated for readers in other Warsaw Pact countries with the aim of promoting Soviet culture .
This issue from 1965 celebrates the 20th anniversary of Soviet Russia ’s victory over Nazi Germany at the end of World War Two , proudly showing the hammer and sickle flag flown on the Reichstag above the devastated streets of Berlin .
11 . Tehnika Molodezhi ( Technology for the Youth ) [ 1968 , No.2 . ]
Image : Fishki
After World War Two the Soviet Union and USA became embroiled in the Cold War Arms Race .
This Tekhnika Molodezhi cover from 1968 aims to demonstrate the sophistication of Soviet weaponry by juxtaposing images of warships , tanks , missiles and bomber planes against a background with sketches of older armaments , such as horse - drawn gun carriages and biplanes .
12 . Soviet Life [ February 1969 , No. 149 ]
Image Source : Marxists
In 1956 the USA launched Amerkia magazine , while Russia published The USSR , under an agreement to exchange and circulate the titles in each other ’s country .
The USSR was renamed Soviet Life after a few years , and while never overtly political , the Russian government controlled the information the magazine provided to the American public , and vice versa .
As the cover states , and we struggle to believe , Soviet kids enjoyed the “ Lazy , Dazy , Crazy Days of Students ’ Winter ” just as much their Spring Break counterparts in the USA .
13 . Tehnika Molodezhi ( Technology for the Youth ) [ 1970 , No.1 ]
Image : Fishki
The Soviet era covers of Tekhnika Molodezhi combined technological advancement with spectacular visuals ; during the 1970s the graphics often had an almost psychedelic flavour .
This cover shows a cosmonaut fixing an orbiting Soviet space station and what appears to be some sort of strange electrical experiment reminiscent of Tesla ’s magnifier transmitter .
14 . Sovetskiy Soyuz ( Soviet Union ) [ March 1985 ]
Image : Scraps of Moscow
This issue of the Soviet Union magazine was printed in 1985 , 30 years after the end of World War Two , and the tone is much less triumphant than in previous decades .
Here we can see that flag waving and missile displays have been replaced by images of urban reconstruction and a crossed - out nuclear mushroom cloud suggesting an anti-war message .
15 . Soviet Life [ May 1990 ]
Image : Unknown
In the late 1980s the Soviet Union was crumbling , with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 signifying the end of the Iron Curtain .
This cover of Soviet Life from 1990 , while hardly a design classic , reflects these changing times , with American media mogul and entrepreneur Ted Turner on the front page .
The last ever issue of Soviet Life was published in December 1991 .
By the end of that month the USSR was dissolved and the Soviet era was over .
Volkswagen is redefining the automobile with the L1 , a bullet - shaped diesel hybrid that weighs less than 900 pounds , gets an amazing 170 mpg and might see production within four years .
The L1 concept car unveiled at the Frankfurt auto show pushes the boundaries of vehicle design and draws more inspiration from gliders than conventional automobiles .
The only question the company 's engineers asked when designing the L1 was , " How would a car have to look and be built to consume as little energy as possible . "
Their answer was small , light and extremely aerodynamic .
Those guidelines led to a car that requires just 1.38 liters of diesel fuel to go 100 kilometers .
Although the L1 is just a concept , VW says the tandem two - seater points the way toward a future model .
" Volkswagen is making a clear statement , " the company said in a statement .
" The L1 represents a step forward into the future with completely new technology and new design ; revolutionary yet close to production readiness . "
The L1 updates an idea Volkswagen has been kicking around since 2002 , when Dr. Ferdinand Piëtch , then the chairman of the board , drove the 1 - Liter microcar from Wolfsburg to Hamburg .
The car drew its name from the fact it needed one liter of fuel to go 100 kilometers .
The 1 - Liter was a technological marvel built of carbon fiber and magnesium , but it was so ridiculously expensive VW knew it was n't practical .
Piëtch shelved the project , figuring it would n't be financially viable for another decade .
VW now thinks the car 's time has come .
The L - 1 is more refined than the 1 - Liter we saw last year when Britain 's Car magazine said VW had greenlighted the project .
The drivetrain features a two - cylinder turbodiesel displacing just 800 cubic centimeters .
It runs in two modes : " Eco , " offering 20 kilowatts ( 26 horsepower ) ; and " Sport , " with 29 kilowatts ( 39 horsepower ) .
Maximum torque is 74 pound - feet .
The engine is mated to a 10 kilowatt electric motor , which VW integrated into a seven - speed DSG automatic gearbox .
Electric motors provide great torque , and VW says the motor in the L1 kicks in under hard acceleration to provide up to 40 percent more grunt .
It also can propel the car on its own , though VW does n't say how far the L1 will go on electricity alone .
VW also did n't offer any specs on the lithium - ion battery , which gets a boost from regenerative braking .
Start - stop technology helps improve fuel economy .
The fuel tank holds just 1.7 gallons , and VW says says the car gets 1.38 l/100 km .
That works out to 170.4 mpg by our math .
VW claims the L1 emits just 36 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide .
For the sake of comparison , the 2010 Toyota Prius emits 89 g/km .
The L1 looks unlike anything else on the road , which is exactly what VW had in mind .
" The design of the L1 redefines classic and aesthetic vehicle traits , " Walter de 'Silva , head of design for the VW Group , said in a statement .
" Especially significant , of course , is how the nearly rocket - shaped lines catch one 's attention .
All of its moving parts are integrated so accurately that the body resembles a rocket or jet .
It is a body that cuts through the wind with minimal aerodynamic resistance . "
Indeed .
The L1 has a claimed drag coefficient of just 0.195 .
That matches the General Motors EV1 , which is the most aerodynamic production car ever built , but is slightly less aerodynamic than the first - gen 1 - Liter .
A carbon - fiber monocoque and carbon fiber exterior skin , both developed with technology derived from Formula 1 and aerospace manufacturing , account for the L1's super flyweight 380 kilograms ( 837 pounds ) .
The body alone weighs just 124 kilograms ( 273 pounds ) .
The car is 12.5 feet long and 3.75 feet tall , making it about as low as a Lamborghini Murcielago .
There are no doors , only a jet - like canopy that swings up from the left side .
There 's room for two , one behind the other , and everyone sits in carbon fiber seats .
Instruments are laid out in a 180 - degree radius in front of the driver , and there are no mirrors , only cameras that display images on organic light - emitting diode displays .
VW says the L1 is perfectly safe , with the driver and passenger safely ensconced in a carbon fiber safety cell and protected by head and side - curtain airbags .
The front of the car features an aluminum crash structure .
The word out of Frankfurt , according to The New York Times , is VW will build a limited number of these next year .
Officially , VW says we 'll have to wait a little longer .
" 2013 is the target year for this future dream car to become a reality , " the company said in a statement .

Most people growing up remember the children ’s book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs , but is this film adaption going to bring back some nostalgia ?
I can remember reading the book and thinking “ Wow …it ’d be so cool if it rained my favorite foods ! ” … but this film really makes it seem like one hellish nightmare .
In fact , for such a light - hearted film , the message about our eating habits was pretty strong .
I am surprised the filmmakers did n’t just go ahead and call the film , Cloudy with a Chance of Heart Disease .
The film follows a somewhat lovable character , Flint Lockwood ( Bill Hader ) , who has always had a nack for inventions .
Flint seems to always have the right intentions with these inventions , but he executes them , ever so poorly .
Well , after a lifetime of failures , Flint finally makes an invention that can turn water into food , and he has finally stuck gold .
In his town , Swallow Falls , sardines have been the main attraction , so Flint really thinks his invention will change the town .
One day , after a freak accident , Flint ’s invention ends up in the sky , and it begins to rain food .
Now , Mayor Shelbourne ( Bruce Campbell ) , is tired of this “ po- dunk town ” as he calls it , and feels that this raining of food could be a new tourist attraction .
This is where the film picks up , because we see the influence that the town and the mayor have on Flint for the rest of the film .
A cute news reporter , Sam Sparks ( Anna Ferris ) , is there for Flint , but I guess it ’s easy to lose your head when you could be come hero of the town .
I ’m not going to spoil any of the inventive food jokes through out the film , but it all culminates into an epic battle at the end that was really cool to watch in 3 - D .
While not perfect , the second half of the film was a lot of fun to watch , and it was great to see those memorable illustrations brought to life on the big screen .
For the most part , the performances were great .
I am so used to seeing Bill Hader as a side - kick in films ( such as Hot Rod ) , so it was cool to see such an oddball character take the lead .
Anna Feris does a good job with Sam Sparks , keeping her peppy and cute … once her nerdy side comes out , she pulls that off wonderfully as well .
I think the character that made me laugh the most was Flint ’s pet monkey ( that has a Thought Translator so you can hear it speak ) , named Steve ( voiced by Neil Patrick Harris ) .
There are so many moments in the film that Steve just takes the spotlight and says something random that will have you in stitches .
Another show stopper was Mr. T as the cop , Earl ; hearing Mr. T calling Flint a “ fool ” was pretty much worth the price of admission for me .
To be totally honest , I thought the film was cast very well , especially the mayor .
Bruce Campbell did a great job at keeping the character with a nice mix of being goofy and sinister , all at the same time .
The films message is clear , people eat too much , and they make sure to shove that point down your throat until you are sick .
We all know that eating too much junk food is bad for you , so it ’s kind of annoying when we see that lecture posted on the big screen for nearly ninety minutes .
At the same time , we also see a more light - hearted message in the form of Flint always shooting for his dreams , even when he did n’t have the approval of his peers .
I think a lot of kids will relate to Flint , seeing as his father knows squat about technology , and Flint is obsessed with that stuff .
For a lot of todays children , the parents can’t keep up with all the new - fangled video games and ipod ’s ; the film shows that even if your family does n’t care for your electronic hobbies , they will never stop caring about you .
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a film I would recommend only as a matinee .
If there is nothing else playing that you want to see , then sure , go ahead , but it ’s nothing really fresh or ground breaking .
After watching the film , I drew comparisons between it and Wall - E. With Pixar ’s film , we had a similar message , about society becoming fat , due to laziness from technology .
Cloudy on the other hand , seems to just make people seem like fat slobs with insatiable hunger …
I guess I just felt this movie was n’t executed as well .
However , the filmmakers should be applauded on some of the inventive things you see in the middle of the film , ranging from a jello vista that Flint makes for Sam , to ice cream snowball fights .
I think this is a step up from the studio’s other CG outings with Open Season and Surf ’s Up , but I do n’t think they are quite up to par with Pixar and Dreamworks quite yet .
The film does n’t stand out among the rest of the CG crowd , and with the elevating prices of 3 - D movies in general , it makes Cloudy a bit harder to swallow .
Electronic warning systems and a computerized “ notice to all airmen ” system exist to prevent midair collisions like the one Thursday night off San Clemente Island that apparently killed nine military members .
But as a Coast Guard admiral noted ruefully Friday , “ No system is perfect . ”
Even in an age of sophisticated collision - detection warning equipment , communication gear and an instantaneous message board notifying all pilots of military maneuvers , the fundamental safety procedure remains “ see and avoid . ”
Night flying is fraught with particular peril , as pilots become more focused on their cockpit instruments .
Even veteran pilots can look up and see other craft dangerously close .

“ We ’ve all had those surprises where your heart jumps , ” said James Huston , a San Diego lawyer , author and former Navy fighter pilot .
The collision between a Coast Guard C- 130 Hercules transport plane and a Marine Corps AH - 1 Super Cobra helicopter occurred about 7:10 p.m. , 20 miles east of San Clemente Island .
A nearby pilot reported a fireball in the sky .
The Coast Guard plane from Sacramento , with seven crew members , was searching for a 12 - foot skiff reported adrift near the island , which is owned by the Navy .
The Super Cobra , with two pilots , was among four Marine helicopters from the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station - based 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing on a night training mission .

The Coast Guard plane , designed for search - and - rescue missions , departed Sacramento about 3:30 p.m. and arrived at the search site about 75 minutes later .
With darkness , the four Marine helicopters headed for their training mission off San Clemente Island .
Pilots can post a “ notice to all airmen ” on a system run by the Federal Aviation Administration .
It is customary to post such notes when the military is conducting either a training or search - and - rescue mission , said Huston , who has handled military helicopter crash litigation .
On the notification system , the location of missions is visible to all aircraft .
It is unclear whether the Coast Guard or Marine Corps posted such a note about their missions near San Clemente Island .
The collision occurred at 900 to 1,000 feet altitude , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Joseph Castillo told reporters in San Diego .

A Pentagon spokesman said it was unlikely that anyone survived .
Still , Castillo refused to give up hope , noting that all the personnel are in good physical condition and trained in water - survival techniques .
“ We will continue to search as long as there is a chance of survivors , ” he said .
Search efforts by the Navy , Coast Guard and Border Patrol in a 644 - square - mile area were expected to continue throughout the night Friday .
Castillo said the Coast Guard and Marine Corps will do a joint investigation to determine the cause of the collision and how similar incidents can be avoided .

The Coast Guard plane on its flight from Sacramento was in touch with FAA controllers .
As it neared San Clemente Island , procedures called for it to notify the North Island Naval Air Station in Coronado , Calif .
The Coast Guard was searching for a small boat piloted by David Jines , 50 , who lives on Santa Catalina Island and had gone to assist another boater .
That boater returned safely but Jines remained unaccounted for .
An FAA spokesman said that controllers had told the Coast Guard pilot to contact North Island as it approached the San Clemente Island airspace .
It is unclear whether that notification was made .
Meanwhile , FAA controllers never talked to the four Marine helicopters , the FAA spokesman said .
Advertisement
In San Diego and Sacramento , families of the crew members waited anxiously for news of a possible rescue .
The Coast Guard estimated survival time in the water as approximately 20 hours .
In San Diego , where many former pilots make their home , the crash renewed their appreciation of the dangers of flying .
“ When I hear about something like this , I get a knot in my stomach , ” said Dave Koontz , a retired Navy officer who flew CH - 53 helicopters .
Huston , whose latest novel , “ Marine One , ” is about the fatal crash of a helicopter carrying a U.S. president , said that even with advanced equipment , there is still the ever - present chance of human error .

“ It ’s the rule you learn on Day 1 of flight school : ‘ Do n’t assume the other guy is doing the right thing , ’ ” he said .

Yesterday — upon learning that Marshall Kirkpatrick had seen a Facebook ad that John Kitzhaber had decided to mount another run for the Oregon governor gig — I started to do a little digging into Kitzhaber ’s social media presence .
Then it dawned on me , instead of just taking a look at the one candidate — even if he was the one who had served as governor during half of my residence in Oregon — it would probably be wise to look at all the gubernatorial candidates , their online presence , and their social media savvy .
Sounds like a pretty good idea , does n’t it ?
Shall we ?
Now , we ’re still early in the race .
Like eight months until the primaries early .
So at this point , there are some folks who are officially running and some who are purported to be running .
And then there are probably some people who many wish were running .
I ’m just going to focus on those first two groups — the official candidates and the purported candidates — and leave that last group up to someone else .
For guidance , I ’m going to use the Wikipedia page on the Oregon gubernatorial election of 2010 .
And who knows ?
If this goes over well , we might need to check in with the candidates from time to time to see how they ’re continuing to fare on the Web .
Okay , enough set up .
Let ’s get to it .
Confirmed Oregon gubernatorial candidates
Allen Alley ( R )
Twitter is clearly taking the whale ’s share ( pun intended ) of the social media strategy , with his tweet stream taking up a good chunk of his campaign site .
@allen_alley has currently composed 651 tweets .
He is following 281 folks and is being followed by 393 .
Twitalyzer gives him a “ slowly emerging based on a calculated score of 0.6 out of 100 . ”
Alley ’s Facebook presence is mostly a repeat of his Twitter stream — like the majority of folks ( me included ) who tie the two together .
He currently has 713 supporters on his fan page .
He ’s not using the vanity URL feature for his campaign — but he is for his personal Facebook page .
Alley boasts a complete Linked In profile .
He ’s currently linked to 336 connections .
I was impressed to see Alley promoting Flickr as one of his social media outlets .
He has currently uploaded 43 public images — documenting the campaign trail — to his account .
He ’s also got a Vimeo account with four videos .
While the Alley site does feature an RSS feed , he currently has no Google Reader subscribers on that feed .
Well , he has one now .
I just signed up .
As far as his site goes , it ’s a well designed site .
There ’s no obvious blog apart from the string of tweets .
Although , there is a forum .
Alley is currently running on Joomla , on open source solution .
He ’s selected the following keywords for his home page : Allen Alley , Oregon Governor , Kitzhaber , DeFazio , Jason Atkinson , Pixelworks , Oregon budget , Kulongoski , Oregon tax increases , Oregon tax increase petitions , Oregon initiatives , Oregon renewable energy , walk across Oregon , Baker City , John Day , Redmond , Bend , and Salem .
Jason Atkinson ( R )
Atkinson appears to have just started using Twitter .
@senjaa follows one person , has 67 followers , and no tweets .
And no one has tweeted about him .
So there ’s no way to send Twitalyzer after him .
The Friends of Jason Atkins Facebook group has 258 members .
It currently features some positioning statements and a few wall posts .
Atkinson has a minimal Linked In presence with one connection .
While I was n’t able find any sort of image or video accounts , Atkinson is regularly featured on the Oregon Senate Republicans YouTube channel .
As far as his site goes , Atkinson appears to be running a WordPress install .
He has a blog with several entries with the latest post dated April 24 , 2009 .
He has an RSS feed for that blog with two Google Reader subscribers .
John Kitzhaber ( D )
Kitzhaber has a Twitter presence that is prominently promoted on his site .
@kitz2010 has 255 followers and is following 143 people .
He currently has three 27 tweets ( see below ) .
Twitalyzer gives him a “ slowly developing based on a calculated score of 1.5 out of 100 . ”
As an aside , whoever is running the Twitter account is using CoTweet which leads me to believe that they ’re likely running more than this account .
And they ’re paying attention .
They just went on a replying tear as I was writing this post , responding to a ton of folks .
That , my friends , is a very good sign .
Kitzhaber ’s strongest showing is on Facebook where he currently has 5028 — up nearly 1000 from when I checked 24 - hours ago .
The page is being well used with the activity stream showing a lot of chatter and liking .
And he ’s taking advantage of the Facebook vanity URL .
I could n’t find a Linked In presence for Kitzhaber .
As far as images and video go , I could find any social accounts dedicated to the campaign .
But there are a few Kitzhaber videos on YouTube .
The Kitzhaber campaign site is built on Typepad .
But it seems to be pretty minimal .
It does n’t currently have an RSS feed or a blog .
And therefore , it does n’t have any Google Reader subscribers .
John Lim ( R )
Apart from a Wikipedia page , Lim has little to no online presence at this point .
Still , The Oregonian confirms Lim is running for governor .
Potential Oregon gubernatorial candidates
Bill Bradbury ( D )
Bradbury has a Twitter presence with 184 followers and 53 tweets .
@bbsalmon currently follows 12 people .
Bradbury is using Facebook and has taken advantage of the vanity URL with BradburyforOregon .
He currently has 949 supporters .
His Facebook page is active .
In fact , most of his entries have at least one comment on them .
Bradbury has a complete LinkedIn profile and he belongs to a couple of Linked In groups .
He currently has 78 connections .
He set up a Flickr account in July that features photos of him meeting with a variety of folks .
The bulk of the current photos are from the Oregon Business Roundtable .
Bradbury ’s campaign site is built on WordPress .
It features a blog — the latest post on which makes me think I ’m going to need to be moving him up into the “ official candidates ” listing soon .
The blog has an RSS feed , but it does n’t have any Google Reader subscribers .
Scott Bruun ( R )
Bruun does n’t have much of an online presence , currently .
Aside from his Oregon House of Representatives page , he has a Wikipedia page .
I ’m just guessing , but I think this may be Bruun ’s Linked In page which has 18 connections .
Peter DeFazio ( D )
DeFazio is not on Twitter according to Tweet Congress .
He does have a Facebook fan page though .
Unfortunately , there is n’t much activity there .
He has 1875 supporters .
DeFazio has a minimal LinkedIn profile with two connections and one recommendation .
I was n’t able to find any other social media or online profiles for DeFazio .
Dave Hunt ( D )
Apart from his Oregon State Rep page and a Wikipedia entry , Hunt ’s only other online presence are remnants of his campaign for the state legislature .
Randy Leonard ( D )
Apart from his City of Portland Commissioner page and a brief Wikipedia article , Leonard ’s most prominent online presence is a respectable Linked In profile with 19 connections .
I could have sworn he was on Twitter , but the account I was following and that his Commission page references — @randyleonard — no longer exists .
Steve Novick ( D )
While we ’re not seeing any gubernatorial rumblings , Novick ’s Twitter presence for his senate bid has 328 followers and 69 tweets .
Even more impressive , he ’s following 1294 folks .
But he has n’t updated since May .
Of 2008 .
Likewise , his Facebook fan page has 507 followers .
But no activity since the senatorial bid .
That said , he ’s still got a “ social media dark horse ” quality .
If only for the success he had withhis campaign videos on YouTube .
[ HTML1 ]
Steve Shields ( D )
The Wikipedia Oregon gubernatorial page is the only thing I can find .
I swear .
[ UPDATE ]
But Mark Douglas is better than me at searching .
Because here ’s a site he found about Steve Shields .
Gordon Smith ( R )
I could n’t find a Twitter presence for Smith , but I did find a fan page on Facebook with 525 supporters .
Other than that ?
Not much .
Desari Strader ( D )
Strader is on Twitter as @solar_girl .
She has 18 followers and is following two people .
She posted one tweet .
In February .
I could n’t find her on Facebook .
But I did find her on Linked In , with a minimal profile and no connections .
Greg Walden ( R )
Walden is on Twitter with 465 followers and 82 tweets .
@repgregwalden is following 83 people .
According to Twitalyzer , he ’s “ just emerging based on a calculated score of 0.2 out of 100 . ”
He ’s on Facebook but he has protected his updates .
Walden also has a Flickr stream and a YouTube account that were used for his congress bid .
Let ’s recap for those of you keeping score at home
[ HTML2 ]
So now I do n’t feel so guilty for focusing on Kitzhaber in the original post .
Because with the exception of Alley , Bradbury , and Kitzhaber — and maybe Novick if he decides to join the race — none of the gubernatorial candidates has even begun to scratch the surface of the Web — let alone social media .
And I would argue that even those four have a long long way to go .
And that ’s a big opportunity .
It will be interesting to see which candidates jump to take advantage of that .
And more importantly , how they use the Web to discuss the issues with their respective constituencies .
Oregon ’s governor seat is still very much up for grabs .

60 . ‘ A Quiet Place ’ ( 2018 ) : Newton ’s John Krasinski ( who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay ) and Emily Blunt , his wife , star as a couple trying to protect their children in a post - apocalyptic world where silence is essential to survival .
Make a sound , and they hunt you .
59 . ‘ Silent Night , Bloody Night ’ ( 1974 ) : The movie that birthed the modern slasher flick .
This forgotten classic – which takes place in Arlington , of all places – features the creepy atmosphere , disturbing backstory , and out - of - the shadows violence that have become staples of the slasher films of the ‘ 80s and ‘ 90s .
Some mansions are best left deserted .
58 . ‘ Fire in the Sky ’ ( 1993 ) : One of the most realistic alien abduction scenes ( if you believe in that sort of thing ) ever put to film .
While pop culture pokes fun at alien “ probes , ’’ you wo n’t be laughing during this one .
Instead , you may just be giving a second glance to that blinking star in the sky or that slow - moving airplane .
Is that an airplane ?
Advertisement
57 . ‘ Insidious ’ ( 2010 ) : A couple ’s young son inexplicably falls into a coma after seeing something frightening in the attic of the family ’s new home .
Months later , after their still - comatose son is brought home from the hospital , it appears the house has become haunted .
Or is it the child who is haunted ?
A sequel and two prequels followed this frightening original film .
56 . ‘ When a Stranger Calls ’ ( 1979 ) : This slow - moving thriller is sure to be scariest to babysitters .
It will send chills down the spine of anyone who has put the kids to sleep and waited anxiously for mom and dad to return with your $ 20 .
You may need to spend it on therapy .
55 . ‘ The Amityville Horror ’ ( 1979 ) : This movie uses a staple of effective scares : based on “ true events . ’’
Whether or not you believe the Lutz family ’s account of what happened in the Long Island manse , it ’s hard not to jump at the bumps in the night .
The lesson here : Never move into a house where a murder occurred .
We know , seems like common sense .
54 . ‘ Dawn of the Dead ’ ( 2004 ) : Some of the scariest scenes come in the opening moments of the film , when a zombie outbreak is just beginning to spread , and a little girl — well , we wo n’t spoil it for you .
While the film is technically a remake of George Romero ’s 1978 zombie epic , it ’s different enough to be enjoyed as an original .
Advertisement
53 . ‘ The Mothman Prophecies ’ ( 2002 ) : It ’s bad enough when you start getting predictions of doom from a strange - sounding , shadowy figure who looks like he could be one of Satan ’s minions .
It ’s worse when those predictions start coming true .
Let ’s not even mention the fact that this movie is based on a book chronicling supposedly true events from the late ‘ 60s .
What horrible prophecies will come next ?
Here ’s one : you , frightened .
52 . ‘ Evil Dead II ’ ( 1987 ) : This is the movie that made Bruce Campbell a B - movie icon and won Sam Raimi a whole lot more directing gigs .
This films has equal parts humor and gore , but when the frights happen , they happen on a grand scale .
Ever wondered what it would be like to fight your own hand ?
You wo n’t have to wonder anymore after watching this movie .
51 . ‘ Paranormal Activity ’ ( 2007 ) : This low - budget , single - camera movie , shot in the first - person style popularized by “ The Blair Witch Project , ’’ is simple and effective .
It eschews story and visual effects for the slow build , and unlike so many similar films , all that building tension really pays off .
50 . ‘ The Wailing ’ ( 2016 ) : This South Korean mystery - horror film centers on a policeman investigating in a small village where people are becoming sick with an illness that causes them to begin murdering each other .
Is a mysterious Japanese stranger to blame ?
49 . ‘ Us ’ ( 2019 ) : Another Jordan Peele film , “ Us ” is a uniquely creepy tale of a family who are terrorized on vacation by their apparent doppelgangers .
Lupita Nyong ’o and Elisabeth Moss star .
Advertisement
48 . ‘ The People Under the Stairs ’ ( 1991 ) : If , for some reason , you have ever been inclined to burglarize someone ’s house , this movie should serve as a proper deterrent .
While there are a few light moments in this Wes Craven classic , the scares still satisfy .
An insane couple and a seemingly inescapable house drive the thrills .
The movie also features the effective use of a “ gimp suit ’’ a la “ Pulp Fiction . ’’
47 . ‘ Session 9 ’ ( 2001 ) : An old abandoned mental hospital ( hello , Danvers ! ) provides the creepy location , as strange things start happening – and people start disappearing – when an asbestos removal crew starts taking apart the floors and ceilings .
Scary scene of note :
One worker trying to outrun the lights in a long tunnel as the generator powers down .
Plus , the film employs the best use of an ice pick this side of “ Basic Instinct . ’’
46 . ‘A Tale of Two Sisters ’ ( 2003 ) : This Korean chiller follows a family with an unexplained past and a ghost that seems to pop up and scare the stuffing out of everyone watching .
The odd behavior of some of the characters , and silent and shameful expressions on others , make you wonder if you ’re getting the whole story .
In one scene , your mind may be turned into a pretzel trying to follow along .
Just go with it .
45 . ‘ Get Out ’ ( 2017 ) : Written and directed by Jordan Peele , “ Get Out ” tells the tale of a black man invited to meet his white girlfriend ’s parents in an upstate New York town .
After arriving , he ’s treated oddly by the parents , their staff , and visiting guests .
From there , things go from bad to worse ( think forced brain transplants ) .
“ Get Out ” was nominated for four Academy Awards , winning for Best Original Screenplay .
44 . ‘ Suspiria ’ ( 1977 ) :
It ’s a stylish , sometimes gory movie from Italy ’s Dario Argento , and a most unlikely location for a horror film : a ballet school in Germany .
The frights come in waves and start as an unassuming student slowly learns who is actually running the school — and what their motivations are .
For those squeamish around bugs , there ’s a scene involving maggots falling from the ceiling that will have your skin crawling .
43 . ‘ Signs ’ ( 2002 ) : “ Night of the Living Dead ’’ meets “ War of the Worlds . ’’
While not all of the scares here are what you ’d call original , they are incredibly effective .
The rural setting and slow build up to the reveal of the bad guys really make the finale pay off .
Yes , there are some scientifically curious things going on that defy explanation , but who ’s got time to be rational when you ’re hiding your eyes behind a couch pillow ?
42 . ‘ The Beyond ’ ( 1981 ) : Aside from the fact that Italian goremeister Lucio Fulci likes to push the envelope with his violent scenes , he masterfully builds in the waiting — the suspense before the prolonged periods of over - the - top bloodshed — that makes those payoffs so cringe - worthy ( in a good way ) .
This movie should also make any owner of a turn - of - the - century fixer - upper think twice before undertaking a major renovation .
41 . ‘ Cujo ’ ( 1983 ) : Rabies , rabies , rabies .
This ai n’t “ Old Yeller ’ ’ we ’re talking about here .
Anyone who has even a slight fear of dogs will not want to watch this one alone .
This film , based on a Stephen King book , makes a compelling argument for tighter leash laws .
40 . ‘ The Crazies ’ ( 2010 ) : This is one of many recent remakes of ‘ 70s and ‘ 80s horror movies , but one of the few to actually improve on its predecessor .
This remake of the George Romero ’s 1973 original will make you fear your neighbors , distrust the government , and question whether your water supply is contaminated .
Oh , and there ’s a scene in a car wash that will get your heart racing .
39 . ‘ The Omen ’ ( 1976 ) : Forget all the stories about bad luck befalling the cast and crew during the movie ’s production : this Gregory Peck - helmed thriller is scary enough as merely a film .
Remember : Never secretly adopt someone else ’s child without meeting the kid ’s parents first — or at least seeing a picture .
If creepy children scare you , then young Damien will be sure to burrow a hole in your brain and come out in your nightmares .
Oh , and by the way , if decapitation scenes get your blood pumping , this one has one of the all - time greatest .
38 . ‘ The Hills Have Eyes ’ ( 2006 ) : This remake of the horror classic actually packs in a few more scares — and a lot more gore .
It does n’t hurt that the makeup department spared no expense to make the bad guys as revolting as possible ( no offense to Michael Berryman ) .
And there are just enough disturbing scenes to make you never , ever look for off - the - highway shortcuts when traveling through the deserts of the western United States .
37 . ‘ 28 Days Later ’ ( 2002 ) : Many movies have tried to recreate what a major city could look like after an apocalypse , but not many do it as hauntingly well as Danny Boyle ’s “ 28 Days Later . ’’
The terrifyingly fast zombie - like creatures roaming the landscape proved to be so effectively scary that the movie spawned a wave of movies featuring fast - paced zombies .
36 . ‘ The Changeling ’ ( 1980 ) : This is a standard - setter for haunted house scares .
If you ’ve ever slept in an old house or heard some creaking pipes , you may have been gripping the sheets just a little tighter thanks to this movie .
Also , never has a wheelchair been used to more terrifying effect .
35 . ‘ The Sixth Sense ’ ( 1999 ) : There ’s something very unnerving about being put in the shoes of a young child who experiences the supernatural .
It ’s even scarier when said child is played as effectively as young Haley Joel Osment .
And the scene where he encounters the little girl — aye carumba .
34 . ‘ In the Mouth of Madness ’ ( 1994 ) : An evil creepiness seeps through the whole movie and continues building throughout , which sets the stage for an inordinate amount of legitimately scary jump - out - of - your - seat moments .
Add in a healthy dose of grotesque monsters and you have the recipe for an all - time scare fest .
If you ever felt guilty about not reading enough books , this film will make you feel better .
Sort of .
33 . ‘ The Brood ’ ( 1979 ) : Something ’s off about those kids .
You know , the ones who hide in the shadows and attack people who get near them .
What ’s their deal ?
Could it be somehow related to that woman being treated by that strange psychiatrist ?
Or are those odd kids just lost , hungry trick - or - treaters ?
So many questions .
32 . ‘ Hellraiser ’ ( 1987 ) : You ’d think a skinless man living in his girlfriend ’s attic trying to get her to commit unspeakable acts to help him become whole again would be disturbing enough .
But then you get a glimpse at the gang of demons that is chasing the skinless man .
Bad guys do n’t get much scarier looking than they look in this flick .
31 . ‘ The Devil ’s Backbone ’ ( 2001 ) : Before “ Hellboy ’ ’ and “ Pan ’s Labrynth , ’’ Guillermo del Toro was crafting this chilling ghost story about an early 19th - century Spanish orphanage .
There are n’t many movie character who deserve more sympathy than Carlos , who struggles to fit in and is harassed by bullies and paranoid caretakers .
Throw in the ghost of a boy whom Carlos keeps spotting , and you feel the hair stand up on the back of your neck with each passing moment .
30 . ‘ Pet Sematary ’ ( 1989 ) : Do you remember that heartbreaking day during your childhood when your beloved pet died ?
Remember how you would have done anything in the world to bring the pet back , even if it was just for a day ?
Remember how crushing it was to realize that such fantasies of reunion were never going to happen ?
If so , here ’s a good movie to help you get over it .
It ’s another film based on a Stephen King book and the author makes an appearance as the preacher .
29 . ‘ The Descent ’ ( 2005 ) : This movie will terrify you if : 1 ) You ’re claustrophobic .
2 ) You ’re scared of the dark .
3 ) You have a fear of being trapped under the earth .
4 ) You have a fear of being trapped under the earth with creatures that can see you but you ca n’t see them .
Yeah , it ’s scary for all those types of people .
28 . ‘ Friday the 13th ’ ( 1980 ) : It may be a cliched setup now , but this movie can still provide a hefty dose of terror .
And do n’t blame the original for the pile of mediocre - to - awful sequels that followed .
There are real scares here , even if they take a bit to materialize .
And try not thinking of this movie if you ’re ever alone , floating in a canoe , in the middle of a lake .
27 . ‘ The Witch ’ ( 2016 ) : In 1630s New England , a family is banished from their colony over a religious dispute and settle on a farm near the edge of a forest .
After the family ’s youngest child vanishes and another seems to become possessed , members of the family begin to accuse the teenage daughter of witchcraft .
26 . ‘ 1408 ’ ( 2007 ) : Ever felt uneasy staying in an unfamiliar hotel room ?
This Stephen King - inspired tale will make you never want to set foot in one again .
This underrated gem has John Cusack as a writer who specializes in haunted hotels , while not really believing any of the stuff he writes about .
That is , until he checks in to a certain room in a New York hotel .
He ’s about to become a believer .
25 . ‘ Halloween ’ ( 2018 ) : Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle reprise their roles in this slasher sequel to 1978 ’s “ Halloween . ”
The plot follows Laurie Strode as she prepares to face serial killer Michael Meyers 40 years after she survived his rampage .
Horror fest , take two .
24 . ‘ The Conjuring ’ ( 2013 ) : In 1971 , paranormal investigators attempt to help a family being terrorized by something evil and powerful in the Rhode Island farmhouse they ’ve recently purchased .
They encounter a home filled with spirits .
One particularly evil spirit has attached itself to the family in horrifying ways never before seen by the seasoned investigators .
23 . ‘ Nightmare on Elm Street ’ ( 1984 ) : As if insomniacs need another thing weighing on their minds every night .
Before Freddy Krueger became a quipster who occasionally dabbles in scares , he was the burned - face murderer with knives for fingernails who killed teenagers in their dreams .
Oh , but they would n’t just die in their sleep .
No , the gore would follow them into the real world .
Sweet dreams !
“ One , two , Freddy ’s coming for you …’’
22 . ‘ Dawn of the Dead ’ ( 1978 ) : What ’s scarier than watching one of the remaining humans slowly transform into a zombie ?
Realizing that the zombie - in - progress is one of the only people who can fly the helicopter to get you out of there .
George Romero ’s epic - scale zombie apocalypse movie is really the only film featuring the living dead that really captures the pure hopelessness of a global zombie apocalypse .
It has spawned sequels and knock - offs and inspired video games , but nothing beats the original .
21 . ‘ Deliverance ’ ( 1972 ) :
It ’s why so many city slickers are terrified of the the South .
There has likely been no greater enemy to the tourism industry in rural Georgia than this film .
If anything , it teaches us two things :
Whenever you ’re a visitor somewhere , do n’t anger the locals .
And it ’s probably best if you keep your canoe trips to the Charles River .
20 . ‘ Saw ’ ( 2004 ) : Before this movie franchise became a sad parody of itself , it brought legitimate shock and terror to a new era , giving birth to a sub - genre in the process .
As unsettling as the predicaments of the characters are , it forces each viewer to answer the question :
What horrible things could I withstand doing in order to save my life ?
19 . ‘ Salem ’s Lot ’ ( 1979 ) : These are n’t your kids ’ vampires , all modern and emo , falling in love with the living and fostering a rivalry with werewolves .
No , these have gnarly teeth and glowing eyes and conjure nothing but pure terror .
So , get out your crucifix and holy water and enjoy .
18 . ‘ The Mist ’ ( 2007 ) : The quote kind of sums it up .
But not completely .
Without giving too much away , there are things in the mist that I guarantee you would n’t think of just by reading the movie ’s back - cover description .
And the shocking ending just may be the ultimate nightmare scenario .
17 . ‘ Psycho ’ ( 1960 ) : There ’s a reason women are wary of guys with mommy issues .
And that reason is this movie .
Thank you , Norman Bates .
Janet Leigh ’s iconic shower scene has become imprinted on the American psyche due to this Alfred Hitchcock classic .
16 . ‘ Silence of the Lambs ’ ( 1991 ) : An incredibly disturbing serial killer is on the loose , and the FBI seeks the assistance of an even more disturbing — yet somehow very charming — serial killer in a maximum security prison .
Unlike most horror movies , the conversations here are scarier than the gore .
But fear not , the gore does n’t disappoint .
15 . ‘ Invasion of the Body Snatchers ’ ( 1978 ) : Honestly , the wide - open mouths , extended fingers , and high - pitched screeching should be enough to keep you locked in your house for at least a week .
14 . ‘ Hereditary ’ ( 2018 ) : Things begin to spiral in terrifying ways for a family after their matriarch ’s death .
Can her daughter and granddaughter escape a horrifying fate that just might be their birthright ?
13 . ‘ Rec’ ( 2007 ) : This instant classic has some serious grip - your - armrests and hold - your - breath scares in it ( and it ’s better than its American remake , “ Quarantine ’ ’ ) .
If you live in a multi- unit apartment building , you ’ll be planning your escape routes after watching this film .
And go ahead , try maintaining complete silence in the grip of total panic .
It ’s not so easy , is it ?
12 . ‘ The Babadook ’ ( 2014 ) : This Australian horror film tells the tale of a widow whose child becomes obsessed with a monster called The Babadook , a frightening character from a pop-up book .
He ’s just a character in a book , right ?
11 . ‘ The Shining ’ ( 1980 ) : From your little boy seeing horrifying visions to your well - adjusted husband slowly descending into madness and becoming a homicidal maniac , there ’s plenty to frighten you in this classic , another Stephen King - inspired thriller .
10 . ‘ The Ring ’ ( 2002 ) : Beautifully ominous settings , a creepy soundtrack , and a good , if somewhat gimmicky , plot device to drive the scares .
“ The Ring ’’ — based upon the Japanese film “ Ringu ’ ’ — did successfully carve its own path , and let disturbing visuals and an impending sense of doom ride to good effect .
You may indeed be scared to death .
9. ‘ Alien ’ ( 1979 ) : Maybe it ’s just a little indigestion .
Yeah , that must be it .
Oh wait , what ’s that bulge violently erupting from my torso ?
If serving as the incubator for a killing machine from outer space does n’t scare you , then just wait until it grows up , and hides in the shadows of your spaceship , and picks off your crew one - by - one .
Luckily , you have a cyborg on your side .
Right ?
8. ‘ The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ’ ( 1974 ) : Frankly , there ’s not much to not be scared about in this movie .
Even before the bodies hit the meat hooks , the movie is simply unnerving .
Once Leatherface makes his entrance , get ready for a full hour of psychological terror .
If you ever complained about your in - laws , watch this movie and thank your lucky stars .
7. ‘ Halloween ’ ( 1978 ) :
It is n’t just that Michael Myers is a homicidal maniac .
He ’s a homicidal maniac who wears a mask that carries an expression of pure blankness , as if killing is boring .
This film set the standard for all supernatural serial killer films to follow .
And it stars a very young Jamie Lee Curtis .
6. ‘ Night of the Living Dead ’ ( 1968 ) Not only did George Romero ’s movie essentially spawn a whole genre with this zombie classic , it also set the standard for the barricade - yourself - in - the - house survival tactic .
Admit it :
You have assessed your dwelling ’s defensive strengths and weaknesses because of this film .
5. ‘ Ju-on ’ ( 2002 ) : There is perhaps no movie in history with creepier children than this classic Japanese haunted house / ghost story .
The one that stands there , frozen - faced , mouth - agape , while meowing will keep you up at night .
Add in a creepy low - key soundtrack and some legitimately striking visual scares and you have a recipe for instant nightmares .
Oh , and do n’t forget the single scariest scene involving a staircase in cinematic history .
4. ‘ Poltergeist ’ ( 1982 ) : From white - noise on the TV to empty in - ground pools to ancient Indian burial grounds , the scares are almost too numerous to count .
This movie would make anyone want to know as much as humanly possible about the history of a house before buying it .
It ’s the ultimate haunted house movie .
3. ‘ The Exorcist ’ ( 1973 ) : No child should ever be that foul - mouthed and that convincingly scary in a movie .
Linda Blair ’s seminal performance is almost enough to make you believe in demons ( that is , if you did n’t believe in them already ) .
If you have n’t watched this in a while , do yourself a favor and check out the director ’s cut , then go ahead and try sleeping afterward .
Good luck with that .
2. ‘ Jaws ’ ( 1975 ) : Be honest , every time you hear news reports of great white sightings off the coast of Cape Cod , you think of “ Jaws ’ ’ ( which was actually filmed on Martha ’s Vineyard ) .
Due to this movie , millions of people think twice anytime they set foot in the ocean .
If you have ever freaked out when something has brushed against your leg in the water , thank Steven Spielberg .
1. ‘ The Thing ’ ( 1982 ) : What makes this the top fright fest ?
Could it be the fear of complete isolation in the face of disaster ?
Or the invisible enemy in sub-zero temperatures ?
How about the terrifying feeling of not knowing which of your supposed friends and colleagues are who they say they are , and not a shape - shifting alien ?
Yeah , all those things .
And here you were thinking that the market 's collapse had taken only six years or so off the value of your nest egg .
After all , the S&P is back to 1,100 , about the same level as late 2003 .
Silly you !
As we 've noted often in recent days , since your government is quietly destroying the value of the dollar ( ostensibly to save your ass ) , the actual dollar - adjusted value of the S&P 500 is back to 1996 levels .
Even after the recent 60 % recovery !
Here , from the FT , is the S&P 500 plotted after adjusting for the dollar 's move relative to a broad currency index :
And here 's the FT 's take on it :
Another extract from Diapason Commodities ’ latest note , courtesy of author Sean Corrigan .
According to Corrigan , the chart — which is set to a logarithmic scale — shows the extent to which money illusion has boosted the apparent performance of US equities .
As he explains :
Strip out the effect of the sickly greenback ( by multiplying by the TWI ) and we see that this bust has clearly spelt doom for a three - decade uptrend ; that we are both hovering dangerously at the 50 % mark of that whole move and also threatening to fail at the previous 2003 low .
were that to occur , it could mean a much deeper unwind of the post - Tequila bubble era range .
As shown by the success of the stage and film versions of " Frost / Nixon , " the former president never fails to fascinate the American people .
Richard Nixon 's rise , fall and efforts to rise again made for great drama .
" I have never been a quitter , " Nixon says in this address delivered Aug. 8 , 1974 .
But quit he did , saying that he had lost support in Congress and that he was stepping down in the interests of the nation .
Whether one admires Nixon or despises him , few could argue this was his most tragic moment , when he became the first president to resign the nation 's highest elected office in disgrace .

This is my first post by request .
One of my readers , “ an occasional blogger and a coach ” , who runs the EffectivenessCoach blog , send me an email the other day .
Besides the usual “ hi , I saw we have similar interests and I ’m also a blogger ” the message had also a question :
“ How can you structure your learning process on the Internet ?
I end up buried under tons of websites , blogs , webinars and you name it .
Do you have any thoughts on this ?
Maybe a blog post about it ? ”
Well , the magic words were spoken : “ a blog post about this ” .
Without further ado , let ’s see how can we structure our learning process on the Internet :
Personal History
I am on the Internet for more than 14 years .
Since the very beginning .
I wo n’t tell you my Internet history here , as it has little to do with our main topic .
But I will tell you a little story about my first Internet full - contact .
10 years ago I started my own web company .
Part of it was of course , internet access .
Maybe it sounds pre-historical , but believe me , that was a time when dial - up was mainstream .
Having cable internet was still a dream .
So , I had the chance to get an office in the same building with an Internet Service Provider .
A simple ethernet link from them and voila : I had 10 mbs internet access .
Wow !
And I mean , WOW !
To make a long story short , the following 3 weeks are a black hole in my mind .
I hardly remember anything from that time other than dumbly looking at hundreds and hundreds of websites .
Without recollecting any of them , of course .
At some point , I realized I started to lose weight , to stare at people without a specific reason and that also my sleep was completely screwed .
That was the moment I started to structure my own Internet learning strategy .
1. Isolate From It For A While
Internet is highly addictive .
If you really want to take advantage of it , you must first isolate from it for a while .
Find out what you really need first .
Go online only when you have a clear image about what you want to incorporate .
During the first 3 weeks of full - contact Internet I was looking at anything : graphics , forums , cars , tech , directory .
Everything .
After the first 3 weeks , I decided it ’s time to focus on only several areas : learning the basics of server maintenance and PHP .
For the next 6 months I did n’t do anything on the Internet except that .
Over the years I found this approach extremely effective .
When I decided to start blogging I took a little bit of a break from my regular browsing habits .
I just isolated for a few weeks and then I started to browse only blogs .
And from blogs , only personal development blogs .
And from personal development blogs , only the ones that I liked .
Taking some distance from the source will surely help you decide how do you really want to use the source .
2. Restrain Your Insertion Points
How ’s the home page of your browser looking ?
How are your bookmarks organized ?
How many feeds do you have in your feed reader ?
I ask because those are your insertion points on the Internet .
You are entering the information highway through those roads .
And if you have too many access roads you ’ll be tempted to use them regardless of their value .
Hence , losing precious time just browsing around .
I recommend having under 5 insertion points .
One of them would be your feed reader , of course , and it ’s your job to constantly peruse it and get rid of old or uninteresting content .
The next ones are based on what I call “ functional web ” .
For instance , I do a lot of research .
And for research I use only Google .
Usually the front page does the trick if I ask the good question .
For interaction and human advice I use Twitter .
And for growing relationships I use Facebook .
As you may see , I still have one spot open . 🙂
3. Pick The Right Tools
Harvesting information is one of the most difficult tasks ever .
Much more difficult than harvesting crops .
This is why you ’re going to need some tools .
And your tools will be influenced by the type of information you ’re harvesting .
If you ’re after design or art , you ’re going to have a good image storing application .
If you ’re into writing , then some sort of database will have to be at hand .
I use only 2 tools to organize my work , and those are Evernote and MacJournal .
Regardless of what type of information you ’re harvesting , I think that , as a rule of thumb , any tool you ’ll use needs to have at least those features :
some sort of tagging or category grouping
integrated search
export capabilities in other formats
online / backup capabilities
4. Transform It
After you have this setup in place , start to transform all this information into something useful .
It could be a research project , a new career , a new business , whatever .
Just make sure you use all the info and you ’re not letting it slip away .
A learning process must end with something comparable .
Keeping a log of your learning activities will definitely help , but most of the time just assessing yourself at certain time intervals will do it too .
From my experience , feeling lost in the jungle of the Internet is often just an expression of a slow progress .
Kind of like frustration .
The information wave we ’re trying to ride is so big that our efforts are looking insignificant .
Having a clear way to assess progress will dramatically decrease frustration .
Sometimes , just feeling good about what you ’ve find on the Internet will alleviate your feelings of being lost in this jungle .
5. Create An Internet Free Day
Remember , your muscle grows not when you lift weights , but when you rest .
Staying in contact with your learning source too much wo n’t make you smarter .
On the contrary .
You need time to incorporate that new information .
You need distance to start making comparisons .
You need some space to start making experiments .
Staying away from the Internet is equally important if you ’re really trying to learn something out of it .
Depending on your schedule and regular work , this Internet free dayÂ may be a weekly day , or monthly day .
What counts is that during that day you ’re totally offline .
A subtle effect is that you ’re letting those outer energies work by themselves .
I often find traffic spikes on my blog after taking an internet day off .
It seems like if you ’re staying too long there you start getting in the way of something .
🙂
So , take a day off every once in a while .
***
That ’s it .
It ’s only 5 steps but I ’m sure it can be refined .
Use it a starting point and create your own .
And of course , add your suggestions in the comments .
I have to admit it was really fun to write a blog post on request .
So , if you feel I may know the answer to a question that bothers you , feel also free to use the contact page and let me know about it .
It might even get a public answer , like this one . 🙂

Jeff Rubin believes that oil prices are going to escalate much higher .
In his book Why Your World is About to Get a Whole Lot Smaller , Rubin foretells $ 200 oil and a vastly transformed global economic picture coming into focus very soon .
The premise of Rubin 's book is that oil is a finite resource and so - called " easy " oil is waning .
Inevitably production will be unable to keep up with the growing demand worldwide , and the price of oil will skyrocket .
The chief economist at CIBC World Markets in Canada for 20 years , Rubin correctly predicted the price of oil reaching $ 50 in 2005 and $ 100 in 2007 .
No one believed him then , either .
" There continues to be widespread skepticism regarding my oil price forecast , " Rubin told Rigzone .
" As I noted in the book , few people have ever changed their minds during the entire history of the peak oil debate , at least insofar as ' experts ' are concerned . "
Peak Oil Pushes New Frontiers
Pointing out that 1966 was the peak in the discovery of new oil fields , Rubin also states that production declines every year by about 4 million barrels per day because of depletion .
In order to replace what is currently being pumped , the industry must in the next five years discover reserves that will top 20 million barrels of oil a day .
In an effort to replace production , exploration and development have been pushed to much harder to produce ultra-deepwaters and equally difficult to refine oil sands .
While new developments have been made to enable production from the ulta- deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico and the oil sands of Canada and Venezuela , these resources come at a price .
In addition to the industry striving to generate emerging ( and costly ) technologies to overcome the rigors of working in waters that are more than a mile deep , Hurricanes Katrina , Rita , Ike and more have proven the Gulf of Mexico a volatile investment , with mega - projects , miles and miles of pipelines , and refineries delayed and even destroyed due to these storms .
Additionally , while Rubin expects Canadian oil sand production to increase to 4 million barrels a day , the heavy oil " must be processed extensively to become a usable motor fuel … done through an extensive cracking process that is much more costly and energy intensive than cracking light sweet crude . "
According to Rubin , the cost of developing and producing a new oil sands project in Canada can reach up to $ 90 a barrel .
While interest in heavy oils was peaked with the 2008 peak in oil prices , the subsequent plummet of oil prices reduced investments in the product .
" When prices plunged during the recession , over $ 50 billion of scheduled investment in the oil sands were suddenly cancelled , " Rubin told Rigzone .
Nonetheless , as the prices rise again , interest in oil sands has been increasing as of late .
Althabasca Oil Sands Corp. announced this week that PetroChina paid $ 1.9 billion to acquire a 60 % stake in its MacKay River and Dover Canadian oil sands projects .
Furthermore , the US State Department approved a multi-billion - dollar oil pipeline from Canadian oil sands to US refineries earlier in August .
" Synthetic oil from bitumen is likely to be the single largest source of new supply over the next two decades , principally from Alberta and the Orinoco in Venezuela , " Rubin said .
" But we need to see a world of triple - digit oil prices to raise that kind of production from tar sands . "
Additionally , interest in arctic drilling and production has increased worldwide , from the Chukchi Sea in Alaska to the waters offshore Greenland .
Rubin argues that these new sources of oil are not necessarily new , but their commerciality just becomes viable with an increase in the price of oil .
Increasing Demand
While Rubin contends that the global economic recession was caused by the peak in oil prices , he also believes that the price of oil is destined to rise again .
Increasing demand for a depleting supply is certain to push the price of oil higher .
While the US and European Union were crippled by the high price of gasoline in 2008 , many oil - rich countries subsidized the price of gasoline for their citizens , states Rubin .
While most economists look for demand to wane when prices soar , this price fix helps to push demand for oil despite high prices .
" So great is the popular demand for fuel subsidies that in many OPEC countries higher world oil prices actually raise oil consumption , in total defiance of conventional economic logic , " states Rubin 's book .
Rubin points to Ski Dubai in the middle of the Middle East as an example of this crude use of oil .
Here , Ski Dubai offers indoor snow skiing , attracting some 3,000 visitors every day .
It takes an equivalent of 3,500 barrels of oil per day to run Ski Dubai and the massive indoor mall in which is it located .
Moreover , many countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are running out of water .
While they may have enough oil to fuel their cars , these countries ' water supplies are dire .
The most likely solution to the problem is the desalination , reports Rubin .
Requiring massive amounts of energy , desalination will effectively turn oil into water .
Oil Prices Destined to Rise
These two factors -- limited supply and climbing demand -- will work together to push the price of oil higher .
In his book , Rubin argues that oil price peaks have caused four of the last five global recessions .
" The over 500 % explosion in oil prices from 2002 to the summer of 2008 is almost double the increase that occurred during either OPEC oil shock ...
No wonder the US economy and the rest of the OECD are in recession . "
While he states that high oil prices do cause the demise of demand , he sees the subsequent recession as a temporary setback for oil 's race to higher prices .
In fact , Rubin predicts that the price of oil will surpass the $ 100 mark and head to $ 200 per barrel within the next few years .
" We will see triple digit oil prices very early into an economic recovery , " Rubin told Rigzone .
" I expect we will be there within 12 months . "
While he does contend that the escalating price of oil will cause another recession , Rubin believes that recovery will spell higher prices once again .
The economist predicts $ 200 oil just around the corner .
" By 2012 , we will either be in a world of $ 200 per barrel oil or we will be back in another oil - induced recession , " he added .
While the price of oil on the NYMEX has been buoyed beyond supply and demand fundamentals , investors ' belief that the economy will rebound and energy demand will increase has helped to nearly double the price of oil through 2009 .
" The biggest signpost of change is today 's oil prices , " Rubin told Rigzone .
" West Texas Intermediate ( the North American benchmark crude ) is trading over $ 70 per barrel in the shadow of the American economy 's deepest post - war recession when there is little evidence yet of a concrete economic recovery ; yet only two and a half years ago , today 's post - recession oil price was an all - time record high . "
Ultimately , Rubin contends that the world economy will be forced to change because transportation and shipping will be thwarted because of the high cost of fuel .
Rubin 's world foresees a continued demand for oil , but a demand that has changed and a world that has de-globalized .
( CNN ) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry has removed a fourth member of a state commission charged with investigating claims that an innocent man may have been executed , his office said .
A family photo shows Cameron Todd Willingham with his wife , Stacy , and daughters Kameron , Amber and Karmon .
The Texas governor has now replaced all of the four members that , under law , he is allowed to appoint to the commission .
The remaining five members are appointed by the state 's lieutenant governor and attorney general .
Perry 's critics say his actions are politically motivated , a charge he denies .
The investigation into claims that faulty evidence led Texas to execute an innocent man in 2004 was at a " crucial point " when the shakeup occurred , one of the replaced members said .
The commission was to hear from the author of a scathing report in the case of the executed man , Cameron Todd Willingham , when Perry announced on September 30 that he would replace three members .
The session was postponed indefinitely because of the new appointments , and Perry 's critics accused him of trying to quash the Willingham probe .
" I think people are making a lot of this issue , " Perry said earlier .
Commissioner Alan Levy was replaced by John Bradley , a district attorney who was also named commission chairman .
Aliece Watts was replaced by Norma Farley , chief forensic pathologist for Hidalgo and Cameron counties .
Perry said at the time the replacements were " pretty normal protocol . "
In a statement Thursday , Perry 's office said he had appointed attorney Lance Evans of Fort Worth to replace former commission chairman Samuel Bassett of Austin , and that Randall Frost of Boerne , chief medical examiner for Bexar County , would replace commissioner Sridhar Natarajan .
" If you 've got a whole new investigation going forward , it makes a lot more sense to put the new people in now and let them start the full process , rather than bring people in there for a short period of time and then replace them , " Perry said two weeks ago .
" I think it makes a whole lot more sense to make a change now than to make a change later . "
But the Forensic Science Commission began investigating the Willingham case in 2008 , hiring Maryland fire investigation expert Craig Beyler to examine the evidence used to convince a jury the fire that killed Willingham 's three daughters was deliberately set .
Levy said at the time of his replacement he had told Perry 's office " that it would be disruptive to make the new appointments right now . "
" The commission was at a crucial point in the investigation , " he told CNN .
Asked about the future of the Willingham investigation , he said , " I do n't know if it will ever be heard . "
Both Levy and Bassett said they had asked to remain on the board .
Evans declined to give an opinion on the Willingham controversy when contacted by the Fort Worth Star - Telegram for a story Friday , saying all he knows on the matter is what he 's read in the newspaper .
" Because I have n't had involvement with the commission , I can't really comment on what 's been going on in the commission in the past , " he said .
" I will work very hard to make sure the duties of the commission ... as given by the Texas Legislature are carried out . "
Beyler 's report -- the first commissioned by a state agency -- is the latest of three to conclude that arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire .
Death - penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man .
The Beyler report concluded that the ruling of arson at the heart of Willingham 's conviction " could not be sustained " by modern science or the standards of the time .
Perry , who faces a Republican primary challenge in his bid for a third term next year , refused to issue a last - minute stay of execution for Willingham in 2004 and has said he remains confident that Willingham was guilty .
So have authorities in Corsicana , south of Dallas , who prosecuted Willingham in his daughters ' deaths .
Asked earlier whether the governor wants to see the Willingham investigation go forward , Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told CNN , " That 's a decision of the commission . "
However , the first replacements raised concern among Willingham 's relatives , who worked to avert his execution and to clear his name after his death .
" It sounds like someone made Governor Perry mad , " his stepmother , Eugena Willingham , said after hearing the news during an interview with CNN at her home in Ardmore , Oklahoma .
" I think it 's going to delay things , " she added .
" It makes me wonder why . "
Neither Bassett nor Levy would say whether they believed political considerations were behind their replacement , though Bassett said in a written statement that the investigation should not be dropped " because there might be political ramifications . "
Bradley told CNN at the time of his appointment he did not believe it was meant to stall the Willingham probe .
" People tend to read into these things the kind of preconceived notions they come to these issues with , " Bradley said .
" They 're not going to change those positions overnight .
They 're going to watch how the commission does its work . "
He said if he does his job right , the commission will " probably satisfy most of those people . "
CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report .
All About Capital Punishment • Rick Perry • Texas
Schools have the ability to drastically reduce cheating among their students - all they need to do is follow the relatively simple and inexpensive solutions suggested by research .
" We know when kids cheat , why kids cheat and how kids cheat , " said Eric Anderman , a recognized expert on student cheating and professor of educational policy and leadership at Ohio State University .
" We know how to motivate kids so that they are much less likely to cheat .
The only problem is that what we know about reducing cheating often is n't put into practice in schools , " Anderman said .
Anderman discussed the latest research on cheating in schools and how to eliminate it during his presidential address August 8 at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Toronto .
Anderman is ending his term as president of APA 's Division of Educational Psychology .
There 's no doubt that cheating among students is widespread and has been growing .
In some studies , up to 80 percent of high - achieving high school students and 75 percent of college students admit to cheating , a percentage that has been rising the past 50 years .
In one study , Anderman and his colleagues found that 21 percent of students who say that cheating is " unacceptable " still engage in cheating behaviors .
" What we know for sure is that students cheat a lot , " Anderman said .
" Parents do n't think their kids will do it , but many do .
I 've seen that in my research , and also in the time I spent as a teacher . "
Studies have shown that boys cheat more than girls .
Students with high - driving " Type - A " personalities are more likely to cheat .
And there is little relationship between cheating and moral development , research shows .
New research by Anderman and his colleagues finds that students with impulsive tendencies are more likely cheat .
In two studies from 2004 , Anderman and his colleagues found that cheating also tends to increase when students make the transition from elementary school to middle school , and then again from middle school to high school .
That 's not surprising , he said .
" During those transitions , teachers start changing how they talk to students .
While earlier in school , teachers emphasize how learning is fun , as students get older teachers begin saying things like ' Now it 's serious .
Your grades matter . '
That 's directly related to cheating , " Anderman said .
Anderman said how teachers present the goals of learning in class is the key to reducing cheating .
But this is the knowledge that is rarely put into practice in classrooms .
Research has consistently shown that cheating is more likely to occur in classrooms that focus on performance - getting the best possible grades , doing the best on tests .
Cheating is less likely to occur when the goal for students is " personal mastery " of the material - in other words , learning and understanding what is being taught .
Federal mandates under " No Child Left Behind , " with its emphasis on test scores , send exactly the wrong message to students and teachers and actually encourage cheating , Anderman said .
" These standardized tests are n't going to go away , but we do n't have to talk about them in the classroom as the ultimate outcome and goal , " he said .
" This produces anxiety and stress in both teachers and students , and that 's what leads to cheating . "
Ironically , students may actually do better if the focus in classrooms was on personal mastery and not on the tests .
Students will learn better , remember the material longer , cheat less , and still do just as well , if not better , when they do standardized testing , according to Anderman .
Schools should work to help teachers change the goals in classrooms from test - taking to mastering the materials , and help them communicate effectively to their students .
" It does n't help when teachers always talk about ' the test ' and reminding students that something ' will be on the test . '
The goal should be learning , and not test - taking , " Anderman said .
" You can change the goal structure in classrooms .
If you change that , you will likely reduce cheating . "

Of those who are opposing health care reform , there are a few general groups :
There are those who are wary of any change in the status quo , even while they realize it is unsustainable ;
There are those who are misinformed on one aspect of the legislation or another – whether they think the plan is “ radical ” or that it has “ death panels ; ”
There are those who are opposed for partisan reasons – one of these is Senator Chuck Grassley who – though he is the key Republican whose support the Democrats are trying to win – admitted he would not support a bill he agreed with if enough Republicans did n’t support it with him ; others in this camp are – of course , Bill Kristol who advised Republicans to “ kill ” reform and Senator Jim DeMint who said he wanted to make health care reform Obama ’s “ Waterloo ; ” and
There are those are ideologically opposed – who are inciting much of the most extreme rhetoric about this issue .
The leadership promoting this – as Rachel Maddow aptly demonstrates – oppose and want to dismantle the programs most Americans support .
They consider Medicare and Social Security to be “ tyranny ” and “ creeping socialism ” and all those other buzzwords that they are now using against health care reform .
In this clip where Maddow confronts former congressmen , majority leader , and one of the major organizers of the tea parties and the anti-health reform activists , Dick Armey :
As Maddow said – it is a very important point .
Many of the Republicans participating in this national “ conversation ” are hiding their true beliefs .
Most Americans do not consider Medicare and Social Security to be “ tyranny . ”
Those who are inciting fears about health care reform do .

A variety of people have asked how the speed of my Lisp Fourier Transform Library compares to an FFI call to the FFTW Library .
I downloaded the FFTW Library , built it , and installed it .
Then , I tried to get someone else ’s FFI wrappers for the FFTW Library going .
I worked on this for two hours several weeks ago .
Today , I put almost an hour into it .
If it ’s going to get done , I ’m just going to have to write my own wrapper .
Here ’s the problem ….
package dependencies .
This would n’t be so much of a problem if all of the packages were in the Cliki and thus accessible to ASDF - Install .
Most of them are not .
To install fftw - ffi , I needed to install ch-image and clem .
One of those depended on ch-util .
That ( and fftw - ffi ) depended on ch-asdf .
That depended on smarkup .
Something there depended on cl- typesetting which depends on cl-pdf .
The ch- asdf also depended on cl- bibtex and ch-bib ( who knows why ?
or where to find it ? ) .
And , something in the above depended on cl-fad .
CL - FAD was the only one in that list that ASDF - Install could find on its own .
Several of the typesetting and PDF libraries along with the ch-image library did not build properly .
There was much reassuring ASDF - Install that everything was going to be okay even if there were no PGP signatures for half of this or if the PGP signatures did n’t jive with the owner of the website .
There was also much reassuring ASDF - Install that I wanted it to try to forge ahead even if it could n’t build cl - bibtex for me .
I could n’t find a list of projects supported by clbuild , so I went to build darcs to fetch clbuild .
Did you know darcs needs the GNU Multi-precision Library ?
I ’m assuming it uses its own hashing functions that want big integers or something , but I was n’t really expecting all of that .
So , after a half hour getting clbuild , it knows nothing about fftw - ffi .
Alright , maybe I managed to get enough stuff installed that I can just load fftw - ffi now ?
No dice .
The fftw - ffi seems to have been generated with some tool that spits out an XML file and a corresponding C file .
Then , it tries to use special ASDF tricks to get the C file compiled .
Alas , these blow up on me .

Japan 's premier - in - waiting Yukio Hatoyama ( not pictured ) and his wife Miyuki pose for the media after casting their absentee ballots at a polling station in Tokyo August 26 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Kim Kyung - Hoon
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s next prime minister might be nicknamed “ the alien , ” but it ’s his wife who claims to have had a close encounter with another world .
“ While my body was asleep , I think my soul rode on a triangular - shaped UFO and went to Venus , ” Miyuki Hatoyama , the wife of premier - in - waiting Yukio Hatoyama , wrote in a book published last year .
“ It was a very beautiful place and it was really green . ”
Yukio Hatoyama is due to be voted in as premier on September 16 following his party ’s crushing election victory over the long - ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Sunday .
Miyuki , 66 , described the extraterrestrial experience , which she said took place some 20 years ago , in a book entitled “ Very Strange Things I ’ve Encountered . ”
When she awoke , Japan ’s next first lady wrote , she told her now ex-husband that she had just been to Venus .
He advised her that it was probably just a dream .
“ My current husband has a different way of thinking , ” she wrote .
“ He would surely say ‘ Oh , that ’s great ’ . ”
Yukio Hatoyama , 62 , the rich grandson of a former prime minister , was once nicknamed “ the alien ” for his prominent eyes .
Miyuki , also known for her culinary skills , spent six years acting in the Takarazuka Revue , an all - female musical theater group .
She met the U.S. - educated Yukio while living in America .
Welcome to the Elementary Particle Explorer , designed and written by Garrett Lisi Troy Gardner , and Greg Little Every known elementary particle is identified by its charges with respect to the electromagnetic , weak , strong , and gravitational forces .
Electrons have electric charge - 1 , up quarks 2/3 , down quarks - 1/3 , and neutrinos 0 , with antiparticles having opposite electric charges .
In the Standard Model these electric charges are a combination of the particles ' hypercharge , Y , and weak charge , W. The Elementary Particle Explorer ( EPE ) allows you to rotate in charge space ( by dragging the image ) , showing the charges of all known particles .
Click on them to see how they are allowed to interact , according to charge conservation .
These charges correspond to the geometry of Lie groups , and unified models of particle physics correspond to how the Lie groups of the Standard Model and gravity embed in larger Lie groups , up to the largest simple exceptional Lie group , E8 .
This geometry of unification is described in a recent Scientific American article and on Wikipedia , a good place to keep up with developments .
We are happy to announce that E8 Theory T - Shirts are now available from physics student Blondegeek .
Marauding Monkeys Pelt Vehicles on Interstate Motorists Report Fruit Attacks on Busy Virginia Highway September 22 , 2000 By Richard Zitrin JARRATT , Va. ( APBnews.com ) -- State Trooper Mike Scott has patrolled heavily traveled Interstate 95 in southern Virginia for two years and he thought he had seen it all .
Now , Scott figures , he has seen it all -- including monkeys in a tree pelting passing vehicles with fruit .
The trooper 's close encounter with three monkeys on the loose occurred Sunday morning , when he was driving along I -95 and came across a car pulled over on the shoulder of the road , state police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said .
' He just started laughing '
As he walked to the car , Scott saw what appeared to be a banana smashed against the rear window .
He noticed the driver , a woman from Pennsylvania , had a grin on her face and a cellular telephone in her hand .
" You know , I was just about to call you guys , but I did n't think the dispatcher would believe me , " she reportedly told Scott .
" You 're going to think I 'm crazy , but I think two monkeys just threw a banana at my car . "
The woman , who identified herself as a paleontologist , said she was sure the animals she had seen were monkeys .
" The trooper said he could n't help it , but he just started laughing , " Geller told APBnews.com today .
" He said he 'll never laugh at anyone again after this . "
Crabapples flung from trees Scott returned to the area where the woman said her car had been hit with a banana and the trooper found two other vehicles -- a van and a car -- on the side of the road .
A man in one of the vehicles told Scott a monkey had thrown an apple at his car .
As the trooper listened , a crabapple dropped from a tree and hit the van .
" He looked up and , sure enough , there were a bunch of monkeys , three of them , in a tree , " Geller said .
" They were 2 - or 3 - feet tall , slender , brownish - gray .
He said they reminded him of the organ - grinder monkeys . "
Soon after , the three monkeys scampered down the tree and across the interstate to the opposite side .
No reports of missing simians Scott and another trooper followed the monkeys as they swung from trees along I - 95 until they disappeared into woods , Geller said .
They have not been seen since , and there have been no reports of monkeys missing in southern Virginia or nearby northern North Carolina , Geller said .
Police theorized the monkeys might have been traveling with someone to the state fair in Richmond , which is about 60 miles north of here , but no one there apparently has lost such animals , she said .
' I suspect they 'll show up again '
The three monkeys likely are capuchins that were someone 's pets , said Metro Richmond Zoo Director Jim Andelin .
Capuchins are highly intelligent , and some are trained to assist people with disabilities , he said .
The monkeys last seen Sunday along I - 95 probably could find enough vegetation to cope on their own until the winter , he said .
They would not be able to live through the winter without human care , Andelin said .
The three monkeys probably will eventually seek out people because they are not accustomed to fending for themselves , he said .
" I suspect that they 'll show up again somewhere , " Andelin said .

A confidential memo from one of the most secretive panels in Congress was leaked on a peer - to - peer file - sharing network , publicly detailing sensitive probes involving more than 30 lawmakers and aides .
The release of the report was jarring enough that Zoe Lofgren , chairman of the House ethics committee , interrupted a series of House votes to alert lawmakers to the breach .
The July document revealed a laundry list of ethics inquiries looking into possible corporate and defense industry influence peddling , according to The Washington Post , which obtained a copy .
The 22 - page report was freely available on an unnamed file - sharing network after a junior staff member working from home stored it on a computer equipped with P2P software , according to a statement ( PDF ) released Thursday night .
Lawmakers and staffers are required to protect the confidentiality of all sensitive information .
The employee no longer works for the committee .
In July , the same month the confidential memo was prepared , a separate House committee held hearings on whether federal laws were needed to protect federal employees from accidental file sharing .
Legislators have grown so worried about inadvertent leaking of documents over P2P networks they 've considered draconian bills that could render entire web browsers and operating systems illegal .
The confidential ethics report discussed inquiries into potential wrongdoing by representatives including Charles Rangel , Jane Harman , Maxine Waters and Laura Richardson . ®

The Senate Finance Committee will take up the Rockefeller and Schumer amendments which were supposed to have been debated today , on Tuesday .
The reasons for the delay are unclear , but it gives us a few more days to impress upon those Democratic Senators who have n't been as helpful on creating real , comprehensive reform .
As of now , we know of three public option amendments that will be offered .
The first is from Rockefeller , and it fairly closely follows the public option House version , which is stronger than the Senate HELP version .
The other two are from Schumer , one that would add the same language as is in the HELP bill , and one that would create a " level playing field " option , thhe weakest of the three amendments .
Make no mistake , the public option in this committee is facing an uphill climb .
But it 's not impossible .
The second Schumer amendment is likely the only one that has much of a chance of making it out of commitee .
If it should , and if all three of these amendments get at least majority support among committee members , the chances of the public option making it into the final bill out of the Senate are significantly increased .
So an action effort on this is worth our while .
Jane has been in touch with Hill sources , and reports on the usual suspects of Dems on the committee .
Max Baucus -- has said he supports a public plan , despite the fact that his bill does n't contain one .
Bill Nelson -- acknowledges that a public option would address lack of competition in the health care industry , but said he was against it , then he was " open " to it , and most recently says it must be subject to triggers .
Bill Nelson -- says emerging public option is " attractive . "
Kent Conrad --
Has always said that " there are n't enough votes for a public option , " but would n't say if he was one of them .
Told Ezra Klein today he would only be open to one that was n't tied to Medicare rates -- which Schumer 's " level playing field " is n't .
Blanche Lincoln -- said in July that a public insurance option should be included in any health care bill , but since then has changed her position like some people change their hair color .
Tom Carper -- thinks the job of the Senate Finance Committee is to honor back room deals with PhRMA .
Wo n't say how he feels about a public option .
There are 13 Democrats and 10 Republicans on the committee , which means they can only lose two Democratic votes and still pass the amendment .
So , in order for a public plan to come out of Finance , three of these are going to have to get off the fence .
Contacting these , and all of the Dem members of the committee would be worth our while .
It would help to remind them of a few factors :
The CBO scoring of the House bill shows an additional $ 85 billion in savings over the Blue Dog version : the public option will save money and bend that cost curve .
The public option remains popular with majorities of Americans .
The public option is popular with swing state voters .
In national polling , voters oppose a mandate to purchase private insurance by 64 % to 34 % but support a mandate with a choice of private or public insurance by 60 % to 37 % .
Contact info for all of them is below the fold .
The focus should be on those five Jane identified : Baucus , Nelson , Conrad , Lincoln , and Carper .
But if you live in any of the states represented by the Senators below , calls to them certainly wo n't hurt , as well as " thank you " calls to Rockefeller and Schumer , in particular , for their efforts .
Mr. Thomas Biskup , founder of Quinscape and outstanding developer from the middle ages of roguelike development ( the nineties ) , the creator of ADoM and the dreamer behind JADE , is a tough one to catch …

Click here to read a 2004 interview with Letts on the BBC Doctor Who website .
Updated 13th October
, producer ofthrough one of its most fondly - remembered periods withas the Third Doctor from 1970 to 1974 , has died at the age of eighty - four .
Previously an actor , Letts moved behind the camera in the 1960s , finding work as a director on several programmes for BBC television .
He first worked on Doctor Who as director of the 1968serial Enemy of the World , before accepting the job of producer during production Jon Pertwee 's first season , in 1969 .
Working closely in association with script editor , Letts oversaw the creative direction and production of the programme for the following five seasons .
In addition to his producing role , Letts also directed several serials during his time in charge of the programme - Terror of the Autons Carnival of Monsters and Planet of the Spiders .
He also handled much of the direction for Inferno after Douglas Camfield was taken ill , and after leaving the series as producer he directed The Android Invasion for his successor , Philip Hinchcliffe .
He also co-wrote The Daemons with Robert Sloman ( under the pseudonym ' Guy Leopold ' ) and worked closely with Sloman on the writer 's other scripts for the programme .
Letts ' legacy to the programme included the creation of the character , played byon the BBC to this day , and the decision to castas the Fourth Doctor .
The latter was a decision for which Tom Baker was always ready to express immense gratitude , as when Letts appeared on his episode of " This is Your Life " in the year 2000 .
Letts remained fond of and connected with the series right up until his death .
When producer Graham Williams broke his leg during production of season 16 in 1978 Letts helped to keep an eye on the series , and more officially he served as Executive Producer in 1980 , overseeing the inexperienced John Nathan - Turner 's first season in charge of the programme .
For many years thereafter Letts also penned novels , novelisations and radio serials connected to the programme .
He also appeared on DVD commentaries and in various documentaries .
He also gained extensive credits outside of Doctor Who , most notably as producer of the BBC's " Classic Serial " strand during the late 1970s and early 1980s .
In this role he produced many acclaimed and award - winning adaptations of classic novels , including " Great Expectations " , " Alice in Wonderland " and " Jane Eyre " .
Later , he directed episodes for the soap opera " EastEnders " .
The Guardian has published an obituary , describing Barry Letts ' varied career and impact on Doctor Who .
Long ago humans pioneered some very powerful innovations , innovations that have allowed us to grow in capability much faster than the rest of nature .
As humans grew more capable , we learned to live in more kinds of places , and to use more of the plants and animals in each place .
We did n’t always destroy non -human living nature – sometimes we converted it to farms , pets , or parks .
But we only left nature alone when we could n’t figure out how to make use of it , or of what it used .
Our expanded use of nature has left less for other species , often leading to their extinction .
This trend has continued in recent times : as we learn more ways to use nature , we use nature more .
There has been , however , one notable exception : rising wages over the last few hundred years have made us abandon some old practices .
For example , during the depression my grandparents farmed marginal land in Kentucky that is now forest .
We still know how to farm the land , and with free immigration it would still be farmed , but as it is labor is too expensive for farming .
This reprieve wo n’t last .
Wages have risen because economic growth rates have outpaced feasible rates of growing well - trained people .
But current growth rates simply cannot continue at familiar levels for ten thousand more years .
We ’ll eventually learn everything worth knowing about how to arrange atoms , and growth in available atoms will be limited by the speed of light .
So over this timescale growth rates simply must fall below feasible population growth rates .
( I actually expect a new brain emulation tech to allow very fast population growth in a century or two , but this is tangential to my argument here . )
With familiar competitive habits , this growth rate change implies falling wages for intelligent labor , canceling nature ’s recent high - wage reprieve .
So if we continue to use all the nature our abilities allow , abilities growing much faster than nature ’s abilities to resist us , within ten thousand years at most ( and more likely a few centuries ) we ’ll use pretty much all of nature , with only farms , pets and ( economically ) small parks remaining .
If we keep growing competitively , nature is doomed .
Of course we ’ll still need some functioning ecosystems to support farming a while longer , until we learn how to make food without farms , or bodies using simpler fuels .
Hopefully we ’ll assimilate most innovations worth digging out of nature , and deep underground single cell life will probably last the longest .
But these may be cold comfort to most nature lovers .
Yes , nature would be saved if we destroy ourselves without destroying nature in the process , but hopefully we ’ll avoid this scenario .
We might also somehow coordinate to prevent competitive growth .
For example , we might empower a world government to protect nature , prevent innovation , or prevent population growth .
But I honestly see little prospect of this .
We now live in a very competitive world , and even governments mainly just redirect competition , toward controlling those governments .
We like nature , but are n’t really willing to pay the price it would take to save most of it .
Nature than cannot survive as farms , pets , or small parks , is doomed .

ベストな施術を受けるには 岐阜には整体院はたくさんありますが、どこを訪れても、同じような効果を得られるわけではありません。それは、それぞれの整体院にいる施術者の技術力がまったく異なるからです。したがって、技術力がない方に施術を受けてしまうと、身体のつらさや痛みをまったく解消してもらえない可能性があります。保険が使えないため、そこそこの費用を支払うことになるのですから、お金を払った分はしっかりと身体を楽にしてくれる施術者がいる整体院を選びましょう。
技術力がバラバラの理由 『整体師の資格を取得しているのだから、技術力に大きな差があるわけはない』と考える方もいるでしょう。しかし、整体師の資格は民間資格で、種類はいろいろとあって、簡単に取得できるものも存在しています。つまり、整体師だからといって、誰もが同じことを学んでいるわけではないため、技術力がバラバラになるのです。岐阜にある数多くの整体院の中からベストなところに通いたいのなら、しっかり評判を調べて、技術力の高さを確認してから通い始めましょう。
得意とする施術がある 整体院によって得意とする施術があるので、不調の原因がはっきりとしているのなら、選定するときは気を付けましょう。それは、腰の痛みを得意とするところもあれば、首の痛みを得意とする整体院だってあるからです。なかにはリラクゼーションを得意とする場合もあるため、自分の悩みに対応したところを探しましょう。岐阜ならば、さまざまな整体院があるので、きちんと調べればつらさや痛みを緩和してくれるところが見つかるはずです。

We met Velvet at an annual gathering of a few thousand witches , druids , heathen , and magick - workers known as Heartland .
Velvet was her magick name , and as such it was all we called her for the three days we spent with her and her coven on the campgrounds of Heartland .
Heartland is in Kansas , an hour north of Kansas City , and despite the buzz of small - engine airplanes overhead — muggles with binoculars spying on naked pagans — the witches and the Christians and the Harley - Davidson bikers in the area all seemed to get along .
Not so in the small town from whence Velvet came .
Velvet was a young mother , but she had n’t been able to bring her daughter with her .
The local judge had awarded custody to her born - again Christian aunt and uncle , on the grounds that Velvet was , in the court ’s view , a Satanist .
Velvet scoffed .
“ As if I ’d ever be a Luciferian , ” she said .
“ They ’re dirty . ”
In fact , Velvet was an “ elf - witch . ”
This is not to say that she was an elf , since , as she pointed out , elves are imaginary .
We asked her to explain the difference .
KtB : How did you become an elf - witch ?
Velvet : I heard about it and thought , yeah , right , this is just some Dungeon and Dragons freak ’s odd little idea .
[ But ] the person who told me about it , I met her grandmother , who taught it to her and had a Book of Shadows [ spell book ] from her great grandmother .
So I studied druidic magick for two years , two years of shamanic magick , two years of Egyptian magick , two years of old Wiccan .
Elf magick is different than a lot of what you see [ amongst ordinary Wiccans ] .
Instead of four elements , it has six , seven elements .
It adds Shadow , Depth , and Reflection to the list of elements .
KtB : Is that the only difference ?
Velvet : Elven magick has rules against ingesting manufactured food , processed food .
KtB : Because elves do n’t do that ?
Velvet : Yeah , exactly .
No , I ’m kidding .
Elves are nature spirits .
Theoretical elementals .
You will never see the little guys with the pointy ears .
Pointy ears are a genetic defect .
I know people with them .
I know people with very fine bone structure and pointy ears .
They are not elven .
KtB : From what we ’ve heard , people do claim to be elves .
And trolls , and dragons …
Velvet :
Oh , shoot , go to Denver , man !
There ’s an entire little clan of people there who all claim they ’re elves and trolls .
And you ’re goin’ 
“ You ’re all cracked . ” I do elven magic .
But I do n’t claim to be an elf .
They do n’t either .
They say they were “ bred ” from elves — those little non-existent beings that run around ?
KtB : Non-existent ?
Velvet :
Well , mythical , I should say .
I ca n’t tell you if they exist or not .
I have never personally seen an actual elf .
I ’ll give that they might have existed , just like I ’ll give that unicorns existed and any other mythical , quote unquote , beast , dragons , may have existed .
But if an elf walked up to me during a ritual , it would n’t make my ritual any stronger or weaker .
It would just be rather odd .
Because I ’d have an elf .
Amusing , maybe , but not important .
It ’s just a name .
It seemed to connect me with everything more than what any of the other [ magicks ]
I ’d tried did .
There ’s a list of elven gods this long , but I do n’t even worship ’em .
I worship Hecate and Loki .
Hecate and Loki are both “ dark deities . ” I hate that term .
The deal is they teach really hard lessons .
And , they ’re not lessons you want to learn .
People want [ magick ] to be all set out in flowers and rainbows .
And life is not all flowers and rainbows .
I ’m sorry .
Neither is it all death and such , but people do n’t even want to face that .
Loki has a tendency to teach by playing a trick , and once you pick up on it , you go , “ You know , I should ’ve known that .
That was stupid . ”
Hecate is more of the opinion of , “ Smack , ok you ’re in this situation , now get out of it .
Yup , you got out of it .
Ok , you learned something , didnt ’cha ? ”
The way I came to follow Loki in the first place was , I was in a ritual down at Herne ’s Hollow .
A men ’s ritual .
KtB : The men had no problem with that ?
Velvet :
Well , they started too , but — it was actually kind of amusing — I bet one guy twenty bucks that Loki would show up when we called him even if I was down there .
And I won twenty bucks .
I also went to sleep down at Herne ’s Hollow , and I had this dream about a coyote coming and taking off this one ring I was wearing and leaving another ring .
Well , I woke up and I found the exact same ring I saw in my dream sitting at my feet .
Well , I switched it out with the one on my hand .
I wore that ring for like six months .
That was a cracked six months , lemme tell ya .
Most people do n’t even know anything about Loki other than he ’s a trickster god .
Which he is .
But they do n’t know anything about it .
After Ragnarok [ Norse mythological apocalypse ] he ’s going to be one of the two gods remaining .
KtB : Who ’s the other ?
Velvet : Odin .
And he wo n’t really be alive .
Ragnarok repeats , unlike the [ Christian ] apocalypse , which happens only once .
Ragnarok repeats itself .
It ’s a renewal cycle .
Odin will technically be dead but he can be brought back .
KtB : Does n’t
Thor beat up on Loki a lot ?
Velvet : Yep .
Thor has a big hammer .
If I were Loki I ’d be scared of that big hammer too .
But if you look at all that [ Thor thuggery ] , somebody learned something out of all that , too .
KtB : How does
Thor teach ?
Velvet : Whap !
Learn it .
Talk to a worshipper of Thor .
Those are n’t subtle lessons .
KtB : We ’ve seen some guys walking around with big hammers .
Velvet : Thor worshippers .
KtB : What did Loki look like when you saw him ?
Velvet :
He looked solid .
You could reach out and touch him .
Little old guy .
Really skinny , hunched over .
Long beard .
I was just going , wow .
A God . Like manifested .
After six months of wearing that ring [ from Loki ] , I ’d start thinking about what I was doing before I ’d do it .
It made me a considerably better person .
I do n’t have nearly as much tendency to yap when I should n’t .
I lost the ring , but I continue to worship him , because he taught me a lot .
Hecate has been more of a long , ongoing thing .
I ’ve worshipped her on and off since I first started being pagan .
She was the first goddess I ever had any interest in .
She is the crone [ senior ] form of the triple goddess .
Mother , Maiden , Crone .
I am not a crone .
I actually chose her because she ’s the only one I feel any connection to .
The Maiden is too happy and innocent and bouncy .
That ’s not me .
It ’s me out here [ at the pagan gathering ] , but it ’s not me in normal life .
My normal life is n’t happy and bouncy , and it just does n’t work to try to be that way .
I ’m a goth , ok ?
Goths are not happy , bouncy .
That would be just disgusting and wrong .
Funny , but disgusting and wrong .
Velvet takes around the lake to see “ The Venus Mound , ” a ritual area for female pagans .
Velvet :
The goddess gathering happens here .
Over at Herne ’s Hollow , it has a very male presence to it .
This is a lighter , airier , female - type energy .
It ’s an altar for the goddesses .
Plus it ’s just a place females can come and sit .
The men who are comfortable down here wo n’t mess with the females .
[ Velvet steps , barefoot , on a thorn . ]
Of course , then we have the spiky tree next to the chair .
Locust tree .
Spikes fall off .
I step on ’em all the time .
There ’s some mythos that locust trees are acquainted with females , though I do n’t understand because usually this little pointy thing they have going on is not equated with females .
[ Wind chimes chime , Velvet rolls her eyes . ]
Females like wind chimes .
They react with air .
Air is a female element .
Air and water are female , earth and fire are male — no , wrong .
I ’m talking elven .
Wrooong mythos .
Typical .
Um , earth and air are female .
Water and fire and male .
I do n’t know why .
We walk up onto a small hill .
Velvet : There ’s a Venus statue .
Venus the goddess .
The hinges around it are offerings left .
They do n’t necessarily have any particularly meaning to other than who left them .
If you rummaged through the grass , you could probably find a $ 1.50 worth of pennies .
Because people that do n’t have a personal item to give , will give just something .
I personally do n’t like leaving money .
I do n’t have a problem with the penny thing , but silver is tacky .
I think it ’s like trying to buy off the goddess .
I have an issue with that .
I do n’t leave offerings to Venus .
Venus is a goddess of love .
It ’s just not my deal .
I usually leave stuff over at the generic altar .
Do I see anything I have left here in the past ?
I ’m looking .
There .
My little beaded keychain .
It was all I had on me .
I wanted to leave something , and I had a sarong and a keychain .
So Hecate got a piece of keychain .
She could n’t have the whole keychain , because I would have had to take it off the key .
And it was the key to my house .
I was n’t asking anything .
I generally leave offerings as , “ Hey I still acknowledge you . ”
Because I do n’t have a tendency to ask for much of anything from anybody .
People come up here and sit and talk to the goddesses for just hours .
And say prayers .
I ’ve seen people do rituals up on the mound .
I do n’t , because I ’m of the opinion it ties up the mound , and I can pray to my goddess down there as well as I can up here .
Pray to my goddess down there , leave my offering here , and go do whatever it is I ’m doing that day .
As far as I ’m concerned an offering is an offering .
Leaving an offering here , it makes people feel they ’re going to be recognized .
I ’m not of that opinion .
I think if the goddess is going to care , she ’s going to care wherever you leave it .
The only reason I come out here to leave offerings is I feel power here .
Same with Herne ’s Hollow .
I come out here and do a ritual to Hecate and go over there and do a ritual to Loki .
It ’s what I do .
I wo n’t demonstrate now because I do n’t want Loki now .
Nooo Loki .
A mouse runs over her foot .
Running in circles around us , like it ’s trying to tell us something .
KtB : Maybe it ’s Loki .
Velvet : Uh-uh .
It ’s hawk food .

Kashiwa Mystery Cafe
So , we 're in Japan , and we 've just stepped off the train in Kashiwa , a very nice town in Chiba which also happens to be the home of Panic 's Japanese HQ , which itself happens to be essentially a cozy apartment , which reminds me of Panic USA 1.0 , except Noby and Kenichi do n't live in the apartment , and the apartment is in Japan .
Anyway .
Noby was n't there yet , so we wandered around the station a little bit , enjoying the good weather and banking on Cabel 's First Rule of Japan : if you wander around anywhere in Japan for a little bit , you will come across something interesting .
( This is also Cabel 's First Rule of Everything . )
So we came across something interesting :
... which despite have a semi-unfortunate acronym , was a collection of elegant , architecturally - cool buildings , possibly part of a temporary exhibition to excite the citizens of Kashiwa , with a nice wooden deck with some inviting café tables .
We sat down to catch a break .
A few seconds later , I heard some halted English coming from my left .
" Hello !
Please come here ! "
This was unusual for Japan , because although most Japanese city centers seemed to be filled with hundreds of unregulated and overdriven speakers , I 've rarely , if ever , been beckoned in English and in person .
It caught me off guard .
I wandered over .
The cashier fumbled for the right words .
" Please ... buy something ! "
OK , this was confusing , because up until this point nobody in Japan has ever outright asked — let alone strongly suggested — I buy anything , ever .
In some regions of China , for example , it 's normal to be followed for blocks by plucky street vendors , with sooty caps and using the Chinese word for " guv' nor " ( 省长 ) , trying to sell the hapless tourist genuine 24 k goldique watches , small angry turtles , expired pudding , Steely Dan CD - R's , and the like .
But simply does n't happen in Japan — just like it also probably does n't happen in China either because I 've never been there and this entire paragraph is based only on bad movies and stereotypes .
While I was a little uncomfortable , I did n't want to be rude .
I grabbed a café menu , quickly translated some Katakana ( you 'll get surprisingly far in Japan by learning this phonetic alphabet ! ) , and found something I kind - of almost .. but not really .. wanted .
" I 'll take an orange juice , please , " I explained , in poor Japanese .
" Hai ! " , was the eager response .
A few moments later , I picked up my orange juice .
Except it was n't an orange juice .
It was an apple drink called " Appletizer " , some weird candy , and a little card .
Yeah .
Now I was confused .
The guys behind the counter and I immediately launched into a humorous , protracted , Englishanese attempt to understand what the hell just happened .
Through judicious fumbling , and after a great deal of precise hand - waving and mangled pronouns , it turned out to be something like this :
At this cafe , you get what the person before you ordered .
The next person gets what you ordered .
Welcome to the Ogori cafe !
As I sat down to enjoy my surprise Appletizer , loving this insane idea and wondering what would happen if you tried it in America , a Japanese woman approached the cafe .
Since she could actually speak Japanese , she could read the large sign at the front and , fortunately or unfortunately , got advanced warning of what she was in for .
Before making a final decision on what to order , she quietly snuck up to me to try to ask me what I had ordered , knowing that it would be her unwavering refreshment destiny .
The staff put a quick stop to her trickery , and I did n't answer .
Of course , regardless of what she ordered , she got the orange juice I ordered a few minutes earlier .
But here 's one of the moments that make this experiment cool : she actually chose orange juice , just like I did .
So she got what she wanted .
Ogori cafe synchronicity !
Before we left , there was one last thing hat had to be done .
Mike went up to the cafe , slapped down a couple thousand yen ( ~ $ 25 ) , and ordered a little bit of everything : some ice cream , some snacks , some candy , some drinks , a Japanese horn - of - mysterious - plenty intentionally set up as a shocking surprise for the next lucky customer .
( After his order , Mike received single iced coffee . )
As we walked away from the cafe , with just the right amount of delay , we heard an extremely excited " arigato goazimasu !!
thank you so much !! " yelled in our direction , from an ecstatic mom and her equally excited young son .
They truly appreciated the surprise .
It was so worth it .
For the record , here are the rules of the Ogori cafe :
Let 's treat the next person .
What to treat them with ?
It 's your choice .
Even if it 's a group of friends or a family , please form a single - file line .
Also , you can't buy twice in a row .
Please enjoy what you get , even if you hate it .
( If you really , really hate it , let 's quietly give it to another while saying , " It 's my treat … " )
Let 's say " Thank You ! ( Gochihosama ) " if you find the person with your Ogori cafe card .
We can't issue a receipt .
The Ogori cafe was an unforgettable travel moment , and an idea that has stuck with me :
It was a complete surprise in our day .
It encouraged communication between total strangers or , in this case , members of the Kashiwa community and a couple of weird guys from Oregon .
It forced one to " let go " , just for a brief moment , of the total control we 're so used to exerting through commerce .
It led you to taste something new , that you might not normally have ordered .
It was a delight .
Then , according to Noby , as quickly as it appeared , the Ogori cafe was gone .

William Brooks said he ’s angry that rescue workers did not move fast enough to find his son after he fell into a fast moving - creek in Delaware County Saturday night .
Investigators said Nick Brooks , 26 , was drinking with relatives and a friend when he apparently slipped and fell into Darby Creek in Montgomery Park around 10 p.m .
William Brooks said he raced to the creek with a friend but found no rescue workers in the water looking for his son .
“ Nobody was doing anything , nobody was in the water .
So I took it upon myself .
I saw which way the current was going and I went down like 100 yards and went it , ” said Brooks .
When he got out of the water police arrested and charged Brooks and his friend , James Deveney , with obstructing a search .
Nick Brooks ’ body was recovered in Darby Creek Sunday afternoon nearly 14 hours after he fell in , according to police .
But it is where his son ’s body was recovered that William Brooks said will haunt him for the rest of his life .
“ He was found in the spot where I was searching and they stopped me , " said Brooks .
Police said rescue boats from four fire departments and the Chester police department 's dive team searched until 4 a.m. without success .
The search resumed at 6 a.m. , and authorities said a rescue boat found Brooks ’ body at 12:20 p.m. about 100 yards downstream from where he fell in .
The Delaware County medical examiner has not confirmed the cause of death .

We have often talked here about the American gulag -- not the far - flung prisons and " intense interrogation " chambers of the global militarist empire , where tens of thousands of captives languish , often without the slightest pretense of even a modicum of rights or legal process -- but the countless human holding pens that glut the highways and byways of the sacred Homeland itself , where not thousands but literally millions of people are incarcerated in a brutal system of retribution , abuse and moral atrocity : a system increasingly geared to corporate profit ; a seedbed and training ground for gangs and extremists ; a breaker and stigmatizer of generation after generation of Americans .
Yes , once again , the latest annual rankings of the world 's prison population are in , and , once again , 2008 found the good old US of A the winners by a country mile .
No other nation in the world comes close to imprisoning more of its own people -- not in terms of raw numbers or by proportion of the population .
As the Economist reports , the United States now has some 2,300,000 of its citizens behind bars -- or a whopping 756 out of every 100,000 people .
China is the closest in sheer numbers , with 1,600,000 people locked up ; but that 's in a population more than four times larger than the United States , and in a state that is unashamedly authoritarian , as opposed to the incessantly self - proclaimed " land of the free . "
The closest competitor in proportion of caged citizens is Russia , with 629 per 100,000 , and a hefty 800,000 + behind bars .
After these three " great powers , " the numbers drop off considerably .
No one can even make half a million , not even teeming Brazil or even - more teeming India , which incarcerates a mere 33 out of every 100,000 of its people .
Iran -- which as we know is the center of all demonic Islamofascist terrorist barbarian evil in the whole wide world -- does n't even have 200,000 of its people locked up .
It goes without saying that effete hellholes like France or Spain or Germany or Sweden or Canada do n't even make the Economist 's list of the Top 14 .
Nor does any nation in Africa -- with the exception of South Africa , with its long , proud lineage of colonial jurisprudence .
( Even so , the South Africans are pikers compared to the Great Powers -- although they are ahead of Iran . )
Nor does Burma , North Korea , Sudan -- or any Arab country -- make the list .
It is truly astonishing that any nation that dares call itself " civilized " would have such a sweeping , punitive prison system .
But this is just one of many shocking facts that no longer trouble the American conscience , which has been both deliberately and incidentally deadened by decades of empire , aggression , brutality and lies .
It is also the mark of a deeply racist culture that has sought -- again both deliberately and unconsciously -- to punish , repress and break vast swathes of its own population : namely , its African - American citizens , the descendants of the people the nation once enslaved .
( Can it be any accident that the first black president of the United States is not only half - white , but is also not descended from American slaves ?
He is not really , you see , one of them : those dark Others who have lived among us for so long as repositories for the white folks ' guilt and fears . )
The viral growth of the American punishment system is , of course , a hardy perennial for the very , very few people who give even the slightest damn about it .
As I said , I 've written about it for several years , as the new annual stats issue forth .
Last year , Arthur Silber trained his considerable firepower on the subject , when a study revealed that not only were one in every 100 American adults now behind bars , but one out of every nine black males between the ages of 20 and 34 are now incarcerated .
Silber noted the fact that " a high proportion of prisoners are non-violent drug offenders , " and went on to say :
You see , in the liberty - loving United States of America , your body does not belong to you .
Surrender your delusion that you are an autonomous being , free to choose what to ingest for sustenance or entertainment .
It is of no moment that you do not violate anyone else 's rights .
What matters is that you recognize your body belongs to the state .
If you fail to follow the state 's edicts as to how you must treat your body , off to prison you will go .
All of this is trebly true if you are such a miserable being as to have failed to be born into the privileged class -- that is to say , if you are not affluent , white and male .
( With regard to distinct but related issues , women obviously are also such miserable beings . )
We must note one further fact of immense significance .
As I discussed in several essays from a few years ago , the prison system in the United States represents nothing less than the institutionalization of brutality and torture on a vast scale .
( See " ' They Don't Represent America ' ?
Not Quite , Mr. President , " " The Real Scandal , " and the other essays listed here under the heading , " About Prison Abuse and Torture in the U.S. , and in Iraq . " )
That system embodies the depravity and degradation of extreme cruelty to a degree that is close to ungraspable , and it corrupts everyone who works in it , as it corrupts our nation .
When is the last time you heard the horrors of the U.S. prison system -- including not only the non-crimes for which hundreds of thousands are incarcerated , but the cruelties that are inflicted on them when they are unjustly imprisoned -- debated seriously and at length by our major politicians , including the leading candidates for president ?
That 's right : you can't remember , because it does n't happen .
You should read the whole piece , and the links to the abovementioned essays , which you will find in the original post .
Earlier this year we ran a long , detailed piece on how the private profits of an elite , politically connected few are helping drive the continued explosion in the American prison population .
The piece centered on the long - running garden - variety corruption and backroom grease of one Lamar Alexander -- the feckless frat boy and Bush family factotum who now disgraces the state of Tennessee as its " senior U.S. senator . "
This article was apparently eaten in the latest hack job on this blog , but you can find it at one of our affiliated sites , Pacific Free Press : Prisons , Profits , and the Banality of Evil .
Lamar was instrumental in the founding of the private prison industry , with his lucrative presence as the creation of the Corrections Corporation of America .
But here I want to focus on some of the general background info from that earlier essay , taken from an analysis of America 's private prisons by Global Research :
Private prisons are the biggest business in the prison industry complex .
About 18 corporations guard 10,000 prisoners in 27 states .
The two largest are Correctional Corporation of America ( CCA ) and Wackenhut , which together control 75 % .
Private prisons receive a guaranteed amount of money for each prisoner , independent of what it costs to maintain each one .
According to Russell Boraas , a private prison administrator in Virginia , " the secret to low operating costs is having a minimal number of guards for the maximum number of prisoners . "
The CCA has an ultra-modern prison in Lawrenceville , Virginia , where five guards on dayshift and two at night watch over 750 prisoners .
In these prisons , inmates may get their sentences reduced for " good behavior , " but for any infraction , they get 30 days added - which means more profits for CCA .
According to a study of New Mexico prisons , it was found that CCA inmates lost " good behavior time " at a rate eight times higher than those in state prisons ....
Who is investing ?
At least 37 states have legalized the contracting of prison labor by private corporations that mount their operations inside state prisons .
The list of such companies contains the cream of U.S. corporate society : IBM , Boeing , Motorola , Microsoft , AT&T , Wireless , Texas Instrument , Dell , Compaq , Honeywell , Hewlett - Packard , Nortel , Lucent Technologies , 3Com , Intel , Northern Telecom , TWA , Nordstrom's , Revlon , Macy's , Pierre Cardin , Target Stores , and many more .
All of these businesses are excited about the economic boom generation by prison labor .
Just between 1980 and 1994 , profits went up from $ 392 million to $ 1.31 billion .
Inmates in state penitentiaries generally receive the minimum wage for their work , but not all ; in Colorado , they get about $ 2 per hour , well under the minimum .
And in privately - run prisons , they receive as little as 17 cents per hour for a maximum of six hours a day , the equivalent of $ 20 per month .
The highest - paying private prison is CCA in Tennessee , where prisoners receive 50 cents per hour for what they call " highly skilled positions . "
.... Thanks to prison labor , the United States is once again an attractive location for investment in work that was designed for Third World labor markets .
A company that operated a maquiladora ( assembly plant in Mexico near the border ) closed down its operations there and relocated to San Quentin State Prison in California .
In Texas , a factory fired its 150 workers and contracted the services of prisoner - workers from the private Lockhart Texas prison , where circuit boards are assembled for companies like IBM and Compaq ... [ Former ]
Oregon State Representative Kevin Mannix recently urged
Nike to cut its production in Indonesia and bring it to his state , telling the shoe manufacturer that " there wo n't be any transportation costs ; we 're offering you competitive prison labor ( here ) . "
As I said , I have been writing , sporadically , on this national shame for many years .
I 'll close with an excerpt from a piece I wrote back in 2006 :

The victim : John Colman .
Not much is known about him , much less about his murder .
His body was hastily buried and has never been found .
A weapon was recovered , but it vanished .
The only account of the crime is secondhand , pieced together from a few witnesses , some of whom might have harbored a grudge .
The chief suspects were singled out because of racial profiling but were never questioned .
No one was ever prosecuted .
It was on Sept. 6 , 1609  400 years ago Sunday  when this , the first recorded murder in what became metropolitan New York , was committed .
Colman was killed only four days after the first Dutch and English sailors arrived .
“ There ’s a reason it ’s still a cold case , ” said Detective Michael J. Palladino , president of the city detectives ’ union , mulling the scant evidence that remains today .
Some 300 people have been murdered in the city so far in 2009 .
Typically , half the homicides are solved in the first year and 20 percent the year after .
Relatively few are solved decades after they occur , although some are .
So it ’s about time modern police brains were brought to bear on the murder of John Colman .
Some detectives gamely agreed to apply their skills to the case during interviews .

But that 's the wonderful things about man ; he never gets so discouraged or disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again , because he knows very well it is important and worth the doing .

I 'm afraid of children my own age .
they kill each other .
Did it always use to be that way ?
My uncle says no .
Six of my firends have been shot in the last year alone .
Ten of them died in car wrecks .
I 'm afraid of them and they do n't like me because I 'm afraid .
My uncle says his grandfather remembered when children did n't kill each other .
But that was a long time ago when they had things different .
They believed in responsibility , my uncle says .
Do you know , I 'm responsible .
I was spanked when I needed it , years ago .
And I do all the shopping and housecleaning by hand .
The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors , but are not .
No , no , it 's not books at all you 're looking for !
Take it where you can find it , in old phonograph records , old motion pictures , and in old friends ; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself .
Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget .
There is nothing magical in them at all .
The magic is only in what books say , how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us .
Of course you could n't know this , of course you still can't understand what I mean when I say all this .

There is more than one way to burn a book .
And the world is full of people running about with lit matches .
Every minority , be it Baptist / Unitarian , Irish / Italian / Octogenarian / Zen Buddhist , Zionist / Seventh - day Adventist , Women ’s Lib / Republican , Mattachine / FourSquareGospel feels it has the will , the right , the duty to douse the kerosene , light the fuse .
Every dimwit editor who sees himself as the source of all dreary blanc - mange plain porridge unleavened literature , licks his guillotine and eyes the neck of any author who dares to speak above a whisper or write above a nursery rhyme .
Do your own bit of saving , and if you drown , at least die knowing you were heading for shore .
Do you know why books such as this are so important ?
Because they have quality .
And what does the word quality mean ?
To me it means texture .
This book has pores .
It has features .
This book can go under the microscope .
You 'd find life under the glass , streaming past in infinite profusion .
The more pores , the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper , the more " literary " you are .
That 's my definition , anyway .
Telling detail .
Fresh detail .
The good writers touch life often .
Most of us can't rush around talking to everyone , know all the cities of the world , we have n't time , money or that many friends .
The things you 're looking for , Montag , are in the world , but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety - nine per cent of them is in a book .

Saturday is the deadline Mr Abdullah has set for his " minimum conditions " President Hamid Karzai's rival in the second round of the Afghan presidential poll says he will announce on Sunday whether he intends to quit the race .
Abdullah Abdullah called for the resignation of key election officials and others as a way to mitigate fraud and corruption in the vote .
But those demands were rejected earlier in the week in talks with Mr Karzai .
A senior adviser said that in talks on Friday , Mr Abdullah 's team decided he should not take part in the poll .
But Mr Adbullah 's campaign said on Saturday that no final decision had been made , and that the former foreign minister would announce his next move on Sunday .

The BBC's Ian Pannell in Kabul says that if he withdraws it will raise serious questions about the credibility of the election .
However , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said a runoff with only one candidate would not necessarily threaten the legitimacy of the process .
" We see that happen in our own country where , for whatever combination of reasons , one of the candidates decides not to go forward , " Mrs Clinton told reporters in the United Arab Emirates .
' Nothing has changed '
Hundreds of thousands of votes were discounted from August 's first round of voting .
The UN - backed Electoral Complaints Commission 's ( ECC ) action meant Mr Karzai 's total was reduced to below the 50 % plus one vote threshold for outright victory , indicating a run -off poll was needed .
Among the " minimum conditions "
Mr Abdullah has set for holding a relatively fair and free contest to be accepted , is sacking of the head of the country 's Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) , Azizullah Lodin .
KARZAI V ABDULLAH Hamid Karzai : First popularly elected president of Afghanistan Opposed Soviet occupation in 1980s Critics say he has done little to rein in corruption Abdullah Abdullah : Tajik - Pashtun , doctor by profession Senior Northern Alliance leader during Taliban rule Removed from Karzai 's cabinet in 2006
Profile : Hamid Karzai Profile : Abdullah Abdullah
The deadline for those conditions to be met expires on Saturday .
On Monday , Mr Adbullah said Mr Lodin had " no credibility " .
Mr Lodin denies allegations that he favoured Mr Karzai .
One of Mr Abdullah 's senior advisers , Ahmed Wali Massoud , said he was unhappy that nothing had been done to redress the electoral system 's problems .
" The fact is that the infrastructure of this fraud is still there .
Almost 1.5 million votes were rigged .
Nothing has changed , " he told the BBC .
" So if you go back and do the second round election , it means that it will happen again .
So , therefore , I do n't think that we would be willing to participate . "
Earlier , the IEC announced that it planned to open 6,322 polling stations for the run-off - more than it did during the first round .
The ECC had recommended cutting the number from 6,000 to about 5,800 - to make sure there would be enough monitors to limit fraud and troops to ensure security .
Mr Abdullah served as foreign minister in the short - lived government headed by the Northern Alliance , and continued as " foreign minister in exile " throughout the years of rule by the Taliban , which was ousted in 2001 .
He continued in that role under the Karzai government that was formed after the fall of the Taliban , leaving the government in 2006 .

We 've all heard the arguments for a China bubble in some shape or form , and may hold different views for or against .
Regardless , it is constructive when someone brings together all major arguments for one side in one piece .
Here , courtesy of Pivot Capitol Managment , is the full case for a major China slowdown .
Why :
There 's more debt in China than common figures suggest .
Capital - expenditure driven growth is likely to collapse soon .
The China urbanization driver is far weaker than proclaimed .
GDP is full of wasteful spending .

What the coverage does n't mention is the level of involvement Google had here : while in theory this could have been built on the Google Maps API with little input from the search engine maker itself , all reports seem to indicate that Google had a direct role in bringing the game to fruition .
And before we start : I get to be the car , ok ?
The Chevy Volt is a car that only appeals to preening schmoes and will fall flat on its face .
Or so says Audi of America president , Johan de Nysschen , who went off on the Chevy Volt and electric cars in general , with Lawrence Ulrich of MSN 's Exhaust Notes .
Nysschen tells Ulrich , “ No one is going to pay a $ 15,000 premium for a car that competes with a ( Toyota ) Corolla ...
They ’re for the intellectual elite who want to show what enlightened souls they are ... so there are not enough idiots who will buy it . "
He thinks the Volt will fall flat , and then the government will rush to its aid with generous subsidies so as to not look like a bunch of fools .
Nysschen would rather the government supported more diesels since they produce fewer emissions than an electric car that 's charged by coal .
And they 're ready today at a competitve price .
He says the government is tricking the public into thinking electrics are clean .
Unless the power grid gets cleaner , our electric cars will remain dirty .
In the government 's defense , it 's not solely about cleaner cars .
It 's also about the reliance on oil , which causes serious economic problems for the United States .
And some people think oil has something to do with some wars .
So , putting aside the green arguments , there 's at least two good reasons to support electrics .
Yes , you read that right .

Our Practice Areas
You ’re a human being .
When you get caught up in a massive case that results in serious harm or injuries , it can be very easy to be treated like a case , a number … just some thing caught up in a bigger affair .
That ’s not our style .
For more than 25 years , the law office of Leonard B. Gabbay , P.C. in Austin , Texas has worked to get people to realize that his clients are people and should be treated that way .
Above all , we want insurance carriers to realize you ’re not just another claim number on their desk– you ’re a person .
If you have n’t heard about the cease and desist letter that Google sent to famed Android OS modder Cyanogen , I suggest you read up before continuing this post .
Google has posted a “ response ” of sorts , hoping to clear the air of their good name in light of “ misconceptions ” amidst the criticism .
Here is an excerpt of that response , posted by Dan Morrill on the Android Developers Blog .
Everyone knows that mobile is a big deal , but for a long time it was hard to be a mobile app developer .
Competing interests and the slow pace of platform innovation made it hard to create innovative apps .
For our part , Google offers a lot of services — such as Google Search , Google Maps , and so on — and we found delivering those services to users ’ phones to be a very frustrating experience .
But we also found that we were n’t alone , so we formed the Open Handset Alliance , a group of like - minded partners , and created Android to be the platform that we all wished we had .
To encourage broad adoption , we arranged for Android to be open - source .
Google also created and operates Android Market as a service for developers to distribute their apps to Android users .
In other words , we created Android because the industry needed an injection of openness .
Today , we ’re thrilled to see all the enthusiasm that developers , users , and others in the mobile industry have shown toward Android .
With a high - quality open platform in hand , we then returned to our goal of making our services available on users ’ phones .
That ’s why we developed Android apps for many of our services like YouTube , Gmail , Google Voice , and so on .
These apps are Google ’s way of benefiting from Android in the same way that any other developer can , but the apps are not part of the Android platform itself .
We make some of these apps available to users of any Android - powered device via Android Market , and others are pre-installed on some phones through business deals .
Either way , these apps are n’t open source , and that ’s why they are n’t included in the Android source code repository .
Unauthorized distribution of this software harms us just like it would any other business , even if it ’s done with the best of intentions .
If I had to sum up each paragraph in one sentence it would be :
The mobile industry sucked so we made Android and now the world is awesome
We built applications for Android that are separate entities from the OS itself … they are just apps you would find from any developer on the market and we negotiate business deals if companies want them pre-installed on the phone
He then goes on to conclude :
I hope that clears up some of the confusion around Google ’s apps for Android .
We always love seeing novel uses of Android , including custom Android builds from developers who see a need .
I look forward to seeing what comes next !
He officially APPROVES of these custom builds of Android , but when Cyanogen includes GMail / YouTube / GTalk and other Google applications in his ROMs for free , it hurts their business .
How ?
Because Google is making deals with carriers and manufacturers who likely have to PAY to feature these Google applications pre-installed on their phones and advertise / market that these are included .
It is all about legalities .
And a HUGE part of the legal system is setting precedence .
I assume that Google was afraid it let Cyanogen continue to cook up these custom ROMs with Google applications baked in , they would lose the right and authority to prevent carriers and manufacturers from featuring Google applications on their phones by default .
This brings up a couple more interesting questions :
What about the Motorola CLIQ ?
A few days ago we saw the Motorola CLIQ claiming it would come with a TON of pre-installed apps .
When Motorola got wind of the word getting around , they removed the content from their website and now the CLIQ does n’t show ANY apps pre-loaded .
I ’m assuming that is because they have to play by the same rules as Cyanogen .
They ca n’t just include applications on their phones pre-installed without permission or an agreement .
And from the graphic we posted …
I ’m just not so sure Motorola had worked out agreements for every last one of them to put it lightly .
How does this change the Mod community for the future ?
One could easily argue that custom ROMs feature HTC Sense , MOTOBLUR and other custom versions of Android are absolutely 100 % illegal to distribute .
HTC and Motorola work hard on creating these softwares and offering them for free – so you can download them and use them on any Android phone when you did n’t pay a dime – amounts to nothing more than pirating .
Please read that previous statement in terms of how one COULD potentially view the situation , not necessarily how I feel or any company mentioned feels .
Whether you like it or not this is a turn for the worse for Android … but it was a road we were going to HAVE to go down sooner rather than later .
And in all honesty , it is probably better that Google nipped it in the bud and filed the C&D themselves instead of a billion smaller companies tossing lawsuits here and there and everywhere .
In fact , Google probably saw the issue with Cyanogen as an opportunity to set the record straight so it could protect its partners and allies in the OHA .
In other words , you could say that Google “ took one for the team ” by agreeing to look like the bad guy and formally intervene .
So now what ?
I have no clue .
This is a pretty vague yet reasonable response from Google .
This is the exact reason that I tried to show restraint in my original post on the topic .
The initial idea is to flip out and go bananas about how this is a violation of trust in the Open Source community yada yada yada – which many people did .
But there is a lot more to it than that and I think anyone looking at this issue objectively would agree .
I ’ll be trying to get in touch with Cyanogen and a rep from the Android team to hopefully clarify how this affects the future and what will / wo n’t be allowed .
In the meantime , try to relax .
Android is still – by far – the best mobile platform on the planet … and I ’m sure there is a happy medium we ’ll all be able to find once this whole thing plays out .

We Take On The Legal Burden And Explain The Process So You Always Know What ’s Going On
Fighting legal battles can be a difficult and stressful process .
Let us take those challenges on for you so that together we can find success .
Starting Sunday , cash - strapped California will dig deeper into the pocketbooks of wage earners -- holding back 10 % more than it already does in state income taxes just as the biggest shopping season of the year kicks into gear .
Technically , it ’s not a tax increase , even though it may feel like one when your next paycheck arrives .
As part of a bundle of budget patches adopted in the summer , the state is taking more money now in withholding , even though workers ’ annual tax bills wo n’t change .
Think of it as a forced , interest - free loan :
You ’ll be repaid any extra withholding in April .
Those who would receive a refund anyway will receive a larger one , and those who owe taxes will owe less .
But with rising gas costs , depressed home prices and double - digit unemployment , the state ’s added reach into residents ’ regular paycheck is n’t sitting well with many .

“ The state ’s suddenly slapping people upside the head , ” said Mack Reed , 50 , of Silver Lake .
“ It ’s appalling how brash that is . ”
Brittney McKaig , 23 , of Santa Ana said she expects the additional withholding to affect her holiday spending .
“ Coming into the holidays , we ’re getting squeezed anyway , ” she said .
“ We ’re not getting Christmas bonuses and other perks we used to get .
So it all falls back on spending .
The $ 40 gift will become a $ 20 gift . ”
The extra withholding may seem like a small amount siphoned from each paycheck , but it adds up to a $ 1.7 - billion fix for California ’s deficit - riddled books .

From a single taxpayer earning $ 51,000 a year with no dependents , the state will be grabbing an extra $ 17.59 each month , according to state tax officials .
A married person earning $ 90,000 with two dependents would receive $ 24.87 less in monthly pay .
California will probably continue to collect the tax at a higher rate for many years -- or find an additional $ 1.7 billion to slice from a future budget , an unlikely occurrence .
All workers who have state taxes withheld will see their paychecks shrink .
“ Many families are sitting at their kitchen table wondering how they ’re going to make ends meet , ” said state Sen .
Tony Strickland ( R - Thousand Oaks ) .
“ At the same time , the state of California is taking a no- interest loan . ”
The provision is one of numerous maneuvers state lawmakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger approved in the summer to paper over the state ’s deficit .
Many of the changes , including the extra withholding , were little noticed outside of Sacramento .

Savvy taxpayers can get around the state ’s maneuver by increasing the number of personal withholding allowances they claim on their employer tax forms , said Brenda Voet , a spokeswoman for the state ’s Franchise Tax Board .
“ People can get out of this , ” she said , noting that most people would have to change their allowances through their employers .
California ’s budget leaders are banking on the hope that most wo n’t .
The increase is coming at a bad time for store owners , many of whom depend on the holiday shopping season to keep their businesses alive .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any question it ’s going to impact consumers ’ spending , ” said Bill Dombrowski , president of the California Retailers Assn .
“ Any time you reduce people ’s disposable income , there ’s going to be a negative effect on the retail sector . ”
Advertisement
But Stephen Levy , director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy , was n’t so sure .
“ It ’s having a relatively small impact on people ’s income , ” Levy said , pointing out that many families will receive only $ 12 to $ 40 less each month .
Yet Erika Wendt , 28 , of San Diego said she already lived on a tight budget :
She rides her bike to work , for instance , to save on gasoline and parking costs .
“ I am frustrated as this directly impacts my weekly budget -- what groceries I buy , how much I drive and can spend on gas , ” she said .
“ Now money will just be tighter , and I ’m not sure where else I can cut back . ”

The extra withholding comes in addition to tax hikes the state enacted this year .
In February , state income tax rates were bumped up 0.25 of a percentage point for every tax bracket .
The dependent credit was slashed by two - thirds .
The state sales tax rate rose 1 percentage point .
The vehicle license fee nearly doubled to 1.15 % of a car ’s value .
Lawmakers and the governor also approved deep cuts to schools , social services and prisons to fend off one of the steepest revenue losses in California history .
Temporary budget bandages , such as the increase in withholding , were included at several points this year to avoid higher taxes and deeper cuts , said H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for the state Department of Finance .

Sacramento , meanwhile , is awash in red ink again .
The state controller recently said revenue in the budget year already had fallen more than $ 1 billion short of assumptions .
Outsize deficits are projected for years to come .
Such temporary measures as the withholding tax increase do n’t really fix the budget gap , “ they just more or less hid it , ” said Christopher Thornberg , a principal with Beacon Economics in Los Angeles .
“ I call it a fraud . ”

- E' lei .
E ' la nave descritta dal pentito di mafia Francesco Fonti .
E ' come e dove lui aveva indicato .
Sotto cinquecento metri di acqua , lunga da 110 a 120 metri e larga una ventina , con un grosso squarcio a prua dal quale fuoriesce un fusto .
Si trova venti miglia al largo di Cetraro ( Cosenza ) .
I fusti sarebbero 120 , tutti pieni di rifiuti tossici .
E la nave sarebbe una delle tre fatte sparire nei nostri mari con il loro carico mortale .
La verità è venuta fuori oggi pomeriggio : ora ci sono le foto scattate nei fondali da un robot inviato lì sotto dalla Regione Calabria .
Sono abbastanza nitide .
Si vede un mercantile adagiato su una fiancata lunga dieci metri , coperto da reti , costruito dopo gli anni Cinquanta .
Si vede la prua squarciata e il fusto che fuoriesce .
Sono foto importantissime , che abbiamo rischiato di non avere mai .
" E ' un risultato - spiega il Procuratore Capo della Repubblica di Paola , Giordano Bruno - al quale siamo arrivati grazie al sostegno dell ' assessorato all ' ambiente della Regione Calabria che ha mobilitato uomini e risorse economiche per questo " .
Sì , perché in Procura spesso non arrivano neanche i soldi per comprare la carta per le fotocopie , figuriamoci per finanziare un'operazione cosi complessa .
" Sono contentissimo - continua Bruno - ma anche triste : speravo di sbagliarmi .
Quella che fino a ieri poteva essere una ipotesi diventa ora un fatto concreto e rivela un progetto tanto macabro da lasciare sconcertati " .
Ora le indagini proseguiranno e sono davvero tanti gli interrogativi da sciogliere .
" A quella profondità - dice il Procuratore Capo - la pressione è tale che non si sa fino a che punto dei fusti possano reggere senza spargere il loro contenuto in mare .
E non sappiamo quanto siano isolati " .
Di certo i misteri che hanno sempre avvolto questa vicenda non lasciano sperare bene .
Come aveva già confermato la Marina militare , nella zona - siamo a venti miglia al largo di Cetraro ( Cs ) - non ci sono relitti bellici né della prima né della seconda guerra mondiale .
Ma di battaglie pare ce ne siano state ben altre nei nostri mari , diventati il tavolino dove politica e mafia giocano le loro partite di soldi e di potere .
Certo , per avere la certezza matematica di cosa ci sia in quei fusti occorre aspettare che vengano tirati fuori dall ' acqua e analizzati .
Ma a questo punto il quadro sembra completo anche in considerazione della presenza di un'altra nave nei fondali di Amantea , la Jolli Rosso e del recente ritrovamento in zona di una collina di rifiuti radioattivi .
Per non parlare dell ' aumento dei tumori sulla costa , sui quali indaga proprio la Procura di Paola .
Quali saranno i prossimi passi ?
" Il robot - spiega il procuratore Bruno - non è potuto entrare nelle stive .
Ora servirà usarne un altro , con un supporto più " morbido " capace di fotografare anche l'interno .
Il nostro lavoro continua .
Already , the economy is being starved of investment it needs to nurture growth .
Net private investment , which includes spending on everything from machine tools to new houses , minus depreciation , fell to 0.1 % of gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 , according to the latest government data .
That 's the lowest level since at least 1947 .
( Update : graph now included , thanks to Melanchthon .
Link to eurotrib original story where it is also visible here )
The recession can be said to have " ended " because corporate profits are doing better than expected , and the stock market can celebrate that thanks to the oodles of cash injected into the financial economy by the Fed .
But this is like losing weigth by starving oneself ...
Read that again : there is NO net new investment in the economy by the private sector , right now , it 's barely keeping what exists in condition .
This is unprecedented since at least WW2 .
If this does n't point to the urgent , desperate , need for more public sector investment to plug the unprecedented gap in the private sector , I do n't know what will .
And if that does n't point to the incredible opportunity for Obama ( and governments elsewhere ) to shape the economy for the next 50 years by putting in place new collective infrastructure ( energy , transport , healthcare , education , etc ) I do n't know what will .
The main argument against government spending and borrowing is that it will " crowd out " investment in the private sector ( ie prevent it from happening ) and increase interest rates .
Well , private sector investmetn is already not happening , and interest rates can basically not be any lower .
The other , more reasonable argument is that debt should not be used to fund consumption - thus the focus on public investment - and the beauty is that the needs are huge and perfectly well identified .
To name just a few : investment in house energy efficiency ( this will additionally help the construction sector ) ; investment in public transport and high speed rail ; rebuilding , strengthening and smartening the power grid ; new investment in education opportunities and healthcare for all , not to mention the industrial facilities behind each of these , if appropriate .
It 's the perfect time to show that government can plan for the future , and help solve the problems of the present at the same time .
It 's a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to prove ( yet again ) that government is the solution , not the problem , to many of our collective woes .
Instead , we get the " government has grown too big already " pollyannas choking off any alternative voice .
The right ( and the neolib or bank - affiliated " left " like Summers and Geithner ) have already succeeded in limiting the stimulus , and blaming its insufficient results on its being too big , rather than too small .
Right now , we have runaway debt and no real recovery plan , ie the worst of all worlds .
Time to do somethign about it , and be bold !
There are many strange religions in this mixed - up , modern world – Discordianism , Pastafarianism , the Church of the Subgenius – but one of strangest and most popular is the Cult of the New .
People will pay more than twice as much to see a first - run movie compared to seeing it in a second - run theater or renting it and watching it at home .
They 'll pay $ 50 for a videogame that will clearly be a $ 20 " greatest hits " game before too long .
They buy novels in hardback , comic books in their original run rather than waiting for the anthology .
And then there are all those people paying $ 600 for video cards that , six months from now , will cost less than the shiny , full - bleed folding pamphlets currently being used to advertise the hardware .
It seems to me that the best way to instantly raise your standard of living is to live in the past .
If you subsist entirely on two - year - old entertainment , and the corresponding two - year - old technology used to power it , you 're cutting your fun budget in half , freeing up that money for more exciting expenditures like parking meters and postage .
The problem is that it 's hard living out of sync with the world around you .
Just ask the Amish or Bill Cosby .
I 'm usually not in a big hurry to keep up with the latest books and movies , but I read the last two Harry Potter books and saw the most recent Star Trek movie very soon after release , just to avoid the inevitable deluge of spoilers .
( Chekov is actually a woman , and Harry Potter grows up to be Spock . )
Plus , it gets tiring listening to people rave about people playing Onechanbara : Bikini Samurai Squad on the Xbox 360 when you have n't finished The History Channel : Battle for the Pacific yet .
That 's why I 'm going to start my own cult .
A counter - cult , if you will , but not a cult actually involved with counters like you 'd see at Home Depot .
My cult will be called the Cult of the Somewhat Delayed , and like all good cults we will shun contact with outsiders .
I 'll probably also get some chanting going — I like chanting .
The main purpose of the cult will be to allow us to enjoy two - year - old entertainment and technology without being corrupted by the heathen new - havers .
In order to remain blissfully ignorant of spoilers and shiny new temptations , we will constantly live as if it were two years in the past .
Normally , a proper cult would live on a secluded campground where we could practice our beliefs and store our automatic weapons , unhassled by people — like folks from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives — who do n't understand our ways .
But isolated armories do n't get the fastest DSL , and AT&T Wireless has notoriously poor coverage in rural Montana , so we would n't be able to use our iPhones , which we just got like five months ago .
( They 're pretty awesome , but I hope Apple comes out with a 3G model . )
Instead , we 'll form an online compound , with its own search engine , entertainment review sites ( " Almost Entirely Decomposed Tomatoes " ) and discussion forums where we can express our hopes and dreams that the Wolverine movie wo n't be a huge disappointment .
Nobody in our cult will be allowed to view media from the outside .
Those who mention Michael Jackson 's funeral will be banished from our society , and anyone who reveals the identity of the final Cylon will be killed .
It is our fervent hope that all of you filthy unbelievers will respect our money - saving way of life , just as we respect your right to provide us with cheap entertainment .
We just want to be left alone , and we hope you and the upcoming Clinton administration understand that .

On the 15th anniversary of the publication of the Gang of Four 's Design Patterns , we are revisiting this article written in 1994 for Addison - Wesley 's Innovations newsletter , in which Erich Gamma , Richard Helm , Ralph Johnson , and John Vlissides made the case for the book on the eve of its debut .

Designing object - oriented software is hard designing reusable object - oriented software is even harder .
Experienced object - oriented designers will tell you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult , if not impossible , to get " right " the first time , and that multiple attempts at reuse with subsequent redesigns are normal .
Yet experience has shown that many object - oriented systems exhibit idiomatic and recurring patterns and structures — objects that solve particular design problems and make designs more flexible , elegant , and ultimately reusable .
The Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) idiom found in Smalltalk is a design that separates representation defined by a Model from possible screen presentations defined by Views .
Model - View - Controller is applied widely throughout Smalltalk systems .
These recurring design structures or patterns of design have a positive impact on object - oriented design and development .
They help designers reuse successful designs and architectures based on prior experiences .
A designer who is familiar with a set of design patterns can apply them immediately to design problems without having to rediscover the design solutions .
This design experience is somewhat similar to that of architects or engineers who design buildings .
Just as they may follow certain standard designs for buildings ( skyscrapers with a solid core and hanging glass wall , energy efficient solar house ) or bridges ( suspension , cantilever , truss ) , so do object - oriented designers follow patterns like " represent states with objects " and " use wrappers to flexibly add / remove features from objects . "
Once you have the pattern , many design decisions follow .
This design experience is valuable .
What is often missing , especially in software , is a record of this experience for others to use .
How many times have you had that feeling , " I have solved this problem before in a previous design " ?
Of course , we all have had cases of design " deja-vu . "
If only we knew about the existing experience , the design issues , and the previously discovered solutions beforehand !
Our main goal in writing Design Patterns was recording the experience of designing reusable object - oriented software .
We set out to systematically name , explain , evaluate , and catalog the commonly occurring important design patterns found in object - oriented systems .
We try to capture in one place the wealth of experience about the design of reusable object - oriented software in a form that provides a ready reference for designers of object - oriented systems .
Central to Design Patterns is the catalog of 23 design patterns .
The patterns described fall into three broad categories : creational patterns that concern the instantiation of objects , structural patterns that concern how objects and classes stand in relationship to each other , and behavioral patterns that concern the distribution of behavior and responsibilities across classes and objects .
Each description of a design pattern names , abstracts , and identifies the key aspects of a common and recurring design structure that can be used to create a reusable object - oriented design .
The design pattern identifies the participating classes , including their instances , responsibilities , and collaborations .
Each pattern concerns one particular design problem or issue .
It describes the circumstances in which the design pattern is applicable , whether the pattern can be applied in view of other design constraints , and the consequences and tradeoffs of using the pattern in a larger design .
As we must eventually use our designs , the description also includes how the design pattern may be implemented using simple object - oriented concepts in object - oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk .
Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architectures .
Expressing proven techniques as design structures makes them more readily accessible to developers of new systems .
The experience embodied in design patterns helps a designer evaluate which design alternatives will make a system reusable and which alternatives will compromise future extensibility .
Design patterns can even improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by furnishing an explicit specification of class and object interactions and their underlying intent .
Put simply , design patterns help designers get their designs " right " the first time .
Few of the design patterns you will find in Design Patterns describe our designs .
We consciously avoided describing design tricks or techniques that we have invented .
Rather , we tried to only include designs that have been applied in practice to implemented and working systems .
However , most of these designs have never been documented before .
They are either known only as part of the object - oriented folklore , or learned only from intimate knowledge of the design of some successful object - oriented systems — neither of which are particularly useful or available references .
So , although the designs described here are not new , they are presented in a new and accessible way — as a catalog of design patterns following a standard template .
After their original car was destroyed during Petit Le Mans practice , the Patrón Highcroft ALMS team was forced to rebuild their Acura LMP1 racer overnight .

So to put it in simple numbers , the team put together a 4,000 - part race car in 21 hours and 45 minutes .
Simply brilliant .
Here 's a few slugs from Patrón Highcroft Racing :
Patrón Highcroft Racing 's won their " race " to make the grid and maintain the team 's championship assault after taking a bare tub into a complete racecar in less than 24 hours today .
After a horrifying crash for Scott Sharp on Thursday , the tub of the team 's Acura ARX - 02a was badly damaged and Honda Performance Development flew out a replacement overnight from its headquarters in California .
Beginning the build at 8:00 am on Friday morning preparing parts , the Patrón Highcroft squad kicked off when the tub arrived at 9:20 am and worked throughout the night to build up a new machine for today 's 12th running of the annual Petit Le Mans endurance classic .
The car was ready to roll at 5:45 am the following morning - in time for the team to take part in the morning warm - up .
Heavy rain overnight actually pushed the warm - up back - allowing the team to take a breath before beginning race day .

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) is an ongoing endeavor to map the sky in great detail , with many different goals .
One of the larger objectives is to map the structure of the cosmos by determining the positions of galaxies and their relativistic redshift ( basically their distance ) .
Using this data and Mathematica , you can plot the information and reveal the structure of the cosmos .
In my spare time , I queried the SDSS website , which is database driven , and in eight separate queries I was able to get all galaxies in the survey out to a redshift of 0.5 .
According to Wolfram|Alpha , this corresponds to looking back in time 5.02 billion years ago , or a distance of 6.14 billion light years , when the light we ’re now seeing from the most distant galaxies started its journey here .
That ’s a billion years before our solar system formed .
It ’s taken this long for the light to reach us .
This animation is of only a tiny fraction of the visible universe , but still more than enough to give you a glimpse of the size and scale of the universe .
Each point represents a galaxy .
Our galaxy would be at the very center ( no , we are n’t the center of the universe — just the center of this animation ) .
As you can see , galaxies tend to cluster along a web - like structure with “ voids ” interspersed .
The survey images the sky in slices , which form the wedge - like pieces in the animation .
These are the areas of the sky imaged so far .
The well - known Hubble Ultra Deep Field , while imaging galaxies to a much greater distance ( about 13 billion years ago and redshifts between 7 and 12 ) , covers only a tiny pinprick of the sky ( 11 arcminutes ) and so does n’t show the structure that this animation does .
This was achieved in Mathematica with a very tiny amount of code :
Teaching Ruby to High School Girls
August 15th , 2009
( Guest post by Sarah Mei )
For the last few years I ’ve been volunteering one day each summer at the GetSET summer camp in Santa Clara .
GetSET is pretty awesome , though their website is horrible .
It ’s a week - long sleepaway summer camp for girls from under - represented minorities who live in the San Jose area .
They first attend the summer before their freshman year of high school , and they return each year with the same group of cohorts .
During the week , they do a variety of half - day and whole - day workshops on different types of engineering - civil , mechanical , aerospace , and , of course , software .
In addition , they tour a different college campus each year , and get help with college prep and applications .
It ’s run by the Society of Women Engineers , and all the administrators , instructors , and TAs are volunteers .
( And they always need donations ! )
Until this year I was just a TA for various programming classes , which basically meant all I had to do was show up .
This year , though , they did n’t have anyone to teach Intro to Java .
I ’d been working on Ruby on Rails workshops for women , and I saw a chance to extend the work to kids .
“ Well , ” I said , “ I ca n’t do Java , but if you want to make it Intro to Ruby , I ’d totally do it . ”
I was n’t expecting them to be too enthusiastic .
SWE membership is mostly women who work in large companies , where Ruby does n’t have much of a foothold , and interpreted languages in general are regarded with some suspicion .
I got the affirmative response in less than 10 minutes .
Go SWE !
It was half - day workshop , which means I had three hours with the girls .
I quickly realized that was n’t going to be enough time for even a cursory overview of Rails .
But I knew something visual would keep their interest better than cursor / command - line programs ( particularly as this workshop was after lunch ) , plus I knew Sarah Allen had taught Shoes with 4th and 5th graders .
So I decided to build on her ideas .
Introduction
You can see the slides I put together ( they ’re HTML ; use the arrow keys to move between them ) .
They ’re pretty minimal - before we got started coding , we first did a quick welcome ( slides 0 - 2 ) , agenda and introductions ( slides 3 - 7 ) , and a little bit about “ what is programming ? ” ( slides 8 - 12 ) .
For the latter , I said that many people think programming is working in an endless cube farm ( slide 9 ) , with weird , possibly insane co-workers ( slide 10 ) , and doing a lot of math ( slide 11 ) .
In fact , programming is more about language ( slide 12 ) than math .
I asked who in the class was bilingual ; most of them raised their hands .
I said programming is about learning to speak the language of the computer .
I could see the lightbulbs lighting up !
Then we talked about Ruby and Shoes ( slides 13 - 17 ) .
I asked who had ever been a translator , going between someone who did n’t speak English and someone who did - most raised their hands .
I said the Ruby interpreter ( slide 13 ) translates your Ruby code into something the computer can understand , just like a human interpreter translates from one language to another .
Shoes ( slide 14 ) translates your Shoes code into something Ruby can understand .
Your program is on top of the stack ( slide 16 ) .
Then I explained the workflow we ’d use to program ( slide 18 ) .
We had a folder on the desktop to hold the source file .
To open the source file for editing , we dragged it to the Notepad shortcut .
To run it , we dragged it to the Shoes shortcut .
This worked really well - much more successful than the edit - compile - run cycle that we had done in the Java class in years prior .
That was the end of the slides .
After that , it was all collaborative coding !
Philosophy
This is an introduction to programming , so I focused on getting them excited about programming and what it can do .
This meant that they got away with some horrible style , and , once in a while , some magic incantations .
Ruby purists may protest that I did n’t talk about objects , or classes , but for the ones who keep going with programming , they ’ll get that soon enough .
In this class , I just wanted them to have fun and see what they could do with code .
Despite that focus , they formed an intuitive understanding of some pretty sophisticated programming concepts , as you ’ll see below .
Setup
I had them start with a blank file .
Last year , I was a TA in Akkana Peck ’s Javascript class with this same group of girls when they were juniors .
The Javascript class is their first programming class , and the girls start with an almost - working Javascript file and edit it to get it working .
This time , I wanted to show them how in programming you really can start with nothing , and end up with something really cool .
Together we wrote an etch - a - sketch program in a series of small steps .
I used the agile development philosophies of short iterations and frequent deployment to drive the project .
Short iterations means that each step is a fairly minor change - we add one thing that the program did n’t have before .
Frequent deployment means that we ran the code constantly to get strong visual feedback that they were making progress .
These in combination seemed to hold everyone ’s interest .
For each step , I coded live on the projector with Notepad ’s font at 48 pt .
Then I ran the program to show them what the modified output would look like .
Then I switched back to the code , got up , and walked around with the TAs to help the girls troubleshoot when they hit errors trying to make the change that was onscreen .
There were 20 girls , 2 TAs , and me .
The TAs were fabulous , but this was a pretty large class .
Having one more TA - for one helper per five girls - would have been perfect .
Step 0 - a blank application
Shoes.app do end
Here we talked about do / end .
I did n’t explain blocks , exactly ; I just said they ’d be seeing the do / end combination in other places , and it just signifies the beginning and end of a section .
Most of them typed shoes instead of Shoes at first , so we also talked about how computers are picky about spelling and capitalization of some words .
When you run this , you get a blank window titled “ Shoes , ” which I do n’t think is super exciting , but the girls thought it was pretty cool .
Step 1 - add some text
Shoes.app do para " Hello , world " end
Here we talked about strings .
I said they could put whatever they wanted inside the quotes - the computer is n’t picky about spelling and capitalization there .
It ’s a sort of free zone for text .
Also , I explained that para is short for “ paragraph ” the way app is short for “ application , ” and that they ’d be seeing a lot of abbreviations in programming .
For several folks that was an a - ha moment ; para is the Spanish word for “ for , ” as in something “ para usted ” is “ for you , ” and they ’d been thinking Shoes spoke Spanish !
Step 2 - add some attributes to the text
Shoes.app do para " Hello , world " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " end
Here we talked about attributes as qualities that you attached to a particular object .
In this case , we ’re attaching them to the paragraph object , so they ’re on the same line as para .
The girls ran into a few issues here getting the punctuation right - commas after everything , colons before the attribute names , hashrockets ( => ) between attributes and their values , and quotes around the values .
I did n’t explicitly talk about symbols , hashes , parameters , or implied hashes at the end of a method call .
Instead I just pointed out that attributes always go at the end of a line , after the important stuff like what text you want .
Step 3 - custom window title
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do para " Hello , world " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " end
We went through this one pretty quickly because the girls were eager to get on to changing the background color .
But I did point out that this time we ’re attaching an attribute to the entire program , instead of to a particular piece of it , so therefore it goes on the Shoes. app line .
Step 4 - background color
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do background tomato para " Hello , world " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " end
I encouraged the girls to try other named colors .
When fushia did n’t work but fuschia did , we talked again about the computer ’s pickiness .
When dark red did n’t work but darkred did , we talked about identifiers , and how they ca n’t have spaces .
One girl asked if we could add an attribute to the para object to change the text color .
Aha , they were paying attention when we talked about the scope of attributes !
I did n’t know the attribute name , so I looked it up .
As I did so , I talked about how you do n’t have to memorize how everything is done to be a good programmer .
You just need to know where to find out .
Step 5 - text color
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do background tomato para " Hello , world " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx-large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
They played around with named colors some more .
Once they found a few colors that bona fide did n’t exist as named colors in Shoes , like “ copper , ” we looked at the color page in the Shoes manual .
Each color there has its equivalent rgb call underneath .
I explained that you could say tomato , or you could equivalently say rgb ( 255 , 99 , 71 ) .
The first number is red , the second color is green , and the third color is blue , and every color is a combination of those three colors .
Since tomato is a reddish color , its first number , the red , is high relative to the other two .
If the color you want is n’t named , you can use its rgb equivalent .
I asked for suggestions for a color to try to make , and we settled on periwinkle .
I sat down at the projector and erased tomato and replaced it with rgb ( .
Then I asked : the first number is red , the second color is green , the third color is blue , so what three numbers should I try ?
The shouted suggestion was 100 , 0 , 100 .
I put that in , saved it , dragged it onto Shoes , and we got a really deep purple .
I went back to color page in the Shoes manual , and we looked at how the light colors like antiquewhite and beige have pretty high numbers for all three colors .
On the other hand , black has all zeroes .
So which direction should we take the numbers to get a lighter purple ?
They totally got it .
Some girls tried really high numbers , like 500 , and the color looked the same as lower numbers , like 300 .
So we talked about how the highest is 255 , though I did n’t touch on binary or why that ’s the limit .
At this point we took a break , and some of the girls continued experimenting with RGB values on their own .
When we came back , a few girls had worked out pretty good versions of periwinkle , which is something like rgb( 180,170,205 ) .
But how do you add it to Shoes ’ list of colors ?
This gave us the opportunity to talk about methods and objects a little bit .
I pointed out that in our list of para attributes , they all had quotes around them except for saddlebrown .
That ’s because saddlebrown is a method call , while the other two are strings .
We need to add a periwinkle method , and then we call it like all the other ones .
Step 6 - named color method
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do def periwinkle rgb ( 180,170,205 ) end background periwinkle para " Hello , world " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
I pointed out def / end as another set of section delimiters like do / end .
In this case , we ’re saying that this method starts with def , short for “ define ” a method , and ends with end .
I also talked about whitespace a little bit , because most of the girls were n’t using any indentation in their code .
I pointed out that indenting like I had done can help you keep track of your end s.
This got more important later on !
And now for something completely different
We got a lot of mileage out of colors , which I was n’t expecting .
I thought we ’d run quickly through background colors and get into event loops before the break , but the girls were enjoying adding their own color combinations , and I did get to talk about RGB , which I had n’t been expecting to do .
Now though it was time to move on , so I announced that we were going to do something completely different - make the application interactive .
Step 7 - adding a button
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do def periwinkle rgb ( 180,170,205 ) end background periwinkle button " Change the text " do @headline .
text =
" I 'm changed ! " end @headline = para " Hello , world " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
We added two things : a button block , and an assignment .
Here I talked about variables : stuff that you want to be able to get ahold of again later .
In this case , we ’re assigning our para object to a variable called @headline and saving it , so that when someone presses the button , we can change its text .
I pointed out the do / end associated with the button block .
At this point , a lot of girls were starting to have syntax errors because they forgot an end somewhere , and some got so annoyed that they actually started indenting .
Success !
Step 8 - coordinates
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do def periwinkle rgb ( 180,170,205 ) end background periwinkle animate do @button , @left , @top = self .
mouse @headline .text = " #{@button} #{@left} # {@top} " end @headline = para " Hello , world " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
In this step , we replaced the button block with an animate block that displays the current mouse coordinates in the para element .
All window applications have an “ event loop ” that runs several times a second and checks for input .
In this case , our animate block runs several times each second .
Inside it , we call a built - in method in Shoes ( like the color names are built - in methods ) that gives us the current mouse coordinates .
It gives us 3 numbers , which we store in 3 variables : @button , @left , and @top .
The coordinates for the window start at 0 , 0 in the top left corner .
@left is how many pixels from the left - hand side of the window the mouse is , @top is how many pixels down from the top the mouse is , and @button tells us whether or not the mouse button is pressed .
They did n’t totally get it until they wrote the code and saw it working , and saw how it updated the numbers whenever they moved the mouse or clicked inside the window .
The string interpolation was the hardest part to explain , and to help them with .
@button , @left , and @top are numbers , but they need to be strings if we want to display them in the para element .
So we use #{} to turn them into strings .
For most of the girls this was pretty much a magic line , I think , but since it was only there to demonstrate how the animate block works , I did n’t worry about it too much .
I gave them some time to experiment with the coordinates - pushing the mouse all the way up into a corner , running it down along one of the edges , etc .
Step 9 - drawing lines based on mouse coordinates
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do def periwinkle rgb ( 180,170,205 ) end background periwinkle animate do @button , @left , @top = self .
mouse line 0 , 0 , @left , @top end @headline = para " Draw ! " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
In this step we replaced the para text replacement with a call to line , which draws a line between the first two coordinates and the second two coordinates .
In this case , we ’re drawing a line from 0 , 0 ( the top left corner ) to the current location of the mouse .
This went pretty quickly , and it really drove home that 0 , 0 is the top left corner of the window .
Some of the girls experimented with different origins so they could draw circular stars which I thought was a cool addition .
One thing we did during this step that did n’t work so well was to change the names of @left and @top to the more descriptive @mouse_column and @mouse_row .
I talked a little about how you need to give variables descriptive names , but the new names were too long to see effectively in 48 - pt font on the projector , and it ’s really tedious in Notepad to make sure you replace all the instances of @left and @top .
I realize now , as I mentioned in the Philosophy section , that with beginners , you ca n’t be too fussy about style .
If they want to skip indentation altogether and give all their variables one - letter names , that ’s fine , as long as they ’re still excited about what they ’re doing .
If they keep going with it , they ’ll realize that there ’s a reason you indent and give your variables descriptive names , and they ’ll start doing it .
But if I just tell them to , they wo n’t .
And nothing ensures that they drop it like a hot potato better than harping on them to write maintainable code .
Anyway !
Moving on .
Step 10 - only drawing a line when the button is down
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do def periwinkle rgb ( 180,170,205 ) end background periwinkle animate do @button , @left , @top = self .
mouse unless @button == 0 line 0 , 0 , @left , @top end end @headline = para " Draw ! " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
This was another fairly quick change - all we added was the unless block around the line call .
Now it only draws a line when a mouse button is down , which allowed the girls to better control what the stars looked like .
We did talk a little bit about = ( assignment ) and == ( comparison ) .
Because they already knew from the previous steps that @button was 0 when no mouse buttons were down , it seemed to make sense to them that we were n’t assigning it zero .
Step 11 - drawing from previous to current coordinates
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do def periwinkle rgb ( 180,170,205 ) end background periwinkle animate do previous_left = @left previous_top = @top @button , @left , @top = self .
mouse unless @button == 0 line previous_left , previous_top , @left , @top end end @headline = para " Draw ! " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
I thought this would take us a long time to get through , but to my surprise , the girls seemed to pick it up really quickly .
We had already talked about variables and how you use them to store something you want to get ahold of later .
So I asked them : each time you run through the loop , what ’s the value of @left and @top before you call self .
mouse ?
They got it - at that point , those variables contain the values you set them to the last time you ran the loop .
So we save them again before we replace them with the current values , and then we draw a line from the old values to the new values .
Ta-da , it ’s a drawing program !
They played around with it for a while .
One girl discovered she could change the line color by adding a : stroke attribute to the line call ; that was a popular addition .
Another girl dug into the documentation she had seen me use , and figured out how to use the color picker to let the user select a color for the line !
Step 12 - a clear button
Shoes.app : title =>
" My awesome application " do def periwinkle rgb ( 180,170,205 ) end background periwinkle animate do previous_left = @left previous_top = @top @button , @left , @top = self .
mouse unless @button == 0 line previous_left , previous_top , @left , @top end end button " Clear " do background periwinkle @headline .
remove @headline = para " Draw ! " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx - large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end @headline = para " Draw ! " , : align => " center " , : size => " xx- large " , : stroke => saddlebrown end
The last addition we had time for was a clear button , so that the girls did n’t have to quit the program and start over to get a fresh drawing surface .
It was pretty straightforward .
You have a button block ( which we ’d seen before , when we changed the paragraph text ) , and then you remove the old text , which is now underneath the background , and redraw it on top of the background .
If you do n’t remove it , even though it ’s now underneath the background , it will get in the way of a new one being drawn , and your headline will slowly creep down the window .
This gave us the opportunity to talk about the Z - axis , and how , conceptually , some things are on top of other things in the window .
Conclusions
The girls rated the workshop quite highly , so I think it was a success .
Next time I do this , though , I ’ll make a few changes :
Arrange some extra curriculum steps in case everyone ’s going faster than I expect .
The girls got a lot further with the application than I thought they would .
I originally only planned out as far as the Clear button , figuring we ’d be lucky to get through saving the previous coordinates .
But we got through everything , including the RGB detour , with just enough time at the end to implement Clear .
Prepare a handout with challenge goals for each step .
Some girls got through everything really quickly and then looked for more to do .
While most found the Shoes manual and started experimenting , a few started doing meebo and facebook .
A little more direction would have helped channel their enthusiasm instead of letting it dissipate between steps .
Prepare a handout with URLs to resources and directions for downloading and installing Shoes themselves .
Buy some cheap USB keys so they can take home their .rb file , a Shoes installer , the reference code , and copies of the handouts in digital form .
Teaching this class was a fantastic experience , and having the two TAs - both experienced programmers , but new to Ruby and Shoes - was invaluable .
Thanks to Alice Callen and SWE for letting me put this together .
I hope I ’ll be able to do it again next year .

As scientists work toward making genetically altered bacteria create living " circuits " to produce a myriad of useful proteins and chemicals , they have logically assumed that the single - celled organisms would always respond to an external command in the same way .
Alas , some bacteria apparently have an individualistic streak that makes them zig when the others zag .
A new set of experiments by Duke University bioengineers has uncovered the existence of " bistability , " in which an individual cell has the potential to live in either of two states , depending on which state it was in when stimulated .
Taking into account the effects of this phenomenon should greatly enhance the future efficiency of synthetic circuits , said biomedical engineer Lingchong You of Duke 's Pratt School of Engineering and the Duke Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy .
In principle , re-programmed bacteria in a synthetic circuit can be useful for producing proteins , enzymes or chemicals in a coordinated way , or even delivering different types of drugs or selectively killing cancer cells , the scientists said .
Researchers in this new field of synthetic biology " program " populations of genetically altered bacteria to direct their actions in much the same way that a computer program directs a computer .
In this analogy , the genetic alteration is the software , the cell the computer .
The Duke researchers found that not only does the software drive the computer 's actions , but the computer in turn influences the running of the software .

" In the past , synthetic biologists have often assumed that the components of the circuit would act in a predictable fashion every time and that the cells carrying the circuit would just serve as a passive reactor , " You said .
" In essence , they have taken a circuit - centric view for the design and optimization process .
This notion is helpful in making the design process more convenient . "
But it 's not that simple , say You and his graduate student Cheemeng Tan , who published the results of their latest experiments early online in the journal Nature Chemical Biology .
" We found that there can be unintended consequences that have n't been appreciated before , " said You .
" In a population of identical cells , some can act one way while others act in another .
However , this process appears to occur in a predictable manner , which allows us to take into account this effect when we design circuits . "
Bistability is not unique to biology .
In electrical engineering , for example , bistability describes the functioning of a toggle switch , a hinged switch that can assume either one of two positions – on or off .
" The prevailing wisdom underestimated the complexity of these synthetic circuits by assuming that the genetic changes would not affect the operation of the cell itself , as if the cell were a passive chassis , " said Tan .
" The expression of the genetic alteration can drastically impact the cell , and therefore the circuit .
" We now know that when the circuit is activated , it affects the cell , which in turn acts as an additional feedback loop influencing the circuit , " Tan said .
" The consequences of this interplay have been theorized but not demonstrated experimentally . "
The scientists conducted their experiments using a genetically altered colony of the bacteria Escherichia coli ( E.coli ) in a simple synthetic circuit .
When the colony of bacteria was stimulated by external cues , some of the cells went to the " on " position and grew more slowly , while the rest went to the " off " position and grew faster .
" It is as if the colony received the command not to expand too fast when the circuit is on , " Tan explained .
" Now that we know that this occurs , we used computer modeling to predict how many of the cells will go to the ' on ' or ' off ' state , which turns out to be consistent with experimental measurements "
The experiments were supported by the National Science Foundation , the National Institutes of Health and a David and Lucille Packard Fellowship .
Duke 's Philippe Marguet was also a member of the research team .
Fed chairman are expected to speak in code , so that reading their remarks is a bit like watching the famous scene in Annie Hall where the conversation between the lovers is subtitled with what they ’re really saying .
So when Ben Bernanke says this :
Another set of lessons that Asian economies took from the crisis of the 1990s may be more problematic .
Because strong export markets helped Asia recover from that crisis , and because many countries in the region were badly hurt by sharp reversals in capital flows , the crisis strengthened Asia ’s commitment to export - led growth , backed up with large current account surpluses and mounting foreign exchange reserves .
In many respects , that model has served Asia well , contributing to the rapid growth rates in the region over the past decade .
In fact , it bears repeating that evidence from the world over shows trade openness to be an important source of economic growth .
However , too great a reliance on external demand can also pose problems .
In particular , trade surpluses achieved through policies that artificially enhance incentives for domestic saving and the production of export goods distort the mix of domestic industries and the allocation of resources , resulting in an economy that is less able to meet the needs of its own citizens in the longer term .
the subtitle reads
HEY , CHINA , STOP ACCUMULATING DOLLARS — IT ’S TIME TO REVALUE YOUR CURRENCY
But does the United States dare put pressure on the Chinese to do that ?
People constantly say that we ca n’t risk it — that we ’re dependent on China to keep buying our debt .
Yet this is all wrong under current circumstances .
How do I know it ’s all wrong ?
Here ’s one way to think about the issue that I have n’t seen anyone else put forth ( if they have , I ’ll be happy to give credit . )
Right now , we ’re in a situation in which conventional monetary policy is hard up against the zero lower bound ; rules of thumb that track past Fed behavior suggest that the short - term interest rate should be - 5 % or lower .
To partially make up for its lack of traction , the Fed is engaged in massive “ quantitative easing ” — a misleading term , but I guess we ’re stuck with it .
What it basically means is that the Fed is selling Treasury bills or their equivalent ( interest - paying excess bank reserves are essentially the same thing ) , while buying other assets , expanding its balance sheet enormously in the process .
What kinds of other assets ?
Mortgage - backed securities ; securities backed by credit - card debt ; longer - term government debt ; etc . .
One type of asset the Fed has not been buying is foreign short - term securities .
But that ’s not because such purchases would be ineffective .
On the contrary , selling domestic short - term debt and buying its foreign - currency counterpart is the essence of a sterilized foreign - exchange - market intervention , which is a time - honored way of gaining a competitive advantage and helping your economy expand .
And some countries have , in fact , made foreign - currency purchases a part of their quantitative easing strategy — Switzerland in particular .
The only reason the Fed is n’t doing this is that we ’re a big player , and ca n’t be seen to be pursuing a beggar - thy - neighbor strategy .
But now ask the question : what would the effect be if China decided to sell a chunk of its
Treasury bill holdings and put them in other currencies ?
The answer is that China would , in effect , be engaging in quantitative easing on behalf of the Fed .
The Chinese would be doing us a favor !
( And doing the Europeans and Japanese a lot of harm . )
Conversely , by continuing to buy dollars , the Chinese are in effect undermining part of the Fed ’s efforts — they ’re conducting quantitative diseasing , I guess you could say , hence the title of this post .
The point is that right now the United States has nothing to fear from Chinese threats to diversify out of the dollar .
On the contrary , if the Chinese do decide to start selling dollars , Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke should send them a nice thank - you note .
National is deliberately undermining ACC to soften it up for partial privatisation and planned cuts to entitlements , said the Green Party today .
“ It is no accident that National is manufacturing a crisis with ACC , ” said Green Party ACC Spokesperson Sue Bradford , “ This is a conscious ploy to undermine ACC ’s reputation to allow the Government to push for creeping privatisation . ”
Green Party Co-Leader Russel Norman added that “ New Zealand has lead the world with its no - fault injury compensation scheme .
Despite this , National seems intent on undermining the principles of fair compensation and rehabilitation on which ACC is based .
“ Once again National is making a situation seem much worse than it is , so that when the truth comes out people are relieved rather than angry with National for undermining our fair society , ” said Dr Norman .
Contrary to the impression being deliberately given by Government and ACC chair John Judge , ACC is not losing money .
This year its revenues were $ 4.5 billion , which is $ 1.5 billion more than it spent on claims .
National is deliberately creating an atmosphere of crisis and confusion as an excuse to cut entitlements and begin partial privatisation .
A major announcement is expected from John Key tomorrow .
Ms Bradford said “ The rollback of access to services will impact hugely on vulnerable people who are already suffering the impacts of accident and injury , mental and physical .
“ I am very concerned about recent changes that make it more difficult for the survivors of sexual violence and abuse to get the treatment and rehabilitation they need .
“ It now appears that many more entitlements aimed at helping people back into work will be reduced or abolished altogether .
“ The Government is also looking to use this manufactured crisis to bring in privatised case management to push claimants off the books as quickly as possible .
“ This will happen through the contracting out of claims management to private companies who will then push people into work that pays far less than their pre-injury employment – or to no job at all – without providing them with adequate rehabilitation . ”
Note :
There is “ No cuts to ACC ” protest march on 12.30 pm Monday 19 October starting at the Cenotaph near Parliament .
Gold 's " breaking out " to a higher level as imminent , Chris Locke , managing director at Oystertrade.com Management , told CNBC Wednesday , as other analysts have said the precious metal could shine again as inflation fears resurface .
" We 're on this point of the market making a substantial move to the upside , " Locke said .
" We will see the market move through the bull market highs of $ 1,040 very , very quickly , " he added .
The S&P 500 index has maintained its uptrend from the March lows and the next target for it is 1,050 , Locke said .
But for the fall period , Locke sees the index weakening .
Locke told CNBC he 's been looking for a signal that the U.S. index will peak in August before correcting slightly , but that signal has n't occurred yet .
But he said he 's " seeing some kind of loss of momentum to the upside " and therefore predicted that the September to November period " will be weaker " and will test the levels below 950 .
He also sees sterling reaching " levels towards parity " against the euro , at 95 cents .
" Sterling looks the most vulnerable to me , " he said .
* Small second - hand retailers thrive in recession
* Optimism even in recovery if savings culture takes hold
DALLAS / PHOENIX , Oct 5 ( Reuters ) -
The recession has taken its toll on many large U.S. retailers but smaller ones catering to the second - hand market are flourishing as the cash - strapped seek the holy grail of the American consumer : a bargain .
In August the National Association of Resale & Thrift Shops ( NARTS ) , which claims to be the world ’s largest resale trade association , said a survey of its membership about second quarter sales in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 showed increasing turnover in the second - hand sector .
“ Of the 263 stores that responded , 64.1 percent said sales increased -- with an average increase of approximately 31 percent -- 11.5 percent said sales were about the same and 24.4 percent had a decrease in sales , ” it said .
Dallas - based Half Price Books , a privately - held operation that mostly trades and sells used books and magazines , has seen its sales rise and has plans to open new stores .
It has opened four new stores so far this calendar year , with more due to open in the fall .
It currently has 106 stores in 16 states .
“ We are buying more books than ever before so people are selling ...
It started last year with people coming in and selling books for gas money , ” said Kathy Doyle Thomas , executive vice president for marketing and real estate .
“ I think people are okay with buying used ... it is also part of the growing culture of recycling , ” said Doyle Thomas .
Such success is rare amid a financial crisis that has thrown millions of Americans out of work and made many think twice before they shop , which is almost a national obsession .
Macy 's Inc M.N said in January that it was closing 11 stores that were performing badly in the recession and Dallas - based diamond and jewelry retailer Zale Corp ZLC.
N has been closing stores -- just two of several examples .
Sales for Half Price Books ’ last fiscal year ( July 1 - June 30 ) showed an increase of six percent to around $ 200 million in same store sales and a rise of 10 percent for total sales including the new stores .
Kathy Gropper is a regular .
“ Whenever I finish books I bring them back and get more .
I do the same with clothes , ” she said after bringing in a box full of books and magazines to the retailer ’s main store in Dallas .
“ For me it ’s a recycling thing .
We also did it before the recession but we are even more careful now , ” said Gropper , who is a stay - at - home “ home - schooling ” mother .
The chain ’s origins were modest .
It was started in 1972 by green activists in a converted laundromat in Dallas with 2,000 books from the founders ’ own libraries
SECOND -HAND CLOTHES ARE CHIC
Other smaller and privately - held second - hand retailers with humble beginnings are also enjoying success , at least in part because of the recession .
My Sister ’s Closet is a chain of 10 stores across the Phoenix metro area selling what they describe as “ recycled designer apparel . ”
It is run by founder Ann Siner and her sisters Jenny and Tess .
The business began in 1991 , with a store in Phoenix , which offered good quality clothing for women , replacing the dark and dingy feel of most second stores with a brighter , more boutique - like feel .
“ Typically you can find retail items brand new at 50 , 60 or 70 percent off , so we had to take it a step further , ” said founder Siner , adding that quality and pricing are key .
“ Our items are typically used , so we have to say ‘ We ’ll give you a really good deal if you come shopping with us . ’
Say you bought a blazer that retails for $ 100 , in our store you are going to get it for between $ 9.95 and $ 19.95 , ” she said .
Siner and her sisters have parlayed the success of the first store catering to women into a store for kids , called Small Change , and another selling consignment furniture , My Sister ’s Attic , and a store for men , called Well Suited .
In the current downturn , where many shops in Phoenix valley strip malls have shut their doors , Siner is opening her eleventh store , this one selling furniture .
“ I ’m almost embarrassed to say this , but we are growing phenomenally .
We ’ve always had good growth , but this year we ’re 20 percent up on last year , ” Siner said .
“ We ’ve always had good growth , but the down economy is , I think , telling people to bring their things in to sell when they normally might have given them away , or given them to the maid ...
Also ( people ) are seeing used items are very good and can give great savings , ” she said .
One customer said shopping for work clothes such as slacks and shirts made perfect sense in the recession .
“ I think everybody is realizing that spending big money now does n’t really make sense , ” said banker Robert Maggs , 37 , as he shopped at Well Suited , the consignment store for men .
“ It ’s cheap and everything is good quality . ”
But does
Siner think that business will still be good when the economy picks up ?
“ We think it will continue , just because people will have learned it ’s an easy way to make some money , and the savings are so appealing . ”
Dania Leon ’s portfolio has surged 55 % during the stock market ’s booming rally over the six last months -- and she could n’t be more nervous .
After suffering deep losses last year , the 41 - year - old Pasadena resident is grateful to recoup some of her money .
But she fears that stock prices have shot up far more than is warranted given the country ’s still - weak economy and nearly double - digit unemployment rate .
“ I ’m scared , I ’m scared , I ’m scared , ” Leon said .
“ Why are we up , especially with unemployment as high as it is ?
I do n’t feel great because I worry that we could have a 500 - or 600 - point drop in a day and I wo n’t be quick enough to pull out of it in time . ”
Propelled by growing faith that the global economy has stopped contracting , this year ’s stock surge comes as an enormous relief after the brutal sell - off during the financial crisis -- and it shows no sign of letting up .

Yet it ’s also one of the least joyous bull runs in memory , as individual investors still smarting from last year ’s devastation in their mutual funds and 401 ( k ) accounts fear that the advance could give way to another free fall .
“ I see a lot of nervousness , ” said Wade Cooperman , chief executive of online brokerage TradeMonster .
“ It ’s not that long ago that some people rode [ the market ] right down to the bottom . ”
After jumping 108.30 points , or 1.1 % , on Wednesday to 9,791.71 , the Dow Jones industrial average is up 5.5 % in just the last two weeks .
The blue - chip index has risen a stunning 50 % since hitting a 12 - year low in early March and is just about 200 points shy of 10,000 , a mark that six months ago few expected to see any time soon .

Market optimists say stocks are responding as they always do to increasing evidence that the economy is coming out of recession , which should fuel a revival in corporate earnings .
On Tuesday , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke reinforced that sentiment by declaring that the recession was “ very likely over . ”
What has stunned many Wall Street veterans , however , is how relentless the rally has been since March , particularly given that most economists believe that any recovery will be weak at best and therefore tenuous .
But investors have been undeterred .
Key stock indexes have yet to be hit by a meaningful “ correction ” -- a normal 10 % to 15 % pullback within a rising market .
Such retreats are considered an essential part of longer - term bull markets because they give the economy time to catch up with investors ’ expectations .
Often triggered by investors taking some of their profits off the table , corrections also allow people who missed the initial surge to jump in .

But potential buyers looking for such an opening in this rally have been stymied .
“ People say , ‘ I ’m waiting , waiting , waiting for a pullback , but it does n’t happen , ’ ” said Nick Sargen , chief investment officer at Cincinnati - based Fort Washington Investment Advisors , which manages about $ 30 billion in assets for its clients .
“ This market continues to baffle everybody , ” said Ryan Larson , a trader at Voyageur Asset Management in Chicago .
The lack of a significant interruption in the march upward worries Keith Murphy .

During the market ’s plunge last year and early this year , the Foothill Ranch mortgage advisor resisted the urge to unload his stock holdings , which are currently worth about $ 500,000 .
But now that things are looking up , he ’s wondering if it ’s time to sell .
“ Every single day I get ready to click the sell button and pull my chips off the table , ” Murphy said .
“ It ’s confusing , and I ’m afraid of what to do and afraid we could be in a bubble .
The market ’s looking floppy , and the reasons for growth do n’t make sense . ”
Such fears are understandable , said Terry Odean , an expert in investor behavior at UC Berkeley .
“ You got whacked on the upside of your head last year , and you ’re looking over your shoulder to see if it ’s coming again , ” Odean said .

The rally also is stirring high anxiety among people who sold stocks during the downturn and have been sitting out , too fearful to take a chance in the market .
“ They ’ve been traumatized twice , ” said Michal Strahilevitz , a business professor at Golden Gate University in San Francisco who studies the psychology of individual investors .
“ First they lost a lot and got out .
And now they ’ve watched it climb up .
It ’s a lot of regret , and for people who are investing for their family , it ’s a lot of guilt . ”
There may be some solace in knowing that many professional forecasters have gotten it wrong too .
Coming into September , warnings were everywhere that a sell - off was imminent .
Classic measures of market sentiment were strongly bullish , which often signals at least a short - term top in share prices .
History also was against the market :
Over the last 50 years , September has been the weakest month of the year for stocks .
But Wall Street has kept focusing on the economy , which may not feel good to many people but still looks good to investors who just wanted to know that the recession has ended .
Most economic reports this month have either beaten or matched analysts ’ expectations .

What ’s more , market bulls note that although stocks are up sharply since March , they remain far below their highs .
The Dow still is off more than 4,300 points , or 31 % , from its October 2007 record of 14,164 .
Ned Davis Research , a well - known market research firm in Venice , Fla. , correctly called the rally earlier this year and has maintained the view that stocks are going higher .
“ So much money has been sitting on the sidelines and now is looking for a place to go ” as confidence in a recovery rises , said Tim Hayes , the firm ’s chief investment strategist .
But he conceded a pullback was likely .
“ We probably will get a decent correction at some point ” in the near future , Hayes said .
“ But we ’re not going to try to time that . ”

Experts note that the rebound in stock prices -- and in other risky investments -- has been a global affair , not just a Wall Street phenomenon .
Since Jan. 1 , a Bloomberg index of 500 European blue - chip stocks is up 20 % , compared with an 18 % rise for the U.S. Standard & Poor ’s 500 index .
Brazil ’s market is up 61 % .
Russia ’s has soared 96 % .
Investors also have poured money into corporate and municipal bonds , driving their prices up .
Many commodities , including copper , sugar and gold , also have rallied .
By pledging repeatedly to keep short - term interest rates near zero indefinitely -- to help the economy and the banking system -- the Federal Reserve has driven some investors out of havens such as money market mutual funds , which now pay next to nothing .
The average annualized yield on money funds is a mere 0.06 % .

Since mid-January , $ 403 billion has flowed out of money funds .
But the funds still hold $ 3.45 trillion .
“ The question people have to ask is ‘ Am I so scared that I ’m going to keep money in cash earning zero , rather than put it in the stock market ? ’ ” Sargen of Fort Washington Investment Advisors said .
Of course , financial advisors say money that you ca n’t afford to lose should never be invested in stocks .
That was the lesson too many people learned the hard way in the crash of last fall and winter .
Anthony Costantino , who lives in downtown L.A. and works in the billing department of a nonprofit organization , just opened an account that he plans to fill with technology stocks at a clip of $ 500 a month .
He knows he ’s missed the rally since March but believes a bigger surge lies ahead .

“ We ’ve seen a stabilization , and it seems the worst is over , ” Constantino , 32 , said of the economy .
“ A lot of people say it ’s better to buy on the upswing , even if you ’re a little late .
It took this long for me to see how things were going to be . ”

" I assume it will continue for several more weeks , and in a number of weeks we will be able to [ declare ] a victory , " Major General Udi Adam , the head of Israel 's northern command , said at a news conference .
Earlier , the United Nations general secretary , Kofi Annan , accused the Israeli military of carrying out a sustained bombing of the UN base on the Lebanon - Israel border that culminated in the killing of four unarmed monitors .
Mr Annan said he had suggested to the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , that they carry out a joint investigation into the events that led to the shelling of the " well - established and well marked " Unifil ( UN interim force in Lebanon ) post in the town of Khiyam .
" I spoke to Mr Olmert and he definitely believes it was a mistake and has expressed his deep sorrow , " Mr Annan told a press conference in Rome .
" But the shelling started in the morning and went on until after 7 pm .
You cannot imagine the anguish of the unarmed men and women peacekeepers who were there . "
The four monitors came from Austria , Canada , China and Finland .
Tonight , European Union and Chinese officials condemned the attack as " unacceptable " and the Irish government filed an official complaint to Israel after its senior UN peacekeeper made half a dozen warning calls over the bombings .
Jane Lute , the assistant secretary general for peacekeeping , told the UN security council that the base came under close Israeli fire 21 times - including 12 hits within 100 metres and four direct hits - from 1.20 pm until contact was lost with the four peacekeepers inside at 7.17 pm .
Ms Lute said the peacekeeping force had protested to the Israeli army after each firing incident .
The UN 's deputy secretary general , Mark Malloch Brown , and Ms Lute herself also made several calls to Israel 's mission to the UN " reiterating these protests and calling for an abatement of the shelling " , she said .
After contact with the base was lost , Unifil then won safe passage for two armoured personnel carriers to evacuate the position , she said .
They arrived at 9.30 pm " and found the shelter collapsed and major damage to the rest of the position " .
Despite negotiating safe passage , the APCs also came under Israeli attack , Ms Lute said .
The 2,000 - strong Unifil force , which sits on the Israel - Lebanon border , has suffered dozens of attacks and direct hits in the two - week conflict .
The deaths of the monitors cast a shadow over today 's meeting in Rome , where foreign ministers gathered to discuss the Israeli - Lebanese crisis .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and the British foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , were among ministers attending the talks in Rome , which ended with no clear indication of when a ceasefire would be achieved .
Tonight , the Italian prime minister , Romano Prodi , said he would be willing to contribute his country 's troops to any UN multinational peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military said eight soldiers had been killed and another 22 injured during intense fighting in the southern Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil .
Elsewhere , Israeli forces killed 19 Palestinians in fighting across the Gaza Strip , including at least nine militants , three children and a disabled man , medics and witnesses said .
Israel has stepped up air strikes and launched raids into Gaza to stop rocket attacks and recover a soldier captured by militants on June 25 .
The army has killed 140 Palestinians since it began its assault .
Elsewhere , the Israeli air force renewed its bombing of Tyre this evening , flattening an apartment block in one attack .
The strike appeared to have targeted the seven - storey building housing the headquarters of Sheik Nabil Kaouk , Hizbullah 's south Lebanon commander .
The building was empty but 12 people nearby were injured .
Israeli forces encircled Bint Jbeil yesterday , with one commander describing it as the " capital of Hizbullah " .
The army said then that it had killed up to 30 militants as it aimed to dismantle Hizbullah command posts there and destroy rocket launchers .
Mr Olmert was today facing mounting pressure to endorse calls for an immediate ceasefire amid claims that his position and that of the Bush administration were putting civilian lives at risk .
In Britain , aid agencies , religious groups and the public sector union , Unison , wrote an open letter to Tony Blair condemning his refusal to back the UN 's demands for a ceasefire .
The letter - signed by 14 organisations including Amnesty International , Christian Aid and the Muslim Council of Britain - warned that the UK government was diluting calls for peace .
" By failing to back the UN and call for an immediate ceasefire , the UK government has reduced the impact of international calls for an immediate halt to the violence , " the letter said .
A spokesman for Mr Blair said the prime minister was engaged " almost on an hourly basis " in trying to secure support for a stabilisation force and was ready to take " heat " from critics .
The government hoped to secure " broad agreement in principle " in Rome to the idea of a stabilisation force , the spokesman told reporters .
Israeli warplanes bombed 100 targets in southern Lebanon yesterday and one family of seven civilians was killed .
More than 400 Lebanese have been killed in total .
Hizbullah yesterday fired some 70 rockets into northern Israel , killing a 15 - year - old girl .
More than 40 Israelis have died in the violence , including 18 who have been killed by rockets .
