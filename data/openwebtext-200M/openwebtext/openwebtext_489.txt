McCain campaign is reviewing bundler 's donations
John McCain 's campaign began on Thursday to review donations brought in by a prominent Florida businessman following disclosures that his business partner , a foreign national , also may have engaged in fundraising .
The campaign is looking into hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to make sure that they are appropriate , a spokesman said .
The campaign sent a letter spelling out legal requirements to all donors who sent their contributions through Harry Sargeant III , the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party .
It 's illegal for foreigners to contribute their own money to U.S. campaigns .
The New York Times reported Thursday that Sargeant allowed a longtime business partner , Mustafa Abu Naba'a , to bring in some $ 50,000 in donations since March from members of a single extended family , the Abdullahs , in California , along with several of their friends .
A House committee chairman is looking into Sargeant 's defense contracts for shipping fuel to U.S. bases in Iraq as part of a probe into whether contractors are engaging in overcharging .
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Mustafa Abu Naba'a is not a bundler for the campaign , although Sargeant is .
" He was n't registered , and he has n't contributed , " Rogers said of Mustafa Abu Naba'a .
The campaign letter to donors notes that federal law bars contributions from foreign nationals and that donations cannot be reimbursed .
McCain is co-sponsor of the campaign finance reform law that bears his name and he is trying to move quickly to resolve any questions involving Sargeant .
McCain has " a deep commitment " to strictly following campaign finance law , said Rogers .

Health economists estimate that depending on how they are used , the two cervical cancer vaccines will cost society $ 30,000 to $ 70,000 , or higher , for each year of life they save in developed countries  a cost commonly seen in treating people already suffering from deadly cancers .
That number will be far higher if a booster is needed .
Looked at another way , countries that pay for the vaccines will have less money available for other health needs .
“ This kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in women ’s health , ” said Dr. Lippman at McGill .
“ Some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care .
I ’m not against vaccines , but in Canada and the U.S. , women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer . ”
By contrast , if the vaccine were to become cheap enough to be used in the developing world , particularly Africa , it would revolutionize women ’s health .
Charities like the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunizations , backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , are trying to devise a solution .
The vaccines offer partial protection against infection from human papillomavirus , or HPV , a common and generally benign sexually transmitted virus that can in rare cases cause cancer after years of silent infection .
The Merck vaccine also prevents some genital warts that are caused by other strains of the virus .
In Britain , “ this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the government ’s health priorities and political priorities , ” said Professor David Salisbury , who heads the Department of Health ’s Vaccine and Immunization Committee .
But critics urge restraint .
“ There is no need to rush , ” said Angela Raffle , a specialist in cervical cancer screening with the National Health Service in Britain , where 400 people die of the cancer each year .
“ If we do this quickly and badly , we could cause more deaths , ” from side effects , for example , or from giving girls false security that they are protected for life and no longer need to be screened , Ms. Raffle said .
The Campaigns
Stephanie Levi decided to give her two daughters the vaccine in late 2006 after receiving a newsletter from their physician .
“ When you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls , of course you do it , ” she said , adding that she was curious because she had not realized cervical cancer was a problem .
1945 Labour Party Election Manifesto Let Us Face the Future : A Declaration of Labour Policy for the Consideration of the Nation Victory in War must be followed by a Prosperous Peace Victory is assured for us and our allies in the European war .
The war in the East goes the same way .
The British Labour Party is firmly resolved that Japanese barbarism shall be defeated just as decisively as Nazi aggression and tyranny .
The people will have won both struggles .
The gallant men and women in the Fighting Services , in the Merchant Navy , Home Guard and Civil Defence , in the factories and in the bombed areas - they deserve and must be assured a happier future than faced so many of them after the last war .
Labour regards their welfare as a sacred trust .
So far as Britain 's contribution is concerned , this war will have been won by its people , not by any one man or set of men , though strong and greatly valued leadership has been given to the high resolve of the people in the present struggle .
And in this leadership the Labour Ministers have taken their full share of burdens and responsibilities .
The record of the Labour Ministers has been one of hard tasks well done since that fateful day in May , 1940 , when the initiative of Labour in Parliament brought about the fall of the Chamberlain Government and the formation of the new War Government which has led the country to victory .
The people made tremendous efforts to win the last war also .
But when they had won it they lacked a lively interest in the social and economic problems of peace , and accepted the election promises of the leaders of the anti-Labour parties at their face value .
So the " hard - faced men who had done well out of the war " were able to get the kind of peace that suited themselves .
The people lost that peace .
And when we say " peace " we mean not only the Treaty , but the social and economic policy which followed the fighting .
In the years that followed , the " hard - faced men " and their political friends kept control of the Government .
They controlled the banks , the mines , the big industries , largely the press and the cinema .
They controlled the means by which the people got their living .
They controlled the ways by which most of the people learned about the world outside .
This happened in all the big industrialised countries .
Great economic blizzards swept the world in those years .
The great inter -war slumps were not acts of God or of blind forces .
They were the sure and certain result of the concentration of too much economic power in the hands of too few men .
These men had only learned how to act in the interest of their own bureaucratically - run private monopolies which may be likened to totalitarian oligarchies within our democratic State .
They had and they felt no responsibility to the nation .
Similar forces are at work today .
The interests have not been able to make the same profits out of this war as they did out of the last .
The determined propaganda of the Labour Party , helped by other progressive forces , had its effect in " taking the profit out of war " .
The 100 % Excess Profits
Tax , the controls over industry and transport , the fair rationing of food and control of prices - without which the Labour Party would not have remained in the Government - these all helped to win the war .
With these measures the country has come nearer to making " fair shares " the national rule than ever before in its history .
But the war in the East is not yet over .
There are grand pickings still to be had .
A short boom period after the war , when savings , gratuities and post - war credits are there to be spent , can make a profiteer 's paradise .
But Big Business knows that this will happen only if the people vote into power the party which promises to get rid of the controls and so let the profiteers and racketeers have that freedom for which they are pleading eloquently on every Tory platform and in every Tory newspaper .
They accuse the Labour Party of wishing to impose controls for the sake of control .
That is not true , and they know it .
What is true is that the anti-controllers and anti-planners desire to sweep away public controls , simply in order to give the profiteering interests and the privileged rich an entirely free hand to plunder the rest of the nation as shamelessly as they did in the nineteen - twenties .
Does freedom for the profiteer mean freedom for the ordinary man and woman , whether they be wage - earners or small business or professional men or housewives ?
Just think back over the depressions of the 20 years between the wars , when there were precious few public controls of any kind and the Big Interests had things all their own way .
Never was so much injury done to so many by so few .
Freedom is not an abstract thing .
To be real it must be won , it must be worked for .
The Labour Party stands for order as against the chaos which would follow the end of all public control .
We stand for order , for positive constructive progress as against the chaos of economic do - as - they - please anarchy .
The Labour Party makes no baseless promises .
The future will not be easy .
But this time the peace must be won .
The Labour Party offers the nation a plan which will win the Peace for the People .
What the Election will be about Britain 's coming Election will be the greatest test in our history of the judgement and common sense of our people .
The nation wants food , work and homes .
It wants more than that - it wants good food in plenty , useful work for all , and comfortable , labour - saving homes that take full advantage of the resources of modern science and productive industry .
It wants a high and rising standard of living , security for all against a rainy day , an educational system that will give every boy and girl a chance to develop the best that is in them .
These are the aims .
In themselves they are no more than words .
All parties may declare that in principle they agree with them .
But the test of a political programme is whether it is sufficiently in earnest about the objectives to adopt the means needed to realise them .
It is very easy to set out a list of aims .
What matters is whether it is backed up by a genuine workmanlike plan conceived without regard to sectional vested interests and carried through Point by point these national aims need analysis .
Point by point it will be found that if they are to be turned into realities the nation and its post - war Governments will be called upon to put the nation above any sectional interest , above any free enterprise .
The problems and pressures of the post - war world threaten our security and progress as surely as - though less dramatically than - the Germans threatened them in 1940 .
We need the spirit of Dunkirk and of the Blitz sustained over a period of years .
The Labour Party 's programme is a practical expression of that spirit applied to the tasks of peace .
It calls for hard work , energy and sound sense .
We must prevent another war , and that means we must have such an international organisation as will give all nations real security against future aggression .
But Britain can only play her full part in such an international plan if our spirit as shown in our handling of home affairs is firm , wise and determined .
This statement of policy , therefore , begins at home .
And in stating it we give clear notice that we will not tolerate obstruction of the people 's will by the House of Lords .
The Labour Party stands for freedom - for freedom of worship , freedom of speech , freedom of the Press .
The Labour Party will see to it that we keep and enlarge these freedoms , and that we enjoy again the personal civil liberties we have , of our own free will , sacrificed to win the war .
The freedom of the Trade Unions , denied by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act , 1927 , must also be restored .
But there are certain so - called freedoms that Labour will not tolerate : freedom to exploit other people ; freedom to pay poor wages and to push up prices for selfish profit ; freedom to deprive the people of the means of living full , happy , healthy lives .
The nation needs a tremendous overhaul , a great programme of modernisation and re-equipment of its homes , its factories and machinery , its schools , its social services .
All parties say so - the Labour Party means it .
For the Labour Party is prepared to achieve it by drastic policies and keeping a firm constructive hand on our whole productive machinery ; the Labour Party will put the community first and the sectional interests of private business after .
Labour will plan from the ground up - giving an appropriate place to constructive enterprise and private endeavour in the national plan , but dealing decisively with those interests which would use high - sounding talk about economic freedom to cloak their determination to put themselves and their wishes above those of the whole nation .
Jobs for All All parties pay lip service to the idea of jobs for all .
All parties are ready to promise to achieve that end by keeping up the national purchasing power and controlling changes in the national expenditure through Government action .
Where agreement ceases is in the degree of control of private industry that is necessary to achieve the desired end .
In hard fact , the success of a full employment programme will certainly turn upon the firmness and success with which the Government fits into that programme the investment and development policies of private as well as public industry .
Our opponents would be ready to use State action to do the best they can to bolster up private industry whenever it plunges the nation into heavy unemployment .
But if the slumps in uncontrolled private industry are too severe to be balanced by public action - as they will certainly prove to be - our opponents are not ready to draw the conclusion that the sphere of public action must be extended .
They say , " Full employment .
Yes !
If we can get it without interfering too much with private industry . "
We say , " Full employment in any case , and if we need to keep 8 firm public hand on industry in order to get jobs for all , very well .
No more dole queues , in order to let the Czars of Big Business remain kings in their own castles .
The price of so - called ' economic freedom ' for the few is too high if it is bought at the cost of idleness and misery for millions . "
What will the Labour Party do ?
First , the whole of the national resources , in land , material and labour must be fully employed .
Production must be raised to the highest level and related to purchasing power .
Over - production is not the cause of depression and unemployment ; it is under - consumption that is responsible .
It is doubtful whether we have ever , except in war , used the whole of our productive capacity .
This must be corrected because , upon our ability to produce and organise a fair and generous distribution of the product , the standard of living of our people depends .
Secondly , a high and constant purchasing power can be maintained through good wages , social services and insurance , and taxation which bears less heavily on the lower income groups .
But everybody knows that money and savings lose their value if prices rise so rents and the prices of the necessities of life will be controlled .
Thirdly , planned investment in essential industries and on houses , schools , hospitals and civic centres will occupy a large field of capital expenditure .
A National Investment Board will determine social priorities and promote better timing in private investment .
In suitable cases we would transfer the use of efficient Government factories from war production to meet the needs of peace .
The location of new factories will be suitably controlled and where necessary the Government will itself build factories .
There must be no depressed areas in the New Britain .
Fourthly , the Bank of England with its financial powers must be brought under public ownership , and the operations of the other banks harmonised with industrial needs .
By these and other means full employment can be achieved .
But a policy of Jobs for
All must be associated with a policy of general economic expansion and efficiency as set out in the next section of this Declaration .
Indeed , it is not enough to ensure that there are jobs for all .
If the standard of life is to be high - as it should be - the standard of production must be high .
This means that industry must be thoroughly efficient if the needs of the nation are to be met .
Industry in the Service of the Nation
By the test of war some industries have shown themselves capable of rising to new heights of efficiency and expansion .
Others , including some of our older industries fundamental to our economic structure , have wholly or partly failed .
Today we live alongside economic giants - countries where science and technology take leaping strides year by year .
Britain must match those strides - and we must take no chances about it .
Britain needs an industry organised to enable it to yield the best that human knowledge and skill can provide .
Only so can our people reap the full benefits of this age of discovery and Britain keep her place as a Great Power .
The Labour Party intends to link the skill of British craftsmen and designers to the skill of British scientists in the service of our fellow men .
The genius of British scientists and technicians who have produced radio- location , jet propulsion , penicillin . and the Mulberry Harbours in wartime , must be given full rein in peacetime too .
Each industry must have applied to it the test of national service .
If it serves the nation , well and good ; if it is inefficient and falls down on its job , the nation must see that things are put right .
These propositions seem indisputable , but for years before the war anti-Labour Governments set them aside , so that British industry over a large field fell into a state of depression , muddle and decay .
Millions of working and middle class people went through the horrors of unemployment and insecurity .
It is not enough to sympathise with these victims : we must develop an acute feeling of national shame - and act .
The Labour Party is a Socialist Party , and proud of it .
Its ultimate purpose at home is the establishment of the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain - free , democratic , efficient , progressive , public - spirited , its material resources organised in the service of the British people .
But Socialism cannot come overnight , as the product of a week - end revolution .
The members of the Labour Party , like the British people , are practical - minded men and women .
There are basic industries ripe and over - ripe for public ownership and management in the direct service of the nation .
There are many smaller businesses rendering good service which can be left to go on with their useful work .
There are big industries not yet ripe for public ownership which must nevertheless be required by constructive supervision to further the nation 's needs and not to prejudice national interests by restrictive anti-social monopoly or cartel agreements - caring for their own capital structures and profits at the cost of a lower standard of living for all .
In the light of these considerations , the Labour Party submits to the nation the following industrial programme : Public ownership of the fuel and power industries .
For a quarter of a century the coal industry , producing Britain 's most precious national raw material , has been floundering chaotically under the ownership of many hundreds of independent companies .
Amalgamation under public ownership will bring great economies in operation and make it possible to modernise production methods and to raise safety standards in every colliery in the country .
Public ownership of gas and electricity undertakings will lower charges , prevent competitive waste , open the way for co-ordinated research and development , and lead to the reforming of uneconomic areas of distribution .
Other industries will benefit .
Public ownership of inland transport .
Co-ordination of transport services by rail , road , air and canal cannot be achieved without unification .
And unification without public ownership means a steady struggle with sectional interests or the enthronement of a private monopoly , which would be a menace to the rest of industry .
Public ownership of iron and steel .
Private monopoly has maintained high prices and kept inefficient high - cost plants in existence .
Only if public ownership replaces private monopoly can the industry become efficient .
These socialised industries , taken over on a basis of fair compensation , to be conducted efficiently in the interests of consumers , coupled with proper status and conditions for the workers employed in them .
Public supervision of monopolies and cartels with the aim of advancing ; industrial efficiency in the service of the nation .
Anti-social restrictive practices will be prohibited .
A firm and clear - cut programme for the export trade .
We would give State help in any necessary form to get our export trade on its feet and enable it to pay for the food and raw materials without which Britain must decay and die .
But State help on conditions - conditions that industry is efficient and go - ahead .
Laggards and obstructionists must be led or directed into better ways .
Here we dare not fail .
The shaping of suitable economic and price controls to secure that first things shall come first in the transition from war to peace and that every citizen ( including the demobilised Service men and women ) shall get fair play .
There must be priorities in the use of raw materials , food prices must be held , homes for the people for all before luxuries for the few .
We do not want a short boom followed by collapse as after the last war ; we do not want a wild rise in prices and inflation , followed by a smash and widespread unemployment .
It is either sound economic controls - or smash .
The better organisation of Government departments and the Civil Service for work in relation to these ends .
The economic purpose of government must be to spur industry forward and not to choke it with red tape .
Agriculture and The People 's Food Agriculture is not only a job for the farmers ; it is also a way of feeding the people .
So we need a prosperous and efficient agricultural industry ensuring a fair return for the farmer and farm worker without excessive prices to the consumer .
Our agriculture should be planned to give us the food we can best produce at home , and large enough to give us as much of those foods as possible .
In war time the County War Executive Committees have organised production in that way .
They have been the means of increasing efficiency and have given much practical assistance , particularly to the small farmer .
The Labour Party intends that , with suitable modifications and safeguards , their work shall continue in peacetime .
Our good farm lands are part of the wealth of the nation and that wealth should not be wasted .
The land must be farmed , not starved .
If a landlord cannot or will not provide proper facilities for his tenant farmers , the State should take over his land at a fair valuation .
The people need food at prices they can afford to pay .
This means that our food supplies will have to be planned .
Never again should they be left at the mercy of the city financier or speculator .
Instead there must be stable markets , to the great gain of both producer and consumer .
The Ministry of Food has done fine work for the housewife in war .
The Labour Party intends to keep going as much of the work of the Ministry of Food as will be useful in peace conditions , including the bulk purchase of food from abroad and a well organised system of distribution at home , with no vested interests imposing unnecessary costs .
A Labour Government will keep the new food services , such as the factory canteens and British restaurants , free and cheap milk for mothers and children , fruit juices and food supplements , and will improve and extend these services .
Houses and the Building Programme Everybody says that we must have houses .
Only the Labour Party is ready to take the necessary steps - a full programme of land planning and drastic action to ensure an efficient building industry that will neither burden the community with a crippling financial load nor impose bad conditions and heavy unemployment on its workpeople .
There must be no restrictive price rings to keep up prices and bleed the taxpayer , the owner - occupier and the tenant alike .
Modern methods , modern materials will have to be the order of the day .
There must be a due balance between the housing programme , the building of schools and the urgent requirements of factory modernisation and construction which will enable industry to produce efficiently .
Housing will be one of the greatest and one of the earliest tests of a Government 's real determination to put the nation first .
Labour 's pledge is firm and direct - it will proceed with a housing programme with the maximum practical speed until every family in this island has a good standard of accommodation .
That may well mean centralising and pooling of building materials and components by the State , together with price control .
If that is necessary to get the houses as it was necessary to get the guns and planes , Labour is ready .
And housing ought to be dealt with in relation to good town planning - pleasant surroundings , attractive lay - out , efficient utility services , including the necessary transport facilities .
There should be a Ministry of Housing and Planning combining the housing powers of the Ministry of Health with the planning powers of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning ; and there must be a firm and united Government policy to enable the Ministry of Works to function as an efficient instrument in the service of all departments with building needs and of the nation as a whole .
The Land
In the interests of agriculture , housing and town and country planning alike , we declare for a radical solution for the crippling problems of land acquisition and use in the service of the national plan .
Labour believes in land nationalisation and will work towards it , but as a first step the State and the local authorities must have wider and speedier powers to acquire land for public purposes wherever the public interest so requires .
In this regard and for the purposes of controlling land use under town and country planning , we will provide for fair compensation ; but we will also provide for a revenue for public funds from " betterment " .
Education and Recreation
An important step forward has been taken by the passing of the recent Education Act.
Labour will put that Act not merely into legal force but into practical effect , including the raising of the school leaving age to 16 at the earliest possible moment , " further " or adult education , and free secondary education for all .
And , above all , let us remember that the great purpose of education is to give us individual citizens capable of thinking for themselves .
National and local authorities should co-operate to enable people to enjoy their leisure to the full , to have opportunities for healthy recreation .
By the provision of concert halls , modern libraries , theatres and suitable civic centres , we desire to assure to our people full access to the great heritage of culture in this nation .
Health of the Nation and its Children
By good food and good homes , much avoidable ill - health can be prevented .
In addition the best health services should be available free for all .
Money must no longer be the passport to the best treatment .
In the new National Health Service there should be health centres where the people may get the best that modern science can offer , more and better hospitals , and proper conditions for our doctors and nurses .
More research is required into the causes of disease and the ways to prevent and cure it .
Labour will work specially for the care of Britain 's mothers and their children - children 's allowances and school medical and feeding services , better maternity and child welfare services .
A healthy family life must be fully ensured and parenthood must not be penalised if the population of Britain is to be prevented from dwindling .
Social Insurance against the Rainy Day The Labour Party has played a leading part in the long campaign for proper social security for all - social provision against rainy days , coupled with economic policies calculated to reduce rainy days to a minimum .
Labour led the fight against the mean and shabby treatment which was the lot of millions while Conservative Governments were in power over long years .
A Labour Government will press on rapidly with legislation extending social insurance over the necessary wide field to all .
But great national programmes of education , health and social services are costly things .
Only an efficient and prosperous nation can afford them in full measure .
If , unhappily , bad times were to come , and our opponents were in power , then , running true to form , they would be likely to cut these social provisions on the plea that the nation could not meet the cost .
That was the line they adopted on at least three occasions between the wars .
There is no good reason why Britain should not afford such programmes , but she will need full employment and the highest possible industrial efficiency in order to do so .
A World of Progress and Peace No domestic policy , however wisely framed and courageously applied , can succeed in a world still threatened by war .
Economic strife and political and military insecurity are enemies of peace .
We can not cut ourselves off from the rest of the world - and we ought not to try .
Now that victory has been won , at so great a cost of life and material destruction , we must make sure that Germany and Japan are deprived of all power to make war again .
We must consolidate in peace the great war - time association of the British Commonwealth with the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R .
Let it not be forgotten that in the years leading up to the war the Tories were so scared of Russia that they missed the chance to establish a partnership which might well have prevented the war .
We must join with France and China and all others who have contributed to the common victory in forming an International Organisation capable of keeping the peace in years to come .
All must work together in true comradeship to achieve continuous social and economic progress .
If peace is to be protected we must plan and act .
Peace must not be regarded as a thing of passive inactivity : it must be a thing of life and action and work .
An internationally protected peace should make possible a known expenditure on armaments as our contribution to the protection of peace ; an expenditure that should diminish as the world becomes accustomed to the prohibition of war through an effective collective security .
The economic well - being of each nation largely depends on world - wide prosperity .
The essentials of prosperity for the world as for individual nations are high production and progressive efficiency , coupled with steady improvement in the standard of life , an increase in effective demand , and fair shares for all who by their effort contribute to the wealth of their community .
We should build a new United Nations , allies in a new war on hunger , ignorance and want .
The British , while putting their own house in order , must play the part of brave and constructive leaders in international affairs .
The British Labour Movement comes to the tasks of international organisation with one great asset : it has a common bond with the working peoples of all countries , who have achieved a new dignity and influence through their long struggles against Nazi tyranny .
And in all this worth - while work - whether political , military or economic - the Labour Party will seek to promote mutual understanding and cordial co-operation between the Dominions of the British Commonwealth , the advancement of India to responsible self - government , and the planned progress of our Colonial Dependencies .
Labour 's Call to all Progressives Quite a number of political parties will be taking part in the coming Election .
But by and large Britain is a country of two parties .
And the effective choice of the people in this Election will be between the Conservative Party , standing for the protection of the rights of private economic interest , and the Labour Party , allied with the great Trade Union and co-operative movements , standing for the wise organisation and use of the economic assets of the nation for the public good .
Those are the two main parties ; and here is the fundamental issue which has to be settled .
The election will produce a Labour Government , a Conservative Government , or no clear majority for either party : this last might well mean parliamentary instability and confusion , or another Election .
In these circumstances we appeal to all men and women of progressive outlook , and who believe in constructive change , to support the Labour Party .
We respect the views of those progressive Liberals and others who would wish to support one or other of the smaller parties of their choice .
But by so doing they may help the Conservatives , or they may contribute to a situation in which there is no parliamentary majority for any major issue of policy .
In the interests of the nation and of the world , we earnestly urge all progressives to see to it - as they certainly can - that the next Government is not a Conservative Government but a Labour Government which will act on the principles of policy set out in the present Declaration .
( CNN ) -- Federal officials have opened a civil rights investigation into a police narcotics raid on the home of a Maryland mayor in which police burst in without knocking and shot the mayor 's two dogs to death .
Mayor Cheye Calvo of Berwyn Heights , Maryland , and his mother - in - law were handcuffed and forced to kneel on the floor during the July 29 raid , which police said was part of an investigation into a scheme in which drugs apparently were sent to unsuspecting people .
Prince George 's County police , who were in charge of the raid , issued a statement Friday clearing the couple of involvement and expressing " regret . "
The FBI and the U.S. attorney 's office in Maryland are investigating the incident , FBI spokesman Richard Wolf said Friday .
Calvo had asked for the federal investigation .
" We lost our family dogs , " he said Thursday .
" We did it at the hands of sheriff 's deputies who burst through our front door , rifles blazing . "
Watch the mayor 's description of the raid »
According to The Associated Press , two men , including a FedEx deliveryman , have been arrested in the case .
Police said the scheme involved shipping drugs to unsuspecting people 's homes and intercepting the packages .
About $ 3.6 million in marijuana had been seized , police told the AP .
In this instance , investigators told the AP , a package containing 32 pounds of marijuana was sent from Los Angeles , California , to Calvo 's house in Berwyn Heights , a town of 3,000 residents 10 miles from Washington .
The package was addressed to his Calvo 's wife , Trinity Tomsic .
Do n't Miss Mayor wants federal investigation into raid
In transit , a drug - sniffing dog in Arizona brought attention to the package , investigators told the AP .
Police intercepted it when it arrived in Maryland , and it was delivered to the Calvo home by an undercover officer , according to the AP report .
In a statement released Friday , Prince George 's County Police Chief Melvin High said he called Calvo on Thursday to tell him that in screening the case with the state 's attorney 's office , " it was concluded that Ms. Tomsic and the Calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers . "
" I called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the family 's beloved dogs , " High said in the statement .
A thorough review of the raid is being conducted , which is standard procedure in such cases , the department said .
The Prince George 's County Police Department was in charge of the raid , and the sheriff 's special operations team was assisting .

Calvo said he set the package aside after it arrived at his home and did n't open it .
He said he was changing clothes and preparing to attend a community meeting when " the door flew open .
I heard gunfire shoot off .
There was a brief pause and more gunfire . "
He said he was brought downstairs at gunpoint while in his boxer shorts , handcuffed and forced to kneel on the floor along with his mother - in - law .
Then , he said , " I noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood . "
While he was being held , Calvo said , he told the police he is the town 's mayor , but they did n't believe him .
" They told a detective I was crazy , " he said .
Berwyn Heights has a police force , he said , but Prince George 's County police did not notify the municipal authorities of their interest in his home or in the package .
" It was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives , " he said .
Calvo added , " they 've arrested the real criminals involved .
We 're pleased to have that and get our name back as well .
But really , this does n't excuse what they did . "

Units and resolution independence for gtk +

Subject : Units and resolution independence for gtk +
Date : Wed , 06 Aug 2008 17:07:10 - 0400
Hey , Many years ago jrb did a writeup about units http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2003-February/msg00009.html
e.g. to make apps avoid using hard coded pixel values .
The past few days I 've been working on implementing something similar to this in GTK +.
MOTIVATION
My main motivation was primarily the need to scratch an itch - one of the laptops I own ( incidentally mclasen has a similar one ) has a 17 " panel with 1920x1200 resolution .
While it 's nice with high resolution , everything is so tiny .
Just bumping up the font size wo n't work ; then all my scrollbars and other widgets look out of place ; they 're too small compared to the font .
In the future we 're going to see more high - DPI displays .
Another motivation is that I think resolution independence ( " RI " ) should be default in the next major version of gtk +
( see below for reasons why we can't turn it on by default in gtk 2.x ) - having a shiny feature like RI sounds to me like an excellent selling point for gtk 3.0 [ 1 ] .
HOW IT WORKS A new macro GTK_UNIT_EM ( and it 's companion GTK_UNIT_ONE_TWELFTH_EM ) is introduced .
This allows application to do e.g. hbox = gtk_hbox_new ( FALSE , GDK_UNIT_EM ( 1 ) ) ; instead of hbox = gtk_hbox_new ( FALSE , 12 ) ; Also , a new type GdkUnit ( and it 's unsigned companion GdkUUnit ) is introduced .
It 's typedef 'ed to gint .
Like jrb proposed some high bits are cannibalized to tag that the given value is an em and not a pixel value .
Also , some users of pixel values are already using - 1 and G_MAXINT as sentinels so bit 31 is off the table .
Thus , bit 30 is used to specify it 's an em and if so , bit 29 is used to specify the sign .
A little convoluted but it works .
Down the road one can add GDK_UNIT_MM GDK_UNIT_INCH etc. though I 've yet to seen a valid use case for physical units .
I think we should just avoid them .
Then there 's a new macro GDK_UNIT_TO_PIXEL that will convert a GdkUnit to pixel sizes [ 2 ] .
The main idea is that widget implementations store GdkUnit 's instead of gint 's and use GDK_UNIT_TO_PIXEL in it 's implementation ( size_request , expose etc. ) .
Now , to preserve backwards compatibility , all getters should return pixel values .
This is achieved with using GDK_UNIT_TO_PIXEL in the getter .
For property getters , gdk_value_set_unit( ) does the appropriate magic to ensure this .
In addition , all widgets that provide C getters , an additional _unit ( ) function is added , e.g. in addition to gtk_expander_get_spacing ( ) there 's also gtk_expander_get_spacing_unit( ) and so forth .
For properties , there 's gtk_widget_get_style_unit( ) and gtk_object_get_unit( ) where the latter is a pendant to g_object_get ( ) .
All setters are also changed to use GdkUnit instead of gint .
There 's also a new type GdkParamSpecUnit type , the use is typically gtk_widget_class_install_style_property ( widget_class , - g_param_spec_int ( " xspacing " , - P_ ( " XSpacing " ) , - P_ ( " Extra spacing applied to the width of a progress bar . " ) , - 0 , G_MAXINT , 7 , - G_PARAM_READWRITE ) ) ; + gdk_param_spec_unit ( " xspacing " , + P_ ( " XSpacing " ) , + P_ ( " Extra spacing applied to the width of a progress bar . " ) , + GDK_UNIT_ONE_TWELFTH_EM
( 7 ) , + G_PARAM_READWRITE ) ) ;
So far so good .
It get 's complicated because parts of gtk + has poor data hiding , e.g. GtkContainer exposes border_width as a public member .
Also , some of these fields are 16 - bit quantities .
The solution here is twofold 1 . for 16 - bit quantities store the GdkUnit in private data and store the pixel value in public field - but we need to update this pixel value value when units change , hence a new ::unit_changed signal 2 . audit all users of public fields and make them use units if appropriate ( not a lot of these )
Now , because of 2 .
we can't unfortunately turn this on by default ( ca n't really audit / change all users of gtk + ) .
So for gtk 2.x the application will need to turn the RI feature on [ 3 ] - it 's an opt - in feature .
Thus if RI is not turned on the GDK_UNIT_EM and friends will assume 1em=12px and return the pixel value directly .
Thus , * everything * will be stored in pixel values and effectively there 's no change whatsoever .
So it 's safe to commit something like this to stable gtk 2.x .
PATCH
There 's a patch against trunk ( revision 21025 from around 1 pm eastern today ) here http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/gtk-resolution-indepence-r21025-20080806-1315EDT.patch
Notes on the patch -
It 's huge !
151 files changed , 4498 insertions (+ ) , 1777 deletions (-)
It weighs 518K .
However , most changes are of the form [ 4 ] - range->min_slider_size = 1 ; + range->min_slider_size = GDK_UNIT_ONE_TWELFTH_EM
( 1 ) ; + usage of GDK_UNIT_TO_PIXEL to resolve to pixels + conversion to use gdk_param_spec_unit .
E.g. most of the patch is trivial .
-
Part of of the patch deals with storing units in private data .
For GtkTable and GtkBox this was really unpleasant ; had to mirror all the childs etc. as private structures .
Ugh .
But we need something like this work anyway as part of the gtk3 plan for sealing off access to private data .
-
The gtkrc parser integration is lame ; it currently uses !
as a prefix to mean em .
It should accept e.g. " 0.8 em " instead of " !0.8 " .
Should n't be too hard , I just did n't like hacking the rc parser right now .
Here 's some version of Gilouche 's gtkrc ported http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/Gilouche-RI-gtkrc
but note that the clearlooks theme engine got a bug with drawing radio buttons .
The Raleigh engine is fine . - I have a small patch to gtk -doc to print out e.g .
Default value : 0.2 em instead of Default value : 2474784784 - GdkScreen grew a " unit - changed " signal - docs - need to add docs for all new symbols - need a porting guide DEMO
Here 's a screencast showing the feature - http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/gtk-resolution-indepence.ogg
Here are some screenshots - http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/file-chooser-em5.png - http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/file-chooser-em10.png - http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/file-chooser-em20.png
PROPOSAL
My proposal is to merge something like this for gtk 2.x in the near future and make it mandatory in gtk 3.0 .
Flames , praises , thoughts ?
Thanks ,
David [ 1 ] : FWIW , I 'm firmly in the " gtk 3.0 without compelling features is suicide " camp .
But this is not the thread to discuss politics .
Thanks . [ 2 ] : GDK_UNIT_TO_PIXEL
probably needs to take a GdkScreen ( and maybe even a position given multiple monitors ) as well . [ 3 ] : Using gdk_unit_enable_resolution_independence ( ) before gtk_init ( ) .
In fact apps probably only want this if they 've ported to using RI themselves too . [ 4 ] :
Interesting factoid : Pixel sizes are hardcoded some 400 - 500 places in the gtk+ source tree .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The United States must provide a “ very clear timeline ” to withdraw its troops from Iraq as part of an agreement allowing them to stay beyond this year , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said on Sunday .
It was the strongest public assertion yet that Iraq is demanding a timeline .
U.S. President George W. Bush has long resisted setting a firm schedule for pulling troops out of Iraq , although last month the White House began speaking of a general “ time horizon ” and “ aspirational goals ” to withdraw .
Iraq ’s leaders have become more confident of their ability to provide security as the country has become safer .
But attacks which killed at least 15 people on Sunday , including a U.S. soldier , were a reminder it is still a violent place .
In an interview with Reuters , Zebari said the agreement , including the timeline , was “ very close ” and would probably be presented to the Iraqi parliament in early September .
Asked if Iraq would accept a document that did not include dates for a withdrawal , Zebari said : “ No , no .
Definitely there has to be a very clear timeline . ”
“ The talks are still ongoing .
There ’s been a great deal of progress .
The deal is very close .
It is about to be closed , ” Zebari said of the agreement , which will replace a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the U.S. presence , which expires at the end of this year .
A sticking point in the negotiations is Washington ’s wish that its troops be immune from Iraqi law .
In July , Iraq ’s deputy speaker of parliament told Reuters lawmakers would likely veto any deal if this condition were granted .
Other hurdles include the power of the U.S. military to detain Iraqi citizens , and their authority to conduct military operations , Zebari said .
“ Our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues . ”
ASSERTIVE STANCE
He would not be drawn on the precise dates that Iraqi negotiators are seeking for withdrawal , saying the document was not yet final .
Iraqi officials have said they would like to see all U.S. combat troops out by October 2010 .
An agreement that included that date would require the Bush administration effectively to accept a timeline almost identical to the one proposed by Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , who opposed the 2003 invasion .
“ You may hear many dates , but I caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document , ” Zebari said .

Iraq has taken an increasingly assertive stance in negotiations with the United States after Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s forces scored military victories against militia groups this year , giving the government a confidence boost .
The high price of oil means the Iraqi treasury has more money for reconstruction projects than it can figure out how to spend , and violence is at a four - year low .
Still , U.S. commanders say they worry that a hasty withdrawal could allow violence to resume .

An attack on Sunday involving a roadside bomb , a suicide bomber and small arms fire in the town Tamirya , just north of Baghdad , killed a U.S. soldier , four Iraqi civilians and wounded 23 people , including two American soldiers .
In Khanaqin , another town north of Baghdad , a suicide bomber blew up a bomb - laden minibus , killing three people and wounding at least 20 .
Five roadside bomb attacks in or near Baghdad on Sunday killed a total of seven people and wounded at least 23 .
Iraqi politics have been paralyzed by a dispute over the northern city of Kirkuk , which Kurds claim as the capital of their autonomous homeland .
The issues threatens to stoke ethnic tensions between the city ’s Kurds , Arabs and ethnic Turkmen .
That quarrel scuppered a law needed to allow provincial elections across the country , despite intensive lobbying by the United States and United Nations to reach a deal .

Google has struck a deal to protect the personal data of millions of YouTube users in the $ 1bn ( £ 497 m ) copyright court case brought against the video - sharing website by Viacom .
Under the deal , Google will make user information and internet protocol addresses from its
YouTube subsidiary anonymous before handing over the data to Viacom in the US legal case .
Earlier this month a judge in New York ordered Google to pass on the personal data of more than 100 million YouTube users - many of them in the UK - to Viacom .
Viacom , the media company that owns TV channels including MTV and Comedy Central and the Paramount film studio , had demanded the information so it could conduct a detailed examination of the viewing habits of millions of YouTube users around the world .
The agreement that Google has struck also applies to other litigants pursuing YouTube user information over copyright claims in a class action that includes the FA Premier League , the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organisation and the Scottish Premier League .
" We are pleased to report that Viacom , MTV and other litigants have backed off their original demand for all users ' viewing histories and we will not be providing that information , " Google commented in a post on the official YouTube blog in the US overnight .
" In addition , Viacom and the plaintiffs had originally demanded access to users ' private videos , our search technology , and our video identification technology .
Our lawyers strongly opposed each of those demands and the court sided with us . "
Keeping YouTube user data anonymous had been championed by privacy campaigners in theUK and US .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation argued that the initial court order had " threatened to expose deeply private information " and violated the Video Privacy Protection Act .
There were also fears that Viacom might use the personal information to go after individuals for uploading illegal content such as music videos .
Google has now agreed to provide Viacom , and a class action group led by the FA Premier League , with a version of a YouTube viewership database that removes user name and IP data that would identify individual users .
However , the agreement does not address the issue of the viewing and uploading habits of Google and YouTube employees on the video - sharing website .
Viacom and Google still have to work out how to share this data over the coming weeks .
Although Google has brought in a series of systems to help with the removal of illegal material from YouTube , Viacom argued that it does not go far enough and launched its court action in March last year .
The court cases against Google are unlikely to come to trial before 2009 or 2010 .
Last year Facebook was forced into a climbdown over an intrusive marketing product called Beacon , which allowed other websites to tell your friends and family about some of your activities elsewhere on the internet , after a massive user backlash .
YouTube , which was founded in California in 2005 , was bought by Google just a year later for $ 1.65 bn and has since become the biggest video sharing website on the web .
It has an estimated 72 million users in the US alone , and its videos are watched more than 2.5 billion times each month .
In the UK , YouTube accounted for almost 50 % of the 3.5 bn video clips watched by web users in March , according to the latest comScore figures .

Last week , the court of appeal overturned the convictions of three people working in a business selling hydroponic growing equipment , on charges of " conspiracy to aid and abet the production of cannabis " .
You can be forgiven for not recognising this offence for one simple reason – it does not exist .
However , such was the anti-cannabis zeal of the judge in Derby presiding over the original case , he happily sent one of the men , David Kenning , to prison for nearly two years .
Cannabis is a certainly a harmful drug that can cause dependency and exacerbates existing mental health problems .
But since David Blunkett 's pragmatic decision in 2004 to regularise drug laws with the existing police practice of issuing warnings , the media have deliberately and wildly exaggerated the dangers of " weed " .
The government has abandoned its reason and thrown its lot in with hysterical and largely ignorant commentators .
The figures used by the home secretary Jacqui Smith in May to justify " popular support " for a volte - face to class B concealed that 32 % of the public support making it a class A drug alongside heroin and crack .
Such polls serve to underline the public 's unqualified confusion about the drug classification system as a whole .
Charles Clarke , when briefly home secretary , grasped this point when he commissioned a review of the whole ABC system .
His successor , John Reid , dropped the review like a burning spliff , and there is no prospect of this rational approach being entertained by Jacqui Smith .
In Jacqui 's eyes , " rational approach " reads as " soft on drugs " .
When she made her U - turn announcement , she lent on the disconcerting coalition of support from the Daily Mail , Telegraph and the entire Conservative party .
That alone should have told her something .
Also hidden in the statement was the bizarre and unworkable pledge to attack the " headshops " selling exotic cigarette papers and Bob Marley posters .
Such is New Labour 's new - found social orthodoxy , Jacqui Smith barked out the ministerial intention " to curtail the sale and promotion of cannabis paraphernalia " – and " where necessary shut the shops down " .
The sight of bongs , pipes and chillums for sale may offend Ms Smith 's sensibilities but this has been shown by several acquittals in the court of appeal as no place for the law .
And it is certainly not a justifiable use of scarce police resources .
The police have , in the past , seized cannabis paraphernalia , but that was some years before Britain 's problematic drug using population had risen to its current figure of 350,000 .
There are several of these shops in Camden Town , north London , where there is also a severe crack problem .
The government drug strategy since 1998 has been rightly aimed at tackling class A drugs as the overriding priority : cannabis policy is now skewing the strategy .
The police were not properly consulted about this latest crusade , and the Association of Chief Police Officers remains " sceptical " about the policy .
A spokesman for the government - funded charity DrugScope said the new enforcement regime " would be unlikely to have any measurable impact on cannabis prevalence " .
Last week also saw the futile attempt to outlaw the sale of cannabis seeds .
The government is looking kindly on the 10 - minute rule bill sponsored by the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake to make possession of these seeds a serious criminal offence .
Brake is worried about the proximity of a headshop in his constituency to a primary school although he could not show any corrupting influence .
Again , this is law based on outrage and not rational thinking .
The MP Paul Flynn , a veteran drugs campaigner , politely pointed out that in making his case , Brake " did not give any evidence of harm " .
The other problem in framing this law is cannabis seeds contain no traces of THC , the active ingredient in cannabis .
The government could outlaw all cannabis products but that would mean shutting down the multimillion - pound ( legal ) hemp business making oils , shampoos , maps , ropes and clothing .
There are also several thousand multiple sclerosis sufferers who purchase seeds to grow plants solely for their own palliative care .
They would all have to seek illegal supply , but most buy over the net in any case .
Of course , this flurry of political activity on cannabis would be more understandable if the government were responding to a rising tide of consumption – but cannabis use , according to the British Crime Survey , has been falling since 1996 .
" Wacky " Jacqui Smith 's intentions on cannabis enforcement are certainly justifying the media hysteria about the drug .
She herself admitted to using cannabis " a few times " at university , but if she had been caught in possession of it , she would have a criminal record and would certainly not now be a MP , let alone home secretary .
By January , she will have re-introduced that iniquitous policy .

Electronic Arts Responds to Copy Protection Outcry , Removes 10 - day SecuROM Check for the Troops
In the face of increasing pressure , BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts today relented , updating the official Mass Effect PC FAQ to note that validation will now only be required when the player downloads new game content .
Q : If the game is n't going to require an authentication every 10 days , will it ever require re-authentication ?
A : Only if the player chooses to download new game content .
The publisher further noted that the protection will still only allow users to authenticate each game on up to three computers .
Approval of further authorizations will be handled by EA customer support on a case - by - case basis .
Neither game will require players to have the disc in their computer in order to play or validate them .
BioWare community manager Jay Watamaniuk broke the news on the company 's official forums .
" To all the fans including our many friends in the armed services and internationally who expressed concerns that they would not be able re-authenticate as often as required , EA and BioWare want you to know that your feedback is important to us , " said Watamaniuk .
Children are naturally prone to be empathic and moral

Children between the ages of seven and 12 appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain , according to researchers at the University of Chicago , who used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) scans to study responses in children .
The responses on the scans were similar to those found in studies of adults .
Researchers found that children , like adults , show responses to pain in the same areas of their brains .
The research also found additional aspects of the brain activated in children , when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual .
" This study is the first to examine in young children both the neural response to pain in others and the impact of someone causing pain to someone else , " said Jean Decety , Professor in the Departments of Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of Chicago , who reported the findings in the article , " Who Caused the Pain ?
An fMRI Investigation of Empathy and Intentionality in Children , " published in the currrent issue of Neuropsychologia .
Joining him as co-authors were University students Kalina Michalska and Yuko Aktsuki .
The programming for empathy is something that is " hard - wired " into the brains of normal children , and not entirely the product of parental guidance or other nurturing , said Decety .
Understanding the brain 's role in responding to pain can help researchers understand how brain impairments influence anti-social behavior , such as bullying , he explained .
For their research , the team showed 17 typically developed children , ages seven to 12 , animated photos of people experiencing pain , either received accidentally or inflicted intentionally .
The group included nine girls and eight boys .
While undergoing fMRI scans , children where shown animations using three photographs of two people whose right hands or right feet only were visible .
The photographs showed people in pain accidently caused , such as when a heavy bowl was dropped on their hands , and situations in which the people were hurt , such as when a person stepped intentionally on someone 's foot .
They were also shown pictures without pain and animations in which people helped someone alleviate pain .
The scans showed that the parts of the brain activated when adults see pain were also triggered in children .
" Consistent with previous functional MRI studies of pain empathy with adults , the perception of other people in pain in children was associated with increased hemodymamic activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first - hand experience of pain , including the insula , somatosensory cortex , anterior midcigulate cortex , periaqueductal gray and supplementary motor area , " Decety wrote .
However , when the children saw animations of someone intentionally hurt , the regions of the brain engaged in social interaction and moral reasoning ( the temporo - parietal junction , the paracigulate , orital medial frontal cortices and amygdala ) also were activated .
The study , which was supported by the National Science Foundation , provides new insights for children between childrens ' perceptions of right and wrong and how their brains process information , Decety said .
" Although our study did not tap into explicit moral judgment , perceiving an individual intentionally harming another person is likely to elicit the awareness of moral wrongdoing in the observer , " he wrote .
Subsequent interviews with the children showed they were aware of wrong - doing in the animations in which someone was hurt .
" Thirteen of the children thought that the situations were unfair , and they asked about the reason that could explain this behavior , " Decety said .
When General Motors ( GM ) CEO Rick Wagoner said the company may sell , kill or revamp the Hummer , one question immediately came to mind : revamp it into what ?
If the oil is spike is permanent , as Wagoner now believes , the Hummer is a punch line , not a profit center .
Now , as GM formally opens up talks to sell the Hummer , the WSJ is reporting that GM " is n't any longer seriously considering a complete revamp of the Hummer division into a lineup selling vehicles with better fuel economy . "
Translation :
It 's selling it .
Strangely , the WSJ article does n't address any of the potential buyers for the Hummer .
And of the potential buyers , Chinese automakers have already seemingly thrown in the towel , Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra is fading out of the picture , and Russian billionaires are , well , fickle .
The potential sale of the Hummer brand would only be a small part of the $ 15 billion GM plans to raise by the end of 2009 .
So let 's hope the rest of capital - raising plan is going better .

The Verified by Visa system may be marketed as an optional opt - in system for internet shoppers , but some banks are forcing users to enrol after only three attempts to avoid it .
The unpleasant experiences of Verified by Visa refusenik and Reg reader Steve are likely to be faced by other cardholders , according to Andrew Goodwill , a director at card fraud prevention specialists
The 3rd Man .
The little - publicised mandatory use of Verified by Visa is down to how some banks apply the system , he explained .
A spokesman for UK banking association APACS confirmed that more banks are making the scheme ( and MasterCard 's equivalent SecureCode service ) mandatory .
" Most card issuers offer it .
Some are making it mandatory but we do n't keep a tally on what the banks are doing .
This is a competitive offering so different banks are doing different things , " he explained .
Visa is yet to respond to our requests for information on what percentage of banks insist the cardholders sign - up and use Verified by Visa , or its guidance on the best way to explain the rollout of the scheme to merchants and cardholders .
Roll up , sign on
Both Verified by Visa ( VbyV ) and MasterCard 's SecureCode services are designed to add an extra layer of security to credit or debit card purchases , and work using 3D Secure protocol checks .
Each is designed to reduce the likelihood of fraudulent transactions while transferring the liability for bogus transactions from merchants who run purchases through the system back towards banks and other card issuers .
When shoppers make purchases online with participating retailers they are typically taken to a website run by the card - issuing bank , where they are asked to submit a VbyV or SecureCode password to proceed with the purchase .
The password is set up when cardholders enroll in the programme , a process that requires knowledge of the personal details of cardholders ( in the US this might be the last four digits of a social security number , for example ) .
An APACS spokesman summarised the desired benefits of the scheme : " For cardholders both Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode make cards safer by making card not present fraud harder .
Even people who do n't use their cards for e-commerce transactions should sign up .
[ That way ] even if a criminal only gets a hold of the basic card details he wo n't be able to use it fraudulently online .
" For e-commerce retailers the scheme guarantees they are dealing with a genuine customer .
If the retailer has Verified by visa then the liability shifts back to the bank , avoiding charge - backs for fraudulent transactions . "
But while these are laudable aims there are practical problems .
For example , potential confusion can arise because e-commerce users are in many cases taken to an unfamiliar website run by the card - issuing bank .
The Verified by Visa guidelines suggest the bank 's verification page is loaded in an inline frame session rather than a pop-up but that approach can make it difficult to confirm the frame is tied to a valid digital certificate .
Steve made a conscious decision not to opt in to the Verified by Visa system because he 's not convinced of its benefits to cardholders .
Recently this decision has made it more and more difficult for him to buy goods or services online .
" In the last month I have made more than half a dozen attempted online purchases , " he said .
" All of which have ended with the retailer 's page presenting me with a ' Verified by Visa ' enrolment page .
Since there is no ' no thank you ' button , only an ' Activate now ! ' , I am forced to either enrol or close my browser , and I choose to do the latter .
" In each case my card provider has stopped my card .
Apparently declining their invitation to enrol is a sign of fraudulent activity .
I look like a fraudster who has been scared off by VbyV instead of like a customer who chooses not to enrol . "

Six months ago I set out on the most unusual and the wettest journey of my life .
Timewatch : Viking Voyage Sat 5 Jan 2008 1955GMT , BBC Two
Watch video at BBC History
The aim of the voyage was to test the ship and gain an insight into how the Vikings would have fared when making the same journey .
One of the first lessons was just how dependent we were on the weather .
With two days of strong winds in the right direction , we had managed to sail over 250 miles ( 400 km ) in one stretch .
But once we reached Norway , the situation changed .
For 10 days we were stuck on land with the wind blowing in the wrong direction or not at all .
A Viking ship is very poor at tacking ( sailing into the wind by zigzagging ) .
Follow the Viking ship 's route

So the only option was to wait for the wind to change .
At first it was a welcome relief after 48 hours in an open boat in the rain .
But boredom soon turned out to be the biggest hazard .
Faced with the same adverse winds , the Vikings would have faced an additional problem and I wonder if this could be at least part of the explanation for the Viking reputation for rape and pillage .
It was the most unusual and the wettest journey of my life

Their voyages would also have been far more hazardous without the benefit of modern weather forecasts .
When we did eventually set out into the North Sea , we were warned of a gale and reluctantly accepted a tow rather than face winds that would at best have blown us back to port .
Wind and waves
In fact the greatest test the Viking ship faced came towards the end of the voyage when too much wind , rather than too little , was the problem .
The wind had appeared to be moderate as the Viking ship set off from Scotland heading for the Isle of Man .
But as we reached open sea , the waves started to get larger and the wind rapidly increased .
Soon there were waves coming over the side of the ship and we were all ordered into our survival suits .
Wind and waves provided a severe test of Viking ship design
We knew the situation was serious when we were suddenly ordered to take down the sail and bring the ship to a halt .
The stability of the Viking longship depends on the flow of water over the hull .
And the rudder is only effective when moving forward .
Without control the ship was turning more side on to the waves and so more waves were crashing over the side .
The noise from the wind and waves made communication very difficult and no one seemed to know why the sail was being taken down .
Eventually I found the captain who was busy organising repairs .
The strap holding the rudder in place had snapped .
Until they could repair the rudder , the ship was helpless .
Meanwhile the life rafts were being prepared and it felt to me like there was a real chance the ship might not survive .
Survive it did , however , and with a new rudder strap in place , we were able to sail once more and make it safely to the Isle of Man .
Viking design
The ship was made as far as possible using the original Viking construction methods but clearly something had gone wrong .
Carsten will sail the Viking ship again in summer 2008
" We have this weak point - the rudder - but everything else seems to work very well , " said Carsten Hvid , the skipper .
" I think it has something to do with the materials we 're using for the rope and the leather strap .
We have to find a new way to make these things . "
The ship builders have until this summer to work out a better way of attaching the rudder .
In July , the ship will set off from Dublin on the return journey to Denmark .
This time they will travel via the south coast of England and may even visit London , taking a week long detour to travel up the Thames .
" Just imagine the ship going through Tower Bridge - that would be a wonderful image , " dreams Carsten .
He feels he now has a much better understanding of the characteristics of the ship .
" We 've learned how to handle the ship in different conditions , " Carsten says .
" The ship is so narrow and so long you have to sail it in its own way compared to other ships .
" For instance , in hard weather we have to reef down earlier than we 're used to , because of the very long keel . "
There is still a huge amount of data to sift through generated during the voyage .
But already they have discovered that the longship is slower than expected .
Overall though , Carsten is very impressed with how the ship performed and is confident it will make it back to Denmark safely .
" Basically it works ! " he says .

Playboy Jazz Festival Photos , Hollywood Bowl - 30th Anniversary
The 30th Anniversary Playboy Jazz Festival was held this weekend at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles .
It was first held in Chicago Stadium in 1959 .
After a twenty year lapse , it was resurrected again in 1979 at its current venue in L.A .
On hand to take in the entertainment were Hugh Hefner and his favorite women , Holly Madison , Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson .
The emcee for the event since 1995 has been Bill Cosby .
The 82 year old founder and majority owner of Playboy Enterprises looks as if he might be auditioning for Gilligan 's Island in his captain 's hat .
Hefner made news a while back when he offered a magazine pictorial to 15 year old Miley Cyrus .
Hefner said she was a " pretty lady " but would have to wait until she was 18 to appear in the magazine .
This followed closely on the heels of her controversial Vanity Fair photo shoot .
Check out more photos from Playboy Jazz Festival below including Bill Cosby on drums .

Europeans and other potential enemies of the US are to be forced to deposit their personal details on the Department of Homeland Security ’s computer system 72 hours before they get anywhere near the place .
The new rules will apply to citizens of the UK , and other countries whose citizens can travel to the US under the “ visa waiver program ” , from January next year .
The prime motivation for the scheme is increased concern in Washington that European grown terrorists can exploit the visa waiver program to get into the US and wreak havoc .
The plan comes a year after Europe expressed concern that US proposals to impose a 48 hour preregistration period for visa free travel would have played havoc with business people making last minute commercial trips to the US .
The US has clearly taken these considerations on board , and decided to up the pre-reg period to 72 hours .
According to reports , registrations made under the scheme will be valid for two years , allowing multiple entries to the US .
Non PC - owning travellers will be able to register through travel agents .
Nevertheless , there are concerns that the scheme will do little to speed entry into the US .
According to the FT , Susan Ginsburg of the Migration Policy Institute , expressed concern that no pilots had been conducted and that the move would increase pressure on the creaking US immigration system .
Of more concern to privacy minded Europeans there ’s also no clue as to what will happen to non-US citizen ’s data once it finds its way into the State Department and Department of Homeland Security Systems .
Clearly , details will be checked against watch lists .
However , Europeans will no doubt be concerned that their information will be dispatched to a big data warehouse where it will be mined into oblivion .
Previously , the consensus was that the little paper entry cards you filled out on arrival in the US were sent to a physical warehouse and consigned to oblivion .
Apart from unease over the amount of data US authorities will be collecting about other countries ’ citizens – the vast bulk of whom will have committed no crime other than wanting to go to Disneyland – there will also be concerns that the immigration database will be a potential goldmine for ID thieves .
The perceived invasiveness of the US scheme will likely dissuade some European travelers from actually crossing the Atlantic .
In which case they can stay at home and grumble about the EU ’s own efforts to tighten up entry procedures .
The US scheme - electronic travel authorization scheme - has been dubbed ESTA for short .
Why ?
Because someone in Washington realized that ETA is a terrorist group .
There ’s no clue as to what the S stands for .
Slow perhaps ?
Or simply " sod off " . ®
Egypt sees Israel preparing for Gaza invasion
Friday , June 6 , 2008 Free Headline Alerts
CAIRO  Egyptian sources said the intelligence community had concluded that Israel 's military was preparing for a massive invasion of the Gaza Strip .
The sources said the invasion would attack several areas of Gaza simultaneously and seek to destroy or badly damage the Hamas regime .
" All of the signals that we have been receiving point to a massive and imminent invasion , " an Egyptian source said .
[ On Thursday , an Israeli was killed and three others were injured when an Iranian - origin mortar slammed into a factory in southern Israel near the Gaza Strip .
Hamas , in an unusual move , claimed responsibility . ]
The sources said the Israeli invasion would be the leading issue for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , scheduled to return from a brief visit to the United States .
Olmert , who discussed the Hamas threat with President George Bush , was said to be ready to approve military plans for a massive operation in the Gaza Strip .
For his part , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak again warned of a major invasion of the Gaza Strip .
Barak did not elaborate .
" The military operation is closer than ever , and it will precede the cease - fire , " Barak said .
" We are nearing the day of reckoning in the Gaza Strip , in which we will decide whether to go in the direction of an agreement of calm or a wide - scale military operation . "
Over the last three months , Egypt sought to mediate a ceasefire or so - called lull in violence between Israel and Hamas .
The sources said the effort failed amid continued Hamas missile strikes and Israeli retaliation .
On June 4 , Al Qaida defended Hamas and called for an end to Israel 's economic blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Al Qaida No. 2 Ayman Zawahiri termed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a traitor for refusing to allow entry to Palestinians .
" The brother from Gaza is refused entry [ by Egypt ] , while an Israeli tourist is allowed to enter without a visa , " Zawahiri said .
Hamas has decided to pressure Israel by increasing missile strikes from the northern Gaza Strip .
The sources said Hamas was also ordering supporters to provoke clashes along the borders of Egypt and Israel .
" We have stressed that the lull must guarantee a lifting of the siege and the reopening of all crossings , especially the Rafah border crossing , " Hamas spokesman Ismail Radwan said .
Still , Egyptian sources said Israel has not formally rejected a plan for a lull or ceasefire with Hamas .
They said Hamas missile strikes were being directed by Iran , who has provided the lion 's share of foreign funding to the Islamic regime .
" In the end , Olmert will make his decision based on what he heard from Bush , " an Egyptian diplomat said .
" If there is an Israeli invasion , it is clear that Bush gave the green light . "
At LinuxInsider , we ’ve been busy these past few weeks trying to bring you all the most important news from the world of our favorite operating system , as we always do .
But it turns out we missed something .
It was n’t until we began compiling our Linux Starter Kit — which we ’re fervently hoping will help show more of the world the light that is Linux — that we discovered it : Lindependence 2008 .
That ’s right , Lindependence !
Hard on the heels of Independence Day , on July 28 , “ a significant percentage ” of the town of Felton , Calif. , declared independence from Microsoft and pledged to go Redmond - free “ for one week … maybe an entire month , ” its organizers say .
“ If things go right , we can start talking about forever . ”
Lindependence Day
Can you imagine that ?
We have no idea why it has n’t received more media attention , but we ’d like to do our part right here to publicize it , albeit a little bit after the fact .
This is something we all need to know about !
Lindependence Day was apparently preceded by three weeks of town meetings and “ installfests , ” designed to familiarize interested Felton residents with how to go about using different media in order to use Linux .
LiveCDs and bootable thumb drives — “ dual booting for the more daring of residents ” — were among the technologies covered .
Representatives from distros and FOSS ( free and open source software ) programs were available to answer questions and instruct people on use of the software , with support from Mandriva , Fedora , Debian , Ubuntu , AntiX , Wolvix , OpenOffice.org and Codeweavers .
100 Italian Towns
No word yet on how many of Felton ’s 6,000 or so residents participated , but “ I expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay ‘ proprietary free ’ after the week is over , because they will discover what we already know : Linux , FOSS and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in Redmond and Cupertino , ” wrote Larry Cafiero of HeliOS Solutions
West , one of the project ’s organizers , on the Ubuntu Forums .
Videos of the event are online at Digital Tipping Point , which got picked up at LXer , among other blogs .
Perhaps even more telling is that the trend seems to be spreading , with reports suggesting that similar initiatives are coming in Boulder Creek , Calif . ; Portland , Ore. ; Taos , N.M. ; and even Italy , where 21 towns will participate , according to a Lindependence blog .
Whiff of Blood
We do n’t want to be overenthusiastic here , but it seems to us there ’s a whiff in the air of Redmond blood …
“ The Lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of Microsoft ’s biggest advantages : inertia , ” Gerhard Mack , a Montreal - based consultant and Slashdot blogger , agreed .
“ If not for the event , people would just continue using Microsoft products because that ’s what they have always been using , and they would be afraid to try something new on their own , ” Mack told LinuxInsider .
Linux - Based UMPCs
Speaking of cracks in the Windows shield , a report on the Linux Loop last week found that the number of Linux - based ultramobile PCs ( UMPCs ) is now 32 or more , up from just 20 or so in March .
“ Interesting — I really did n’t realize the list was that long , ” responded Linux Loop blogger Johan Moller .
“ Good for us ! ”
Then , of course , there was the news last week that IBM is partnering with Canonical , Red Hat and Novell to deliver Microsoft - free desktop PCs featuring Lotus Notes and Lotus Symphony by 2009 .
There ’s that buzzword again — Microsoft - free !
Vista to Thank
“ The slow adoption of Vista among businesses and budget - conscious CIOs , coupled with the proven success of a new type of Microsoft - free PC in every region , provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for Linux , ” said Kevin Cavanaugh .
“ We ’ll work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry - leading solution . ”
The news was immediately picked up on Slashdot , where more than 400 comments had ensued by Friday — many of them expressing concern about the inclusion of Notes .
“ Great … but can I get one without Lotus Notes too ? ” quipped Dice .
“ To paraphrase Yoda , ‘ Notes leads to anger .
Anger leads to Notes consultants .
Notes consultants lead to suffering ’ , ” agreed Anonymous Coward .
“ 2008 will be known as the year of Lotus Notes on the desktop ! ” added morgan_greywolf .
Power to Adapt
On the other hand : “ This is a perfect example on why IBM stays ahead : they adapt , ” countered Darkness404 .
“ They went from proprietary to open , from DOS to Linux .
From punch cards to computers .
Despite how ‘ old ’ IBM seems , they always seem to adapt , something that some tech companies refuse to do . ”
Indeed , “ One of the weak points of Linux desktops over the years has been access to viable — let alone powerful — productivity applications , ” Charles King , principal analyst with Pund - IT , told LinuxInsider .
“ IBM ’s Lotus suite has been around for years , is used by billions worldwide , and is well understood and well established , ” King added .
“ For Red Hat , Novell and Canonical , being able to leverage Lotus on desktop PCs is a real opportunity . ”
Microsoft is well established in businesses for some very good reasons , but “ if a company is thinking of moving to a new platform , this mixture of IBM and these partners gives it some options for having a solid business productivity experience with Linux that would not necessitate the purchase of either Vista or new hardware to support it , ” he concluded .
In other words , Microsoft - free is n’t a totally outrageous idea , even in the business world .
One day , it just might happen !
The socialist mayor of Paris , in cooperation with French architects , is about to do what both Hitler and Le Corbusier wanted to accomplish but could n’t : destroy the city .
With a population approximately the size of London ’s , but only half the land area , Paris is both overcrowded and suffering from a housing shortage .
The solution , according to the mayor , is to build large numbers of tower blocks , destroying once and for all the city ’s famous skyline .
It is n’t difficult to detect the crude self - interest and thirst for cultural vandalism behind French architects ’ salivation .
“ This is just the beginning , ” said one of them , Michel Angevin .
“ Paris is going to change , and will look very different soon enough . ”
Never mind that people do n’t want it ; the architects know better what is good for them .
With a lordly contempt for his fellow citizens — and ignoring the fact that Paris is still one of the richest and most productive cities in the world , its architectural conservatism notwithstanding — another architect , Jean Nouvel , urged the city council to go even further in its plan for aesthetic destruction .
“ We need to stop thinking of Paris as a museum city , ” he said .
As it happens , Nouvel , who won the Pritzker Architecture Prize this year , is the architect who managed the supremely difficult feat of producing a museum even more hideous than the Centre Pompidou .
Located near the Eiffel Tower , his Musée du quai Branly , which now houses the national collection of African and Oceanic art , is an eyesore so terrible that for a man of normal aesthetic sensitivity to look at it is sheer torture .
It is the perfect example of the egotism of certain modern architects , who believe that the most important quality of a building is the stamp of the architect ’s originality .
To travel around France , moreover , is to observe the collapse of the country ’s architectural taste and talent .
With very few exceptions , it is impossible to find anything built in the last 50 years that rises above banal — except for buildings that are eye - catchingly brutal and aesthetically destructive of everything for miles around .
Nouvel has said that architecture is “ the petrification of a cultural moment . ”
If so , the moment is a long one , and it spans Europe .
In the 1920s , Le Corbusier wanted to pull down Paris and build something like Novosibirsk ; in the 1950s , the city council of Bath wanted to pull down the Georgian city and replace it with purely functional blocks of the kind that have destroyed other townscapes in Britain ; in the same decade , Joop den Uyl , then an Amsterdam city councillor and eventually prime minister of the Netherlands , wanted to pull down seventeenth - century Amsterdam and replace it with housing projects that he considered more socially just and efficient .
The only explanation for such wishes is a ravening egotism .
In order even to entertain an idea like den Uyl ’s , one must believe both that what one inherits from the past is worth nothing , and that one is capable by one ’s unaided , brilliant self of doing better .
The result is the Musée du quai Branly .
Look upon it and despair .
WASHINGTON --
The housing and financial crisis convulsing the U.S. is powering a new wave of government regulation of business and the economy .
Federal and state governments alike are increasingly hands - on in their effort to deal with failing businesses , plunging house prices , worthless mortgages and soaring energy prices .
The steps add up to a major challenge to the movement toward deregulation that has defined American governance for much of the past quarter - century since the " Reagan Revolution " of the early 1980s .
In fact , ...
A rogue trader has cost French bank Société Générale € 4.9bn ( £ 3.7 bn ) in the biggest fraud in financial history .
News of the fraud , which will virtually wipe out 2007 profits at France 's second - largest bank , sent shockwaves through European markets , already battered by the escalating credit crisis .
SocGen also revealed that it is being forced to make further write - downs of € 2bn relating to the credit crisis and said it would have to raise € 5.5 bn in fresh capital to strengthen its balance sheet .
The bank gave few details about the trader , who has already been dubbed " the French Nick Leeson " .
Leeson was the rogue trader who brought down Barings Bank in 1995 , with losses of £ 800 m .
But the SocGen fraud is more than four times that figure .
By late afternoon SocGen had filed a formal complaint with the public prosecutor in Nanterre , on the outskirts of Paris , on three main charges : fraudulent falsification of banking records , use of such records and computer fraud .
The bank insisted that it had taken this measure to " contain the impact of the loss " .
While the bank refused to name him , it is now known that he is 31 - year - old Jerome Kerviel , who it worked in the bank 's Delta One products team in Paris .
SocGen 's Delta
One business includes programme trading , exchange traded funds ( ETFs ) , swaps , index and quantitative trading .
Kerviel joined the bank in the summer of 2000 .
SocGen , founded in 1864 and one of France 's most prestigious companies , said the Paris - based trader had confessed to his actions , which involved " massive " fraudulent positions in 2007 and 2008 , beyond his " limited authority " .
The trader has been responsible for " plain vanilla futures hedging on European equity market indices " , the bank said .
It discovered the fraud last weekend and decided to close the positions as soon as possible .
Their size , and the very unfavourable market conditions in which it was forced to unravel the trades , led to the € 4.9 bn hit .
" Aided by his in - depth knowledge of the control procedures resulting from his former employment in the middle - office , he managed to conceal these positions through a scheme of elaborate fictitious transactions , " the bank said .
A " thorough analysis " of all positions in his department has been undertaken , which has confirmed the " isolated and exceptional nature of this fraud " .
The trader has confessed to the fraud , SocGen said , and is in the process of being dismissed , as are his managers .
SocGen said chairman and chief executive Daniel Bouton had offered his resignation but this was rejected .
The board reaffirmed its confidence in him and in the top management and said it has asked Bouton to " lead the group back on track for profitable growth " .
Bouton said he and his deputy Philippe Citerne will both give up their salary until June 30 in the light of the losses .
Speaking at a hastily called press conference in Paris this morning , Bouton said the rogue trader was acting alone and does not appear to have gained personally from the unauthorised trading .
He added : " I do n't know the person and his motives are totally irrational . "
SocGen executives refused to account for why the trader had been allowed to leave the building - and possibly flee the country - without yet being interviewed by police .
The French prime minister , François Fillon , speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos , attempted to reassure markets , saying that while the SocGen situation was serious , it was not tied to the current turbulence .
The Bank of France has set up an inquiry and the French government was following the situation with " very , very great attention , " Fillon told reporters .
" Société Générale has had to deal with a very major case of fraud .
It is a serious case but at the same time it has nothing to do with the situation on the financial markets , " he said .
" I note that ( SocGen ) has taken very significant measures to tackle this situation .
I note that the Bank of France indicated that it was n't worried about the solidity of this banking establishment .
I am happy about that .
" Trading in the bank 's shares was briefly suspended on the Paris market this morning .
When dealing resumed , they fell just over 4 % to € 75.87 , taking their loss since the start of the year to more than 20 % .
News of the fraud and credit crunch write - downs sent shockwaves through the banking sector this morning .
Rival French bank BNP Paribas rushed to reassure the market , saying it does not expect any exceptional losses in its 2007 accounts that would justify a profit warning .
" The process of closing the 2007 accounts of BNP Paribas is continuing in a satisfactory manner , " it said in a statement .
" It has not revealed any loss of item that would justify any particular warning to the market . "
In an effort to allay fears over its figures , the bank said it would publish its preliminary results for 2007 next week .
Roger Steare , professor of organisational ethics at Cass Business School in London said the SocGen scandal was further evidence of a " systemic deficit in ethical values " in the banking industry .
He said : " This latest rogue trader scandal is yet more evidence that while rules - based regulation and controls work for kids in the playground , it wo n't stop adults doing the wrong thing .
" The banking industry used to have a reputation for honesty , trust and prudence .
This latest scandal , on top of the massive losses in credit markets , and the ongoing incidence of mis-selling to retail customers , indicates that there is a systemic deficit in ethical values within the banking industry . "
SocGen said chairman and chief executive Daniel Bouton had offered his resignation but this was rejected .

And neither does his campaign staff .
In an interview Wednesday , McCain was asked how many houses he and his wife own .
His response :
I think —
I ’ll have my staff get to you .
Well , according to his staff , they own “ at least four . ”
At least ?
How could someone not know how many homes they own ?
How many homes would you have to own in order to start losing track of them ?
Newsweek estimated this summer that the McCains own at least seven properties .
Remember that in 2004 the Bush campaign blasted John Kerry and his wife for owning five homes .
And a few days earlier , McCain said his threshold for considering someone rich is $ 5 million .
Of course , McCain got rich the old fashioned way — he married it .
UPDATE : The McCain camp is responding to this gaffe in an , um , creative way .
According to McCain spokesman Brian Rogers it does n’t matter how many homes McCain owns now , because “ This is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years — in prison . ”
Remember when Joe Biden made fun of Rudy Giuliani because every sentence of his contained a noun , a verb , and 9/11 ?
McCain is making his sentences almost the same way : noun verb P.O.W .
UPDATE 2 : Politico now reports that the McCains own at least eight homes , and five of them were purchased in the last four years .
Not only that , but the McCains increased their budget for “ household employees ” to $ 273,000 in 2007 , according to their tax returns — more each year for servants than the median sales price for a home in the US ( $ 215,000 ) .
By Tony Iltis
August 27 , 2008 -- Since the European Union - brokered ceasefire brought the shooting war between Georgia and Russia to an end on August 12 , there has been a war of words between Russia and the West .
One point of contention is the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia - proper ( that is , Georgia excluding the de facto independent territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia ) , in particular the towns of Gori , Zugdidi and Senaki and the port of Poti .
The war began with Georgia ’s August 7 attack on the territory of South Ossetia .
Russia responded with a military assault that first drove Georgian troops out of South Ossetia , then continued to advance within Georgia - proper .
Russia agreed to withdraw when it signed the ceasefire and has since indicated that it is doing so — but slowly , and not before systematically destroying Georgia ’s military capacity .
A bigger difference , based on competing interpretations of what is and is n’t Georgian territory , is Russia ’s stated intention to maintain a beefed - up peacekeeping presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Western leaders have stressed recognition of Georgia ’s official borders , which includes the breakaway territories .
US President George Bush stated on August 16 that “ Georgia ’s borders should command the same respect as every other nation ’s .
There ’s no room for debate on this matter . ”
Not Georgian
What this ignores is not only that most of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been outside Georgia ’s control since the early 1990s , but that the Abkhazians and Ossetians ( who are both distinct non-Georgian nationalities ) have shown in repeated referendums , as well as in the wars that followed the break - up of the Soviet Union in 1991 , that they have no desire to be under Georgian rule .
While the Western media and politicians have portrayed the current war as Russian “ great power ” aggression against its much smaller neighbour , this ignores the fact that war was started by Georgia ’s August 7 blitzkrieg that levelled South Ossetia ’s capital Tskhinvali .
Anywhere between “ dozens ” and 1500 civilians were killed , depending on the source , and 30 - 40,000 refugees ( half the population ) fled across the border to North Ossetia - Alania , a republic within the Russian Federation .
Since coming to power with Western support in 2003 , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvilli has allied his country closely to the West .
However , since Georgia provoked the current war with Russia , it became clear that the West was not keen to get involved in a war with nuclear - armed Russia in support of its ally ’s territorial ambitions .
Despite military assistance from the US and Israel , the Georgian army collapsed in disarray before the Russian advance .
Russian and South Ossetian forces have been able to seize significant quantities of abandoned US and Israeli military hardware .
On August 21 , there were thousands - strong protests in Tskhinvali and the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi demanding Russian recognition of independence of the territories .
The recognition of Kosova ’s independence from Serbia ( under Western supervision ) has created a precedent in international law .
Russia has refused to recognise Kosovan independence but has indicated that it could change this position in exchange for Western recognition of independence for Abkhazia and South Ossetia ( under Russian supervision ) .
Nationalism
The conflicting nationalisms in the Caucasus is a result of the colonisation of the highly diverse region by the Russian empire , beginning in the 18th century .
This was followed by the promise of national liberation and equality between peoples by the 1917 Russian Revolution .
This promise was betrayed when the revolution degenerated into bureaucratic dictatorship under Joseph Stalin .
National movements subsequently played an important role in the restoration of capitalism in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s .
Full control by the Russian empire of the Caucasus by 1864 was accompanied by ethnic cleansing of Muslims , which included about half the Abkhaz population .
After the 1917 revolution , the Bolsheviks recognised the rights of all peoples to self - determination .
While the various nationalities of the North Caucasus ( including Ossetians , Chechens , Ingushetians and the myriad of Dagestani ethnicities ) formed the pro-Bolshevik Mountain Soviet Republic ( MSR ) , Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan became anti-Bolshevik independent states propped up by British troops .
Between 1918 and 1921 , what started as tax revolts by South Ossetians against the Georgian regime developed into full scale warfare , with the South Ossetians seeking to be united with their North Ossetian compatriots in the MSR , which from 1919 was an autonomous part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) .
Georgian reprisals against the revolt took 18,000 lives .
Keen to dislodge the British , the Red Army came to the aid of the Ossetians , the Abkhaz and a revolt by Georgian Bolsheviks .
A Georgian Soviet Republic was established .
Similar processes established Soviet rule in Azerbaijan and Armenia .
Painfully aware of the resentment towards Russians in the nations colonised by the Tsarist empire , Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin stressed equality between nations .
In 1922 , he clashed with Stalin , then commissar of nationalities , who despite being Georgian displayed , in Lenin ’s words , “ all the characteristics of a Great Russian bully ” in his attempts to pressure the Georgian Bolsheviks into accepting absorption of their country into the RSFSR .
Stalin lost that fight and in 1922 Georgia , Abkhazia , Armenia and Azerbaijan became equal members of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .
North Ossetia became an autonomous republic within the RSFSR while South Ossetia became an autonomous district of Georgia .
Counter - revolution
However , following Lenin ’s death in 1924 , Stalin led a counter - revolution whereby a bureaucratic caste took power and undid many of the progressive gains of the revolution .
While national equality remained in form , its content was gutted .
In 1931 , Abkhazia was made an autonomous republic within Georgia and Georgian replaced Abkhaz as the official language .
The transmigration of Russians , Armenians and Georgians into Abkhazia was accelerated under Stalin .
In the 1940s , having officially revived Russian nationalism in response to Nazi invasion , Stalin increased arbitrary acts of national oppression .
In the Caucasus this included deporting the entire Chechen and Ingushetian population to Central Asia .
Following Stalin ’s death in 1953 , the extremes of Stalin ’s dictatorship were tempered , including the nationalities policy .
Deported nationalities were allowed to return to their homelands and the suppression of Abkhaz culture ended .
However , while repression decreased , the main lines of bureaucratic dictatorship remained .
For Ossetians in the post - Stalin Soviet Union , the boundary between North Ossetia ( part of the RSFSR ) and South Ossetia ( part of Georgia ) became purely administrative , of no more significance than that between two Australian states .
On the one hand , in both territories the Ossetian language was used in government , education and the media .
On the other hand , as with the rest of the USSR , in neither territory did people actually have a say in choosing their government , or the right to oppose it .
As the Soviet Union began to unravel in the 1980s , nationalism came to the fore as local bureaucratic elites sought to ensure their power in the post - Soviet order .
By 1988 war had broken out between Armenia and Azerbaijan , despite both being constituent republics of the USSR .
The restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union in 1991 was accompanied by its dissolution into constituent republics .
In Georgia , following unsuccessful attempts by Moscow to repress the nationalist tide , dissident and former political prisoner Zviad Gamsakhurdia was elected president in 1990 .
While to Georgians , Gamsakhurdia ’s slogan of “ Georgia for the Georgians ” and his appeals to historical mythology of ancient Georgian kings , represented freedom from Russia , to the Abkhaz and Ossetians it represented a threat to their national rights .
For the Ossetians , the dissolution of the USSR also meant the border between North and South Ossetia became an international frontier .
War and ‘ autonomy ’
In November 1989 , South Ossetia voted to be merged with North Ossetia within the RSFSR , although this was vetoed by the Georgian Soviet government .
A march on Tskhinvali by Gamsakhurdia ’s nationalists led to clashes and the intervention of Soviet troops .
In 1990 , South Ossetia tried to declare itself a constituent republic of the USSR .
Georgia , now under Gamsakhurdia ’s presidency , responded by abolishing South Ossetia ’s autonomy .
By January 1991 , before the USSR had dissolved , the dispute escalated into warfare between Georgian and Ossetian militias .
This war , which ended in 1992 , cost hundreds of lives and created tens of thousands of refugees .
By this time Gamsakhurdia had been overthrown in a military coup and newly independent Georgia was degenerating into civil war .
The peace agreement allowed for de facto independence and a peace keeping force involving Georgian , North and South Ossetian and Russian troops .
Gamsakhurdia ’s successor , Eduard Shevardnadze , who had been the Stalinist head of Soviet Georgia in the 1970s , had reinvented himself as a democratic reformer and then again as a moderate nationalist when the military junta that overthrew Gamsakhurdia offered him the presidency .
While Shevardnadze ended the war in South Ossetia , he started another by invading Abkhazia , which had declared its independence to pre-empt abolition of its autonomous status .
This war ended in Georgian defeat , after the Abkhazians received help from a multi-ethnic North Caucasian volunteer force , the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus , who were accused of ethnic cleansing .
Hundreds of thousands of Georgians fled Abkhazia , leaving the Abkhaz as a demographic majority for the first time since the 19th century .
The 1993 peace agreement left it , like South Ossetia , legally part of Georgia but with a de facto independence guaranteed by Russia .
The US helped bring the ultra-nationalist Saakashvilli to power in 2003 with the aim of using him to pressure Russia .
However , Saakashvilli ’s nationalist adventurism , backed by US and Israeli military aid , has resulted in handing Russia an opportunity to militarily crush Georgia and humiliate its Western allies .
In the brutal history of colonialism , competing nationalism , war and ethnic cleansing that has marked the Caucasus , the example of the early stages of the Russian Revolution stands out as offering a way forward .
The Bolshevik policy of granting national self - determination and seeking to ensure equality between peoples ’ , in contrast to the manipulation and violence used by various powerful interests that have dominated the region , is the only way of ensuring lasting peace .

African Americans are leaving San Francisco because of substandard schools , a lack of affordable housing and the dearth of jobs and black culture , according to a report by a committee looking into the exodus .
The African American Out- migration Task Force , put together by the mayor 's office last year to figure out what can be done to preserve the city 's remaining black population and cultivate new residents , presented its findings at a public hearing Thursday called by Supervisor Chris Daly .
San Francisco's black population has dropped faster than that of any other large U.S. city 's .
It went from 13.4 percent in 1970 to an estimated 6.5 percent in 2005 , according to the census .
Nationally , African Americans make up 12.1 percent of the population .
Much of the blame has been placed on the Redevelopment Agency , which intentionally drove black families and businesses from the Fillmore district in the 1960s and 1970s .
Many residents who attended the nearly four - hour meeting live in the Bayview - Hunters Point area and expressed concern about the redevelopment project now under way there , saying it will continue to reduce the city 's dwindling African American population .
Much of the anger was placed on Lennar Corp. , the developer building 1,600 houses at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard .
Residents say they are being pushed out , so the city can gentrify the area that is the last black neighborhood .
" In San Francisco , we run the risk of losing the entire black population , " said Minister Christopher Muhammad of the Nation of Islam .
" There should be emergency hearings , because this is an emergency . "
In San Francisco , the number of African Americans in very - low - income households has increased , the number of black - owned businesses has declined , and African Americans have the lowest home ownership rates , according to the report .
About 24 percent of black people in the city are living in homes that need severe or moderate repairs , and African Americans make up nearly half of the residents in public housing .
The report suggests such statistics contribute to why African Americans are leaving San Francisco and also explain why black families do not want to move here .
The report recommends improving schools in black areas , adding programs for youth , increasing employment opportunities and promoting business development .
" African Americans in San Francisco lag behind the rest of the city in almost every key economic indicator and face significant barriers to addressing the disparities , " the report states .
The findings were nothing new to residents , who said they have heard it all before .
" We could paper the walls of this building with reports that have been made on this issue , " said Aileen Hernandez , chair of the task force .
" If we are really serious , we need a vision .
" This is a city that still has a problem with discrimination , and many of the things we are talking about are the result of discrimination , " she said .
" Every organization that has anything to do with eliminating discrimination has been underfunded , understaffed and underrecognized . "
Fred Blackwell , head of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency , said the mayor is working on implementing some of the recommendations in the report - like a violence - prevention plan and rebuilding public housing - and that the final report will be presented to the Board of Supervisors within a couple of weeks .
" While Gavin Newsom vacations in Africa , our families are being evicted , going hungry and are unemployed , " said Alicia Schwartz , an organizer at POWER , People Organized to Win Employment Rights .
" We need a real response .
Developer - driven policy in San Francisco is killing my people . "

The glasses were created during volcanic events on the Moon US scientists have found evidence that water was held in the Moon 's interior , challenging some elements of the theory of how Earth 's satellite formed .
The Moon is thought to have been created in a violent collision between Earth and another planet - sized object .
Scientists thought the heat from this impact had vaporised all the water .
But a new study in Nature magazine shows water was delivered to the lunar surface from the interior in volcanic eruptions three billion years ago .
This suggests that water has been a part of the Moon since its early existence .
The discovery came from lunar volcanic glasses , pebble - like beads collected and returned to Earth by the US Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
This confirms that water comes from deep within the mantle of the Moon
Alberto Saal , Brown University
In the decades since , scientists have sought to determine the nature of a class of chemical elements known as volatiles in the multicoloured glasses .
In particular , they searched the glasses for signs of water - but the evidence has remained elusive .
This was consistent with a general consensus that the Moon was dry .
The team , from Brown University , the Carnegie Institution for Science , and Case Western Reserve University , used secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) technology to detect extremely minute quantities of water in glasses and minerals .
" We developed a way to detect as little as five parts per million of water , " said Erik Hauri , from the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC .
" We were really surprised to find a whole lot more in these tiny glass beads , up to 46 parts per million . "
Lost to space
The team then confirmed through a series of tests that hydrogen had been present all along , and the samples had not been infused by hydrogen - rich solar winds or tainted by other volatiles .
" This confirms that water comes from deep within the mantle of the Moon , " said lead author Alberto Saal , assistant professor of geological sciences at Brown University .
" It has nothing to do with secondary processes , such as contamination or solar wind . "
Orange lunar soil found by astronaut Harrison Schmitt in 1972
The researchers believe the water was contained in magma which erupted via " fire fountains " on to the lunar surface more than three billion years ago .
About 95 % of this water vapour was lost during the volcanic activity .
" Since the Moon was thought to be perfectly dehydrated , this is a giant leap from previous estimates , " said co-author Erik Hauri , from the Carnegie Institution .
" It suggests the intriguing possibility that the Moon 's interior might have had as much water as the Earth 's upper mantle .
But even more intriguing :
If the Moon 's volcanoes released 95 % of their water , where did all that water go ? "
Since the Moon 's gravity is too feeble to retain an atmosphere , the researchers speculate that some of the water vapour from the eruptions was probably forced into space .
But some may also have drifted towards the cold poles of the Moon where ice may persist in permanently shadowed craters .
Ancient rocks
The research also might yield additional insight into how long water had been on Earth .
" It suggests that water was present within the Earth before the giant collision that formed the Moon , " Dr Saal explained .
" That points to two possibilities : Water either was not completely vaporised in that collision or it was added a short time - less than 100 million years - afterward by volatiles introduced from the outside , such as with meteorites . "
The glasses analysed in the study colour the lunar soil green or orange .
While most glasses collected on the Moon were produced by melting of rocks during meteorite impacts , these lack the typical characteristics of so - called impact glasses .
In addition , their ages are similar to those of surrounding basaltic rocks , linking them to the Moon 's geological evolution .
Verifying that water is at the Moon 's poles is one goal of Nasa 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission , due to launch later this year .
It is the primary objective of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCross ) scheduled for launch in 2009 .

I ’ve had a little utility that I ’ve been kicking around for some time now that I ’ve found to be quite useful in my JavaScript application - building endeavors .
It ’s a super - simple templating function that is fast , caches quickly , and is easy to use .
I have a couple tricks that I use to make it real fun to mess with .
Here ’s the source code to the templating function ( a more - refined version of this code will be in my upcoming book Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja ) :
// Simple JavaScript Templating // John Resig - https://johnresig.com/
- MIT Licensed ( function ( ) { var cache = {} ; this .tmpl = function tmpl ( str , data ) { //
Figure out if we 're getting a template , or if we need to // load the template - and be sure to cache the result .
var fn = !/\W/.test( str ) ? cache[str ] = cache[ str ] || tmpl( document.getElementById(str).innerHTML ) : //
Generate a reusable function that will serve as a template // generator ( and which will be cached ) .
new Function ( " obj " , " var p= [ ] , print=function (){p.push.apply ( p, arguments ) ;} ; " + //
Introduce the data as local variables using with ( ) {} " with ( obj ) {p.push ( ' " + //
Convert the template into pure JavaScript str .replace (/[ \r\t
] /g , " " ) .split ( " < % " ) . join ( " \t " ) .replace ( /(( ^ | % > ) [ ^\t ] * ) '/g , " $ 1\r " ) .replace (/\t=(.*? ) %>/g , " ' , $ 1 , ' " ) .split ( " \t " ) . join ( " ' ) ; " ) .split( " % > " ) . join ( " p.push ( ' " ) . split ( " \r " ) . join ( " \\ ' " ) + " ' ) ; }return p.join ( ' ' ) ; " ) ; //
Provide some basic currying to the user return data ? fn( data ) : fn ; } ; } ) ( ) ;
You would use it against templates written like this ( it does n’t have to be in this particular manner – but it ’s a style that I enjoy ) :
< script type =" text / html " id =" item_tmpl " > < div id= " < % =id % > " class= " <%=( i % 2 == 1 ? " even " : " " ) % > " > < div class = " grid_1 alpha right " > < img class = " righted " src= " <%=profile_image_url % > " /> </div> < div class = " grid_6 omega contents " > < p ><b>< a href= " /<%=from_user % >" ><%=from_user %></a>:</b> <% =text %></p> </div> </div > </ script >
You can also inline script :
< script type =" text / html " id =" user_tmpl " > < % for ( var i = 0 ; i < users.
length ; i++ ) { %> < li >< a href= " <%=users[i].url % >" ><%=users[i].name %></a></li> <% } %> </ script >
Quick tip : Embedding scripts in your page that have a unknown content - type ( such is the case here – the browser does n’t know how to execute a text / html script ) are simply ignored by the browser – and by search engines and screenreaders .
It ’s a perfect cloaking device for sneaking templates into your page .
I like to use this technique for quick - and - dirty cases where I just need a little template or two on the page and want something light and fast .
and you would use it from script like so :
var results = document.getElementById(" results " ) ; results.innerHTML
= tmpl ( " item_tmpl " , dataObject ) ;
You could pre-compile the results for later use .
If you call the templating function with only an ID ( or a template code ) then it ’ll return a pre-compiled function that you can execute later :
var show_user = tmpl ( “ item_tmpl ” ) , html = “ ” ;
for ( var i = 0 ; i < users.
length ; i++ ) { html += show_user ( users [ i ] ) ; }[/js ]
The biggest falling - down of the method , at this point , is the parsing / conversion code - it could probably use a little love .
It does use one technique that I enjoy , though :
If you 're searching and replacing through a string with a static search and a static replace it 's faster to perform the action with . split ( “ match ” ) .
join ( “ replace ” ) – which seems counter - intuitive but it manages to work that way in most modern browsers .
( There are changes going in place to grossly improve the performance of .replace ( / match/g , " replace " ) in the next version of Firefox – so the previous statement wo n’t be the case for long . )
Feel free to have fun with it – I ’d be very curious to see what mutations occur with the script .
Since it ’s so simple it seems like there ’s a lot that can still be done with it .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Russia 's use of strategic bombers and ballistic missiles against Georgia 's civilians outside of the South Ossetian conflict is " far disproportionate " to Georgia 's alleged attack on Russian peacekeepers , a senior U.S. official said Saturday .
The official was not authorized to speak on the record due to the sensitive nature of the diplomacy .
Russia 's use of its potent air weaponry signals a " severe " and " dangerous escalation in the crisis , " the official said .
" For the life of me , I can't image that being a proportionate response to the charge that Georgia has attacked Russian peacekeepers , " the official said .
" It 's hard for us to understand what Russia 's plan is here . "
The official said Russia is probably trying to destabilize Georgia politically to kill its chances of joining NATO .
Georgia wants to join NATO , but Russia opposes the move , concerned that the alliance 's eastward march will erode its influence .
NATO rejected Georgia 's membership bid in April despite strong lobbying from U.S. President Bush , though the alliance promised that Georgia could join at a later date .

Still , Georgia bears some of the blame for the fighting over South Ossetia , the official said .
Recently , the United States has had " very blunt exchanges with " Georgia , telling its leaders that they have no chance of winning a war with Russia and that they should stick to a path of diplomacy .

The official said European allies have told the United States that Russia has " crossed a line of unacceptable behavior " and should " expect international condemnation . "
" I do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies , " he said .
The United Sates , Britain and NATO on Friday called for a cease - fire .
And on Saturday , French President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed an immediate cease - fire as part of a three - step plan to end fighting .
Sarkozy 's proposal calls for the return of Russian and Georgian troops to their former positions and requires Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected .
A statement from Sarkozy 's office did not provide further details on the plan .
The official also said the State Department has authorized only the voluntary departure of dependents of U.S. embassy employees from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi .
The official said he did not know how many dependents would choose to leave .
Meanwhile , the U.N. Security Council held a private meeting on Georgia on Saturday , though it seemed unlikely that there would be any immediate agreement on a statement on the conflict .
The U.S. , European Union and international security organizations on Friday called for an end to the fighting
Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Friday discussed the conflict in Beijing , where they attended the opening of the Summer Olympics .
The EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were sending envoys to Georgia to secure a cease - fire , but a senior U.S. State Department official said the United States would send only a representative after a cease - fire is in place .
The European Union said it was working with other parties " towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict . "
EU spokeswoman Christina Gallach told CNN : " We think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction . "

If you are planning on doing a clean install of Windows on your PC , you will more than likely have to reactivate Windows , either online or over the phone .
Normally , the online reactivation will work just fine as long as the hardware on your computer has n’t changed very much since the OS was originally installed and the version of Windows is exactly the same as the version that shipped with the computer .
If you have swapped out hard drives , graphics cards , memory , etc over time , then you might run into problems when you try to reactivate Windows online using the same product key .
In these cases , you will have to call Microsoft and do an over the phone activation .
If the hardware has n’t changed too much , you can make a backup of the information that Windows uses to ensure your copy is valid and then restore it after the reinstall , which I explain below using a freeware program .
Download Recovery Media
If the computer came installed with an OEM version of Windows and you perform a clean install with a retail version of Windows , it also wo n’t activate online .
Previously , new PCs came with an OEM DVD that allowed you to reinstall Windows , but in the last few years most PCs now have a separate recovery partition that lets you restore directly from the hard drive .
You should n’t have any problem activating Windows if you restore this way .
If you do n’t have the DVD or recovery drive , you can either call Microsoft and try to activate by phone or you can directly download the ISO image files from Microsoft , but you will definitely need to have the product key from the COA sticker on the computer .
In order to download Windows 7 recovery media , you have to enter a valid product key before it will let you download the ISO file .
For Windows 8.1 , you are not required to provide a product key for the download .
You can get the Windows 8.1 ISO from the Create Media Reset page on Microsoft ’s website .
It ’s worth noting that for years you could download Windows 7 ISO images from DigitalRiver , an official distributor of Microsoft software .
However , those have all been taken down and no longer work .
Your only legal sources are the links above from Microsoft .
Another item to note is that if your computer has Windows 8 , the key wo n’t be able to activate Windows 8.1 .
The same is true if you have a Windows 8.1 key and are trying to activate Windows 8 .
If you need a Windows 8 ISO image , then check out the Upgrade Windows with product key only page .
Here you enter your product key and it will download the correct ISO image that can be activated for that specific key .
Windows XP
In Windows XP , you can avoid having to reactivate by simply copying a file from your Windows directory and saving it external media .
When Windows XP is first activated , it creates a file called WPA.DBL and stores it in the C : \Windows \System32 directory .
Copy this file to your external storage device and keep it handy .
When you go to reinstall Windows , you ’ll reach the point where you have to activate .
Decline the activation and complete the installation .
Now you ’ll need to restart your computer in Safe Mode by pressing F8 on startup to get into the Advanced Boot Options menu .
Go to C : \Windows \System32 and you should see a file called WPA.DBL already there .
Simply rename it to something like WPA.OLD and then copy your backup version of WPA.
DBL to the current location .
Restart the computer and Windows XP should now be activated and working normally .
Remember that this will only work if you use the WPA.
DBL file from the same computer that Windows XP was originally activated on .
If you install XP on a different machine and try to copy the WPA.
DBL file there , it wo n’t activate .
Windows Vista , 7 , 8
If you are running Windows Vista , 7 or higher , you wo n’t be able to simply copy one file in order to avoid the activation problem .
There is a lot more information that is required , which makes it a lot more complicated .
Luckily , there is a freeware program called Advanced Tokens Manager that will make a copy of all the activation data for you and allow you to easily restore it later on .
Once you download it and unzip the files , go ahead and run the executable file .
It does n’t require any installation , so that ’s nice .
On the main screen , it will start detecting any valid Windows and Office products .
If all works out well , the status should detect your version of Windows and it should display the product key along with the license status .
To backup the data , just click the Activation Backup button .
A fairly large dialog will pop up that basically explains all the features and the requirements in order for the activation to properly work .
Make sure you read it carefully .
The main points here are what I had already mentioned above : do n’t make major hardware changes when performing the restore and make sure the OS edition is the same .
Go ahead and click Yes and the backup will be created in a new folder called Windows Activation Backup , located in the same folder as the EXE file .
You ’ll want to make sure to copy this folder to some external media before you reinstall Windows .
Once you have loaded Windows , simply download and run the program again .
Make sure to copy the backup folder into the same folder as the EXE file .
The program will detect the backup folder and the button will change to Activation Restore .
Click on that and when it asks you if you are sure , click Yes .
Wait about a minute or so and if the program succeeds , you will get a Success message .
At this point , you should be good to go with an activated copy of Windows .
Note that if you Microsoft Office installed also , you can click the Office Activation Backup button and it will allow you to back that data up separately .
The only issue with Advanced Tokens Manager is that it does not fully support Windows 8.1 .
It can save all the activation data , but it can only restore activation for Windows 8.1 copies that were activated by phone .
If activated online , it wo n’t be able to restore properly .
The developers say they are in the process of trying to figure this out , but there has been no update to the program September 2013 , so that ’s not a good sign .
Either way , it works well for Windows Vista , Windows 7 and Windows 8 .
If you have any questions , post a comment .
Enjoy !
OSCON The Mozilla Public License ( MPL ) is the latest casualty of Google 's decision to remove open - source licenses from its popular code hosting service .
The search giant has said Google Code is no longer accepting projects licensed under MPL , although existing MPL - licensed code is allowed to stay .
The move comes two years after Google Code launched , when MPL was one of just seven licenses Google allowed developers to use .
Others included Apache , BSD and the Free Software Foundation 's GPL and LGPL .
Google 's MPL ban follows the block on FSF 's Affero GPL .
That decision 's seen a number of projects abandon Google Code for rival hosts .
As with Affero , the reasons for Google 's decision are not entirely clear .
On the one hand , it sounds like Google is using its critical mass to force an industry reduction in the number of open - source licenses .
Open source programs manager Chris DiBona said - as with Affero - the move is designed to stop license proliferation inside Google Code .
A decent objective .
He told the O'Reilly Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) developers are welcome to host MPL projects elsewhere , just not on Google Code .
He noted you could still build plug-ins for Mozilla 's Firefox browser without licensing under MPL .
Here 's where the proliferation argument stumbles , though .
DiBona said MPL is not widely used to justify a place on Google Code - also the reason given for blocking Affero .
OK , so proliferation as a concept is bad .
Proliferation is not bad , though , when a license grows in popularity .
Two things are needed to pass muster on Google Code : to be used in " thousands " not " hundreds " of projects , plus a dose of " gut measure " from DiBona and his team .
" It 's so arbitrary , " DiBona told The Reg .
It ’s Kafkaesque in its simplicity .
It really , though , sounds like Google is concerned about the threat some licenses might pose in terms of code authors and hosts ( Google ) getting prosecuted by holders of intellectual property ( IP ) and by the degree of ownership over its own code Google might have to surrender .
Recalling Microsoft saber rattling ( here and here ) over IP in open source , DiBona told OSCON : " Most open source licenses have not a thing to say explicitly about patents or trade marks . "
He added : " That 's the reason we use the Apache license as the default license , " for Google 's projects .
So , no surprise : Apache is considered " safe " for developers , and safe for Google 's own business .
This could certainly explain Google 's aversion to Affero , which says companies like Google running services are distributing code and must allow consumers of those services to modify and pass on that code .
That could threaten the Google 's secret algorithmic sauce .
MSL , though , seems relatively harmless .
And , how can Google dump MPL when it still seems to accept GPL , a license Microsoft takes strong exception to .
As DiBona told us of the decision to drop MPL : " We [ Google ] will be unpopular for a while . " ®

AS we approach July 4 , it is worth reminding ourselves of America ’s foundational idea .
This country is set apart from the rest of the world because of its unparalleled commitment to personal freedom and the dignity of the individual .
It is a vision captured in the guarantee of freedom of speech , freedom of religion , due process of law , equal protection under the law and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure and cruel and unusual punishment .
We do not always live up to these aspirations .
Over time , we have embarrassed ourselves and tarnished our image as a country that is respectful of civil liberties .
We have persecuted dissenters , interned the innocent , suspended habeas corpus , invaded reasonable expectations of privacy .
We have even engaged in torture .
What , then , can we do to see to it that we more reliably honor our core values ?
Here ’s a start .
Presidents have a wide range of official advisers .
There is a secretary of defense , a secretary of labor , a national security adviser , to name just a few .
The next president should create a new executive branch position : a civil liberties adviser .
Within the highest councils of every administration there should be a respected public official whose charge it is to defend our civil liberties against all comers .
Many administrations have included high - level officials who have been strong advocates for civil liberties , even though this was not their explicit job description .
At times , such officials have made a real difference .
During World War I , for example , the administration of Woodrow Wilson conducted a devastating campaign to squelch dissent .
Although the Justice Department vigorously supported this campaign  prosecuting some 2,000 people for criticizing Wilson ’s war policies  several key figures in the department ( most notably John Lord O’Brian and Alfred Bettman ) effectively moderated the government ’s campaign of repression .
A hundred years after Alzheimer 's disease was discovered , a cure for the degenerative condition that strips sufferers of their memory and personality remains a dream .
The main advances have been in drugs to control symptoms such as agitation and restlessness .
Restoring memory and cognitive ability has proved much harder .
That is why the publication last week of research showing that an old Russian drug once prescribed for hay fever may be the most effective treatment yet for the devastating condition has captured the attention of scientists and patients ' groups .
A single 20 mg pill of the drug , called Dimebon , taken three times a day , appears to be twice as effective in improving cognitive performance and preventing deterioration in memory as existing drugs .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The discovery was greeted by charities as perhaps the most exciting development in treatment of the disease .
Existing drugs – cholinesterase inhibitors such as Aricept – have limited effects and were introduced over a decade ago .
According to the American researchers who led the trial , Dimebon is the furthest advanced of 65 agents being investigated for Alzheimer 's , and holds the most promise .
However , British experts cautioned that the results were from a single trial of the drug , which is not licensed for Alzheimer 's , and said further studies were necessary .
A second international trial of the drug , which started last month in the USA , Europe and South America , is due to be completed by the end of the year .
Dimebon was used as an antihistamine in Russia 20 years ago , but it was withdrawn from the market when newer drugs superseded it .
Investigations by the Russian Academy of Sciences revealed that it had a potential neuroprotective effect and it was bought by a US company , Medivation .
The company asked Professor Rachelle Doody , director of the Alzheimer 's and Memory Disorders Center at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , to lead the randomised trial run by American and Russian scientists .
It involved 183 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer 's in 11 hospitals in Russia .
Doody , who set up the Houston centre in 1987 , is one of the world 's leading researchers on Alzheimer's .
She was the lead investigator in the trials of Aricept , the best - known existing Alzheimer 's drug .
The results of the Dimebon trial she led , published last week in The Lancet , show that it improved performance on all five rating scales used to assess Alzheimer 's patients , including cognitive performance , behaviour and capacity to carry out ordinary daily activities .
Patients taking the drug scored better than they did at the start of the study , while those taking placebo got worse over the initial six - month period of the trial .
In a smaller group of patients who continued with the drug for a further six months , an even greater gap of 6.9 points on the cognitive performance test opened up between those on the drug and those on placebo .
This compares with a 2.5 - to three - point gain in trials of existing drugs .
Doody said : " I was surprised that all five of the outcome measures were positive and that the benefit [ against placebo ] widened over time .
You do n't see that with the other drugs ...
But this was n't a comparison study – you can't say that makes Dimebon better than the other drugs . "
She added : " I am very happy with the results .
They show a clear signal and I am hopeful that the new international study which started last month will replicate them .
US regulators have indicated that the trials are potentially acceptable as evidence for approval [ for a licence ] .
There are a couple of dozen agents I am working on , and 65 that I follow , and the good news is that this is the furthest along in Alzheimer 's research . "
Clive Ballard of the Alzheimer 's Society said the findings were " encouraging " and the discovery of a new application for an old drug was " potentially exciting " .
But it was a single trial of a small size and the results needed confirming , he said .
Caution was also expressed by Professors Alastair Burns of the University of Manchester and Robin Jacoby of the University of Oxford , who wrote in a commentary in The Lancet : " Addition of treatment options is good news for patients and clinicians – it promotes choice and offers the possibility of bespoke treatment packages which maximise the chances of response .
[ The ] trial shows that Dimebon is better than placebo which is no mean feat considering the positive placebo responses in dementia . "
But Jacoby said that he retained a " healthy scepticism " about the findings .
" They need to be replicated before I will start prescribing it , " he said .
If the results are replicated , it will be a boost for a new approach to drug research – taking old drugs and investigating their potential in other areas of medicine .
Old drugs can go rapidly into clinical trials for new conditions because they are known to be safe .
This speeds up development and cuts the cost .
A cure for Alzheimer 's is not imminent , but it 's good news that an old drug may be an effective treatment .
Everything hangs on the second Dimebon trial now under way .
Alzheimer 's : the facts
About 400,000 people suffer from Alzheimer 's in the UK and 25 million worldwide .
It is the commonest form of dementia , costing £ 17bn in the UK for care and treatment .
The condition is caused by the accumulation of protein deposits in the brain , producing the dementia symptoms .
There are three drugs that claim to halt the progress of the disease ( but not to reverse it ) – Aricept , Reminyl and Exelon .
In 2006 , the NHS 's use of these drugs was restricted to the moderate stage of the disease by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence because of their limited effect .
There are currently no drugs available on the NHS for the tens of thousands of patients in the UK with mild Alzheimer's .
IT MAY be time for some summer exercise in America .
Roughly a quarter of all adults , split roughly evenly between men and women , are obese , according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , a government body .
In medical terms , a person is obese when his weight to height ratio ( or body mass index ) is over 30 .
Mississippi , home of the mud-pie , is the fattest state in the union , with nearly a third of its residents considered obese .
Neighbouring Alabama and Tennessee are similarly porky .
Adults in the north - east and the West are among the leanest , but trim Colorado is the only state with less than a fifth of adults reckoned to be obese , perhaps because of the hiking trails , high altitude and outdoors lifestyle .

It is one thing to know something intellectually , and quite another to see it suddenly happen before your eyes .
I experienced such a moment in 2005 , during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , when I watched ( via the Internet ) as police officers went door - to - door in New Orleans neighborhoods , forced law - abiding citizens into the streets , cuffed them , and then searched their homes for firearms before leaving them bewildered and helpless .
There were no warrants involved .
No probable cause was mentioned .
No charges of wrong - doing were filed .
Intimidation and brute force were the order of the day .
And as much as I wish I could believe otherwise , I 'm afraid that what we saw in New Orleans is merely a preview of coming attractions .
Since September 11 , 2001 , the federal government has been busily advancing preparations for the day when it might impose martial law throughout the United States , thus presenting us with the specter of the sort of thuggery we witnessed in New Orleans being carried out all across this " land of the free . "
A quasi-legal apparatus has already been put into place for this , via such legislation as the PATRIOT Act , the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , the Military Commissions Act , and the National Security and Homeland Security Directive .
But legislation , although important in creating the illusion of legitimacy , is only one of the two boots with which the authoritarian state tramples freedom ; the other is propaganda , and it is even more essential than force because it allows the state to conquer by stealth , and thus with a minimum of effort .
The state that employs only force to achieve its aims will rule only as long as it can subdue the people ; but if it can successfully use propaganda , it can rule indefinitely because the people will subdue themselves .
Propaganda deludes the slave into seeing his servitude as sacrifice , even as an honor .
It transforms political prisoners into the enemies of the people , turns massacres into purgings , makes partisanism look like saintly perseverance , sells torture as retribution , portrays dissent as sabotage , and masks aggression in the guise of crusading .
As Adolf Hitler observed in Mein Kampf , " By an able and persistent use of propaganda heaven itself can be presented to the people as if it were hell and , vice versa , the most miserable kind of life can be presented as if it were paradise . ”
And of all the varied forms of propaganda , religious propaganda is by far the most effective ; for , it provides fallible men with the sanction of heaven , which must not be resisted nor even questioned .
Our government is well aware of this and , from all indications , is ready to use religious propaganda in order to help pacify the American population in the event that martial law is declared .
For years , rumors circulated to the effect that the U.S. government would use members of the clergy in efforts to pacify Americans should martial law ever be declared .
Many scoffed at the idea , calling it so much conspiracy theory nonsense .
Then , in 2007 , KSLA Channel 12 in Shreveport , Louisiana , reported that , following Hurricane Katrina , " clergy response teams " were utilized to assist the government with public relations ( click here to watch the video ) .
According to the story , such teams will likely be used in future emergency situations , with an emphasis on their potential role in a martial law scenario .
Here 's a quote from the story :
Such clergy response teams would walk a tight - rope during martial law between the demands of the government on the one side , versus the wishes of the public on the other .
" In a lot of cases , these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they 're helping to diffuse that situation , " assured Sandy Davis .
He serves as the director of the Caddo - Bossier Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness .
A member of one such clergy response team , Dr. Durell Tuberville , was interviewed by KSLA , and stated that Christians have a responsibility to obey the government , no matter what .
" The government 's established by the Lord , " said Tuberville .
" That 's what we believe in the Christian faith .
That 's what 's stated in the scripture . "
As a Christian myself , I understand where people like Dr. Tuberville are coming from .
I remember my ninth - grade Government teacher telling our class ( Christian school , mind you ) that Soviet citizens had no right to defy their government because , no matter how oppressive the Soviet State was , it was " ordained by God " ( when asked about whether the American patriots were right to rebel against England , however , he equivocated ) .
This reasoning is based on several passages of scripture , but particularly on the following remarks made by the Apostle Paul in Romans , chapter 13 ( as the KSLA news story pointed out ) :
Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities .
For there is no authority except from God , and those which exist are established by God .
Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God ; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves .
For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior , but for evil .
Do you want to have no fear of authority ?
Do what is good and you will have praise from the same ; for it is a minister of God to you for good .
But if you do what is evil , be afraid ; for it does not bear the sword for nothing ; for it is a minister of God , an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil .
Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection , not only because of wrath , but also for conscience ' sake .
With these things in mind , I 'd like to take some time to examine the issue of how Christians should react to the prospect of martial law in America .
Government officials are not the highest " authorities " in America
The first thing I would like to point out to people like Dr. Tuberville , who think Christians should obey government officials no matter what because they are " the higher powers , " is that there is another , yet higher power to which even such officials are beholden : the Constitution of the United States .
This Constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ; and all treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land .
Article VI , Section 1 .
It is from the Constitution that our elected officials , both federal and state , derive their office and legitimate powers .
Their powers are delegated , not inherent ; concrete , not elastic , and , as clearly set forth by the 9th and 10th Amendments , they are limited to the specific areas of authority that the Constitution either grants to the Union or denies to the states .
Further , our elected officials are " bound by oath or affirmation " to support the Constitution and its provisions , including the limitations placed upon their own powers :
The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the members of the several state legislatures , and all executive and judicial officers , both of the United States and of the several states , shall be bound by oath or affirmation , to support this Constitution … ( Article VI , Section 3 ) .
Thus , in taking up the powers and responsibilities of political office , our elected officials are also agreeing to place themselves under the law .
This is one of the foundational ideas of the American political system : the concept that everyone is under law and equal in its eyes .
For this reason , if government officials violate the Constitution , their actions are illegal and void of authority , and they are no better than common criminals .
It is absolutely critical that Christians understand this when they contemplate their relationship to the government .
Our elected officials are not the source of their own power ; rather , they are representatives who have been entrusted with the authority of the American people as defined in the United States Constitution .
If they violate that trust , they are as much criminals as the guy who robs your local 7 - 11 store ; they just dress better , make other people use the guns , and almost never go to jail .
Martial Law is Unconstitutional and , therefore , Illegal
The Constitution does not directly address martial law ; however , it does contain a provision that clearly makes martial law impossible .
Consider Article IV , Section IV :
The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , and shall protect each of them against invasion ; and on application of the legislature , or of the executive ( when the legislature cannot be convened ) against domestic violence .
Republican government is civil , representative government ; martial law is military rule .
Since the former is specifically guaranteed here , the latter is necessarily precluded .
This provision , which our government officials are sworn to support as being part of the supreme law of the land , makes martial law unconstitutional and thus illegal .
The moment that martial law is declared , the federal government will have stepped outside of its sphere of lawful powers .
In fact , in a very real way it will have conducted a revolution , as it will have overthrown the legitimate government of the Constitution by force of arms .
The President is Commander in Chief , not Dictator in Chief
The " war powers " of the President are a woefully misunderstood aspect of constitutional law , thanks primarily to the success of Abraham Lincoln 's war and further developments under those who inherited his theory of government .
Said theory boils down to the idea that , technically , anything the government does in order to " safe - guard " the country ( really its own power ) is constitutional .
The Constitution itself differs with that idea .
It describes the " war powers " of the President in Article II , Section II , where we read :
The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several states , when called into the actual service of the United States .
That 's it .
That is the sum total of all the Constitution has to say about the war powers of the President .
Everything else that has developed since the adoption of the Constitution where such powers are concerned , from " peace - keeping " missions to covert operations , is extra-constitutional ( and largely a perversion of the war powers the Constitution grants to Congress in Article I ) .
Indeed , the military powers that presidents exercise today would have seemed kingly to our country 's founders .
Under the American system , presidents were to be limited chief executives , not self - empowering monarchs who could overthrow the rights of the people or commit the country 's military to action for any reason whatsoever .
The history of centuries of blood - letting under the crowned heads of Europe had taught Americans better than to trust such powers in the hands of one individual .
They forgot that lesson rather quickly once they were free to determine their own affairs , but that initial understanding is enshrined in the Constitution 's language to this day , and the reasoning behind it is still just as sound .
The Commander in Chief clause , read as it is plainly written , gives the President authority to act as a sort of commanding general of all U.S. armed forces in their constitutional role of providing for the common defense .
It makes him a unifying military leader , capable of coordinating the country 's defenses in order to repel an aggressor ; it does not make him a dictator , nor does it authorize him to use the military offensively or for law enforcement purposes .
Note that the authority granted in Article II , Section II is military , not civilian , and that it does not release the President from his sworn duty to uphold the Constitution , nor does it revoke the right of the states to a republican form of government .
In response , some will undoubtedly argue that we now face dangers that our country 's founders could not have envisioned , and , for that reason , certain things must change .
But the founders provided us with a means of changing the Constitution in the face of new circumstances or new wishes on the part of the people .
We call this provision the " Amendment Process " ( see Article V ) .
So why is it that our leaders are not using this legitimate , constitutional tool , if indeed they believe that they require additional powers in order to meet modern challenges , and if indeed their motives are pure ?
Defenders of the Bush administration and its congressional allies ( particularly Christians seeking to invoke Romans 13 ) should give serious thought to this question .
Consider that nearly seven years have elapsed since the September 11 , 2001 attacks , and yet , in all that time , in spite of all the powers that Bush and Congress have usurped , they have not once prepared or even suggested a constitutional amendment to legitimize any of it .
And the reason for this ?
Quite simply , they do n't believe they need to legitimize their actions .
They do not recognize any authority above themselves , neither the Constitution of the United States nor the people who elected them .
Beware Government Agents quoting Scripture
The common perception of propaganda is that it is the art of telling lies , but in fact lies are only part of the picture .
No , the true master of propaganda is skilled not only in telling outright lies , but also in employing distortion and half - truth .
For an example of this , consider Romans 13 again .
The standard snake oil sold by the Dr. Tuberville 's of the world ( unwittingly or not ) , where this passage is concerned , is that government is the " higher power " and must be obeyed in all things .
This is what you 're likely to hear when a clergy response team member shows up on your doorstep , flanked by national guardsmen and demanding that you hand over your firearms , supplies , and / or valuables , or that you accompany them to Hotel Halliburton .
Yet , as we have already seen , the Constitution , not the government , is the highest " power " in the United States of America , and those who act outside of it are criminals .
Note also that the Apostle Paul was arguing that Christians should support the " higher powers " because government is ordained by God to be " an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil . "
" Rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior , " Paul tells us , " but for evil , " after which he admonishes us to be " in subjection not only because of wrath , but also for conscience ' sake . "
So what then of a government which , instead of punishing evil , actually practices evil itself ?
Can Paul have been suggesting that Christians should view the evil actions of a lawless power as somehow bearing the approval of God ?
Can a Christian either condone or submit to evil doings " for conscience ' sake " ?
Is it possible to do good by sanctioning , submitting to , or participating in evil ?
As Paul himself was fond of saying , " God forbid ! "
When in Rome ?
At this point , some might argue that the Roman Empire was evil in many ways , and that if Paul informed Christians that they needed to be in subjection to such a regime , surely today 's Christians have no excuse for resisting the will of the U.S. government , constitutional questions aside .
And while I would agree that Rome was certainly a ruthless and brutal government , there are three important things that should be kept in view here :
1 ) Rome did not rule under a supreme Constitution such as we have .
2 ) While Paul instructed Christians to recognize Roman rule , he never once suggested that they should sanction or participate in Roman brutality .
Indeed , the Bible contains a number of passages that instruct us to aid the oppressed ( not to aid in their oppression ) :
Proverbs 24:10 - 12 : " If you are slack [ weak , feeble ] in the day of distress , your strength is limited .
Deliver those who are being taken away to death , and those who are staggering to slaughter , Oh hold {them} back .
If you say , “ See , we did not know this , ” Does He not consider {it} who weighs the hearts ?
And does
He not know {it} who keeps your soul ?
And will He not render to man according to his work ? "
Isaiah 1:16 - 17 : " Wash yourselves , make yourselves clean ; Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight .
Cease to do evil , Learn to do good ;
Seek justice , Reprove the ruthless , Defend the orphan , Plead for the widow . "
Jeremiah 21:12 : " O house of David , thus says the LORD : u2018 Administer justice every morning ;
And deliver the {person} who has been robbed from the power of {his} oppressor , that My wrath may not go forth like fire and burn with none to extinguish {it , } because of the evil of their deeds . ' "
Jeremiah 22:2 - 3 : " Thus says the LORD , u2018 Do justice and righteousness , and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of {his} oppressor .
Also do not mistreat {or} do violence to the stranger , the orphan , or the widow ; and do not shed innocent blood in this place . ' "
The above passages make it clear that no one who claims to fear God should have anything to do with oppressing the innocent ; but , rather , they should actively " reprove " those who do such things and " deliver " those who are being victimized .
Genesis 14 tells the story of how Abraham attacked and overcame a group of kings who had taken his nephew , Lot , captive ; and , in Job 29 , we 're told that , among the good deeds Job was known for , he " delivered the poor who cried for help , and the orphan who had no helper , " and " broke the jaws of the wicked and snatched the prey from his teeth . "
The Bible refers to both Abraham and Job as " righteous " and " upright . "
Further , in I Timothy 5:8 , the Apostle Paul , who wrote Romans 13 , remarks : " But if anyone does not provide for his own , and especially for those of his household , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever . "
Surely " providing " for one 's own involves protecting them from those who would do them harm .
3 ) Two recorded instances from the Apostle Paul 's own life demonstrate that a Christian need not submit to injustice simply because it is perpetrated by agents of the state .
Both examples come to us from the book of Acts .
The first is recorded in Acts 22 , where Roman authorities questioned Paul in relation to his part in a riot that had just taken place in Jerusalem .
Not satisfied with his answers , the Roman " chief captain " ordered that Paul be subjected to a bit of enhanced interrogation , 1st Century style ( they were going to scourge him while questioning him further ) .
Now , Paul was a Roman citizen , and under Roman law it was illegal to scourge a citizen .
Paul pointed this out to his captors in Acts 22:23 , and was spared the torture in favor of a trial .
The second example comes from Acts 25 .
Paul , who was then under trial before Porcius Festus , the Roman governor of Judea , saw that the governor was probably not going to give him a fair trial , and so he invoked the supreme right of a Roman citizen : he appealed to Caesar himself in hope of justice .
He did this respectfully , but resolutely .
Clearly , the Apostle Paul had no problem with questioning authorities or appealing to the law in his defense , and I see no biblical reason why modern Christians are under obligation to act any differently .
The Constitution is our supreme law , our supreme authority ; we have every right to appeal to its provisions and to demand that those provisions be respected and not overthrown .
Conclusion
In summary , be aware of the fact that our government has already begun using religious propaganda to get its way , and that it fully intends to do so again .
Beware those who would preach to you concerning how you should obey them as authorities over you , if they refuse to obey the authority over them .
Beware those who talk about the law if they themselves are law - breakers .
Beware those who would speak to you of " duty , " if they themselves have broken their oaths and violated the trusts of their offices .
Contrary to the propaganda you 're likely to hear in the event of a martial law situation , neither Romans 13 , nor any other passage of scripture , can be twisted to the effect of forcing Christians to buckle under to , participate in , or otherwise sanction , illegal actions or outright atrocities committed by the state .
You who are members of the clergy : could you go door - to - door telling people that God wants them to turn in their guns ( or fuel , or food , or gold ) and to leave themselves bereft and helpless because the state says so ?
You who are members of the military or law enforcement agencies : could you force yourselves on , or actually fire on , otherwise law - abiding American citizens who might only be trying to defend themselves , their property and their families against those who have decided to toss the law out like yesterday 's garbage ?
Could you justly take part in unjust actions ?
How many of history 's wars and other atrocities could have taken place had those ordered to carry them out simply said " No. " ?
Could Rome have enslaved and tortured millions of people without the consent of its soldiers ?
Could any of the tyrants of the past have plundered their citizens had they been forced to wield the sword by themselves ?
Could a single Southern farm have been burned had Northerners not consented to Lincoln 's rampage ?
Could Stalin or Mao have murdered tens of millions of their own countrymen without the assistance of their " Peoples ' " armies ?
Make no mistake , if the United States government ever decides to oppress its own people , for whatever reason , it will not be the President or members of Congress , or the Joint Chiefs who go around intimidating people , kicking in doors , muzzling protest , dividing families , jailing and / or torturing dissenters or carrying off property .
It will be you .
They will expect you to do these things for them .
The question is : can you live with it ?
And even more importantly : can you answer to God for it ?
II Corinthians 5:10 — " For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad . "
( Note — I see no exceptions granted here for those " acting under orders " ) .
Finally , do n't wait for the crisis to come before you act .
The day martial law is declared is not the time to begin doing something about it .
That time is now , today , before it happens .
Start by familiarizing yourself with passages of scripture such as those I 've listed above ; and always consider what the Bible says for itself , not how others would interpret it to their own advantage .
Familiarize yourself with the Constitution , with relevant legislation and presidential executive orders , and with the history of martial law situations and military occupations both here in the U.S. and in other countries .
Share what you learn with your friends and family .
Consider joining up with groups like Ron Paul 's new Campaign for Liberty , where you can work for change alongside other concerned Americans .
Never forget that an intimate knowledge of truth is the best defense against the lies , distortions and half - truths of the propagandists .

The Best of Robert F. Hawes Jr.
Google launched its long hyped Wikipedia competitor Knol earlier today , but despite being open for editing by all , not all users are being treated equally .
Unlike Wikipedia , Knol works around user identities , both with user profile pages , and through the URL structure .
For example , here is my profile page , and here ’s my page on blogs , both with my name in the URL .
Google is promoting the tie - in to profiles as a way to enable experts on particular topics to be easily identified , and couples the profiles with a verification process to make sure the person writing entries is who they say they are .
And this is where Knol turns into a two class process .
To verify a user name on Knol , users must verify their account by phone or credit card .
I sort of expected Knol to exclude non-US phone verification , so that was n’t a surprise , but the rule applies for credit cards as well .
US credit card or cell , or no verification .
Canadians are excluded as well .
To try and be a little fair to Google , the service is brand new , and perhaps the logistics of providing verification to the whole planet may be a little challenging , but why implement a verification system at all when only users in the United States can use it ?
It ’s not as if Knol is closed to contributions from outside of the United States .
Instead , Knol contributors in the United States will now have an unfair advantage in contributions of others , and that does suck , even if its only a little bit .
I also do n’t understand why in the last couple of years Google has moved from being an inclusive , global player with product launches to being one that excludes people outside of the United States .
Google is so immensely popular today globally in part due to its inclusive global product launches where other companies have continued to remain focused on the United States ( Yahoo in particular comes to mind ) .
Google may say Knol is open to everyone , but it ’s a half arsed approach .

New Zealand has long had a record of being ahead of the political game .
It was the first country in the world to accept women 's right to vote , in 1893 .
In the 1930s , it emerged as a pioneer of the modern welfare state .
Fifty years later , in the 1980s , it was the first state to declare itself nuclear - free .
Less creditably , during the same decade , New Zealand became host to the first social democratic government to embrace a free - market programme of wholesale privatisation , liberalisation and deregulation .
Named after New Zealand Labour 's then finance minister , " Rogernomics " was all the rage on the global new right for a time - and laid the ground for neoliberal social democratic governments like Tony Blair 's - until it finally imploded amidst a litany of social and economic failures : stagnation , unemployment , bankruptcies , crime and rampant inequality .
Two decades on , another New Zealand government , this time a more progressive Labour coalition headed by Helen Clark , is again at the forefront of political change - leading the revival of public ownership .
On Tuesday , Clark 's government renationalised the country 's railways and ferry services , privatised in the early 90s and subsequently run down and asset - stripped by the Australian owners .
Launching the new , publicly owned KiwiRail , finance minister Michael Cullen declared that privatisation had " been a painful lesson for New Zealand " .
Nor is this the first renationalisation by the Clark government , which took over Air New Zealand after it nearly collapsed in 2001 and has also built up a successful state - owned retail bank - named Kiwibank , needless to say .
And unlike Gordon Brown 's government , which strained every nerve to avoid nationalising Northern Rock to avoid seeming " old Labour " , Clark has championed the takeover of rail as exactly what is needed to build a modern , environmentally sustainable transport network .
Against a background of global warming and rising fuel prices , she argues , rail is a " central part of 21st - century economic infrastructure " .
Given Britain 's similarly disastrous experience with rail privatisation , you might think that taking a leaf out New Zealand 's book would be just the kind of popular policy to help dig Brown 's government out of its hole .
Despite the modest improvements achieved by putting the lethal Railtrack out of its misery , Britain 's railway system remains a byword for bewildering fragmentation , unreliability , overcrowding , delays and exorbitant cost - which has only now completed a high - speed link to the Channel tunnel , 15 years after its state - owned French counterpart .
Fleeced by the private train companies and rolling stock contractors ( some of them pocketing 30 % rates of return ) , it is now the most expensive , opaque and inefficient rail system in Europe .
As the Campaign for Better Transport reported yesterday , walk - on fares are on average nearly five times those booked in advance - and all ticket prices are set to spiral in the next few years .
Meanwhile , renationalisation is strongly supported by the public and is in fact official Labour party policy .
But far from planning to end what has been a disastrous experiment , the rail minister , Tom Harris , last month insisted that if the Tories had n't privatised the railways , New Labour would have sold them off when it came to power in 1997 .
In a surreal aside that will baffle most UK train passengers , he insisted that " the private railway has provided a level of investment , innovation , imagination that would n't have happened if BR had stayed as it was " .
This is nonsense .
Investment in the railways comes from farepayers and government subsidy , now around three times the level before privatisation ( £ 2bn a year goes to the train operating companies alone ) , while the leakage of cash from the industry to private investors and lenders is estimated at £ 800 m a year .
The rise in passenger numbers is simply the product of economic growth , and the case for a reintegrated , publicly owned rail system - at the heart of a national investment programme to encourage more people to move off road and air travel on to rail - is overwhelming .
It has the added advantage that most services can be taken back at no cost as franchises expire .
But the government is still in the grip of an ideology that sees privatisation as the only way to reform the health service , and nationalisation as a throwback to be avoided at all costs .
As global economic conditions increasingly undermine the credibility of free - market economics , however , real life is pointing in another direction .
The revival of public ownership in countries as diverse as New Zealand and Venezuela reflects a wider disillusionment with the neoliberal experience of the past decade .
As the writer and Work Foundation chief executive Will Hutton recently argued in a BBC programme on nationalisation , the takeover of Northern Rock , Railtrack and Metronet has begun to force a mainstream reappraisal of what had become a political taboo - just as academic research has been rehabilitating the productivity and costs record of Britain 's postwar nationalised industries .
But it 's also clear that , if there is going to be an effective new role for public enterprise and intervention , it will have to be about more than bailing out the failures of the private sector in traditional industries , and engage with the cutting edge of the economy .
In Britain , the credit crisis has exposed the dangers of the reliance on finance , the rundown of manufacturing , and the chronically low rate of investment in the economy .
The case for a national fibre - optic network , for example , giving universal fast broadband access to the home is a powerful one , both on economic and social grounds - countries such as South Korea are far ahead of Britain .
But the private sector wo n't deliver the necessary multibillion pound long - term investment .
A publicly owned network , on the other hand , could do - perhaps funded by service providers as part of a universal service obligation , as the Communication Workers Union argues .
What is certain is that the Brown government 's kneejerk resistance to public intervention and ownership will have to end if it is to have a hope of riding out the crisis and dealing with the new economic reality .
By making a stand for progressive common sense , New Zealand has at least helped break the spell that privatisation is somehow the natural order of things in the modern world .

The Quartuncia was the smallest Roman coin , minted from 217 to 215 BCE , and then discarded as useless .
This is my Duae Quartunciae -- my two cents -- on science , mathematics , and unbelief .
Showtime was still a few hours away , and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails was sitting in a hushed , candlelit room backstage at the Air Canada Centre trying to find his scream .
Nails ’ music sounds like a massive nightmare machine , but , on this day , Reznor woke up with his voice small and croaky .
As a humidifier gently chugged away in the corner , the rock star smiled faintly and asked , “ How old am I again ? ”
The answer is 43 , but Reznor , who clawed through some dark years of drug addiction , is a picture of vitality these days with his brawny shoulders and clear - eyed confidence .
He is also serious and candid .
Asked about the time when the backstage scene at a Nails show would have been less seance and more human sacrifice , Reznor squinted down at his palms like a farsighted fortune - teller .
“ I got so bad that I could n’t even write down songs that were caught in my head , ” he said .
“ And then I would feel depressed , so I would go and get more messed up .
I finally pulled out of it .
Then it was great to discover that I had n’t killed myself and my liver still worked and eventually my brain started functioning again , and then [ I ] was enjoying the process again . ”
That process is , in simple terms , caging up the songs that swim through his stormy and considerable imagination .
Reznor , whose band will play a sold - out show at the Forum on Saturday , is one of the acclaimed creative figures of his generation in rock , a showman who occupies a territory somewhere between the digital throb of the dance club and the thunderous amps of arena rock .
There ’s always been a melding , too , of the tribal and the technological in his work , and that has been the most fascinating subplot of Reznor ’s career here in 2008 .

The first week in May , Reznor typed the words , “ This one ’s on me , ” and posted the message on his website , NIN.com , along with an entire new album ’s worth of raw , twitchy music titled “ The Slip . ”
There was no advance notice given , no advertising or anything that remotely resembled a conventional record - label approach .
More than 1 million fans downloaded “ The Slip ” by the end of the month .
It was the second Nine Inch Nails release in two months .
Reznor posted the 36 - track “ Ghosts I - IV , ” an unsettling instrumental collection , in similar fashion earlier in the year .
Nine Inch Nails -- which is the name Reznor records under ; it ’s more of a brand - name for him than a traditional band -- finished off a contractual commitment to Interscope Records last year , and Reznor walked away and found the fear of a truly liberated man .
“ There was a moment of rejoicing , but at the same time it was also quickly followed by panic , because there is nothing real clear or right to do today , ” Reznor said .
“ I mean , it ’s obvious what record labels are doing is wrong , but it ’s not entirely clear what the right thing is to do . ”

Reznor ’s “ right thing ” appears to be relentless work .
He does n’t just follow his muse , he chases it and wrestles it to the ground .
In addition to those two albums released this year , he has been meeting with HBO to pitch his idea of writing a two - year series called “ Year Zero , ” which would be based on the intricate science - fiction tale that he created for a 2007 album of the same title .
It also came alive for fans as an alternate - reality game on the Internet .
If the television show moves forward as Reznor expects , he will add new chapters to “ Year Zero ” through another album , another game and a concert tour .
Reznor was giddy talking about this 21st century creative life that allows him to be a rock star but also weave tales that can be watched on screens , pursued through the Internet and performed on stage : “ That ’s my grand ambition .
Will it happen ?
I do n’t know .
But it ’s the most exciting thing on the horizon when I wake up in the mornings .
I mean , think about it ; being able to integrate different forms of media to tell a story with music . ”
Just then his cellphone went mad with lights and vibrations .
“ Ugh .
Sorry , the whole world is calling me . ”
He turned the phone off without looking at the name of the caller .
“ It can wait .
Sometimes you just have to take a breath . ”

He smirked , and for a moment the only sound was the humidifier gurgling away .
“ OK , what were we talking about ? ”
Computer geek
Michael TRENT
Reznor was born in leafy central Pennsylvania in a little town called Mercer .
His dad had the same first name , so the son went by his middle name .
The youngster loved music and computers and , in the early 1980s , he was part of a generation that began to truly meld the two for its own pop-culture pursuits .
“ I ’ve always been into computers , ” said Reznor , whose latest album began on a laptop .
“ When I was getting out of high school and forming my identity musically , all of it was really coming into the fold , computers and drum machines .
It felt like , you know , I ’m in the right place at the right time .
I liked the collision . ”

Reznor found his way to Cleveland , where he worked as an assistant engineer and the janitor at Right Track , a recording studio .
He ’d heard how Prince , the R&B ; and funk superstar , created entire soundscapes on his own by playing each instrument and layering them over one another in the studio .
He set out to do the same -- the result was 1989 ’s “ Pretty Hate Machine , ” written , arranged and performed by Reznor .
The music was harrowing human emotion within the pulse and crash of an industrial soundscape .
It was n’t man versus machine , it was man vis - a - vis machine , as disturbing at times as living tissue pinned down in an angry laboratory .
Take the song “ Down in It ” : “ So what does it matter now / I was swimming in the hate now I crawl on the ground /
And everything I never liked about you /
Is kinda seeping into me . ”
During the tour for the 1994 album , “ The Downward Spiral , ” Reznor slipped into a destructive cycle of addiction .
“ I was ill - equipped for social situations and found that having a few drinks made it easier .
Then I found out I liked cocaine too .
And try living in New Orleans , where the bars do n’t close .
You come home in the morning and you always see some guy jogging .
That ’s the worst when you ’re stumbling in and the sun is coming up .
The sound of the birds in the morning .
. . . ”
It ’s become a common error in articles about Reznor to report that he was a heroin user -- maybe it ’s his lyrics about jabbing needles -- but he has n’t asked for corrections .
“ That ’s kind of a sad conversation to have ; ‘ I ’m not a junkie , I ’m a coke head ’. . . . “

How far has Reznor come ?
At dinner in Toronto , the Los Angeles transplant -- he left Louisiana a few years back and now lives near Beverly Hills -- was joined by a surprise guest , his father , Michael Reznor , who had driven up from Pennsylvania .
“ This is my chance for one - on - one time with Trent , I have to share him with the rest of the family when he comes down and plays Cleveland and Philadelphia .
I did n’t tell anybody I was coming up .
His nephew is going to be mad .
He just started playing the guitar . ”
The elder Reznor got hung up at the Canadian border ; a guard recognized the last name and , as a line of traffic started to form , the female officer asked questions about the celebrity in the family .
The rock star looked pained as his father told the story , but he did n’t complain .
He just ate his supper and smiled .
Financially secure
Reznor became rich and famous thanks to the traditional music industry and now has the ability to give his music away because of the money he makes from touring and from die - hard fans who will still buy CDs even after downloading the music .
That ’s made him a target of criticism from some newer artists who have the less fortunate timing of starting their careers after platinum albums have become truly rare .

Reznor has mixed feelings ; he enjoys working outside the larger corporate system , but his pride hates to think of art discounted .
“ As an artist , I do n’t feel that it should be free ; it ’s my life ’s work , ” he said .
“ Record labels trained [ fans ] to mistrust them and feel ripped off by them , and now the technology exists that you can just take stuff .
I understand why people feel it ’s OK , and I say , ‘ I ca n’t fight that fight . ’
I look at the way the cards have been dealt and make the most of it .
There is also another side of me that wants the world to hear the music , whether you ’ve paid for it or not , I want you to hear it .
And people are hearing it . ”
“ The Slip ” debuted at No. 13 on the U.S. pop charts and the reviews have been good , although Reznor said he believes this quickly assembled album is more of a sketch than a painting .
He anticipates he will spend many months putting together his next collection .
At the show in Toronto , Reznor ’s performance was startling -- he can still tap into the anger and fear of the old songs even though he ’s in a saner place in his own life .
The stage production is impressive too , with digital effects and a cage - like curtain that descends from the rafters to make it seem as if Reznor is in a parallel , static - filled dimension , peering into the real world .

There ’s also a quieter subset of the show , a sequence in which the mastermind of Nine Inch Nails peels away the industrial power tools and the computer hard drives to show the man inside the machine .
“ Sometimes , ” he explained earlier , “ it ’s just about the song and the singer . ”

Im in u.k England in a place called Shinewater which is within Eastbourne ..
It is now about 9.20 am and relativity bright , and the sky just went dark around this area , like night time dark , but no stars or clouds just pitch black ... Quite a few people saw this so i'm not hallucinating ... My neighbour believes it was a sudden eclipse but would n't that make everywhere else dark ?
I could clearly see the area known as " The Downs " which is a rough bunch of high hills and it was not dark over there from what i could see .. it seemed like the light within about a .... a mile radius perhaps ?
just simply went dark , and I could very clearly see The Downs alight with natural light ... the downs being quite a relativly high landmark you can see them from quite afar .
This may sound mad but it was like , kinda like ... The sky was cracked almost .
Like what i was seeing was n't our sky ... it was odd and there was a really eerie feeling going on , but i guess that 's just human nature when faced with something unknown .
I posted this here because well ... it was in the sky and you guys kinda deal with the sky , so perhaps a UFO of some sought ?
But honestly , it just felt looked like the sky had cracked , im sure someone would 've picked this up on there mobile phone or something and cctv , that has to be an option .
I 'm gunna try my best to get this in some media format , i'll start with the local herald newspaper and see if i can get this higher because what i saw was not natural well , i for one believe it was n't natural and i have a probable several 100 witnesses to this ... but if you guys / girls do have a more sensible solution then mine then please do post instead of flaming and calling me a liar .
Anyway i have to goto work so i'll answer question when i get back , but i've done the best i can describing the event .
okay ... this is odd : [ edit on 10/8/08 by Axzion ]
For an executive who had just had his company bought for a cool billion a few months ago and was on the eve of announcing a major update to his business ' flagship database program , former MySQL CEO Marten Mickos , now Sun Microsystems ' senior vice president for databases , did n't look comfortable .
Mickos had come to the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit on April 9 at the University of Texas Super Computing Center to explain that MySQL was not about to abandon Linux .
His audience , the movers and shakers of Linux business and development circles , were not overly impressed .

Eight Sound Reasons Not to Use MySQL
Five Compelling Reasons to Use MySQL
ABC : An Introduction to Open Source
The pro-Linux crowd of 200 - plus were worried that now , with Sun in charge of MySQL , Sun 's focus would be on creating a SAMP ( Solaris , Apache , MySQL , Perl / PHP / Python ) software ecosystem instead of supporting the LAMP ( Linux , Apache , MySQL , Perl / PHP / Python ) stack , which has enabled Linux to gain $ 21 billion worth of traction in the server market .
For more on Sun 's acquisition of MySQL , see Sun Acquires MySQL : Impact on the CIO ?
There was northing subtle about this concern .
During his keynote address , Mickos was asked by an audience member if Sun/ MySQL was still committing to keeping Linux as one of its prime operating systems .
Mickos replied that Sun/ MySQL was " still committed to Linux . "
After all , Mickos added , " If we are n't committed , then any one of you can take the MySQL code and fork it to make a new MySQL product , which I am sure you would do if Sun tried to convert LAMP to SAMP . "
That quip was well received by the audience .
All things considered , though , as several Linux and ISV ( independent software vendor ) developers said after the speech , they 'd just as soon not fork MySQL .
As one ISV , who did n't wish to be named , said , " Maintaining a DBMS ( database management system ) is hard work , and it's not the work I 'm getting paid to do .
We need MySQL to do its work in Linux so we can do our work with LAMP . "
Mickos also used lines from the Sun executive playbook about how " Sun can claim to be the biggest open - source contributor in the world . "
That did not go over as well with this audience .
For all the major contributions Sun has made to open source OpenSolaris and Java , the Linux community still remembers Sun 's conflicts with Red Hat and former Sun CEO Scott McNealy 's disdain for Linux .
More recently , although Mickos repeatedly mentioned Sun 's support for GPLv3 — the latest version of the popular open - source General Public License — Linux developers remain suspicious of Sun 's licensing model .
In particular , several developers expressed concerns about the effect of Sun's CDDL ( Common Development and Distribution License ) , which is used with OpenSolaris .
Their concerns are that if Sun makes improvements in MySQL under the CDDL , it will restrict their the users ' ability to use new versions of MySQL with their applications .
For businesses , of course , the concern is whether they 'll continue to get the promised improvements in LAMP application from MySQL improvements in a timely fashion .
Some of the Linux developers ' and business customers ' jitters may have been settled on April 15th when , at the MySQL Conference in San Francisco , Sun announced the next version of MySQL : MySQL 5.1 .
This edition , which is now available as a release candidate , is still under the Linux - friendly GPLv2 .
For more on GPL versions , see The Manager 's View of GPL Version 3 : Two ( and a Half ) Things to Like and Two More to Look Out For .
Perhaps more important , from the viewpoint of Linux users , the release candidate is available on all of MySQL 's supported Linux hardware platforms .
So , for example , businesses that use Red Hat Enterprise Linux , SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Linux on IBM 's Power or S/390 architectures , all will be working with the most up - to - date version of MySQL .
According to a press statement by Mickos , MySQL 5.1 will run " up to 15 percent faster than previous versions in our own internal tests — making it a compelling solution for demanding Web - based enterprise applications " — it promises to be attractive not just to Linux developers but to any business that depends on LAMP stacks .
For now , at least , there seems to be no concrete reason for LAMP programmers or enterprise users to worry about the future of LAMP applications .
While Sun may have had problems with Linux , its continued partnership with Red Hat , its new server partnership with Ubuntu and Mickos ' statements , it 's clear that Sun / MySQL 's recent actions all point to a long and prosperous life for LAMP .
PITTSBURGH --
In the garage of his house , Frank Sanns spends nights tinkering with one of his prized possessions : a working nuclear - fusion reactor .
Mr. Sanns , 51 years old , is part of a small subculture of gearheads , amateur physicists and science - fiction fans who are trying to build fusion reactors in their basements , backyards and home laboratories .
Mr. Sanns , who owns a banquet hall here , believes he's on track to make fusion a viable power source .
" I'm ...
It 's a Friday afternoon in Boston , and I 'm being forced to stand 10 feet off the curb on Causeway Street across from North Station - just stand there in the street - because I 've off ended Christopher Hart by using the wrong word to describe an idea .
The word I used was " wild . "
In retrospect , it was n't right .
I think it slipped out because the idea reminds me of the Wild West .
But I do n't regret using the word , because it forced Hart to teach me a lesson .
A few minutes before , I 'd been sitting with Hart inside the Institute for Human Centered Design , a nonprofit advocacy group on Portland Street , just down from Causeway , where Hart is the director of urban and transit projects .
We were discussing Shared Space , a street design concept becoming popular in parts of Europe ( the German town of Bohmte started turning its entire main street into a Shared Space last fall ) , and I ask Hart if he thinks such a " wild " idea could ever work in Boston .
" It 's not a wild idea , " he counters quickly .
" It existed for thousands of years .
It was only with the advent of sewers and fast - moving vehicles - horses and trolleys and cars - where you start seeing curbs and really defining where uses go . "
The curb is a big enemy in the Shared Space philosophy , because the curb is a separator , dictating what belongs to the pedestrian and what belongs to the vehicle .
There are other enemies as well : signs , lines on the road , even traffic lights .
Pioneered by Dutch traffic engineer Hans Monderman , who died earlier this year at age 62 , Shared Space gets the street naked , removes all physical and psychological barriers , and forces cars and pedestrians to share .
The concept makes the street safe by making it dangerous to proceed without paying attention .
We have some elements of Shared Space here ; in Downtown Crossing , Winter and Summer streets have no curb and , in the mornings , commercial vehicles mix with pedestrians .
But the full Shared Space experience is hard to feel until all the clothes come off , which is why - as we start to cross Causeway - Hart stops a third of the way to the median .
" We 're going to stand here , " he says .
" The cars will go around . "
My first reaction is to look at Hart and admire his commitment , his passion for changing the world .
This warm feeling lasts until the light turns green and I see two taxis - it had to be taxis - coming toward us .
IF HART'S GOAL IS TO MAKE THE SITUATION FEEL DANGERous , it 's working .
And not just on me , because the taxis actually go around us , slowly , staring at us , wondering what the hell we 're doing on their street .
" So what have we done here ? "
Hart asks .
" We 've extended that curb 10 feet out .
We 're forcing drivers to pay attention , and we 're forcing them to slow down even just a little bit because their field of vision has changed . "
The light turns the other way , and now the drivers coming out of Portland Street who want to make a right have to contend with us .
The situation repeats .
They see us .
They move slowly around us .
A few even go behind us .
But no one blares a horn .
No one gives us the finger .
No one does anything except share .
This is exactly what the father of Shared Space had in mind .
Wendy Landman , the executive director of the nonprofit pedestrian advocacy group WalkBoston , says , " One of the pieces that Monderman talked about is that you have to give responsibility back to the drivers and pedestrians to behave rationally . "
( An oft - quoted Monderman mantra is " If you treat drivers like idiots , they act as idiots . " )
I grew up in this city .
" Do n't play in the street " was a mantra of my parents .
I know our drivers are notoriously bad ( and , in my opinion , our pedestrians are worse ) .
I do n't need Christopher Hart to make the streets of Boston feel dangerous for me .
Yet for the 10 minutes we stand in the middle of Causeway , it feels surprisingly safe .
We established our presence on the street , and drivers behaved differently .
You could say the fact that I was holding a notebook and writing things down changed the way they behaved , because any journalist will tell you that it does .
And you could say that no one wanted to hit the guy in the wheelchair ( Hart has cerebral palsy ) .
But I do n't think it 's either .
In those 10 minutes on Causeway Street in the middle of a beautiful spring day , we had , as Hart put it , " changed perception . "
For decades , our urban street system has focused almost exclusively on the efficient movement of cars .
" When you walk down one of these European streets and see people walking , entire families riding bicycles together , people sitting outside having an evening drink , you think , ' This is the way a city should be , ' " says Steven E. Miller , the executive director of the Healthy Weight Initiative in the nutrition department at the Harvard School of Public Health .
He believes walkable streets will go a long way toward mending chronic health problems .
" And you feel astounded that America has n't caught on to that effect . "
But there is hope .
Boston , like other US cities , is making tweaks to create safer streets .
( Cambridge is making even bigger tweaks . )
Groups advocating for pedestrians and bicyclists , along with some forward - thinking engineers , architects , and urban planners , are working to change our perception of the street .
They 're pushing " human- centered design " or " complete streets " or " context - sensitive design . "
In a city where walking is the most dangerous form of transportation ( over the last five years , the number of pedestrians killed by cars was double that of drivers and passengers killed in car accidents ) , it 's a movement that is long overdue .
THE FINE FOR JAYWALKING IN THE state of Massachusetts is one dollar .
This , many experts say , is not the problem .
The threat of punishment does not stop people from jaywalking , just as it does not stop people from running red lights , cheating on their taxes , or killing each other .
People jaywalk because they do not trust the system to serve them in a fair and reasonable time .
So they serve themselves .
If you look at an intersection as essentially a series of lines waiting to move , then from the pedestrian 's perspective , it 's a broken queue .
Dick Larson , an engineering professor at MIT who is a leading authority on the science and psychology of waiting in line - he 's been referred to as " Dr. Q " - thinks we can go a long way toward mending these broken queues if we start thinking about the mind - set of the pedestrian .
" In the psychology of queuing , " Larson says to me one day in his office , " if you manage people 's expectations for the duration of the queue , people will behave . "
How do we do that ?
Larson thinks we need to look to the London subway system , elevators , and Disney World for inspiration .
" When you ride the subway in London , there 's a little display that tells you how long until the next train arrives .
When you 're waiting for an elevator , there 's usually a light up above that tells you what floor it 's on .
When you enter a line for an attraction at Disney World , they put a sign up that says ' 45 - minute wait from this point . ' "
These devices , Larson says , are " psychologically relaxing " for the person .
You know you 've got 10 minutes until the next train ; that 's time to take out a book or put on your headphones .
The elevator 's on the sixth floor and you 're on the fifth ; you deduce it 's probably not worth it to take the stairs .
Disney tells you it 's 45 minutes from this point ; you might decide to eat first , or use the bathroom , or abort .
( Interestingly , Larson says that Disney always overestimates the time , so that when you actually get on the ride in 35 minutes , you feel as if you 've made out . )
Drivers expect to have their needs served in due time .
The pedestrian ?
Unsure .
Do I have to push the button , or will it just give me the walk signal ?
And when ?
So what we do , Larson says , is serve ourselves .
" Most of the time , it 's safe if you 're a rational person .
That 's when people jaywalk .
But a car can come out of a driveway , and that 's when trouble happens . "
Larson has a suggestion to counter this self - service risk - taking : " We have these clocks that show you how much time you have to cross the street until you 're in grave danger . "
Why not do the opposite - tell pedestrians how long until they get to cross the street ?
This sort of information , Larson says , has been shown to keep people from taking risks .
A lot of the experts I spoke with like Larson 's idea .
But the problem , many say , is that pedestrians would not be happy if they found out how long they had to wait .
Many of Boston 's intersections with traffic lights have cycle lengths of 90 to 100 seconds .
Off - peak , they may go down to 80 seconds or less .
The catch , according to Ann Hershfang , one of the founders of WalkBoston , is that studies have shown that pedestrians will wait just 30 seconds before they get restless and cross .
Four years ago , the city of Boston established a plan to reduce pedestrian wait time with " automatic concurrent walk " signals .
When cars get the green , the pedestrians traveling in the same direction get the walk signal , and turning vehicles have to yield to them .
It 's a system that 's been in place in other cities for decades , according to Hershfang .
Now , advocacy groups want Boston to standardize a " leading pedestrian interval , " which gives pedestrians a three - to five - second headstart on cars with the green and gets them into the crosswalk and the sightlines of the turning drivers .
This system is already in heavy use in Cambridge , which , as a city , gets applause from transportation advocates .
( Cambridge was recently named America 's " Best Walking City " by Prevention magazine and the American Podiatric Medical Association .
In another recent walkability survey , this time by Walk Score , Boston landed in third place . )
Boston is also re-timing intersections so that the " DONT WALK " signs actually mean what they 're supposed to mean - which is , do n't step off the curb .
The city will do this by extending the " WALK " signal until the point where a relatively slow person would no longer be able to make it the other side safely .
In the past , no matter the length of the light or the crossing , intersections would show " WALK " for seven seconds and then fl ash " DONT WALK " the rest of the time .
The unpredictable length of the flashing " DONT WALK " has made it less of a command to stay on the curb and more of a psychological yellow light telling pedestrians that they can still make if they step on it .
" LOOK AT THIS GUY RIGHT HERE IN THE SUIT .
BOOM !
Desire line . "
I 'm on Causeway Street again , but this time I 'm standing on the curb with Peter Gori , the Boston Redevelopment Authority 's senior manager for public realm projects , and we 're watching a man jaywalk diagonally across the street from the east exit of North Station .
" He went on a straight beeline from the train to Canal Street .
He 's trying to get to the Financial District , and psychologically he thinks the fastest way to cross is diagonally at the middle of the block .
That 's his desire line .
But you can't always put a crosswalk where that desire line is , because it might not be safe .
You have to look at pedestrian mentality and then balance it against other modes of transportation . "
The city is developing plans to redesign Causeway and 11 other main streets that extend out from the new Rose Kennedy Greenway to increase usability , reconnect downtown with the waterfront , and give the area an aesthetic cohesiveness .
Causeway is a particular challenge because pedestrians emerging from North Station - the city 's main north commuter hub - behave with the predictability of pigeons .
Causeway 's evolution was dictated by the old Boston Garden and the old elevated trolley line .
Gori says the street once had built - in impediments - trolley beams and heavy traffic and cabs parked everywhere - that blocked the sightlines to the other side of the street and worked to naturally " channelize " pedestrians to the crosswalks .
But today Causeway is wide open and sunny , and less traffic travels the street because the I - 93 on - and off ramps disappeared from its east end with the Central Artery .
Now it 's all desire - line opportunity .
You have pedestrians leaving North Station heading south to the Financial District and Government Center , except that neither of the two station exits lines up with a street leading south , so many people take the diagonal .
You have people heading west to state offices and Massachusetts General Hospital , who have to cross an odd - shaped four - way intersection at Lowell Square .
Then you have the rather large sports arena that sits on top of North Station , and fans leaving the Garden are heading to garages in all directions .
How do you accommodate all of these desires ?
The Causeway Street plan calls for painting the entire intersection so it stands out from the rest of the street and has a slight tactile feel for motorists passing over it ( the city recently used this approach on parts of Huntington Avenue ) and then , Gori says , trying to lead pedestrians there with little tricks like placing trash cans and newspaper boxes and benches near the corners .
It 's a lot of thought to accomplish a seemingly simple goal , which Gori characterizes as trying " to get pedestrians to take the extra four seconds to walk to the crosswalk . "
So is it really as simple as getting pedestrians and drivers to behave within the system ?
Thomas Tinlin , the city 's transportation commissioner , thinks that 's a big part of it .
" We live in an environment where everybody is in a rush , " Tinlin tells me as we sit in a conference room inside the transportation department 's offices in City Hall .
" Our job is to look at it as , if everybody plays by the rules , how best to move everybody through the system .
It would always baffle me to drive through the Financial District and see someone who just closed a billion - dollar deal walking through the cars without looking . "
The transportation department has a secure room inside City Hall known as the Traffic Management Center .
It looks a bit like the war room in a Hollywood movie .
Eight large screens and several smaller ones show real - time video of different intersections , and computer screens display the city 's signal maps .
A technician sits at a desk monitoring the ant farm , ready to make traffic - light adjustments .
But fixing one intersection could create gridlock in the next .
Everything they do , Tinlin says , is a trade - off .
" Transportation commissioners of the past have always been about ' move the car , move the car . '
The world is so different now .
It 's cars and bikes and wheelchairs . "
The new reality , however , is still playing out inside an old reality .
Greater Boston is artery - heavy ; its main pedestrian streets are often choked with vehicles .
Shared Space , Tinlin 's engineers point out , is not designed for heavily trafficked streets .
And tearing up and rebuilding the city is not realistic .
Instead , there are many retrofits that are coming into vogue and appearing in a few nearby cities and towns to calm traffic and make the pedestrian safer .
A big one is to install things like bump- outs , bulb - outs , and curb extensions , which all function similar to what Chris Hart and I did on Causeway Street .
They bring the sidewalk out past the parked cars , closer to the edge of the travel lane , put the pedestrian into the sightlines of drivers , and shorten the distance the pedestrian has to cross to the other side of the street .
These extended sidewalks can also improve bus stops .
Because the curb comes out to the travel lane , it eliminates the need for a 90 - foot bus stop ( which can actually add a parking space or two ) , makes the on / off safer and easier , and keeps the bus from having to fight its way back onto the street - improving service and reliability and , advocates believe , encouraging more people to use mass transit , which they view as a huge component for making the entire system better .
Of course , moving out bus stops means cars have less chance to pass a slower - moving bus , but advocates say you need to consider the fact that there could be more people on that bus than in the cars behind it , and the best way to balance the system is to consider how many people you move , not how many vehicles .
Another retrofit in wide use is the raised crosswalk , which brings the crosswalk level with the sidewalk and forces the car to have to come up onto the pedestrian 's space , instead of the pedestrian having to step down onto the vehicle 's territory ( it also functions as a speed bump ) .
Reducing the number of vehicles helps the pedestrian situation across the board .
Four - plus bucks a gallon and concerns about global warming have done their part to make driving a car sting both your wallet and your ethics ; some want to make it even more painful ( at least financially ) .
In 2003 , London launched " congestion pricing , " which charges vehicles the equivalent of $ 16 to enter the city center .
( New York mayor Michael Bloomberg is pushing for a similar approach , though it 's met much resistance . )
Another movement calls for bringing on - street parking rates up to what you 'd pay in a garage to discourage " cruising . "
Studies have found that in some neighborhoods , such as New York 's Park Slope , up to 40 percent of the traffic is simply cruising around looking for a spot .
Dick Larson , at MIT , has a grad student working on a thesis about cruising in some of Boston 's more congested parking neighborhoods , such as the Back Bay , and Larson says his student is getting similarly high statistics .

Japan faces a 16 percent slide in the size of its workforce by 2030 while the number of elderly will mushroom , the government estimates , raising worries about who will do the work in a country unused to , and unwilling to contemplate , large - scale immigration .
The thinktank , the Machine Industry Memorial Foundation , says robots could help fill the gaps , ranging from microsized capsules that detect lesions to high - tech vacuum cleaners .
Rather than each robot replacing one person , the foundation said in a report that robots could make time for people to focus on more important things .
Japan could save 2.1 trillion yen ( $ 21 billion ) of elderly insurance payments in 2025 by using robots that monitor the health of older people , so they do n’t have to rely on human nursing care , the foundation said in its report .
Caregivers would save more than an hour a day if robots helped look after children , older people and did some housework , it added .
Robotic duties could include reading books out loud or helping bathe the elderly .
“ Seniors are pushing back their retirement until they are 65 years old , day care centers are being built so that more women can work during the day , and there is a move to increase the quota of foreign laborers .
But none of these can beat the shrinking workforce , ” said Takao Kobayashi , who worked on the study .
“ Robots are important because they could help in some ways to alleviate such shortage of the labor force . ”
The current fertility rate is 1.3 babies per woman , far below the level needed to maintain the population , while the government estimates that 40 percent of the population will be over 65 by 2055 , raising concerns about who will look after the graying population .
Kobayashi said changes was still needed for robots to make a big impact on the workforce .
“ There ’s the expensive price tag , the functions of the robots still need to improve , and then there are the mindsets of people , ” he said .
“ People need to have the will to use the robots . ”

If you want a metaphor for the state of the US economy , and the bubble of denial that some of its policymakers remain within , then look no further than the King Canute - style advertising campaign by car maker Chrysler .
While the average price of petrol is now $ 4 a gallon nationwide , Chrysler wants the good times to keep rolling .
Buy one of its Dodge Durango SUVs - which boasts 13 miles to the gallon around town - or Jeep Grand Cherokees and it will guarantee that you can fill it up with gas for $ 2.99 a gallon for the next three years - no matter how high the price of petrol rises .
( And no matter that it 's still a bad deal when compared with a more fuel - efficient car . )
Since some forecasts are predicting $ 6 for a gallon of gas , that 's a scheme that could ruin Chrysler ( so it 's a good thing for Chrysler the campaign has n't worked ) .
But how else can it shift its unsold pile of fuel - guzzlers ?
The alternative is to do what GM did last week : announce the closure of two of its US factories that make pick - up trucks and SUVs , and two more in Mexico and Canada , cutting 10,000 jobs .
The news from GM came in a week when official figures showed a steep rise in US unemployment , the latest round of bad news for the US labour market .
That raised the inevitable question about the US economy being in recession , spooked the financial markets and set off another decline in the dollar ( which has now been declining and falling for longer that the Roman empire - or at least it feels that way ) .
But will there be a recession ?
According to Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve and so the person who should have as good a feel for the national pulse as anyone , " the risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so " .
Is he right ?
Optimists will point to figures from the early part of 2008 , showing annual growth of a weak but still hardy 0.9 % .
And it 's true that anyone who bet against the US economy in the last decade would have lost money - its resilience and flexibility are extraordinary .
That does n't mean that the US economy is out of the woods : Bernanke 's statement on Monday still leaves room for a downturn .
A closer look at the figures removes some grounds for optimism and leaves open the possibility of a long and sluggish period of adjustment .
It may not be a savage recession , but the rest of 2008 could still be painful for many - which means that Chrysler will have trouble shifting its cars no matter what the price of gas , unless they start making one that runs on water .
Going back to the first quarter GDP figures ( there 's a phrase to break the ice at parties ) , the only unmitigated piece of good news was the rise in US exports and a big fall in imports ( thanks to a weaker dollar and weak domestic demand , as you 'd expect ) .
That was then .
Today 's US trade data showed a widening deficit in April , thanks again to the rising price of oil , wiping out otherwise rosy export data .
The effect of more expensive oil and other commodities , and the ripples that sends around the US economy , appears to concern Bernanke , who on Monday warned that inflation is a worry .
The combination of the two , inflation and low - to - negative growth , does n't bode well .
But let 's look on the bright side .
First , the Fed seems to have successfully warded off the sort of financial meltdown that was threatening a few months ago , highlighted by the collapse of Bear Stearns .
Second , while the unemployment rate is creeping up it is still only 5.5 % - although it is particularly affecting younger workers .
Third , Americans are adjusting to more expensive gas by doing the obvious things : buying more fuel efficient cars , driving less and using public transportation more .
Then there 's the bad news .
Houses continue to stack up waiting for sale , while sales prices are still tumbling ( even if the decline has not been as severe as some earlier forecasts ) .
Fixed investment - including housing and capital expenditure - is faltering .
A big hangover in consumer debt and harsher lending terms by banks mean that retail spending is not going to be a source of growth for some time .
( The number of Americans defaulting on their auto loans , as with their mortgages , is on the rise .
Many borrowers have negative equity on their car - and perhaps also their home . )
And of course US consumer confidence is n't too hot either .
How far those trends continue into 2008 will determine whether the US will be officially deemed to be in a recession .
But it may not matter , other than for newspaper headline writers .
None of the economy 's weaknesses - especially in housing - are going to disappear anytime soon .
If Bernanke is right and inflation is back on the agenda , then the moment for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts - already down to 2 % anyway - has passed .
The columnist Paul Krugman recently wondered if the question " Is this a recession ? " meant much anymore , given changes to the economy that have smoothed out the peaks and troughs of the traditional business cycle .
It 's an open question whether a sharp recession would be any worse than a couple of years of sluggish growth .
Optimists who believe that neither are on the cards can make a killing by buying a new condo in Florida - there 's plenty out there and they 're going cheap .
And why not pick up a Dodge Durango while you 're out there ?

The House has sent articles of impeachment against George Bush to the House Judiciary Committee , however Speaker Nancy Pelosi now says that an actual impeachment VOTE is n't on the table .
On Wednesday 's Countdown , Jonathan Turley gives his expert analysis on this epic fail as well as the latest attempt by the president to obstruct Congressional oversight by claiming executive privilege in the CIA / Plame leak investigation .
As for Bush 's executive privilege claims , Turley goes right for the jugular .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey all but begged the president not to make him testify about Dick Cheney 's role in the Plame case and has ignored a subpoena to appear to testify about the matter before Congress -- which Turley says should prompt Congress to charge him with Inherent Contempt .
That 's not likely to happen , and as Jonathan points out , Democrats who voted for Mukasey are now getting what they paid for :
No recent British government has put as many women offenders behind bars as New Labour .
The most famous slogan that Tony Blair ever uttered in opposition – reputedly coined for him by Gordon Brown – was that Labour would be " tough on crime and tough on the causes on crime " , seems only to be true of the first half of that dictum .
Between 1996 and 2005 , the population of the women 's prisons rose from 2,300 to 4,600 .
It has stayed close to that peak ever since .
Currently , it is 4,460 .
This is not simply because more women are getting into trouble with the law .
It is also that the courts are much readier to hand out a prison sentence when there is a woman in the dock .
In 1996 , 10 per cent of women convicted of indictable offences went to jail .
Within 10 years , the proportion had gone up to 15 per cent .

There are , of course , some very dangerous and malicious women behind bars , such as Rosemary West , the Gloucester housewife , mother and multiple killer who – like the 1960s child killer Myra Hindley – will never leave prison alive .
But most inmates of Britain 's 17 women 's prisons are serving short sentences for petty , non-violent crimes .
A disturbingly large number are more of a danger to themselves than to anyone else .
The typical woman prisoner is a teenager or 20 - something who has been caught shoplifting or dabbling in drugs , and will be out in a matter of weeks .
More than a fifth – 21 per cent – are in prison for theft or handling stolen goods , and nearly two - thirds are serving sentences of six months or less .
But this brief punishment can have traumatic consequences that last long after a prison term has been completed .
About 120 babies are born each year in prison .
There are mother - and - baby units in women 's prisons for very young children but it is very rare for a prison governor to permit a child over 18 months to be raised behind bars .
Unless there is a close relative ready to step in , the child will go into care , with little prospect of being reunited with its mother even when she is released .
" It did n't matter whether they were prostitutes , thieves or drug dealers – they never stopped being mums , " said one ex-convict , mother of a boy , who asked not to be named .
" Birthdays and Mother 's Day were the worst .
Uncontrollable sobs would echo through the corridors .
No wonder so many women tried to kill themselves . "
Lesley Butt , who has served three terms in adult prisons , is convinced that the constant turnover of young women is utterly wasteful .
Her own experience brought her to the perhaps surprising conclusion that the most effective prison sentences are the long ones .
It was her third sentence , of six years , that gave her the time to get off drugs .
" If you 're going in on a short sentence , you have n't got enough time and support to sort yourself out .
Then you come out and go straight back into crime , because when they put a woman in prison they take her whole life away .
It 's usually the woman who keeps a family together , so she has no family to go back to , and soon she 's back . "
She added : " Prison should be for sex offenders , murderers and people who are violent .
The others should be sentenced to serve in the community . "
The statistics suggest that she is right .
Almost two - thirds – 64 per cent – of the women released from prison during 2004 were in trouble with the law again within two years .
The figures also suggest that women offenders need an effective inducement to get off drugs .
An Oxford University survey found that of the 500 women convicts they sampled , in the six months before going to prison more than half had taken drugs every day .
The same team found that 78 per cent were showing some sort of mental disturbance .
That proportion would be 15 per cent in the female population as a whole .
After there were six deaths in quick succession inside Styal Prison , near Manchester , a Home Office commission , headed by Baroness Jean Corston , recommended that vulnerable offenders could be dealt with outside prison .
Its findings were welcomed by experts in the field – who then felt let down when little action followed .
Juliet Lyon , the director of the Prison Reform Trust , says that the Government is aware of the wastefulness of keeping large numbers of women in prison , but that in the past " implementation has lagged woefully behind " the good intentions of ministers like Maria Eagle .
But , she added , " with cross - party support , public opinion on her side and over 20 of the largest charitable funders offering to help , we hope that the minister secures the resources needed to deliver this policy at last " .
Russia has issued a harsh response after Poland and the United States signed a deal to base part of a United States missile defence system on Polish soil .
The 10 interceptor rockets in Poland , along with a radar complex in the Czech Republic , will form the European part of a global system Washington says it is assembling to shoot down ballistic missiles from rogue states like Iran or militant groups such as Al Qaeda .
But Russia says the deal creates a new arms race in the European continent and beyond its borders , adding that the agreement creates mistrust .
In an ominous warning , Russia says it will react - and not only through diplomatic protests .
Some Russian politicians say Poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .
The US and Poland signed the deal at a ceremony in Warsaw .
America says the system will help NATO , Poland and the US respond to " the threats of the 21st Century " .
Despite US assurances , Russia believes the planned missile shield is a threat to its own security and designed to undermine Russia 's nuclear deterrent .
Russian leaders also say the missile defence system provide no protection against any Iranian danger .
On 3/21/08 , I wrote an article about the economic and technological implications of medical tourism .
True to our long tradition here at The Futurist , this article made predictions months before a major publication arrived at the same expectations .
The Economist has an article this week that predicts everything that by original article does , from a rapid increase in Americans going abroad , to the loss in revenue to the US healthcare system triggering overdue reforms .
I particularly like the following sentences from the article :
" Jagdish Bhagwati , an economist at Columbia University , thinks that the offshoring of , for instance , customer service and claims - processing could save America alone $ 70 billion - 75 billion a year . "
" By Deloitte ’s reckoning , medical travel will represent $ 162 billion in lost spending on health care in America by 2012 . " " A bit of rivalry from top foreign facilities may introduce transparency and price competition into an inefficient system riddled with oligopolies and perverse incentives . "
If some people thought the outsourcing of technical support and software development was significant , then medical tourism promises to be several times larger by the middle of the next decade .
The Economist article provides a chart projecting the number of US patients expected to partake in medical tourism .
The number is expected to grow from under 1 million today to over 15 million by 2017 .
By then , this could carve $ 250 Billion / year out of US healthcare spending , and pump $ 50 Billion / year into the destination countries , introducing $ 200 Billion / year of net deflationary benefit into the US economy .
Everyone will know someone who went abroad for a medical procedure , with many customers comparing their experiences in India vs. Thailand vs. Jamaica .
To repeat the sequence of predicted events from the first article , they are :
1 ) Americans with no insurance are forced to make a life or death decision to get their surgeries abroad , where the service meets or exceeds their expections .
2 ) More insurance companies offer medical tourism with liability guarantees and cash / vacation incentives to American patients .
Only a small fraction of patients are adventurous enough to do this , but all insurance companies are compelled to offer these options .
3 ) Major centers for medical tourism , after a track record of about a decade , develop solid brands that can attract American patients .
4 ) When we finally get to the point that 10 % of Americans are traveling abroad for a wide array of procedures , the US will be forced to begin to take measures to reduce costs throughout the healthcare system .
Losing 10 % of the market is all that it will take to force some positive changes .
This could begin to happen by 2020 .
This confluence of market forces , globalization , and biotechnology is about to bring overdue reform to one of the biggest and worst sectors of the US and global economies .
There are tremendous investment opportunities here , which I will write about in the near future .
Part of the reason these numbers may be hard to swallow , Mr. Leamer says , is that they do not capture the many differences between the economic conditions of the 1980s and today , or even 2002 and today .
Income , mortgage rates and popular vacation spots have changed since then , as have myriad other factors deeply entwined with house prices .

Many experts look to price - to - rent ratios to estimate where house prices should be in a region .
Because renting is a direct alternative to buying , and because rents tend to be less volatile than prices , rents are often considered to be a good shorthand for figuring out the intrinsic value of a home .
In the past decade , the price - to - rent ratio in many markets has exploded , indicating that people have been paying much more for their homes than the property is actually worth .
From 1994 to 2002 , for example , Phoenix had an average ratio of 11 , according to data from Moody ’s Economy.com .
After peaking in the last quarter of 2002 at 22.5 , it cooled to about 17.3 in the first quarter of this year .
This measure is popular but problematic because some economists say many of the homes that people rent ( apartments in multifamily buildings ) may not be comparable to the types of homes that people buy ( single - family houses ) .
Another ratio that housing economists watch is the ratio of home prices to per-capita income .
This is telling because it shows whether Americans can actually afford the houses in their area .
Looking at previous peaks and troughs in the income ratio can provide an idea of where the housing market will bottom in a particular city .
In Boston , for example , the housing market peaked in the late 1980s around 11 , and then hovered around 7.5 when it bottomed in the late 1990s , according to Mr. Case .
This time around , it peaked at over 12 , and in the first quarter of this year , it was just over 10 .
Income and employment have had a particularly depressing effect on some regional housing markets .
In the Midwest , said Mr. Case , “ they never had a boom .
There was no bubble .
There ’s just a bust because employment ’s dropping like a rock . ”
In Detroit , for example , the price to per-capita income ratio grew gradually from 1991 to about 2004 , and has dropped steeply since then .

Introduction
This tutorial briefly walks you through writing a plugin for the Scala compiler .
It does not go into depth , but just shows you the very basics needed to write a plugin and hook it into the Scala compiler .
For the details on how to make your plugin accomplish some task , you must consult other documentation .
At the time of writing , your best option is to look at other plugins and to study existing phases within the compiler source code .
The command lines given in this tutorial assume you are using a Unixy Bourne shell and that you have the SCALA_HOME environment variable pointing to the root of your Scala installation .
When to write a plugin
A compiler plugin lets you modify the behavior of the compiler itself without needing to change the main Scala distribution .
You should not actually need to modify the Scala compiler very frequently , because Scala 's light , flexible syntax will frequently allow you to provide a better solution using a clever library .
There are some times , though , where a compiler modification is the best choice even for Scala .
Here are a few examples :
You might want to add additional compile - time checks , as with Gilad Bracha 's pluggable types point of view .
You might want to add compile - time optimizations for a heavily used library .
You might want to rewrite Scala syntax into an entirely different , custom meaning .
Beware of this kind of plugin , however , because any code relying on the plugin will be unusable when the plugin is not available .
Compiler plugins lets you make and distribute a compiler modification without needing to change the main Scala distribution .
You can instead write a compiler plugin that embodies your compiler modification , and then anyone you distribute the plugin to will be able to access your modification .
These modifications fall into two large categories with the current plugin support :
You can add a phase to the compiler , thus adding extra checks or extra tree rewrites that apply after type checking has finished .
You can tell the compiler type - checking information about an annotation that is intended to be applied to types .
This tutorial walks through the most basic aspects of writing compiler plugins .
For more information , you will need to read the source of other people 's compiler plugins and of the compiler itself .
A simple plugin , beginning to end
A plugin is a kind of compiler component that lives in a separate jar file from the main compiler .
The compiler can then load that plugin and gain extra functionality .
This section walks through writing a simple plugin .
Suppose you want to write a plugin that detects division by zero in obvious cases .
For example , suppose someone compiles a silly program like this :
object
Test { val five = 5 val amount = five / 0 def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) { println ( amount ) } }
Your plugin could generate an error like this :
Test.scala:3 : error : definitely division by zero val amount = five / 0 ^ one error found
There are several steps to making the plugin .
First you need to write and compile the source of the plugin itself .
Here is the source code for it :
package localhost import scala.tools.nsc import nsc.Global import nsc.
Phase import nsc.plugins .Plugin import nsc.plugins.PluginComponent class DivByZero(val global : Global ) extends Plugin { import global .
_ val name = " divbyzero " val description = " checks for division by zero " val components = List[ PluginComponent ] ( Component ) private object Component extends PluginComponent { val global : DivByZero.this.global.type = DivByZero.this.global val runsAfter = " refchecks " // Using the Scala Compiler 2.8.x the runsAfter should be written as below // val runsAfter = List [ String ] ( " refchecks " ) ; val phaseName = DivByZero.this.name def newPhase ( _prev : Phase ) = new DivByZeroPhase ( _prev ) class DivByZeroPhase ( prev : Phase ) extends StdPhase ( prev ) { override def name = DivByZero.this.name def apply ( unit : CompilationUnit ) { for ( tree @ Apply ( Select ( rcvr , nme .
DIV ) , List ( Literal ( Constant ( 0 ) ) ) ) <- unit.body ; if rcvr.tpe <:< definitions .IntClass.tpe ) { unit.error ( tree.pos , " definitely division by zero " ) } } } } }
There is a lot going on even with this simple plugin .
Here are a few aspects of note .
The plugin is described by a top - level class that inherits from Plugin , takes a Global as a constructor parameter , and exports that parameter as a val named global .
, takes a as a constructor parameter , and exports that parameter as a named .
The plugin must define one or more component objects that inherits from PluginComponent .
In this case the sole component is the nested Component object .
The components of a plugin are listed in the components field .
.
In this case the sole component is the nested object .
The components of a plugin are listed in the field .
Each component must define newPhase method that creates the component 's sole compiler phase .
That phase will be inserted just after the specified compiler phase , in this case refchecks .
method that creates the component 's sole compiler phase .
That phase will be inserted just after the specified compiler phase , in this case .
Each phase must define a method apply that does whatever you desire on the given compilation unit .
Usually this involves examining the trees within the unit and doing some transformation on the tree .
Beginning with the Scala Compiler version 2.8 a new system for handling compiler phases will be introduced .
This new system gives the plugin writer greater control over when the phase is executed .
As seen in the comment in the code example above , the runsAfter constraint is now a list of phase names .
This makes is possible to specify multiple phase names to preceed the plugin .
It is also possible , but optional , to specify a runsBefore constraint of phase names that this phase should preceed .
It is also possible , but again optional , to specify a runsRightAfter constraint on a specific phase .
Examples of this can be seen below and more information on these constraints and how they are resolved can be found in Compiler Phase and Plug - in Initialization SID .
private object Component extends PluginComponent { val global = DivByZero.this.global val runsAfter = List [ String ] ( " refchecks " , " typer " ) ; override val runsBefore = List [ String ] ( " tailcalls " ) ; //
Enable this and both runsAfter and runsBefore will have no effect // override val runsRightAfter = " refcheks " val phaseName = DivByZero.this.name def newPhase ( _prev : Phase ) = new DivByZeroPhase ( _prev ) }
That 's the plugin itself .
The next thing you need to do is write a plugin descriptor for it .
A plugin descriptor is a small XML file giving the name and the entry point for the plugin .
In this case it should look as follows :
< plugin > < name>divbyzero</name > < classname>localhost.DivByZero</classname > </ plugin>
The name of the plugin should match what is specified in your Plugin subclass , and the classname of the plugin is the name of the Plugin subclass .
All other information about your plugin is in the Plugin subclass .
Put this XML in a file named scalac - plugin.xml and then create a jar with that file plus your compiled code :
mkdir classes fsc -d classes ExPlugin.scala cp scalac - plugin.xml classes ( cd classes ; jar cf ../divbyzero.jar . )
Now you can use your plugin with scalac by adding the - Xplugin : option :
$ scalac - Xplugin:divbyzero.jar Test.scala Test.scala:3 : error : definitely division by zero val amount = five / 0 ^ one error found $
When you are happy with how the plugin behaves , you can install it by putting it in the directory misc / scala - devel / plugins within your Scala installation .
You can install your plugin with the following commands :
$ mkdir -p $ SCALA_HOME/misc/scala- devel / plugins $ cp divbyzero.jar $ SCALA_HOME/misc/scala-devel/plugins $
Now the plugin will be loaded by default :
$ scalac Test.scala Test.scala:3 : error : definitely division by zero val amount = five / 0 ^ one error found $
Useful Compiler Options
The previous section walked you through the basics of writing , using , and installing a compiler plugin .
There are several compiler options related to plugins that you should know about .
- Xshow - phases — show a list of all compiler phases , including ones that come from plugins .
— show a list of all compiler phases , including ones that come from plugins .
- Xplugin - list — show a list of all loaded plugins .
— show a list of all loaded plugins .
- Xplugin - disable : — disable a plugin .
Whenever the compiler encounters a plugin descriptor for the named plugin , it will skip over it and not even load the associated Plugin subclass .
— disable a plugin .
Whenever the compiler encounters a plugin descriptor for the named plugin , it will skip over it and not even load the associated subclass .
- Xplugin - require : — require that a plugin is loaded or else abort .
This is mostly useful in build scripts .
— require that a plugin is loaded or else abort .
This is mostly useful in build scripts .
- Xpluginsdir — specify the directory the compiler will scan to load plugins .
Again , this is mostly useful for build scripts .
The following options are not specific to writing plugins , but are frequently used by plugin writers :
- Xprint : — print out the compiler trees immediately after the specified phase runs .
— print out the compiler trees immediately after the specified phase runs .
- Ybrowse : — like - Xprint : , but instead of printing the trees , opens a Swing - based GUI for browsing the trees .
Adding your own options
A compiler plugin can provide command - line options to the user .
All such option start with - P : followed by the name of the plugin .
For example , - P : foo : bar will pass option bar to plugin foo .
To add options to your own plugin , you must do two things .
First , add a processOptions method to your Plugin subclass with the following type signature :
override def processOptions ( options : List [ String ] , error : String => Unit )
The compiler will invoke this method with all options the users specifies for your plugin .
For convenience , the common prefix of - P : followed by your plugin name will already be stripped from all of the options passed in .
The second thing you should do is add a help message for your plugins options .
All you need to do is override the val named optionsHelp .
The string you specify will be printed out as part of the compiler 's - help output .
By convention , each option is printed on one line .
The option itself is printed starting in column 3 , and the description of the option is printed starting in column 31 .
Type scalac - help to make sure you got the help string looking right .
Here is a complete plugin that has an option .
This plugin has no behavior other than to print out its option .
package localhost import scala.tools.nsc import nsc.Global import nsc.
Phase import nsc.plugins .Plugin import nsc.plugins.PluginComponent class Silly ( val global : Global ) extends Plugin { import global .
_ val name = " silly " val description = " goose " val components = List[ PluginComponent ] ( Component ) var level = 1000000 override def processOptions ( options : List [ String ] , error : String => Unit ) { for ( option <- options ) { if ( option.startsWith ( " level : " ) ) { level = option .
substring ( " level : " .length ) .
toInt } else { error ( " Option not understood : " + option ) } } } override val options Help : Option [ String ] = Some ( " - P: silly : level : n set the silliness to level n " ) private object Component extends PluginComponent { val global : Silly.this.global.type = Silly.this.global val runsAfter = " refchecks " // Using the Scala Compiler 2.8.x the runsAfter should be written as shown below // val runsAfter = List [ String ] ( " refchecks " ) ; val phaseName = Silly.this.name def newPhase ( _prev : Phase ) = new SillyPhase ( _prev ) class SillyPhase ( prev : Phase ) extends StdPhase ( prev ) { override def name = Silly. this.name def apply ( unit : CompilationUnit ) { println ( " Silliness level : " + level ) } } } }

Develop using Eclipse
Based on a discussion on the scala - tools mailing list , here is how to develop and debug a compiler plugin using Eclipse :
Today was the second and final day of RubyFringe .
I only had the opportunity to listen to a couple speakers today because I was busy all day interviewing some of the speakers from the conference for InfoQ .
Check out a post from the Unspace folks discussing the conference .
The Speakers
Geoffrey is a well - known personality in the Ruby community and is a very entertaining speaker .
He showed up to speak to us in a kilt which was very surprising and made him stand out very much .
His talk was really good and covered many of the things we as developers take for granted and the roots of our thoughts in philosophy .
I enjoyed the talk immensely .
John is one of my favorite speakers and personalities because he is smart and his talks are well thought out .
John is a good sport about things and showed it with his entrance to his talk when the lights went down and the music used when Darth Vader used to enter the scene in Star Wars .
It was totally fitting for a conference where Ruby and open source is the theme and Microsoft is evil .
The crowd loved it and cheered John ’s humor .
His talk was around his past and the different projects he took on his path to IronRuby .
Interviews
Sunday was all about interviews and that ’s what the InfoQ team did today .
We conducted 10 videotaped interviews for InfoQ .
I took care of 5 of them and I have to say they were a lot mentally harder than I expected , I was exhausted afterwards .
I had a good group of interviewees and learned a lot more about each of them .
These interviews will be transcribed and up on InfoQ in the next three weeks or so .
I hope each one is worth the price of admission .
I learned a ton here this weekend but more importantly I met a lot of people and had the chance to get to know them .
I really enjoy these smaller venues where you can really have a good time without too much going on .
Unspace did a great job of organizing this conference , bringing in great speakers and keeping everything running smoothly .
The evening ended with a good dinner and great conversation .
I hope there is a RubyFringe next year and I have the opportunity to attend .

JERUSALEM 
For the second time in a month , a Palestinian plowed a large construction vehicle into traffic on a busy Jerusalem street on Tuesday before being shot dead .
The driver was stopped when a passer - by got out of his car and shot into the vehicle ’s cabin .
A border policeman then fired more shots at the driver , the police said , “ to confirm his death . ”
The attack , which left some 16 people injured , took place in Jerusalem ’s upscale hotel district , close to the King David Hotel , where Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee for president , was to stay on Tuesday evening .
Mr. Obama is on a weeklong tour of the region as part of an American delegation .
The attack occurred near the Israeli presidential residence , where President Shimon Peres was having lunch with the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas .
It was the first visit by a Palestinian leader to the residence .

FROM Brussels this week NATO brandished a fist at Russia , warning it that there could be no “ business as usual ” so long as Russian forces remained in Georgia .
The Russians , oddly , did not quail .
If anything , President Dmitry Medvedev and his mentor and prime minister , Vladimir Putin , seem to be enjoying the world 's impotent indignation in the face of their new - found machismo .
And why not ?
They know that the West will not fight for the territorial integrity of Georgia , a trisected statelet of only 4 m people in the faraway Caucasus .
They also know that they will face no serious economic punishment .
As a collective , NATO may huff and puff , but the cold fact is that many of its big members need a lot of business with Russia to continue .
Germany and others in Europe need to keep buying Russia 's oil and gas .
America needs Russia , too , in order to secure vital foreign - policy objectives of its own , such as preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Does this mean that Russia will get away with its smash - and - grab operation ?
In one sense it does .
Russia 's intentions were unclear this week ; it drove some tanks here and there for the benefit of the cameras ( see article ) .
But if it is determined to keep its forces in Georgia proper despite the ceasefire agreement brokered by France , Germany and America , it is hard to see what any outsider can do about it .
Georgia 's dispute with Russia would then once again become a “ frozen ” conflict , except with different de facto borders .
The wider aims with which Russia is presumed to have entered Georgia have not yet been achieved , however .
They include toppling its pro-American president , Mikheil Saakashvili , and using intimidation to stop Georgia and Ukraine from following the Poles , Czechs , Balts and other former dominions of the Soviet Union into the orbit of the West and thence into NATO .
If it pursues sound policies , the West still stands a fair chance , despite its divisions , of thwarting these aims .
Sound policy starts with a sense of proportion .
Contrary to some excitable first reactions , Russia 's ability to crush the minuscule Georgian army does not make it a superpower , and its aggression in the Caucasus need not mark the start of a new cold war .
To put things in perspective , America 's GDP is ten times bigger than Russia 's and it spends at least seven times more on defence .
Russia 's economy would fall off a cliff if energy prices slumped and its population , racked by ill - health and inequality , is shrinking by up to 800,000 a year .
Russia can make mischief , but it cannot project military and ideological power all around the world , as the Soviet Union did during the cold war .
Although it scares some neighbours ( but not the Chinese ) , its threats make them all the more determined to stay on guard .
It is surely no coincidence that after months of prevarication the Poles agreed immediately after Russia invaded Georgia to let America base missile defences ( ostensibly against a future threat from Iran ) on Polish territory .
To say that Russia 's strength is exaggerated is not to say that it should be allowed to escape its Georgian adventure unpunished .
A weak power can be more reckless than a strong one .
Russia needs to learn that in spite of their own enervating foreign wars and economic worries the members of the Western alliance can still unite in front of a challenge .
But because Russia is fundamentally less strong than it likes to pretend , the West 's response can afford to be patient as well as principled .
One principle the West must insist on is the legitimacy of Georgia 's government .
However foolish Mr Saakashvili was to give Russia a pretext for invasion , he should stay in office until Georgians themselves throw him out .
Another principle is the right of any country , even if it is a former Soviet vassal in what Russia still counts as its own sphere of influence , to ask to join NATO .
Naturally , the alliance should not admit members who are unready , or for whom it is not in the end willing to fight .
On this test , Georgia might never get in .
But to give Russia a veto would be to mock the sovereignty of small countries .
Just wait
As to patience , suspending business as usual should not be pushed to the point that drives Russia into the sort of sulk that will make its behaviour worse .
Finding the line between disapproval , pressure and continued engagement will be hard .
Too much concern for the hurt feelings of a fallen empire could be misread as weakness and so encourage further bullying .
But there is vital work to be done — on nuclear proliferation and arms reduction , for example — in which the need for co-operation with Russia simply outweighs the need to punish it .
So Russia will keep its tanks in Georgia if it wants to .
But the longer it does so , the less Europe will want to rely on Russia for its energy , the longer it will wait to join the World Trade Organisation , the more hostile the next American president will be and the more its nervous neighbours will be tempted to turn to the West for safety .
The job now is to explain to Russia that this may not have been such a victory for machismo , after all .
DIGG THIS
The criminal case of E - Gold , an internet company that allows users to make exchanges using gold as currency , highlights basic questions about both justice and the proper scope of policing .
America is very far from being a free country .
Indeed , America is moving in the opposite direction .
At some point — and I , for one , would say that point is now — the U.S. becomes a police state or , at the very least , a " soft " police state .
The E - Gold case dramatically illustrates the lack of monetary freedom in the U.S. and many other countries with similar laws .
A person with monetary freedom can transact in any currency of his choice with anyone else willing to transact in that currency .
He can transmit any amount of money in any form he wants to use to any place in the world where another party stands ready to accept it .
A free person can use any available method of transmission to transmit the medium of exchange of his choice .
With monetary freedom , legal tender does not exist .
People choose the media of exchange that they prefer to use , and no authorities force them to use the dollar , the euro , the won , the yen , the rupee , the renmimbi , the ruble , or any other money .
They can use cowrie shells if they wish ( used widely in Africa until the 20th century ) .
Dr. Roger McCain writes that " The colonies were required to use European money , and they did — but when the European monetary systems collapsed in hyperinflation , the West African people went back to using their cowrie - money to get past the crisis .
It was the cowrie - money that proved most reliable for many years of the twentieth century . "
Monetary freedom also entails freedom for those in business who deal in money .
They are free to provide the service of privacy to their clients who want it .
Monetary freedom means that businesses are not compelled to spy on their clients .
It means that they are not forced to report transactions to the authorities , and that they are not compelled to become part of a network looking for activities that the authorities have deemed to be suspicious .
Monetary freedom means that if a business service permits it , a person can withdraw or deposit any amounts in any form he wants to without being subject to the prying and spying eyes of the authorities who have forced the business into being part of their police apparatus .
All of this can be re-stated in terms of rights .
A free person has the right to choose the medium of exchange ( money or currency ) that he prefers .
He has the right to choose any form of currency or money he prefers .
His rights are being invaded when the State compels him to use a national currency , like the dollar , or not to use a currency like gold .
His rights are being invaded when he is forced to accept a particular kind of money in transactions .
A free person has the right to send any amount of money in any form whatever to wherever he wants to .
He has the right to send it in secrecy and privacy if he can find an obliging carrier or transmitter .
Conversely , his rights and those of financial institutions are being invaded if those businesses are forced by the authorities or anyone else into inspecting and reporting upon his financial dealings .
Businesses that cannot operate or get licenses unless they agree to become spies for the authorities are having their rights invaded .
They are being subject to extortion by the State .
This is by no means a complete catalogue of what monetary freedom entails .
It serves as an introduction to the case of E - Gold .
The E - Gold Case
On July 21 , 2008 , the U.S. Department of Justice released a document with the headline : " DIGITAL CURRENCY BUSINESS E-GOLD PLEADS GUILTY TO MONEY LAUNDERING AND ILLEGAL MONEY TRANSMITTING CHARGES . "
Paragraph one noted " E - Gold , Ltd. , ( E - Gold ) an Internet - based digital currency business , and its three principal directors and owners , pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to money laundering and the operation of an illegal money transmitting business … "
The principal person involved is the company ’s founder , Dr. Douglas Jackson , 51 , of Melbourne , Florida .
He " pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business . "
Sentencing is due on November 20 , 2008 .
" Douglas Jackson faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a fine of $ 500,000 on the conspiracy to engage in money laundering charge , and a sentence of five years and a fine of $ 250,000 on the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business charge . "
Additionally , as part of the plea , E - Gold and Gold & Silver Reserve have " agreed to forfeiture in the amount of $ 1.75 million in the form of a money judgment for which they are joint and severally liable . "
On top of that , at sentencing , the companies also face a maximum fine of $ 3.7 million .
Questions
The case raises such questions as these .
Did E - Gold violate the rights of others ?
Or have the monetary rights of E - Gold been violated ?
Suppose that a department store has a restaurant , and suppose that several criminals transact business at a table while having lunch there .
Is the store guilty of a crime ?
Suppose that criminals communicate using newspaper ads .
Is the newspaper company guilty of a crime ?
Did it violate the rights of the criminals ’ victims ?
Suppose that criminals communicate secretly using some advanced telephone or internet communications device .
Are the manufacturers of that device responsible for the crimes that these criminals commit ?
Are internet providers guilty of conspiracy ?
Suppose that a bank receives deposits from criminals .
Is the bank responsible for the crimes these criminals have committed ?
Is it responsible for knowing its customers and for detecting those who are criminals ?
Is it responsible for reporting monetary transactions to the authorities ?
Should racetracks , gambling houses , and internet gaming companies be required to report large money bets and large winnings ?
Should stores , auto dealers , and real estate agents be required to report large purchases for cash ?
Should every company be made to detect and report possible criminal activities on its premises or among persons using its products or services ?
Should every company be made to monitor everyone with whom it deals in order to detect possible criminal activities ?
Answers
A free person is certainly not free if he is forced into becoming a police spy .
A person is not free if he is forced to monitor all the people and their activities that he encounters .
The same statements hold for a business .
If there is a law against dealing in drugs , that becomes a matter for the police , not a bank or a stock broker or a mutual fund , all of whom are being forced into reporting to the authorities .
Everyone has a right to his life , liberty , and property .
To be forced into using one ’s time , money , and property in order to detect possible criminal behavior is clearly an invasion of one ’s basic rights .
It is one thing to ask people to be on the lookout for a suspected criminal .
It is one thing to ask people if they will post wanted posters , or to ask a business to donate some space to alert people to a suspected criminal .
The voluntary cooperation of common people in finding and apprehending criminals is one thing , but compelling them to police one another is entirely a different matter .
This is the difference between a free country and police state .
The U.S. has crossed the line , and so have many other countries .
Another answer to all of these questions is panarchy .
You choose your society , and I will choose mine .
And they can co-exist side by side on the same territory .
Societies that are without territorial control , living side by side , intermingling , are what panarchy is about .
You practice your religion or none , and I practice mine or none .
We live in the same town and there is no problem .
If you want to live in a society in which no one has privacy and everyone spies on everyone else , then do so .
Your members can report on each other all they like .
But you have no right to impose your restraints and dictates on those who think otherwise and choose a society in which their banks do not have to report large cash transactions to the police .
You may want to reduce drug - taking and attempt to do so by imposing all sorts of police - state methods .
You may launch billion - dollar wars on drugs and build a prison in each locality to house , feed , and clothe drug users , or you may execute them .
But you have no right to impose your methods ( or taxes or regulations ) on anyone else who chooses a different society , although they may live on the east side and you on the west side of town , or even if they live on the west side too .
Tolerance is what panarchy is about , that is , tolerance by people of those who live across the social divides that they wish to make for themselves .
Social divides need not be territorial divides .
There is plenty of room for everyone and plenty of ways to accommodate the different ways of others without compelling everyone to live under one set of laws in this vast region we call the United States of America .
You may be as intolerant of drug-users as you like to all those within your society who have agreed to that intolerance , but you may not extend your intolerance to my drug use within my society and my ability to buy drugs without a doctor ’s prescription or to my having them administered by an alternative healer of illness .
Is Dr. Jackson guilty of a crime ?
The fact that Dr. Jackson pleaded guilty does not answer the question of whether he is guilty of a crime .
He was forced into a corner .
He is seeking to continue the company he began 12 years ago .
He is revamping it to comply with the State ’s edicts .
A guilty plea was his least - cost choice , in his estimation .
Dr. Jackson ’s statement can be found here .
It is a complete cave - in to all the demands of the State .
E - Gold was not a fly - by - night business .
Its customers did not bring about the criminal indictment .
It was not customer complaints about missing gold , embezzlement , theft , or poor service that brought on the indictments .
E- Gold did not steal anything from anyone .
If it has , why has n’t the DOJ trumpeted that ?
However , the criminal complaint did have a large negative effect on E - Gold customers who encountered illiquidity in their accounts .
The Department of Justice [ sic ] news release goes on at great length about the supposed crimes that Dr. Jackson committed .
In fact , the document suggests to me that the company committed no crimes at all !
If it did commit crimes , did the victims appear in court ?
Did they document their damages ?
If Dr. Jackson actually committed a crime , what was it ?
The fact is that he pleaded guilty to the nebulous crime of conspiracy to engage in money laundering .
This only means that other people used E - Gold to transmit funds possibly obtained via illegal activities and that E - Gold was not equipped to detect who they were and report them .
What kind of cockamamie crime is it when one fails to kowtow to the State ’s edicts compelling one to work with the authorities to detect money laundering ?
For that is what is involved in the other conspiracy charge .
I quote the DOJ : " E - Gold … will move to fully comply with all applicable federal and state laws relating to operating as a licensed money transmitting business and the prevention of money laundering which includes registering as money service businesses .
Also as part of the plea agreement , the businesses will create a comprehensive money laundering detection program that will require verified customer identification , suspicious activity reporting and regular supervision by the Internal Revenue Services ’ ( IRS ) Bank Secrecy Act Division … "
Dr. Jackson has pleaded guilty to the crime of not verifying who his customers were , not making sure that they were not criminals , not creating a comprehensive program to detect money laundering , not detecting and reporting suspicious activity , and not operating under the supervision of the Bank Secrecy Act Division of the IRS .
In other words , he did n’t become part of the State ’s spying apparatus , and that makes him and his operation a criminal conspiracy .
The crime here is not the commission of a crime .
Instead the State is demanding that you do what it tells you , and if you do n’t , then that is a crime .
If you stand up for your rights and do not obey the State ’s demands , you are a criminal !
Conclusion
In Wikipedia , we read : " The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 ( or BSA , or otherwise known as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act ) requires U.S.A. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering .
Specifically , the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments , file reports of cash transactions exceeding $ 5,000 ( daily aggregate amount ) , and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering , tax evasion , or other criminal activities .
It was passed by the Congress of the United States in 1970 .
The BSA is sometimes referred to as an “ anti- money laundering ” law ( “ AML ” ) or jointly as " BSA / AML " .
Several anti-money laundering acts , including provisions in title III of the USA PATRIOT Act , have been enacted up to the present to amend the BSA .
( See 31 USC 5311 - 5330 and 31 CFR 103 . ) "
The rest of the article introduces the reader to the reporting requirements under these laws .
These laws infringe the monetary rights of all persons who either are made to obey them or who are forced to transact under the watchful eyes of financial institutions that are applying these laws to their persons and property .
These laws are one of the very many instances of the abysmal and wretched failure of Americans to have monetary freedom .
Many other countries are in no better shape .
We have major laws that openly violate the rights of people .
I protest !
If I disobey one of these laws , then I am a criminal under these laws .
If I am caught , then I will pay a price for my disobedience , that is , for exercising my rights .
That is what happened to E - Gold .
It ’s a topsy - turvy world .

McCain may postpone convention
John McCain said the Republican National Convention may be postponed , after federal officials said Hurricane Gustav was gathering to a devastating Category 5 as it headed toward star - crossed New Orleans .
“ It just would n't be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near - tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster , ” McCain told Chris Wallace of “ Fox News Sunday ” in an interview taped for Sunday .
“ So we 're monitoring it from day to day and I 'm saying a few prayers , too . ”

McCain also said : “ I 'm afraid , Chris , that we may have to look at that situation and we 'll try to monitor it .
I 've been talking to Govs. Jindal , Barbour , Riley .
Chris , I 've been talking to all of them . ”
Officials at the convention , which is to open Monday in St. Paul , Minn. , tell Politico they are figuring out how to handle the formal business of nominating McCain even if some delegations are not able to attend .
The officials also are preparing program contingencies in case speakers such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal have to cancel .
Maria Cino , the convention ’s president and chief executive officer , said in a statement to Politico : " Like all Americans , our prayers are with those who will be affected by Hurricane Gustav .
We continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies .
“ We are in communication with the Gulf state governors to make sure the convention is taking all the appropriate steps as the hurricane progresses .
The safety of our affected delegations is our first priority , and preparing for Gustav comes before anything else . "
On Friday , Cino vowed on C - SPAN , in a quote picked up by the Drudge Report , that the gavel will come down .
President Bush , first lady Laura Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are scheduled to speak Monday .
The government ’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina still stings , and Republicans said they doubt the president would come to a political bash if New Orleans were facing a threat .
White House officials were considering a range of alternatives , including a Bush satellite appearance from the Gulf , according to Republican officials .
They would not say what the other possibilities were .
Press Secretary Dana Perino told reporters on a conference call Saturday that the government is preparing for a devastating storm of historic proportions .
" We are making contingency plans should the president decide against traveling to Minnesota for the RNC convention , " Perino said on the call .
New Orleans officials said they might begin a full evacuation Monday .

Golden Scales : Nanoscale Mass Sensor from Berkeley Can Be Used to Weigh Individual Atoms and Molecules
Contact : Lynn Yarris , ( 510 ) 486-5375
There ’s a new “ gold standard ” in the sensitivity of weighing scales .
Using the same technology with which they created the world ’s first fully functional nanotube radio , researchers with Berkeley Lab and the University of California ( UC ) at Berkeley have fashioned a nanoelectromechanical system ( NEMS ) that can function as a scale sensitive enough to measure the mass of a single atom of gold .
A double - walled carbon nanotube NEMS has been used to measure the mass of a single atom of gold .
Atoms landing on the tube change the tube�s resonant frequency in proportion to the mass of the atoms , much like what happens when a diver hits a springboard .
Alex Zettl , a physicist who holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division ( MSD ) and UC Berkeley ’s Physics Department , where he is the director of the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems , led this research .
Working with him were members of his research group , Kenneth Jensen and Kwanpyo Kim .
“ For the past 15 years or so , the holy grail of NEMS has been to push them to a small enough size with high enough sensitivity so that they might resolve the mass of a single molecule or even single atom , ” Zettl said .
“ This has been a challenge even at cryogenic temperatures where reduced thermal noise improves the sensitivity .
We have achieved sub - single - atom resolution at room temperature ! ”
The new NEMS mass sensor consists of a single carbon nanotube that is double - walled to provide uniform electrical properties and increased rigidity .
One tip of the carbon nanotube is free and the other tip is anchored to an electrode in close proximity to a counter - electrode .
A DC voltage source , such as from a battery or a solar cell array , is connected to the electrodes .
Applying a DC bias creates a negative electrical charge on the free tip of the nanotube .
An additional radio frequency wave " tickles " the nanotube , causing it to vibrate at a characteristic “ flexural ” resonance frequency .
When an atom or molecule is deposited onto the carbon nanotube , the tube ’s resonant frequency changes in proportion to the mass of the atom or molecule , much like the added mass of a diver changes the flexural resonance frequency of a diving board .
Measuring this change in frequency reveals the mass of the impinging atom or molecule .
" Getting nanotubes to vibrate is fairly easy , " said Jensen .
" The difficult part is detecting those small vibrations .
We accomplished this by field - emitting , or spraying , electrons from the tip of the nanotube and detecting the resulting electrical current . "
Using their NEMS mass sensor , Zettl , Jensen and Kim were able to weigh individual gold atoms and measure masses as small as two fifths that of a gold atom at room temperature and in just a little more than one second of time .
A gold atom has a mass of 3.25 x 10 - 25 kilograms , which means that there are about 3 million million million million gold atoms in a single kilogram .
While there have been other NEMS that function as mass sensors before , most of these previous devices were fashioned from silicon , and none had achieved the magical single - atom resolution at room temperature .
The carbon nanotube mass sensor of Zettl ’s group is a thousand times smaller by volume than typical NEMS resonators – measuring only about a billionth of a meter in diameter and 200 billionths of a meter in length .

“ Carbon nanotubes are the ideal material for this purpose and their small size makes them sensitive enough to resolve single atoms even at room temperature , ” Jensen said .
While scientists already have the ability to measure the mass of individual atoms through a complex technique known as mass spectrometry , this new carbon nanotube NEMS mass sensor offers some distinct advantages and opens the door to new possibilities , as Jensen explained .
“ Unlike mass spectrometry , our device does not require the ionization of neutral atoms or molecules that can destroy samples such as proteins .
Also unlike mass spectrometers , our carbon nanotube mass sensor becomes more sensitive at higher mass ranges , which makes it more suitable for measuring large biomolecules like DNA .
Finally , our device is small enough so that , in time , it could be incorporated onto a chip . ”
Zettl , Jensen and Kim described their NEMS mass sensor in a paper published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology , entitled : “ An atomic - resolution nanomechanical mass sensor . ”
This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Office of Science , Basic Energy Sciences Program ’s Materials Sciences and Engineering Division , and by the National Science Foundation within the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems .

The team 's bees were identified with small numbers
The way bumblebees search for food could help detectives hunt down serial killers , scientists believe .
Just as bees forage some distance away from their hives , so murderers avoid killing near their homes , says the University of London team .
This " geographic profiling " works so well in bees , the scientists say future experiments on the animals could now be fed back to improve crime - solving .
The team 's work is reported in the Royal Society journal Interface .
" We 're really hopeful that we can improve the model for criminology , " Dr Nigel Raine , from Queen Mary , University of London ( QMUL ) , told BBC News .
Understanding how bees are recruited to flowers is much easier than understanding the complex thoughts of a serial murderer
Dr Nigel Raine
The scientist is working with colleagues Steve Le Comber and Kim Rossmo , a former detective in the US , to tag bees with tiny coloured numbers and follow them from their nests to flower patches .
The researchers ' analysis describes how bees create a " buffer zone " around their hive where they will not forage , to reduce the risk of predators and parasites locating the nest .
It turns out that this pattern of behaviour is similar to the geographic profile of criminals stalking their victims .
" Most murders happen close to the killer 's home , but not in the area directly surrounding a criminal 's house , where crimes are less likely to be committed because of the fear of getting caught by someone they know , " Dr Raine explained .
Food importance Understanding the geographic profiles of animals is interesting to biologists as it helps them predict the locations of important feeding grounds , and knowing these areas will inform more effective conservation measures .
This approach works well for very different creatures , from bees and bats to great white sharks .

But what is more unusual is that models used to describe bee foraging can be applied back to human behaviour , the researchers say .
Instead of using information about the distribution of flowers visited by bees to explain the insects ' behaviour , criminologists ' models will use details about crime scenes , robbery locations , abandoned cars , even dead bodies , to hone the search for a suspect .
" Bees have much simpler brains and so understanding how bees are recruited to flowers is much easier than understanding the complex thoughts of a serial murderer , " Dr Raine said .
More broadly , the London - based team hopes its work will lead to a better understanding of how one of the most familiar animals in nature goes about its daily business .
" Bees are hugely important to ecosystems and also important to humans , " Dr Raine told BBC News .
" Bees ' pollination ' services ' account for about one in three mouthfuls of food that we eat as humans .
They pollinate a huge diversity of our fruit and vegetable crops .
" If we do n't know how bees forage then we do n't really understand pollination , and that is quite detrimental to how we feed ourselves ; which is becoming an increasing problem with bigger populations . "
Dr Raine 's team is also using tiny Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags - the same technology used to track stock in warehouses or supermarkets - to monitor the movements of bees .
The miniature tags are glued to the backs of the insects to record their movements in and out of the hive .

What are these ?
In the OO languages I 'm most familiar with , there 's always been the ability to set a variable to null or nil which of course can lead to all sorts of fun problems .
What I 'm wondering is if there 's an actual need for null / nil or not ?
Anyone know any research about this ?
I have a sense that null is the kind of thing that 'd end up being invented by programmers if it was n't already in the language to begin with which makes me wonder if it has been shown to be essential somehow in the same way that number systems seem to need zero .
( I suspect I may be way out of my depth in even asking this question ... but what the heck :) )
( CNN ) --
The air in and around New Orleans is electrified with anticipation -- and anxiety .
Louisiana National Guard members arrive at the New Orleans convention center during preparations for Gustav .
Nervous is how Merrick Matherne says he is feeling .
Nervous and stressed at the prospect of having to survive and rebuild in the wake of another hurricane .
As Friday 's third anniversary of Katrina 's landfall passed , the Crescent City found itself potentially in the cross hairs of another destructive storm , Hurricane Gustav .
Residents are suspended in a wait - and - see mode , with an evacuation order for New Orleans likely to come sometime after Saturday , according to Mayor Ray Nagin .
Matherne and his family live in a low - lying area in the town of Metairie , near Lake Ponchartrain , just outside New Orleans .
After Katrina and a drawn - out evacuation , Merrick and his wife spent nine taxing months living in various places , sometimes apart .
Then , they went through the challenge of dealing with insurance companies and contractors over the phone , waiting for the various bureaucracies involved to do their part .
Now they face the prospect that it might happen all over again .
And they are not alone .
" The city is in a little bit of a panic , " says Dr. Tim Pearman , Ph.D. , a clinical associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine .
" Kind of wherever you go , every TV is turned to the news .
The news is now reporting nothing else other than the hurricane , and it 's days away .
People are really heightened in terms of their emotions right now . "
Many New Orleans residents already live on the edge emotionally .
Among Katrina survivors , New Orleans has a post - traumatic stress disorder rate of more than 25 percent , and a mood and anxiety disorders rate of roughly 35 percent , according to a study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry in January .
The big question is , can the city deal with any mental health fallout should Gustav get within striking distance ?
" Thinking about the storm is anxiety - provoking for people .
It brings them back to a lot of those feelings they had and memories from Katrina , " says Dr. Anthony Speier , the deputy assistant secretary for the office of mental health at the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals .
" People have memories that are triggered by preparing for this storm . "
" Why did we return ?
Why did we rebuild ?
Why is this happening again to us ?
All of those thoughts are going through people 's minds , " says Dr. Lisa Mills , an associate professor of emergency medicine at Louisiana State University 's Health Sciences Center at New Orleans .
" People are certainly anxious and doubting themselves . "
But there is a small silver lining to all the attention Gustav is generating .
Pearman , who also serves as the director of the Tulane Cancer Center Comprehensive Clinic , says that although the anxiety brought on by Gustav is " definitely a bad thing , " it is spurring better preparedness .
" In terms of the prep , it 's great , because I really think it 's going to be a different ball game than it was three years ago . "
There is no doubt that the city is better prepared overall than it was for Katrina .
But in mental health services , many holes still exist .
After the storm , the city lost -- and has n't completely replaced -- many of its hospital beds devoted to mental health , and also many of its psychiatrists , psychologists and social workers , leaving it ill - equipped to handle its chronic caseload , let alone any spike in mental health care needs brought on by potential stressful events like Gustav .
" Throughout the country , mental health is in crisis , and in areas that are impoverished and recently devastated like New Orleans , they are certainly struggling , " says Mills , who is also an ER physician at the Louisiana State University emergency department at the University Hospital in New Orleans .
Mills says the city 's mental health system that can't provide care for its chronic level of illness , let alone for any surge in demand .
Pearman agrees that the city has not recovered .
" Mental - health wise , absolutely not .
The number of providers is still far below what 's needed , " he says .
Still , New Orleans is not a complete wasteland in terms of mental health services .
Louisiana Spirit is the state - run counseling program funded by FEMA .
" We 've been on the ground since Katrina and have been providing mental health and emotional recovery services , " says Speier , who directs Louisiana Spirit .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Post - traumatic stress disorder
He says the agency has about 215 counselors who service the parishes in and around New Orleans .
" We have provided individual counseling visits to over a quarter - million people and we 've generated probably 2.5 million to 3 million contacts -- many people we see more than once .
The primary part of their work [ is ] meeting with survivors , going to their neighborhoods , homes , community centers , and educating people about emergency preparedness , about coping with the recovery process , about getting their homes and lives back together . "
As for Matherne , he says he and his wife are dealing with the specter of Gustav with humor , mostly for the sake of his eldest daughter , now 9 , who is anxious about losing her friends and her toys all over again .
" We 're just trying to be as funny as possible and keep it in as light a mood as possible while we 're biting our nails .
We 're worrying amongst ourselves and eating junk food as relief . "
He jokes that they have n't hit the bourbon yet , but they are defrosting the freezer , where a gallon of daiquiris await .

All About Hurricane Katrina • Mental Health
By Geeta Pandey
BBC News , Srinagar
Kashmir has some stunning scenery
Not long ago , people on flights from Delhi to Srinagar , capital of Indian - administered Kashmir , were either government officials , local businessmen or journalists .
Years of fighting between separatist militants and Indian security forces had created a feeling that it was unsafe to travel to the region and tourists stayed away .
But now travellers are back in numbers .
At Delhi airport , my fellow passengers are families and other tourists .
The queue at the departure gate is noisy with happy chatter and the squeals of excited children .
On the flight , the conversation is about cheap airline tickets , mountains , lakes and snow .
Improved security
In Srinagar in the early evening , the boulevard near Dal Lake is buzzing with tourists .
Shopkeepers selling traditional Kashmiri handicraft and embroidered clothes call out to prospective buyers and women in jeans , T - shirts and sleeveless tops admire the wares on display .
The turn - around in tourism can be attributed directly to improved security in the past few years - India and Pakistan have better relations and incidents of violence are greatly reduced .
Some say tourism is the lifeline of Kashmir And a semblance of peace has brought in more visitors than ever before .
In 1989 , before militancy erupted in Kashmir , there were 250,000 visitors .
This year , there were 400,000 visitors in the first six months .
Many in the tourist trade find it hard to suppress their glee .
Taxis and tourist coaches are doing roaring business ferrying visitors from Srinagar to the other tourist hotspots of Gulmarg , Sonmarg and Pahalgam .
" There are 15 flights landing in Srinagar a day and each one is chock - a- block with tourists , " says Nazir A Bakshi of Shiraz Travels .
' Making money '
Mr Bakshi is handling 5,000 tourists at the moment and his phone is ringing off the hook .
" You ca n't get a hotel room in Srinagar or Pahalgam easily .
Everything is booked .
We have a situation where we are refusing customers . "
Mr Bakshi says for the first time in many years , " a lot of people are making a lot of money " .
Dal Lake is the most popular tourist resort in the region
He says if things continue the way they are " we can expect up to 700,000 tourists this year " .
By 2010 , he expects that number to cross the one - million mark .
Some say even that is a conservative estimate .
But is Kashmir prepared for this influx ?
Yes and no .
Many of the hotels and houseboats which had shut down during the years of insurgency have reopened .
As the situation improved , new hotels have been built and many have been refurbished .
Now , the tourism department is also inviting applications for " bed and breakfast " and " paying guest " accommodation to meet the ever - growing need .
" There are new , better hotels coming up at all tourist destinations .
The number of rooms has increased manifold in the last few years , " says Mr Sarmad Hafeez , joint director in the state tourism department .
" The remarkable thing this year is that we have received a lot of high - end visitors - we 've had golfers , skiers and leisure tourists - who spend a lot of money and hence contribute to the local economy . "
Few foreigners Srinagar 's new international airport is due to open at the end of the year and Mr Hafeez says direct flights from Dubai , Singapore and Bangkok will bring in more tourists .
But , he admits , a lot more needs to be done .
" At the moment , about 10,000 visitors arrive in Kashmir every day .
We need to develop full infrastructure , build better hotels if we want to have more affluent visitors . "
Almost everyone I speak to here says too few foreign tourists are coming to Kashmir .
Houseboat owners miss foreign tourists " In 1989 , 14 flights used to land in Srinagar every day from Delhi , Bombay [ Mumbai ] and Ahmedabad .
Twelve of those used to be full of foreign tourists .
The foreigners prefer to stay in houseboats .
We want those types of tourists , " says the chairman of the Houseboat Owners ' Association , M Azim Tuman .
After militancy peaked in the 1990s , most Western governments advised against travel to Kashmir .
Since then , the number of European and American visitors has been a trickle - and tourism officials are trying to change that .
" Militant attacks happen everywhere in the world .
New York , London , Delhi , Bombay , everyplace has seen attacks .
And more people die on Delhi 's roads because they are hit by buses than in militancy - related violence in Kashmir .
Why single us out , " Mr Hafeez asks ?
" In fact , Kashmir is the safest - there 's no crime against women here , there have been no instances of rape or molestation .
It 's time for the Western governments to reconsider their travel advisories , " he says .
' Thrilled '
For the moment , Indian tourists are having a great time in Srinagar .
The lake front is crowded with holiday - makers and most houseboats have " house full " signs .
The Satyamurthy family say they are having a great time The Satyamurthy family are " thrilled " to be here .
" We went to Sonmarg this morning , the children saw snow for the first time today .
They were so excited , " says mother Usha Satyamurthy .
Her son , Vikram , says : " I had heard that there are terrorists here .
But I 'm not afraid any more . "
Father V Satyamurthy says he wanted to bring his children to ensure there were " no demons in the mind " .
And if hundreds of thousands of visitors are anything to go by , the demons of Kashmir 's immediate past seem to be losing their grip
But uncertainty about the future remains .
" Tourism is important for Kashmir .
But it 's a very touchy industry , " says the president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Mubeen Shah .
" Something happens and the tourists would be the first ones to run away . "

I do n't think the FBI can just declare a case solved and everybody just packs up and goes home , but if they can , or if that 's what they are going to do even if they can't , just like the rest of this administration , that 's all the more reason to suspect he was suicided .

I tells ya , go and read Meryl Nass ' blog .
The one thing that I surmised is that the reporter , Gary Matsumoto , is inside , check this out : Matsumoto is a peculiar journalist .
We had a number of conversations .
He would not get off the phone , sometimes staying on for an hour or more .
He would harass me , in an attempt to shape the story .
He worked very hard , trying to force me to say that the only problem with anthrax vaccine was its squalene adjuvant , although there were many reasons to question that assertion .
I hung up on him more than once , exasperated , and no doubt I used some foul language describing our conversations to others .

When it hits MSM 6 o'clock news , you know they are trying to sell the public so they can call the case solved and officially closed .
There is absolutely nothing they have offered that in any way resembles concret evidence .
Mr. Ivins unfortunately had some help . . . yah suicide !

I read on one of the sites that Ivins gave himself the anthrax vaccine every six months in order to continue working in the lab .
It had to be given that frequently because it does n't last very long .
By one estimate he had been vaccinated 33 times against anthrax .
Now it is reported that he had been suffering for a number of years from serious mental illness .
I have to wonder what effect the anthrax vaccine had on him .
It is believed by many to be responsible for Gulf War Syndrome .
It is know to carry a number of high risks .
If he had a tendency toward depression and paranoia , God only knows how this condition might have worsened with each shot .
Of course , since vaccines are generally considered sacred cows ( " the benefits outweight the risks " ) , I seriously doubt anyone in the mainstream will even raise this question .

While the NPR story seems pretty good , it , the initial AP story , and the initial NYT story all have a significant inaccuracy .
This inaccuracy was used to lead the NYT story and I believe was the main thrust of the initial AP story .
The error , in all three stories and others I 've found , claimed that " a few days before the attacks " ( worded slightly differently in the different stories ) , Ivins sent an email warning " Bin Laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas . "
Sounds extremely suspicious written like that --- as though he were planning to pin the attacks on Muslims in advance of doing them , which is what the letters enclosed in the attacks do .
But , within those affidavits for warrants are the email in question .
And guess what ?
The email in question was sent eight days AFTER the first attacks were postmarked , on the same day the Washington Times did a story saying bin laden was trying to get sarin and anthrax .
And all three stories omitted Ivins ' phrase " I just heard tonight " before " Bin Laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas . "
I wonder when the lab was first told about someone getting a letter ?
I imagine they must 've arrived by Sept. 26 .
And even if the letters had n't been tested for anthrax , the letters included the word " anthrax . "
Could it be that this email --- painted as so damning --- was something he sent after being told about the anthrax mailings at work ?
Regardless , Ivins ' Sept. 26 email is not particularly suspicious at all when one does n't lie about when it was sent and omit " I just heard tonight . "
Why'd they all get the story wrong ?
At least part of the reason is probably that the postal inspector summarized the email incorrectly in the exact same way at the top of the warrant .
I wonder if the feds were also still pushing that lie / distortion as a talking point .
It seems likely since it led at least two major stories .
I contacted the NYT and AP last night and their stories have been corrected .
I contacted NPR today , so hopefully that article will be corrected soon .
The NYT deleted a comment I had left complaining about the error and then noting that it was corrected , once it was ( more than an hour after I complained ) .
That 's too bad , because there 's a much larger point than just correcting the error --- somehow multiple news sources are getting this information wrong .
Information that at least two of the publications saw as important enough to lead their stories on the feds ' case .
And it 's important to note that the top of the warrant is misleading and actually wrong .
The phrase " sole custodian " has also been bandied about , despite the fact that apparently 100 people had access to that anthrax .
This is a serious obfuscation .
It just goes to show the need for a full and impartial vetting of all of the claims and to see the actual evidence .
Maybe he is guilty .
But , I 'm not just going to take the claims at face value with no examination of the evidence .
This is too important to our nation to do that .
If Dr. Ivins were not responsible , or even if he was not solely responsible , the culprit(s ) , who committed an extremely successful attack and helped propel policies of wars , torture , indefinite detention , and spying on Americans are still free to continue plotting , killing , and manipulating public policy .
And after the Hatfill mess , why would we assume the case is solved correctly ?
And even the feds admit their case is circumstantial and that they can't tie him to driving to NJ / the mailbox .
I still do n't even know if he COULD make weaponized anthrax .

Gary Matsumoto is really inside this investigation : Vaccine - A uncovers a story of betrayal — the betrayal of the men and women who serve in the armed forces , the betrayal of medical ethics , and the betrayal of the American people by military and civilian leaders sworn to defend and protect .
Veteran journalist Gary Matsumoto shows that the worst friendly - fire incident in military history came from something no soldier had any reason to think would harm him : a vaccine administered by the military 's own medics ...
His 1998 article in Vanity Fair was the first to draw the connection between the anthrax vaccine and Gulf War Syndrome .

More from that Vaccine - A site :
In 1978 , the Pentagon began developing an anthrax vaccine of unsurpassed safety and purity .
Soon , however , military scientists learned that their new vaccine , though pure , was also ineffective .
To remedy this they added an oil called squalene — an " adjuvant " — to stimulate the immune system .
What the scientists did n't know , but should have known , is that squalene causes autoimmune diseases : chronic and even life - threatening diseases like lupus erythematosus , crippling arthritis , and multiple sclerosis .
Matsumoto reveals that even very recently , squalene - laced " vaccine A " continues to be secretly injected into Army , Navy , and Air Force personnel .
Did Ivins know anything about this ?

Does anyone know when the first anthrax letter was reported to authorities ?
Not when it was tested postive for anthrax , but when the first person opened it , read it , and called authorities ?
I want to know if it was before or after Dr. Ivins ' Sept 26 email .
Regardless , I think the letter is not particularly suspicious ( as long as one does n't cut the phrase " I just heard tonight " and lie about its date ) .
If the feds are not only lying about the letter 's timing , and deleting an important phrase , but also knew that the authorities already had known about an anthrax letter by then , that 's pretty major .

Found the date the anthrax letters were discovered I think I found the answer to my question : I do n't think any of the letters were reported to authorities by 9/26 .
It looks like the NBC one was opened soon after Sept. 18 , but the person opening it did n't realize for awhile that it could be dangerous and seemingly did not report it .
( http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14785359/
)
It sounds like the others were n't opened , or at least reported , for at least a couple of weeks .

The NY Post one was also recovered , it was found on Oct. 19 .
They only inferred that there were letters sent to ABC , it was not recovered .
There was apparently a letter addressed to Jennifer Lopez with a Star of David that they think was the National Enquirer letter , which ws not recovered .

I pulled this excerpt from an MSNBC article , which actually questions why ivins continued to work at Ft Dietrick after he was being investigated by the feds ...
" Privacy concerns , bureaucratic loopholes , the demands of a criminal investigation — all combined to let Ivins keep his job and stay out of jail for years .
And in the high - security lab until last November .
Or was it just that the government 's evidence was too weak to act ?
That 's what Ivins ' attorney says .
" If it 's such earth - shattering stuff , what 's been going on since 2005 ? "
Paul F. Kemp asked Wednesday after the government made its case with a news conference and a pile of documents .
" Why is he on the street if they think it 's that important ? "
That question goes beyond the criminal investigation .
It goes to the heart of how secure the nation 's nearly 1,400 biological defense labs are and whether the estimated 14,000 scientists working with deadly toxins are being screened for the kind of mental illness Ivins exhibited . "
What really caught my attention was the use of the term " biological defense labs " .
They are not just defense labs , they are weapons labs .
If they were in Iraq , they 'd for sure be weapons labs , and we'd have an excuse to invade .
Sure hope the Chinese are n't gearing up to disarm us from our WMD , being the threat to world peace that we are .

I was on the right track , good motive for bumping him off , but no proof he did it .
From NYT : The stakes were particularly high for Dr. Ivins , who , for nearly a decade , had been leading experiments in which laboratory animals — rabbits , monkeys and mice — were injected with vaccines that each had slightly different additives in an effort to increase their effectiveness .
Critics of the program were accusing the Defense Department of using one of the experimental formulas , which featured an oil - based additive called squalene , in vaccines given to military personnel in the gulf war , a decision , they contended , that may have caused autoimmune diseases among returning soldiers .
“ It is well documented that the U.S. military has a history of administering experimental vaccines to the troops , ” said Gary Matsumoto , who was doing research on a book on the anthrax program and who had submitted Freedom of Information requests to the Army requesting access to Dr. Ivins ’s laboratory notebooks .
And the motive ? , a cover up IMO ( bold mine ) The Defense Department denied conducting such experiments on troops and defended the vaccine , saying it was both safe and effective , and necessary to protect the military from a possible attack .
Dr. Ivins ’s notebooks , which were released to the public , suggested , however , that he had found that the vaccine might be making some of the test animals sick .
case closed ?

Can understanding the biographical context of a philosopher and the type of person that they were help us understand their philosophical writing ?
Is there anything that philosophers might learn from biography ?
Monk as an award - winning biographer of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell is well - placed to address these questions .

There are nearly 4,000 wild elephants in Sri Lanka " Gunshot wound , this is a gunshot wound , and this one , there are so many gunshot wounds , " said Sri Lankan government vet , Doctor Chandana Jayasinghe .
He was standing next to the huge , slumbering bull elephant in a clearing in the jungle , hypodermic syringe in hand .
" It is normal , they all have gunshot wounds . "
The men of the Wildlife Conservation Department had ventured into the tangled scrub to find the wounded elephant .
Treading carefully not to snap twigs and prompt a charge , they had moved up close , so near they could see his ears flapping behind the thick greenery , before one man shot him with a tranquiliser dart .
Now he lay on his side , slow , heavy breaths rattling in his trunk .
They gave him antibiotic injections and sprayed disinfectant on his wounds , some old and calloused , others new and raw .
' Unintended '
The renewed civil war between Sri Lanka 's government and the separatist Tamil Tigers is claiming many victims , among them increasing numbers of the island 's wild elephants .
Of the 74 elephants which died in the north and north - west region last year , 44 were killed by gunfire .
The others fell victim to poison , were deliberately electrocuted by farmers who connected wire fences to the mains , or fell down wells .
Just four died of natural causes .
The home guards are now being trained not to shoot at elephants
The elephants are not straying into the frontlines .
Wildlife officials say the shootings are in part an unintended consequence of a government initiative to deploy thousands of new home guards to villages near the frontlines and to arm local people .
" Due to present security conditions people are armed by the government to protect themselves from the Tamil Tigers , " says Manjula Amararathne from the Wildlife Conservation Department .
" But in some areas people use such weapons to kill elephants also . "
There are as many as 4,000 wild elephants in Sri Lanka and many live in uncomfortably close proximity to man .
Farms are being carved out of what was once jungle and the remaining forest patches are getting smaller .
As dusk falls , local farmers set out to patrol their fields , peering into the gloom and starting at shadows .
They set off crackers to try to frighten away foraging herds .
Killed
It is not just crops that are damaged by the elephants , houses are frequently knocked down , and people are killed too .
" They did n't see the elephant until they came near it , " said Asanga Reno , standing by the freshly dug grave of his mother Ranjini .
" They were afraid of the elephant and the elephant panicked too . "
Asanga Reno has been given compassionate leave from Sri Lanka 's navy to come back to bury his mother .
The Wildlife Conservation Department wants to keep man and elephant apart
As is traditional in Sri Lanka the last yards to the grave were fenced off with white streamers that blew in the hot breeze .
The elephant pulled Ranjini off the back of the motorbike on which she was travelling home from the fields , and threw her down by the side of the road .
By the time her husband got there she was dead .
The Wildlife Conservation Department is trying to keep man and elephants apart .
They are erecting low - voltage electric fences around villages .
Plants palatable to elephants are being cultivated in the remaining jungle patches so the animals are less tempted to go and forage elsewhere .
Training
And new recruits to the home guards are being given special training - they are being taught to shoo away the animals rather than turning their guns on them .
" We train them to avoid them and not to harm them , how to protect them and by doing that , how to love fauna and flora , " said Major Priyantha Rathnapriya , who is in charge of the Galakiriyagama training camp .
" Definitely , we do n't shoot any more .
We do n't do that . "
Back in the jungle the bull elephant was being encouraged to show signs of waking up after his treatment .
One of the team from the Wildlife Conservation Department was poking it gently with a stick and shouting : " Come on , elephant .
Get up my son . "
The elephant will survive his wounds , which had been cleaned .
But thick as the jungle was where he was lying , fields and houses were just a few hundred metres away .
There is a high chance he could be shot again , another casualty of the conflict between man and elephants .
" Actually this is the main problem , I think the elephants should be in the jungle , " said the grieving Asanga Reno at his mother 's graveside .
" We can't do anything .
The elephant wo n't live in the jungle . "

Israeli free - speaking newspaper < http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/994682.html>Ha'aretz reports that anti-Christianity toward messianic Christians in Israel is now so intense they can't worship safely without armed protection .
Militant ultra-orthodox Jewish settlers dominate most local government and police in central Israel and the West Bank .
Police do nothing as Christians are harassed and threatened with violence .
( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/christiansinisraelrepost.html#part2> " Christians in Israel : An Endangered Species " )
In October , a Jerusalem church used by messianic believers was mysteriously torched .
A messianic teen was critically injured by explosion of a package bomb in his face ; police believe ultra-Orthodox terrorists were responsible .
Angry orthodox Jews publicly burned hundreds of New Testaments .
( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/burningnewtestaments.htm> " Burning New Testaments in ' Democratic ' Israel " )
Official persecution of Christians is sharply on the rise in Israel .
Ha'aretz says , " Calev Myers , a lawyer who represents messianic Jews , said he has fought 200 legal cases in the past two years .
Most involve authorities ' attempt to close down houses of worship , revoke the citizenship of believers or refuse to register their children as Israelis
In incidents of violence [ against Christians ] , police are reluctant to press charges . "
The government of Israel maintains a hands - off policy .
It contends that Christians who witness and are persecuted deserve it .
The government is just as anti-Christian as local magistrates .
Israel continues to attempt to deport a German Christian student for the alleged " crime " of witnessing .
( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/christiandeportedfromisreal.htm> " Christian Deported from Israel " ) History of Persecution
As every Bible student knows , Jewish leaders did not welcome the emergence of Christianity in the first century .
The Pharisee Saul of Tarsus led ruthless and homicidal persecution of the infant church until his miraculous conversion to Christianity .
The Book of Acts recounts several dozen instances of violent persecution of Christians throughout Israel and the Mediterranean .
Such Jewish hatred may have continued under Nero , a convert to Judaism .
(1) Perhaps the greatest authority on ancient Rome , Edward Gibbon , asserts that Nero 's zealously Jewish wife , the beautiful Poppaea Sabina ( ancestor of one of the most renowned sages of the Talmud , Rabbi Meir ) ( 2 ) , almost certainly incited Nero to blame a relatively unknown sect , the Christians , for the burning of Rome .
(3) In that persecution , countless Christians ( including most of the apostles ) were martyred .
Yet , unable to destroy Christianity physically , anti-Christian Jews attempted to destroy it spiritually .
The Jewish Encyclopedia says some early church fathers said all heresies of the time began with Jews ( 4 ) who wanted to poison Christian teachings .
The Encyclopedia flatly states that Jews inspired gnosticism - the most destructive heresy in Christian theology .
Gnosticism 's bad premises have negatively influenced both Augustinian Catholicism and Calvinist Protestantism to the present .
( 5 ) Circumstances ( and God 's grace ) restricted the first - century Sanhedrin from persecuting the church into extinction .
Yet the Talmud and Zohar - most sacred texts for observant Jews - burn with hope of someday renewing violent persecution against Christians as " idol worshipers . "
These rabbinic scriptures teach that the coming Judaic one - world order will uphold Hebrew monotheism with zero tolerance toward those who believe in a " polytheist , three - in - one God , " Christians .
( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/israelisattackamalek.htm> " Israelis Attack ' Amalekites ' - with Baseball Bats ! " )
New Power to Persecute
The power to persecute Christianity has largely returned to Judaism through Jewish control of big media and " hate crime " laws .
Jewish supremacists are encouraged as never before that they might finish what their forefathers began in the Book of Acts ( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/jewsconfirmbigmedia.html> " Jews confirm Big Media is Jewish " See also , < http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7217700265038533779> "
Hate Laws : Making Criminals of Christians " )
Meanwhile , evangelical Christians remain in denial .
In view of rising anti-Christianity in Israel , Christian leaders and media are silent .
Unbiblically , they refuse to find fault with a nation and religion they believe God forbids them to criticize .
Evangelical leaders hope that somehow the increasing anti-Christianity coming from orthodox activism in Israel will subside as a result of even more palavering of Christian " love " and " blessing . "
They have no solution for rising Jewish anti-Christian activism and media corruption in the western world .
This threat to Christian civilization will not go away unless Christians face these threats head on and protest .
To turn the other cheek does not mean to be silent before evil .
Testing Christian Limits Evil Jewish leadership , from Israel to America , is testing Christians to see how much abuse they will take .
Hitler and Mussolini tested the West in 1939 with preliminary wars of aggression in Spain and Ethiopia .
In the same way , militant Jewish activists use hate crime prosecutions ( such as conviction of Rev. Stephen Boissoin in Canada ) to lay groundwork for worldwide persecution of Christians .
So far , Jewish supremacists must be delighted in how evangelicals continue to cooperate , even as such Jews undermine our Christian civilization .
At the turn of the 20th century , a holocaust of anti-Christian persecution erupted from Jewish - inspired communism in Russia .
Tens of millions of Christians in Russia and , later , China , southeast Asia and Cuba died .
( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/jewishactivistscommunism.html> " Jewish Activists Created Communism " )
Today , a malignant trickle of persecution insidiously proceeds from Zion , spreading across the world landscape .
It still could be dried up if Christians identify its leaders as Jewish and expose them to the withering heat of public displeasure .
That is not happening .
The source from which it emanates is sacrosanct to Christians and allowed to flow unobstructed .
With such spectacular complicity from most Christian leaders , there is little to restrain even more aggressive anti-Christianity .
Scripture says full - blown persecution will eventually break forth over the whole earth as the great harlot , international Jewish control , devastates the church .
( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/israelcontrolmideast.html> " Israel Prophesied to Control Mideast " )
Israel , the first to spiritually marry her divine husband , Christ , apostasized and became the mother of spiritual whoredom ; she killed Him .
Ever since , she has sought another husband , Anti-Christ , who will give her world dominion and take away her shame .
Initially , the great harlot will undoubtedly use her hate crimes laws to imprison evangelical " anti-Semites . " ( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/usgovcondemns.htm> " US Government Condemns ' Unintentional ' Anti-Semitism " )
Ultimately , Christian " idolaters " will be executed as heretics under the Talmud 's Noahide laws .
( See < http://www.truthtellers.org/alerts/comingjewishutopia.html> " Coming Jewish ' Utopia ' Ruled by Noahide Laws " ) Rev. 17:6 says Israel will become drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus .
The beast she rides upon , anti-Christ , will " wear out the saints of God " ( Dan. 7:25 ) and " destroy the mighty and holy people [ the church ] " ( Dan. 8:24 ) .
How is a juggernaut of persecution this ominous empowered to worldwide dominion ?
By the eerie silence of the Christian world right now !
Endnotes : 1 . " Nero , " Jewish Encyclopedia , page 88 .

This article says that , according to the Talmud , Nero converted to Judaism and Rabbi Meir descended from him .
3 . Gibbon , Edward , The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , volume I , page 459 , Modern Library , New York .
Gibbon says the Jews bitterly resented Roman dominion of Palestine and had a much stronger motive to burn Rome than did Christians .
" But the Jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace , and even in the heart of the Tyrant ; his wife and mistress , the beautiful Poppaea , and a favorite player of the race of Abraham , who had already enjoyed his intercessions in behalf of the obnoxious people . "

Some derive all heresies , including those of Gnosticism , from Judaism . " " ... the principal elements of Gnosticism were derived from Jewish speculation " " since the second century B.C. gnostic thought was bound up with Judaism , which had accepted Babylonian and Syrian doctrines . "
5 . My video < http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4452153918748081072>Zionism and Christianity : Unholy Alliance considers at length the bad influence of Gnosticism on Augustinian , Calvinist doctrine .
I point out that Calvin 's teaching of unconditional salvation ( eternal security ) was directly influenced by Jewish Gnosticism .
Both Augustine and Calvin largely bought into the Gnostic idea that to inhabit a physical body is sin .
With little confidence in obedient , daily trust in Christ to save us , they turned to covenant guarantees : " once saved , always saved , " and loyalty to the true church , Rome .
Their lack of conditions of obedience laid the foundation for evangelicals ' almost universal belief that Israel also enjoys a covenant - based unconditional right to occupy Palestine , even in disobedience .

NWS is designed to be a coordination facility that is language neutral .
NWS clients exists for a variety of languages , including MATLAB , Perl , Python , R , and Ruby .
This neutrality offers advantages , chief among them : i ) NWS coordination patterns and idioms can be applied to any of these , ii ) by using the quasi-lingua franca of ASCII strings to encode data , NWS can be used to coordinate heterogeneous ensembles of these .
It also implies certain costs , in particular it cannot ( always ) be as seamlessly integrated as native bindings .
Toss up : NWS names can be any ASCII string .
Thus , the above rendered in NWS -ese :
ws.store ('x ' , ws. fetch ( 'y ' ) )
fetch
x
store
ws
In many languages it is possible to neaten this up — the introductory lectures demonstrated a “ cleaner ” API for Python :
sv.x = sv.y
sv
Coordinated Binding Behavior
x = y
y
y
But in an ensemble setting , somebody very well might do just that .
In other words , in the context of coordination , an unbound name has a perfectly valid ( and useful ) interpretation : “ Please hold . ”
It does n't have to have this interpretation , but it seems to make sense , so let 's run with it .
Now consider :
x = 123 x = 456
But in an ensemble setting , lot 's of other processes may be interested in the sequence of values bound to x .
If so , how do we know a particular value of x has been put to good use ?
Enter generative communication : some coordination events generate data that exist independent of any process , others consume such data .
Let 's interpret the binding of a value to a name as the addition of that value to a list of values mapped to that name rather than the ( possible ) overwriting of a single associated value .
Let 's further stipulate that we do so by maintaining a FIFO queue of values .
But how do we ever shed values ?
To complete the picture : retrieval of a value bound to a name removes one value from the queue .
Again , it does n't have to have this interpretation , but arguably this is a reasonable one .
In sum : an assignment records a value of interest , a retrieval consumes one value , an empty list of values triggers ' Please Hold ' for a retrieval .
Let 's see how well these play together .
In one or more Python sessions , run the following :
import nws def f( x ) : return x*x*x ws = nws.client.NetWorkSpace(' table test ' ) while 1 : ws.store ( 'r ' , f( ws.fetch ( 'x ' ) ) )
import nws ws = nws.client.NetWorkSpace(' table test ' ) for x in range ( 10 ) : ws.store ( 'x ' , x ) for x in range ( 10 ) : print ' f ( %d ) = % d '%( x , ws. fetch ( 'r ' ) )
Worker pre- ( and post - ) start .
Number or workers variable .
Value ordering — for a two - body ensemble .
Variations
Consider maintaining a global maximum .
Suppose many processes are cooperating in a search to find a value , x max , that will maximize a function , F , and that knowing that F's maximum is at least F+ , we can rule out some candidate x's .
Further , let 's assume F is expensive to evaluate , but the winnowing check is cheap .
We would like to do something like :
for x in MyCandidateList : currentMax = ws.fetch ( ' max ' ) if noGo( currentMax , x ) : continue y = f( x ) if y > currentMax : ws.store ( ' max ' , y )
fetch consumes a value that may not be replaced .
find
for x in MyCandidateList : currentMax = ws.find ( ' max ' ) if noGo( currentMax , x ) : continue y = f(x ) if y > currentMax : ws.store ( ' max ' , y )
Are we maintaining a single ' max '?
Is currentMax really current ?
for x in MyCandidateList : currentMax = ws.find ( ' max ' ) if noGo( currentMax , x ) : continue y = f(x ) currentMax = ws.fetch ( ' max ' ) if y > currentMax : currentMax = y ws.store ( ' max ' , currentMax )
There are other uses for find , the most common being “ write - once ” variables : various data that are established at the beginning of a computation , or are independent of any one computation and that are needed by two or more ensemble members .
find alters the way the value queue is referenced , but what about variations in the queue itself ?
NWS supports four “ types ” ( aka “ modes ” ) :
FIFO : the default
LIFO : because you cannot have one without the other
Non-deterministic : Back to our Linda roots
Single : Not uncommon just to want the “ last one ” .
Works well with find .
Good for status values — simplifies monitors that read them .
ws.declare ()
Managing Workspaces
So if multiple processes each execute :
ws = nws.client.NetWorkSpace(' snake pit ' , host='python.zoo.cs.yale.edu ' )
But who would own it ?
And why would that matter ?
Answers :
By default , the process that first mentions the workspace to the server owns it .
We need to clean up , and traditional gc does n't really apply .
Workspaces , like tuplespaces , can be persistent .
In practice this can quickly lead to a mess , so they are by default transitory : when the process that owns them exits , they exit .
This can make staging an ensemble a bit of a pain , even if the general idea is right .
So “ use ” vs “ open ” .

History is full of insane geniuses , humans who mentally put the pedal to the metal -- and sometimes through the floor .
7 Pythagoras , Greek Mathematician , around 575 - 500 B.C .
The Genius :
Yes , this is the guy who came up with the Pythagorean theorem we all learned in school ( " The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides " ) .

Apart from this pillar of trigonometry , Pythagoras was the first high - profile academic to insist that natural phenomena could be explained mathematically ( paving the way for the study of Physics ) and was even a major inspiration for Plato 's theories of democracy .
So , yeah , we can thank him for , like , half of the good things ever invented .
The Insanity :
Much like L. Ron Hubbard and David Koresh , Pythagoras founded his own religion .
Much like L. Ron Hubbard and David Koresh , Pythagoreanism was totally insane .
How insane ?
To put it concisely , the square of the insanity of Pythagoreanism is equal to the sum of the square of the insanity of other religions .

Pythagoras ' religion had two primary tenets : souls are reincarnated , and beans are evil .
Not metaphorical beans , or metaphysical beans , but just plain , edible beans .
" Aaaaaahhhhh ! "
Amongst other absurdities , Pythagoreanism 's greatest commandments include :
- Do not , under any circumstances , eat beans
- Smooth out all bodily indents on pillows and / or beds
- Do not step over a crossbar
- Do not sit on a quart
- Do not walk on highways
- Do not leave the pot 's impression in the ashes after removing it from the fire
- Do not stir a fire without iron
- Do not let swallows nest under the roof
Pythagoras ' sect had more understandable rules , such as vegetarianism and pacifism , but he tended to break those .
The vegetarianism rules were bent when , upon discovering his famous theorem , he celebrated by slaughtering an ox .
His message of pacifism suffered greatly from his dying in a fight .
@humongous_mouse :
I thought the same thing when I heard about Xmen Vs Street fighter for the first time .
Then the day came I was walking home from school and like 5 of my friends stopped me because the local pizza shop got it in and I was floored .
The game played great , looked great and all those cares went away .
I think if its done right you wont worry so much .
Those games never really had much of a story it was just pure fanservice .
As apposed to MK vs DC where they are trying to add a story it might conflict with the comics and the heroes we know so much about instead of just a brawl fest .
Marvel vs DC fighting game would be great if it was made by Capcom , no need for a real story just battle it out with your fav heroes .
I think it would also make the internets asplode !!!

Does anyone remember these lovely little numbers ?
Back in the early eighties , they were all the rage at suburban holiday get togethers .
I know , because my parents had quite a few of those get togethers , and my mom served these all the time .
And though she ’d ordered me to stay upstairs and do my homework , when it was clear to me the adults were nice and sloshed on egg nog and settled in the living room , I ’d sneak down to the kitchen , grab a huge handful of these little treats , and stuff them in the pocket of my Vanderbilts .
Of course , they would n’t fit because the jeans were a tad on the snug side , but at least I had the coolest gold belt on my street .
God , what I ’d do for that belt right now .
Then I ’d sneak back upstairs and munch on the little delights and wind up not doing my English homework because I ’d be too bloated after my little snack .
All this to say that these treats , while almost vintagy and prosaic in their ingredients , are so flavorful and delightful , whoever tries one is always instantly transformed .
Case in point : my dad ’s partner in orthopedic surgery .
Always a serious and emotionally closed - off individual , he was especially that way with me during summers and Christmas breaks when I ’d “ work ” at my dad ’s office for a little extra spending money .
And “ work ” , at the time , to me , anyway , usually meant making long distance calls to all my camp friends and raiding the supply closet for Ace Bandages and ointments I did n’t really need .
My dad ’s Doctor Friend really had no use for me — hardly ever gave me the time of day — until one day , one magical day when I brought these treats to the holiday office party and Dr. Emotionally Closed Off polished off about eighty of them .
“ What ARE these ? ” he asked , moaning and groaning in delight .
I told him the ingredients , how to make them , and he kept on eating .
Then the strangest thing happened : He smiled .
Then , as I was leaving the office later that day with an offering of cookies from my dad ’s secretary and a big stash of smuggled band - aids and gauze pads , Dr. Distant stopped me at the door .
“ Hey , ” he said .
“ Thank you for bringing those appetizers .
They made my whole day . ”
So what I ’m trying to tell you is this :
Make these appetizers for someone you know who ’s emotionally closed off .
They ’ll bridge gaps and promote world peace .
The Cast of Characters : Club Crackers , Thin -Sliced Bacon , Grated Parmesan Cheese .
That ’s it .
Yes , I ’m serious .
Begin by laying crackers on a cookie sheet , face up .
Who does n’t love Club Crackers ?
Now listen , folks .
Do n’t be hatin’ .
There was a time in our nation when Kraft Parmesan Cheese was widely used in all segments of society , and no one even thought about raising a stink about it .
If you have freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano
on hand , by all means…use it .
But for the rest of us , do n’t hate .
Appreciate !
And look — I chose the Parmesan / Romano blend , which elevates all of this to something higher .
Scoop about 1 teaspoon of cheese right out of the container …
It can be slightly heaping .
Now just spoon 1 teaspoon of cheese over each cracker .
Repeat on each cracker …
Until they ’re all covered .
Now take your package of bacon …
It ’s here that I determined this bacon was too thick to do the job right , so I transferred all the bacon to a large Ziploc bag and put it in the freezer for later .
Luckily , I had some thin bacon in my fridge so I did n’t have to begin weeping .
Now it ’s time to assemble !
Wrap 1/2 piece of bacon around each cracker …
… Being careful to completely cover the cracker .
You want it to fit snugly , but do n’t stretch it too tight as you wrap .
This is the INCORRECT way of wrapping the cracker .
See the two exposed ends ?
Naughty , naughty , naughty .
Place the little delights on a baking sheet with a rack …
And place the pan in a 250 - degree oven for around 2 hours .
Here they are in the oven after 1 hour .
And here they are just after I removed them from the oven , at around 1 hour / 45 minutes .
Mmmmm … you should smell my kitchen right about now .
Oh , baby .
What I like to do with seventies - eighties appetizers like these is serve them on a sleek , modern tray .
The juxtaposition makes me laugh .
And giggle .
And chuckle .
And smile .
But then I sink my teeth into one of these suckers … and I stop laughing .
They ’re flavorful , crispy , and delicious .
And the great thing about these is , you can make them way ahead of time , then store them in a large Ziploc in the freezer .
Then , when you ’re ready to serve them , just thaw and warm in the oven for about 10 minutes .
Now I admit , there ’s really nothing nutritionally redemptive about these appetizers .
The bacon fat seeps into both the cheese and the cracker , and they ’re positively loaded with calories .
But it ’s the holidays !
Fat does n’t count ’ til January 1st .
So enjoy !
As we reach the mid-point of the 2008 Summer Olympics , it seems appropriate to review what hosting the Olympics has meant to China and what could be in store once the tourists leave and the athletes go home .
Sure , there will be some snazzy , state - of - the - art venues left for the people of Beijing to enjoy for years to come , but they may first have to deal with the infamous post -Olympic Jinx .
Cities that have sponsored the Games face more than just a psychological and emotional letdown after the excitement around the Olympics subsides .
After several years of single - minded purpose where the city Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if not the entire country Ã¢â‚¬â€œ seems to be geared towards outdoing the previous hosts , switching back to a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ normalÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â life may seem rather dull by comparison .
However , it is the financial impact that should cause concern .
Gone are all the jobs created to plan and build venues for the games ; gone are the jobs created to house and feed thousands of tourists ; and gone is all that tourist money .
ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Bid for the Olympics
China has long sought to host the Olympics and really pulled out all the stops when preparing for the 2008 bid .
Chinese authorities worked hard to assure Olympic officials that a massive building program would be implemented to provide facilities superior to anything constructed for previous Olympics .
Commitments were also made to make improvements to BeijingÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s notorious air pollution which some critics felt could actually be harmful to the athletes .
Much was also made of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s rather spotty human rights record and concessions on this front were also offered , particularly around freedom of the press and the right to demonstrate .
Events of Tiananmen Square in 1989 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with images of police and military vehicles attacking unarmed citizens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were still fresh in the minds of many people .
Despite the protestations of several victim rights groups , China emerged as the odds - on favorite to win the vote with Toronto and Paris as the only other cities realistically still in the running .
On July 13th , 2001 , IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch confirmed that the City of Beijing would indeed serve as the host city for the 2008 Olympics .
The Great Construction Boom
While sports purists may decry the political overtones attached to the selection process and the games themselves , in reality , politics have been part of the Olympics dating back to the first games of the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ modern eraÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â held in Athens in 1896 .
While certainly not as overtly political as say the 1936 games used to showcase the Nazi regime , China is nonetheless fixated with Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ putting its best forwardÃ¢â‚ ¬Â as it were .
Of course , this is no different from any other host country , but China has demonstrated an almost fanatical dedication to being the biggest and the best to emphatically demonstrate the nationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s arrival on the world stage .
China claims to have spent $ 40 billion USD preparing for the games ; some experts meanwhile contend that the figure is actually much higher .
Whatever the true costs , there is no doubt that China initiated a construction boom in Beijing that rivals even the reconstruction efforts immediately following the Second World War . [ 1 ]
Impressive new facilities for gymnastic and aquatics were built as well as an absolutely magnificent stadium and athleteÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s village .
Other projects including a subway system and world - class hotels have also been completed to ensure that the expected half million tourists see only the best of what China has to offer .
In order to find space in downtown Beijing to build these new facilities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as to make good on the promise to provide acceptable air quality Ã¢â‚¬â€œ older sections of the city were completely razed resulting in the relocation of thousands of citizens .
Factories deemed to be unacceptable polluters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as mining operations and coal - fired generation plants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were forced to close prior to and during the Olympics resulting in both short - term and permanent job losses . [ 2 ]
The Olympic Hangover
So , what happens once the athletes and guests have packed up and returned home ?
Literally overnight , hotels will go from being fully booked to having to now work to fill a great number of empty rooms , the restaurants no longer have hoards of hungry tourists to cater to , and hardly anyone is buying Olympic souvenirs .
But surely other host countries have managed to shake the post -Olympic funk ?
Actually , the track record of other cities adjusting to life after the Olympics suggests that the jinx is not simply a fanciful myth ; a recent report produced by HSBC indicates that every Summer Olympics since the end of the Second World War has suffered a drop in GDP upon the completion of the Games .
This drop is more pronounced in some cases , but examples include : [ 3 ]
South Korea ( 1988 ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Prior to the Olympics , South Korea enjoyed a growth rate of just over 11 % in the years immediately preceding the Games .
This fell to 6.4 % in the following year .
Japan ( 1965 ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ GDP was approaching 12 % before hosting the Olympics Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ it fell to just 5.8 % in 1966 .
Cities hosting the games often find themselves on the hook for accumulated debt with the Montreal Olympics being the prime example of how to lose money while hosting the Games .
It took thirty years for Montreal ( and the rest of Canada ! ) to pay off the 1976 Games .
Other cities that have hosted the Games since then have faired better but still managed some staggering losses .
These include : [ 4 ]
Barcelona ( 1992 ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1.4 billion USD
Athens ( 2004 ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Estimated 9 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 12 billion USD
Sydney ( 2000 ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nearly half a billion USD
When you look at how much host countries spend to prepare for the Games , it only stands to reason that overall economic growth will fall somewhat once the Games end Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the loss in jobs alone is partly responsible .
Consider the number of people employed directly through the Olympics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from shuttle bus drivers to the aforementioned souvenir salespeople Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that find themselves out of work once the crowds leave .
And what about the thousands of jobs connected to the construction industry ?
With the completion of the new venues , many of these workers are no longer needed .
For those that relocated from parts of the country simply to get in on the great Beijing construction boom , things must seem rather dire just now .
Sure , China will continue to grow and construction is still a major employer but it is unlikely any new phase of development can equal the construction kicked off in 2001 when the IOC announced Beijing as the host country .
Realistically , even a pronounced slowdown in Beijing will have only a small effect on the overall Chinese economy ; it is just too large to be greatly affected by troubles in one city .
However , growing concerns of an economic slowdown centered in the U.S. and Europe do have the potential to severally impact China ’s export markets and this – together with a post -Olympic letdown – could be the beginning of more serious trouble for China . [ 5 ]
Guess that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s why they call it a “ jinx ” .
Quick Beijing Construction Facts
1. 22.5 % – the annual growth rate of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s construction industry from 2001 Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ 2005
2. 4,000 billion yuan ( $ 520 billion USD ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the amount of GDP generated solely through construction from 2001 Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ 2005
3. 10.7 % Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the percentage of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s GDP comprised by new construction

Dueling Blurbs : Collins vs. Coulter
By Richard B. Hoppe
Posted June 15 , 2008
Some years ago Bill Dembski wrote that " Design theorists are no friends of theistic evolution . "
The italics were in the original .
Thursday Dembski reinforced that assertion while commenting on Ken Miller 's new book Only a Theory : Evolution and the Battle for America 's Soul .
Dembski's post is titled Theistic Evolutionists Close Ranks : Let the Bloodletting Begin !
It turns out that Dembski also has a new book coming out called Understanding Intelligent Design : Everything You Need to Know in Plain Language .
His co-author is Sean McDowell , the head of the Bible Department at Capistrano Valley Christian Schools .
( Nope , ai n't no religion here ! )
What caught my eye in Dembski's post was his juxtaposition of blurbs for Miller 's book and his own .
Miller 's book is blurbed by Francis Collins :
In this powerfully argued and timely book , Ken Miller takes on the fundamental core of the Intelligent Design movement , and shows with compelling examples and devastating logic that ID is not only bad science but is potentially threatening in other deeper ways to America 's future .
But make no mistake , this is not some atheistic screed -- Prof .
Miller 's perspective as a devout believer will allow his case to resonate with believers and non-believers alike .
Not surprising -- Collins is the former head of the Human Genome project and an evangelical Christian who has written his own ( in my opinion , weak ) attempt to reconcile science with his religion .
Dembski's book , on the other hand , has a laudatory blurb from ... wait for it ... science writer ... public intellectual ... um ... strident harpy Ann Coulter :
In my book Godless , I showed that Darwinism is the hoax of the century and , consequently , the core of the religion of liberalism ....
Liberals respond to critics of their religion like Cotton Mather to Salem 's " witches . "
With this book , two more witches present themselves for burning : Sean McDowell , whose gift is communicating with young people , and Bill Dembski , often called the Isaac Newton of intelligent design .
I think Dembski is more like the Dick Butkus of Intelligent Design .
The Dick Butkus of intelligent design ?
I laughed out loud when I read that .
The Fig Newton of information theory ( to adapt to reality Rob Koons ' sycophantic characterization of Dembski ) is one thing , but Dick Butkus ?
One thing seems clear : Dembski has wholly abandoned any pretense that ID is not a religiously motivated enterprise .
As I wrote 20 years ago , if the creationists ( of any stripe ) win the war , the next day blood will be flowing in the aisles and between the pews .
Dembski has a particular affinity for violent imagery -- recall his vice strategy for squeezing the truth out of " Darwinists . "
Recall also that Dembski published that strategy just one month before he ran like a deer from his deposition for the Kitzmiller trial , where he was scheduled to be an expert witness .
Dick Butkus would n't have run away from no good ol ' boy appointed - by - Dubya conservative Pennsylvania judge .
But the Fig Newton did .

A Johns Hopkins expert in HIV and how the AIDS virus hides in the body says antiretroviral drugs have stopped HIV from replicating , the first of three key steps needed to rid people of the virus .
In an address to be delivered Aug. 6 at the XVII International Conference on AIDS , taking place in Mexico City , infectious disease specialist Robert Siliciano , M.D. , Ph.D. , says current drug- combination therapies can stop HIV in its tracks , with some combos suppressing its ability to make copies to less than one in a billion .
But , he says , progress is still needed in identifying where viral reservoirs persist and in finding ways to eliminate these HIV hiding places .
Indeed , it was Siliciano 's team at Hopkins in 1995 that confirmed the existence of these reservoirs in immune system CD4 memory T - cells - those left behind , after an initial infection , to fight recurrences .
The CD4s concentrate in the lymph nodes and spleen .
Siliciano suggests that other as yet unverified viral pools could exist , citing previous studies at Johns Hopkins that , in 2006 , identified adult stem cells and progenitor cells as potential hideaways for HIV .
According to Siliciano , a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator , laboratory models that mimic HIV infection in these reservoir cells are key to finding drugs that can eliminate them .
" We know now that HIV can be stopped , " says Siliciano .
" Our next steps are to go after these reservoirs of HIV .
And although much work needs to be done to find and eliminate them , infected people who have access to antiretroviral drugs and who take them as prescribed stand a good chance of leading normal lives . "
Siliciano points out that if antiretroviral drugs can be made more accessible , affordable and less toxic , then infected people who take the drugs correctly will not develop AIDS .
Included in Siliciano 's presentation are recent data from his team and researchers at the National Cancer Institute and the University of Pittsburgh , which shows that adding a fourth , more potent anti-HIV drug to existing antiviral combinations does not further suppress the number of HIV viral copies in the blood .
" Adding more drugs to current regimens will not further reduce the amount of virus in the blood , " says Siliciano .
" We have already reached rock bottom in using drugs to stop HIV from replicating .
The trace amounts of virus that remain are coming from viral reservoirs , not active replication of the virus . "
In 15 HIV - positive study participants already using highly active antiretroviral therapy , or HAART , to suppress the virus , researchers added either a protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor .
They found no greater suppression in viral blood levels than seen before the fourth drug was added .
Hundreds of thousands of the more than 1 million Americans infected with HIV are currently using HAART , a combination usually of three of 25 potent antiviral medications .
And these drugs almost eliminate the amount of virus in the blood , lowering the number to fewer than 50 copies per cubic milliliter of blood .
Siliciano also describes the progress of four laboratory models for testing HIV reservoirs , including one developed at Johns Hopkins , in identifying all viral reservoirs , and in penetrating them with antiretroviral drugs .
There are more than 33 million people in the world living with HIV , including an estimated 950,000 in the United States and 23,000 in the state of Maryland .

WASHINGTON  The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday outlined a pattern of bizarre and deceptive conduct by Bruce E. Ivins , an Army microbiologist who killed himself last week , presenting a sweeping but circumstantial case that he was solely responsible for mailing the deadly anthrax letters that killed five people in 2001 .
After nearly seven years of a troubled investigation , officials of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department declared that the case had been solved .
Jeffrey A. Taylor , the United States attorney for the District of Columbia , said the authorities believed “ that based on the evidence we had collected , we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt . ”
Some survivors of the attacks and members of Congress said they were persuaded by the evidence against Dr. Ivins , laid out in hundreds of pages of applications for search warrants unsealed for the first time .
But some independent scientists , friends and colleagues of Dr. Ivins remained skeptical , noting that officials admitted that more than 100 people had access to the supply of anthrax that matched the powder in the letters .
Lawyers for Dr. Ivins reasserted their late client ’s innocence and criticized the government for presenting what they called “ heaps of innuendo ” that failed to link him directly to the crime and would never have to be tested in court .
“ It was an explanation of why Bruce Ivins was a suspect , ” said Paul F. Kemp , who represented the scientist for more than a year before his death on July 29 at age 62 .
“ But there ’s a total absence of proof that he committed this crime . ”
I have a question , which has arisen after running into an unexpected variable capture in a Python program I am working on .
Here is a sample :
def codeExample1 ( hashTable ) : def makeGenerator ( ) : for keyName in hashTable : def valueGenerator ( ) : for keyValue in hashTable [ keyName ] : yield keyValue yield ( keyName , valueGenerator ( ) ) return makeGenerator ( )
Now , I was expecting keyName in the function valueGenerator to be bound to the value of keyName at the current step in the iterator over hashTable , effectively creating a new copy of the valueGenerator function each step .
What occurred instead was that keyName was bound to the value of keyName at the last step of the iterator , effectively making each valueGenerator call the same .
To correct this unexpected behavior , one would rewrite valueGenerator to take a parameter like this :
def codeExample1 ( hashTable ) : def makeGenerator ( ) : for keyName in hashTable : def valueGenerator ( _keyName ) : for keyValue in hashTable [ _keyName ] : yield keyValue yield ( keyName , valueGenerator ( keyName ) ) return makeGenerator ( )
So that was a bit of a long lead in , but what I 'm trying to get at is what is the name for the type of variable capture exhibited by Python in this example and what is the name of the variable capture I was expecting to occur ?
Google is the sleeping giant when it comes to advertising in video games .
While the company dominates search advertising , it has yet to make a big splash in video games .
That could change soon , as the company has been quietly testing its “ AdSense for Games ” product for months .
Sources close to the matter said that the company has developed an in - game advertising technology that allows it to insert video ads into games .
In demos of the technology , a game character can introduce a video ad , saying something like , “ And now , a word from our sponsor , ” before showing a short video at the end of a sequence in a game .
Since testing has been going on for some time , Google could launch the technology fairly quickly , if it so chooses .
But it ’s not clear why Google has n’t already launched its in - game advertising business , given that the seeds of AdSense for Games were planted in early 2007 .
Google did not respond to a request for comment this morning .
I ’ll update if that changes .
“ I do n’t know what ’s taking them so long , ” said one source close to the matter .
“ They could move into this market very quickly , given what they have shown off . ”
If the company enters the market , it should stir up the competition the way it has in other ad markets .
Companies such as Double Fusion , IGA Worldwide , Microsoft ’s Massive , MochiMedia and NeoEdge Networks have been carving out niches with in - game or wrap - around ads for some time .
All of the companies know the potential of the market .
Advertisers are turning to in - game ads because it ’s one of the only ways to reach young male gamers who have stopped watching TV .
The Yankee Group predicts the market will be worth $ 971.3 million by 2011 .
Google ’s top executives know that search advertising may not last forever , and in - game advertising could become a compelling technology over time as both games and in - game ad technology become more and more engaging .
Google would cover its bases by making a small side bet on in - game ads .
Google ’s technology can be applied to console games , disk - based PC games , web - based PC games and cell phone games .
But those who are kicking the tires on the technology ( outside the company ) have not seen all of those platforms in action .
One of its options is to keep testing its technology while it waits for the market to get bigger .
The company drew attention to its game - ad intentions when it bought Adscape for $ 23 milion in February , 2007 .
Bernie Stolar , the former head of both Sega of America and Sony Computer Entertainment America , was Adscape ’s chairman .
Working for Google , he gave a speech just about a year ago describing “ AdSense for Games ” at the 2007 Casual Connect conference in Seattle .
In the talk , Stolar said Google had no plans to make games or otherwise enter the game portal business ; Google just wanted to do ads .
A flurry of stories appeared in November last year that Google was launching its beta test with Bunchball .
That involved only pre-roll advertising , not with in - game characters .
The Bunchball Facebook games rolled out with the Google ads , but not much else happened .
That false move is a reason why some of the partners are wondering if Google is really going to go forward or not .
In buying Adscape , Google was reacting to Microsoft ’s own move into in - game advertising .
In May 2006 , Microsoft bought Massive , the pioneer of in - game ad networks that was founded in 2004 .
Since the acquisition , the market gathered steam .
Alison Lange Engel , global marketing director for Massive , said that the company now has more than 200 advertisers in its network .
Those companies can insert either fixed or live ads into games .
The live ads are more suitable for short - term campaigns because the companies can change the ads on the fly , using Internet connections to pipe new content into video game consoles .
More than 70 games now use Massive ’s in - game ads .
The battle lines have been drawn .
Yahoo , which draws 18 million gamers a month to its Yahoo Games portal in the U.S. , recently signed up NeoEdge and Double Fusion as its in - game ad partners .
Electronic Arts has a variety of partners .
And Sony has signed up Double Fusion and IGA Worldwide .
Sony is thought to be a prime potential customer since it is launching its
Home virtual world for gamers in the fall on its PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 .
Among the console makers , only Nintendo has been quiet when it comes to in - game ads .
At this rate , there may not be much left for Google .
It better not wait too long .
The insider buzz is growing about Google ’s plans , particularly since its big sales force could generate a lot of interest in the ad platform .
A bunch of Google representatives attended the 2008 Casual Connect show in Seattle last week , but they did n’t answer questions about when Google would jump into the in - game ad market .
Google spilled part of its intentions by announcing its virtual world — or more appropriately virtual room .
The company launched Lively by Google earlier this month .
Lively by Google would be a natural vehicle for Google ’s AdSense for Games product , which could insert ads into the rooms of users .
In fact , others expect it to be a proving ground .
いやぁ、待ちに待ちましたよ。

Finance is reporting A Tax Revolt Is Quietly Brewing in Some States .
On Election Day , Massachusetts will vote on whether to eliminate its state income tax .
Advocates hope victory in a place long thought of as a free - spending liberal bastion will pave the way for similar initiatives in other states over the next few years .
Critics insist a yes vote would lead to fiscal disaster .
Oregon voters will decide whether to allow taxpayers to deduct an unlimited amount of their federal income taxes on their state returns .
Nevada is expected to vote on a constitutional amendment that would restrict property - tax increases .
North Dakota voters may vote on whether to chop the state 's personal income tax in half .
And Minnesota will vote on a proposed amendment to its state constitution to raise the state sales tax by three - eighths of a percentage point , with the money going to protect the environment and to benefit the arts .
Here is a look at a few of the most high - profile tax battles :
Massachusetts .
The issue is whether to erase the state 's income tax in two phases .
The 5.3 % tax would be sliced in half next year and then disappear entirely the following year .
Advocates of repeal are hoping for support from voters worried about tough economic times and angered by bloated government spending .
Six years ago , a similar proposal attracted 45 % of the vote .
Eliminating this tax " will mean less money in the hands of politicians and will give back an average of $ 3,700 to each of 3.4 million workers and taxpayers in Massachusetts -- not just once but every year , " says Carla Howell of the Committee for Small Government , a nonprofit citizen group battling to repeal the tax .
" There are tax - cut activists around the country who are very interested in what we 're doing here , " she says .
" If it does well , we may see copycat initiatives in 2010 and 2012 across the country . "
Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform , a Washington - based coalition of taxpayers and taxpayer groups opposed to tax increases , agrees .
The Massachusetts vote , officially dubbed " Question One , " " could be a model for the future " in many other states , he says .
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , a Democrat , has been " very clear " in his opposition to repeal of the state income tax , says Rebecca Deusser , a spokeswoman .
" A cut of this magnitude would severely reduce the ability of the Commonwealth to provide the services that citizens and taxpayers have come to expect from their state government , " she says .
My Take
Nevada .
Voters are focusing on a proposed constitutional amendment that would impose a new cap on property - tax increases .
Generally , the measure would cap property tax at 1 % of the taxable value of the home for the 2003 - 04 fiscal year , and would also limit property - tax increases to only 2 % a year ( or the cost of living , whichever is less ) , until the property is sold .
Voters would have to approve the proposal not only this year but also in 2010 in order for it to become effective .
Nevada 's secretary of state recently certified the proposal for inclusion on the ballot , but it still may face a legal challenge .
A spokesman for Gov. Jim Gibbons , a Republican , says the governor " has n't taken a position at this point " on the proposal .
" We need stable and predictable property taxes , " says Sharron Angle , a former state legislator who heads
We the People Nevada , which drafted and is advocating passage of the amendment .
She says many voters have complained that their property taxes have risen even though home values have declined .
She also says there is interest in several other states , including Arizona , in proposing similar property - tax caps .
My Take
Other states .
In North Dakota , efforts are being made to place a proposal on the ballot that includes cutting personal income - tax rates by 50 % .
Colorado will vote on whether to increase the state 's sales tax to fund services to people with " developmental disabilities . "
The state may also vote on major changes to its taxpayer bill of rights law and the manner in which the state funds public education through 12th grade .
My Take
We use how much gas ?
From more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to tapping the strategic oil reserve , politicians and pundits spar daily over the best solution to America 's ongoing fuel crisis .
But no matter which side of the fence they 're on , almost everyone can agree on one thing :
Americans are going to have to get used to paying more for their gas than they have in years past ; possibly much more .
The specter of permanently higher gas prices has already driven consumers and automakers to take a long , hard look at the fuel economy ratings on the vehicles that Americans own and produce , and what they 've found has sparked an aggressive search for ways to squeeze more miles out of each gallon .
In this brief article , I 'll take a look at why the current American auto fleet is so inefficient , and at what 's being done to improve it .
Prior to the recent spike in oil prices , the US enjoyed a relatively long period of extremely cheap gas relative to the rest of the world .
During that time , US automakers sold the public on the idea that large trucks and SUVs equipped with large engines were ideal for family transport .
Better yet for the automakers , these large vehicles were cheap to make , which meant large profit margins .
The technology packaged inside them was n’t particularly advanced , based as they were on fairly unstressed , large - capacity engines that paid lip service to the idea of fuel efficiency .
The boom in SUV sales increased in the early 2000s , when small businesses were granted a tax break for purchasing vehicles that weighed more than 6000 lbs .
Intended presumably to help general contractors offset the cost of their trucks for hauling , the ultimate effect of this change was that even more large SUVs appeared on the road .
Automakers , domestic and foreign , moved quickly to capitalize on the public 's newfound appetite for bigger rigs and lower MPGs .
For instance , shortly after the tax break was enacted , BMW managed to find an extra 5 lbs somewhere on their X5 SUV that previously topped the scales at a mere 5995 lbs , no doubt ensuring a raft of extra sales .
Indeed , between 1987 and 2004 , light truck ownership ( including both trucks and SUVs ) almost doubled , from 28 percent to 53 percent .

It would be wrong , however , to think that America ’s fuel economy problem is solely due to the SUV and truck market .
American consumers have traditionally demanded larger cars for their money than Europe or Japan .
Large cars are heavy cars , and heavy cars also need big engines .
Those big engines need more fuel , so pretty much everyone , be they a driver of a car , truck , or SUV got used to poor fuel efficiency .
And who can blame them ?
Not only was gas cheap , but Congress repeatedly failed to raise federal fuel efficiency regulations , known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy , or CAFE standards .
Environmentalists and people with concerns over energy security railed against this trend , but corporate dollars trump good intentions .
CAFE mandates that automakers achieve an average fuel economy figure across their range , and levies fines based on missing this target multiplied by the total number of vehicles sold each year .
Currently , CAFE demands 27.5 mpg for cars , and 22.5 mpg for trucks below 8500 lbs .
Vehicles weighing more than 8500 lbs are exempt from CAFE .
However , all good parties come to an end , and as crude oil prices show signs of settling well above $ 100 barrel , gas - guzzling drivers are beginning to have second thoughts .
If you like my projects , perhaps you might be interested in one of my older ones : the $ 14 steadycam .

Dame Anita : ' Money means nothing to me ' , she said and left her entire fortune to charity .
Her will , published yesterday , was eaten up by inheritance tax
She was always adamant she had no intention of " dying rich " .
And Dame Anita Roddick , the founder of The Body Shop , has proved as good as her word .
Her will , published yesterday , reveals that she has left precisely nothing , having already given away £ 51 million of her fortune to charity and the rest to the taxman .
The gross value of Dame Anita 's estate when she died last September was £ 665,747 .
But the entire sum was swallowed up by inheritance tax , leaving her net worth at " nil " .
It is understood that hundreds of thousands of pounds in duty became liable on gifts of money she gave to family and friends shortly before her sudden death .
Under the Inland Revenue 's " seven - year rule " , an individual can escape paying tax if they survive for seven years after making monetary gifts .
Dame Anita , who died from a brain haemorrhage at the age of 64 , wanted her vast wealth to fund campaigns on green issues , human rights and Third World debt .
She described leaving money to your family as " obscene " and cut her two daughters Sam and Justine out of her will in 2005 soon after making a fortune from the sale of The Body Shop .
French cosmetics firm L'Oreal paid £ 625 million for the company , paying Dame Anita and her husband Gordon more than £ 100 million for their 18 per cent share in the business .
Her half of the profit from the eco-friendly , ethical business which she and her husband built up from one shop was donated to the Roddick Foundation , which supports charity causes she espoused .

Cut out :
The businesswoman 's daughters said they agree totally with their mother 's decision not to leave them any money .
Sam , left , runs an upmarket sex shop in London and Justine lives and works in California
Her widower , 65 , who also received £ 51 million from the L'Oreal sale , is a trustee of the foundation .
Mr Roddick and his family were yesterday away on holiday but the couple 's daughters have publicly supported their mother 's decision to disinherit them .
Justine , 38 , lives and works in California .
Sam , 35 , runs the upmarket London sex shop , Coco de Mer .
In an interview before her mother 's death , Sam called the decision to disinherit her and her sister " a relief " , adding : " If the money was divided between family members I suppose it would be natural to equate the amount that you were left with the amount that you were loved , which makes it very complicated and emotional .
" So , if my mum had said to me , ' I 'm not leaving the money to you but I 've decided to give it all to a distant cousin ' , then I would have found that offensive .
" But giving it all to charity is different .
You can't really argue about someone giving their money away , can you ?
" They 've already given us everything in terms of love and support . "
She added , mischievously : " My mum 's only actually got half the family fortune .
My dad has n't said what he 's going to do with his half . "
Dame Anita was diagnosed with Hepatitis C last year - the unknown legacy of an infected blood transfusion 35 years earlier - but appeared to be coping well with the illness when she collapsed at her home in West Sussex .
Explaining her philosophy , she had said : " Money does not mean anything to me .
The worst thing is greed - the accumulation of money . "
Building the Second Avenue Subway line . *
Illustration : Peter Grundy * NYC subway map of the future .
New Yorkers are used to waiting for the subway and all , but this is ridiculous .
Their first new line in 70 years — the T — is finally getting built .
The Second Avenue Subway , as it's known , was proposed in 1929 and has been on the drawing board in this incarnation since 1999 .
Workers are now rerouting utilities and preparing to assemble a 250 - foot - long tunnel - boring machine at 92nd Street .
Next June , as part of the $ 4.3 billion Phase I , it 'll begin gnawing its way south through 20 blocks of Manhattan schist ( bedrock ! ) to 72nd , where a new station will be built .
Ultimately , after decades of work , the new T Line will unite the Upper and Lower East Sides .
The tunnel - boring machine will cut through 50 feet of Manhatten shist ( bedrock ) a day .

' By the Power of Greyskull ... I Have the Power !'
So they have used their dominant position in OPEC to act as the “ swing ” producer , raising and lowering production as needed to keep prices steady and to ensure that the oil age continues .
But lately , their power has been threatened by surging world demand that has eliminated most of the gap between supply and demand .
The Khurais field , they hope , will help restore that margin .
Image The Saudis say the Khurais oil field holds 27 billion barrels .

The New York Times
Mr. Nasser and other Aramco officials described a project whose dimensions boggle the mind .
Starting in June 2009 , the field will produce 1.2 million barrels a day , enough to satisfy the expected growth in global demand next year .
The Saudis say they are investing more than $ 10 billion , with 26 contractors , 106 subcontractors and 28,000 employees .
It is the largest piece of a five - year , $ 60 billion effort to expand oil production capacity at a time of fast - rising demand .
A company tour of the main processing zone had a surreal , theatrical air .
As the journalists stared out through the windows of their air - conditioned bus , hundreds of south Asian workers stopped work to stare back , their sun-protection masks and dark glasses making them look like Hollywood extraterrestrials .
It was impossible to know if the site had been prepared for the journalists ’ tour .
Beyond the buildings , gas flares blurred the horizon , in a forbidding landscape punctuated only by low reddish dunes and a few scattered shrubs .
The Khurais complex , which includes two smaller adjacent fields , was discovered in 1957 .
It got only limited use , because its oil is less accessible than that of the great Ghawar field , the world ’s largest .
Now the Saudis are deploying an extraordinary engineering effort to bring Khurais ’s mile - deep oil to the surface .
Seawater will be carried through new pipelines from the Persian Gulf and injected into oil - bearing rock to pressure the oil upward .
Usually Aramco pumps seawater into a field only after several years of production , and some skeptics point to this as a reason to doubt that Khurais will live up to its billing .
But Mr. Nasser said the huge seawater injection system at Khurais was about cost and logistics , not a sign of a weak field .

[ What is this ? ]
HOUSTON  Lance Armstrong is one of the favorite sons of Texas and a model citizen known as much for his social conscience as his cycling .
So it came as a surprise when it was revealed this week that he is one of the biggest individual users of water in Austin , where he lives .
Say it ai n’t so , Lance .
In July , Mr. Armstrong , who won the Tour de France seven times , used a whopping 330,000 gallons of water at his lush Spanish - colonial home , with an acre of gardens and a swimming pool , city water authority officials said .
This tremendous flow of H2O , which is 38 times what the average household in the city uses in the summer , comes as Texas is going through a dry spell and officials are asking people to cut back on watering their lawns .
“ We are definitely short on rain , ” Lisa Rhodes , a spokeswoman for the authority , said with a sigh .
Mr. Armstrong declined to be interviewed .
He has been in Colorado and California all summer and only noticed the surge in water use when he saw his bills go up , his spokesman , Mark Higgins , said in an e-mail message .
( The bill for July was $ 2,460 . )
“ Lance and all the folks involved are looking into it and will for sure get it under control , ” Mr. Higgins wrote .

Clouds forming in the lee of Pico del Teide ( 3718 m ) , Tenerife .
While in the lowest 3 km layer the winds were very weak on that day ( almost calm ) , higher above this level the winds were much stronger , blowing from the northwest ( from the left in these images ) .
This resulted in wake rotor motion to right of the Teide summit , manifested by rolling clouds there ...

Low clouds above the southeastern coast of Tenerife , as viewed from the summit of Montaña Blanca ( 2750 m ) .
Similar situations are quite typical for the island - while the slopes of the coastal mountains or the entire coast are covered by low clouds , the highland plateau surrounded by Circo Cañadas Mts. ( 2300 - 2700 m ) enjoys clear skies .
If any clouds manage to overflow this ridge , they usually quickly dissolve , as in this case .

Thin dark layers in the distance are clouds of Saharan dust , making their way across the Atlantic Ocean .
This dust passed above Tenerife on the next day ( see the following case ) .

Since it was almost calm at the lowest 2 km , the clouds do not flow anywhere , but only " bubble " and " splash " around .
Above the 2 km level were very strong winds from the west , which also brought some Saharan dust during this sequence .
The dust layer seems to be vertically very thin , drifting between about the 2 to 3.5 km levels .

Low levels of high - density lipoproteins ( HDL ) -- the " good " cholesterol -- in middle age may increase the risk of memory loss and lead to dementia later in life , researchers reported in Arteriosclerosis , Thrombosis and Vascular Biology : Journal of the American Heart Association .
Observing 3,673 participants ( 26.8 percent women ) from the Whitehall II study , researchers found that falling levels of HDL cholesterol were predictors of declining memory by age 60 .
Whitehall II , which began in 1985 , is long - term health examination of more than 10,000 British civil servants working in London .
" Memory problems are key in the diagnosis of dementia , " said Archana Singh - Manoux , Ph.D. , lead author of the study and Senior Research Fellow with the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research ( INSERM , France ) and the University College London in England .
" We found that a low level of HDL may be a risk factor for memory loss in late midlife .
This suggests that low HDL cholesterol might also be a risk factor for dementia . "
Researchers defined low HDL as less than 40 mg / dL and high HDL as 60 mg / dL or higher .
The team compared blood - fat and memory data collected in phases 5 ( 1995 ? ) and 7 ( 2002 ? ) of Whitehall II , when the average ages of the study members were 55 and 61 years , respectively .
Researchers measured lipid concentrations in blood samples collected after an eight - hour fast , or at least four hours after a light , fat - free breakfast .
They assessed short - term verbal memory using 20 one - or two - syllable words read aloud at two - second intervals .
Study participants then had two minutes to write down as many of the words as they could remember .
Their main findings are :
At age 55 , participants with low HDL cholesterol showed a 27 percent increased risk of memory loss when compared to those with high HDL .
At age 60 , participants with low HDL had a 53 percent increased risk of memory loss compared to the high HDL group .
During the five years between phases 5 and 7 , study members with decreasing HDL had a 61 percent increased risk of decline in their ability to remember words versus those with high HDL .
Men and women did not differ significantly in the link between lipids and memory loss , so researchers combined data from both sexes for analysis .
Total cholesterol and triglycerides did not show a link with memory decline .
Using statin drugs to raise HDL and / or lower low - density lipoprotein ( LDL or " bad " cholesterol ) showed no association with memory loss .
HDL cholesterol , which at high levels decreases the risk of heart attacks , serves several vital biological functions .
It helps clear excess cholesterol from the blood ; assists nerve - cell synapses to mature ; and helps control the formation of beta- amyloid , the major component of the protein plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer 's patients .
Dementia most often occurs in people 65 years or older , the fastest growing age group in the industrialized world .

The precise mechanism linking HDL cholesterol to dementia remains unclear .
" But it is possible that HDL cholesterol prevents formation of beta- amyloid , " Singh - Manoux said .
" HDL could also affect memory through its influence on atherosclerotic disease and stroke , or vascular injury .
Finally , HDL cholesterol may influence memory through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects .
" Many previous investigations into the association between lipids and memory in the elderly have focused on total or LDL cholesterol because of their status as proven risk factors for cardiovascular disease , " Singh - Manoux said .
" Our results show HDL cholesterol to be important for memory .
Thus , physicians and patients should be encouraged to monitor levels of HDL cholesterol . "
In an accompanying editorial , Anatol Kontush , Ph.D. and M. John Chapman , Ph.D. , D.Sc. , at INSERM and University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris , France , note , " It is tempting to speculate that increasing levels of HDL-C , or " good cholesterol " might protect our memories .
However , unfortunate results in large interventional trials with dietary antioxidants suggest that we should remain cautious when proposing therapeutic intervention on the basis of observational studies which do not allow causation to be inferred .
Nonetheless , these studies demand that we focus more effort on research at the interface between HDL and brain function . "
To raise HDL and lower LDL cholesterol , the American Heart Association recommends exercising regularly ; eliminating trans fats from the diet ; reducing the intake of all fats , especially saturated fats ; and consuming monounsaturated fats , such as olive , canola and peanut oils .
Statins can also improve HDL and LDL cholesterol levels , when they pose a heart risk .

BERLIN ( Reuters Life ! ) - Archaeologists have discovered traces of a Bronze Age place of worship in Germany in what they say might be the country ’s answer to Stonehenge .
Scientists from a university in Halle are excavating a roughly 4,000 year - old circular site in eastern Germany which contains graves that bear a strong resemblance to Stonehenge , a prehistoric stone circle of towering megaliths in southern Britain .
“ It is the first finding of this kind on the European mainland which we have been able to fully excavate and which shows a structure we have until now only seen in Britain , ” Andre Spatzier , head of the excavation team , told Reuters TV .
He thinks rituals and ceremonies took place at the site , possibly even sacrifices .
“ The way it is built , with many concentrated rings of graves , walls , palisades and pillars are very similar to the British monument at Stonehenge , ” added Spatzier .
The site , near the town of Poemmelte , was discovered through aerial photos which showed the formation of the graves in a ring with a diameter of about 80 meters ( yards ) .
One difference to Stonehenge , however , is that the remains are made out of wood rather than stone .
So far the scientists have found few items such as bones or pieces of glass , but they expect to find more as the dig continues .
The final results are expected to take up to three years .
Stonehenge goes back to 3,100 BC when native Neolithic people started its construction .
There is no consensus among scholars on whether it was a temple , burial ground or an astronomical site .
The era of cheap food is over — this means disaster for millions , and mega - profits for a few .
How did we get into this mess ?
Most objective observers of the current food crisis are understandably concerned .
Around 45 % of the world ’s population live on two dollars per day or less .
Skyrocketing food prices are now bringing stress to two billion people , and despair to millions — around one hundred million , actually .
The situation is only expected to further deteriorate as : the price of oil continues to soar ; climate change - related disasters increase in frequency and intensity , and as policy decisions such as mandated biofuel quotas in our fuel supply further strengthens the already strong price connection between fuel and food .
It is a humanitarian disaster that ’s well underway , and one which seriously threatens to destabilize international security .
As I ’m sure you can appreciate , a hungry man is an angry man .
Making a killing
And yet , this situation is playing into the arms of large corporations who are making windfall profits out of desperate demand for the most basic of needs , and who see even greater opportunities for a lot more of the same in the coming months and years .
Much of the news coverage of the world food crisis has focussed on riots in low - income countries , where workers and others cannot cope with skyrocketing costs of staple foods .
But there is another side to the story : the big profits that are being made by huge food corporations and investors .
Cargill , the world ’s biggest grain trader , achieved an 86 % increase in profits from commodity trading in the first quarter of this year .
Bunge , another huge food trader , had a 77 % increase in profits during the last quarter of last year .
ADM , the second largest grain trader in the world , registered a 67 % per cent increase in profits in 2007 .
Nor are retail giants taking the strain : profits at Tesco , the UK supermarket giant , rose by a record 11.8 % last year .
Other major retailers , such as France ’s Carrefour and Wal - Mart of the US , say that food sales are the main sector sustaining their profit increases .
Investment funds , running away from sliding stock markets and the credit crunch , are having a heyday on the commodity markets , driving prices out of reach for food importers like Bangladesh and the Philippines .
These profits are no freak windfalls .
Over the last 30 years , the IMF and the World Bank have pushed so - called developing countries to dismantle all forms of protection for their local farmers and to open up their markets to global agribusiness , speculators and subsidised food from rich countries .
This has transformed most developing countries from being exporters of food into importers .
Today about 70 per cent of developing countries are net importers of food .
On top of this , finance liberalisation has made it easier for investors to take control of markets for their own private benefit .

Orchestrating famine
The ability of developing nations to feed themselves has been progressively undermined by trade policies and Structural Adjustment Programs ( see also ) forced upon them by the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank .
This ‘ unholy trinity ’ , as these partner institutions are often described , has brought our current food crisis upon us through their neoliberal ‘ free ’ trade agenda , tailoring markets in developing countries to suit Northern corporations .
Recipients of IMF and World Bank loans must open their borders to the influx of highly subsidised agricultural produce from countries like the U.S. of A. , who sell their food at below the cost of production ( a practice called ‘ dumping ‘ ) , undercutting local producers and putting them out of business — causing mass urbanisation as millions leave their fields to work or beg in cities , as well as swelling numbers of illegal immigrants into the North .
Whilst called ‘ free trade ’ , the reality is that these Structural Adjustment Programs are inherently unfair .
Wealthy states like the U.S. and the E.U. continue to subsidise their production , and refuse to consider any kind of program to ensure their farmers do not over - produce , whilst developing nations are forced to remove subsidies for their production .
This imbalance makes it impossible for small scale farmers to compete with Big Agribusiness — so they simply stop growing food .
As it happens , the same thing occurs within rich countries too — small scale American farmers are giving up at a rate of about 330 per week — but , while some of these farmers commit suicide ( “ Suicide is now the leading cause of death among US farmers , occurring at a rate three times higher than in the general population . ” — CounterCurrents ) , most manage to find a way to continue getting food onto the table .
It is not so in the developing world .
One of the main requirements imposed on developing countries is that they must plug into the global market by transforming themselves into export - oriented economies .
Where a country before was producing a full and diverse range of agricultural produce on small landholdings , this transition sees traditional practices such as crop rotations and composting being supplanted by large scale monocrops intended for export to Northern supermarkets .
Production of food for local consumption thus gives way to agricultural specialisation and mass transit of goods , and closed or virtually closed farming systems are converted into input - and water - intensive monocrop energy hogs , that only serve to deplete soils and create vulnerability to pests and disease .
Cash crops are exported for foreign currency , needed to repay debts to the World Bank and IMF .
These commodity crops take up the best agricultural land , whilst producing food for local markets is disincentivised , reduced in scale and moved to less fertile fields .
These countries thus become dependent on food imports themselves — and in each direction money continues to line the pockets of those orchestrating the production , transfers and transactions .
Whilst there are some benefitting from this paradigm shift — from giant agribusiness entities like Cargill , Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) , and Monsanto , to shipping and air - freight industries , western supermarket chains , and let ’s not forget the oil industry , without whom none of this would be possible ( hint hint ) — the nation doing the exporting is not amongst them .
Some weeks ago I wrote about Haiti — where people have had to resort to eating mud to survive .
As astonishing as this is , the following makes that mud even harder to swallow :
Recipe : Mud , a little vegetable oil ,
and salt .
Mix well , then bake in sun …
Thirty years ago , Haiti raised nearly all the rice it needed .
What happened ?
In 1986 , after the expulsion of Haitian dictator Jean Claude “ Baby Doc ” Duvalier the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) loaned Haiti $ 24.6 million in desperately needed funds ( Baby Doc had raided the treasury on the way out ) .
But , in order to get the IMF loan , Haiti was required to reduce tariff protections for their Haitian rice and other agricultural products and some industries to open up the country ’s markets to competition from outside countries .
The U.S. has by far the largest voice in decisions of the IMF .
Doctor Paul Farmer was in Haiti then and saw what happened .
“ Within less than two years , it became impossible for Haitian farmers to compete with what they called ‘ Miami rice . ’
The whole local rice market in Haiti fell apart as cheap , U.S. subsidized rice , some of it in the form of ‘ food aid , ’ flooded the market .
There was violence , ‘ rice wars , ’ and lives were lost . ”
“ American rice invaded the country , ” recalled Charles Suffrard , a leading rice grower in Haiti in an interview with the Washington Post in 2000 .
By 1987 and 1988 , there was so much rice coming into the country that many stopped working the land .
…
People from the countryside started losing their jobs and moving to the cities .
After a few years of cheap imported rice , local production went way down . ”
Still the international business community was not satisfied .
In 1994 , as a condition for U.S. assistance in returning to Haiti to resume his elected Presidency , Jean - Bertrand Aristide was forced by the U.S. , the IMF , and the World Bank to open up the markets in Haiti even more .
— Counterpunch
Haiti also used to be the world ’s largest exporter of sugar — now it has to import even this .
The environmental impacts of the giant food - swap oriented globalised model are immense , but the socioeconomic impacts are equally so .
This is effectively a tax - payer funded assault on poor countries , accompanied by the cha-ching sound of escalating profits for the world ’s largest corporations .
Watch the clip below to see how twenty years of policy restructuring brought about the ‘ famine ’ in Niger in 2005 :
The following 2005 article on the Niger food crisis shows how it ’s not production that ’s the problem , but ‘ free market ’ induced poverty .
In Tahoua market , there is no sign that times are hard .
Instead , there are piles of red onions , bundles of glistening spinach , and pumpkins sliced into orange shards .
There are plastic bags of rice , pasta and manioc flour , and the sound of butchers ’ knives whistling as they are sharpened before hacking apart joints of goat and beef .
A few minutes ’ drive from the market , along muddy streets filled with puddles of rainwater , there is the more familiar face of Niger .
Under canvas tents , aid workers coax babies with spidery limbs to take sips of milk , or the smallest dabs of high - protein paste .
Wasted infants are wrapped in gold foil to keep them warm .
There is the sound of children wailing , or coughing in machine - gun bursts . …
This is the strange reality of Niger ’s hunger crisis .
There is plenty of food , but children are dying because their parents cannot afford to buy it .
The starvation in Niger is not the inevitable consequence of poverty , or simply the fault of locusts or drought .
It is also the result of a belief that the free market can solve the problems of one of the world ’s poorest countries .
— Guardian , August 2005
Just as in Niger in 2005 , the current problem is not a lack of food , but of massive social inequality brought about by an unrestrained , extractive , capitalist system .
People that could be providing for their own needs by the labour of their own hands must now , instead , fulfil those needs through purchase .
No money , no food .
Where from here ?
The World Bank , IMF and WTO are increasingly on the defensive as the double whammy of a recession and the food crisis hit hard .
They have , after all , been effectively running the economies of the very nations we ’re now watching become unglued .
Over the last decade some countries have begun to wise up , seeking alternative sources of funding , so as to avoid the stranglehold conditions imposed in exchange for receiving loans from the IMF .
In fact , business has been so bad for the IMF of late that it ’s intending to liquidate some of its enormous gold reserves to plug its own funding shortfalls .
The Economist says that “ the food crisis of 2008 may become a challenge to globalisation ” .
It is obvious that the world is ripe for change .
Two weeks ago we covered ( here and here ) the recent huge IAASTD report on world agriculture , where 400 scientists and agricultural experts conducted a three year study which concluded that if we are to feed the world we need to relocalise markets and return to sustainable farming systems ( a report that is being undermined , see section ‘ The Obstacles ’ , by the countries whose industries reap the most benefits from globalised trade and who are pushing the use of genetically modified crops , which the scientists rejected … ) .
At the same time , there is also a very real risk that the ‘ solutions ’ applied to this global food crisis will be implemented by the same organisations that brought it upon us , bypassing lasting change to just bring more of the same .
The World Bank has announced emergency measures to tackle rising food prices around the world .
…
The World Bank endorsed Mr Zoellick ’s “ new deal ” action plan for a long - term boost to agricultural production .
Emergency help would include an additional $ 10 m ( £ 5 m ) to Haiti , where several people were killed in food riots last week , and a doubling of agricultural loans to African farmers .
— BBC ( emphasis added )
Again , the problem is not one of production , but the World Bank ‘ solution ’ , ignoring root causes , is yet more loans and to ‘ boost agricultural production ’ — the latter , in their mind , means more destructive fossil fuel based monocrop agriculture , which means more profit for all the big players that have their fingers in the pie .
IMF / World Bank “ economic medicine ” is not the “ solution ” but in large part the “ cause ” of famine in developing countries .
More IMF - World Bank lending “ to boost agriculture ” will serve to increase levels of indebtedness and exacerbate rather alleviate poverty .
World Bank “ policy based loans ” are granted on condition the countries abide by the neoliberal policy agenda which , since the early 1980s , has been conducive to the collapse of local level food agriculture .
— Global Research
I must be on the same page as President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal , as he has just come out with a scathing rebuke to the UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation ( or FAO — which has worked closely with the World Bank since 1964 ) , saying that the UN food body should be completely scrapped and that it is largely to blame for the current food crisis .
Note :
The following ( short ) clip strangely loops in the middle for a brief period , before continuing .
It ’s well worth watching right through .
Food crisis opens door to greater use of GMOs
As if the above was n’t infuriating enough , the flip side to increased hunger is that it creates wonderful opportunities for Big Agribusiness to further the spread of genetically modified foods .
People that need food aid , and seeds , are being pressured to accept it in a genetically modified form .
Indeed , for many it ’s now their only alternative .
Soaring food prices and global grain shortages are bringing new pressures on governments , food companies and consumers to relax their longstanding resistance to genetically engineered crops .
In Japan and South Korea , some manufacturers for the first time have begun buying genetically engineered corn for use in soft drinks , snacks and other foods .
Until now , to avoid consumer backlash , the companies have paid extra to buy conventionally grown corn .
But with prices having tripled in two years , it has become too expensive to be so finicky .
…
Even in Europe , where opposition to what the Europeans call Frankenfoods has been fiercest , some prominent government officials and business executives are calling for faster approvals of imports of genetically modified crops .
They are responding in part to complaints from livestock producers , who say they might suffer a critical shortage of feed if imports are not accelerated .
In Britain , the National Beef Association , which represents cattle farmers , issued a statement this month demanding that “ all resistance ” to such crops “ be abandoned immediately in response to shifts in world demand for food , the growing danger of global food shortages and the prospect of declining domestic animal production . ” …
Certainly any new receptivity to genetically modified crops would be a boon to American exporters .
The United States accounted for half the world ’s acreage of biotech crops last year .
…
Opponents of biotechnology say they see not so much an opportunity as opportunism by its proponents to exploit the food crisis .
“ Where politicians and technocrats have always wanted to push G.M.O. ’s , they are jumping on this bandwagon and using this as an excuse , ” said Helen Holder , who coordinates the campaign against biotech foods for Friends of the Earth Europe .
— NY Times ( see also here , here and here )
The people of South Korea , who do not want GM foods in their country , are currently in a bind .
Up until recently they imported corn from China , but , as the food crisis hit , China reduced its exports .
This forces Korea to turn to the U.S. , where 70 percent of the corn grown is now genetically modified .
I can almost see the Monsanto executives salivating .
They ’ve done a wonderful job of convincing naïve politicians worldwide that biotech is going to ‘ feed the world ’ , despite report after report after report after report after report to the contrary .
Argentina , who have been farming with GM crops for some time , is a good ‘ developing country ’ example of how the introduction of GMOs has effected their farming communities :
Within the past decade in Argentina , 160,000 families of small farmers have left the land , unable to compete with large farmers .
GM soya has served to exacerbate this trend towards large - scale , industrial agriculture , accelerating poverty .
…
Argentina is currently the second biggest producer of GM Soya in the World .
The countryside has been transformed from traditional mixed and rotation farming , which secured soil fertility and minimized the use of pesticides , to almost entirely GM soya .
Financial problems for farmers are set to worsen with Monsanto now starting to charge royalties for their seeds , where before , it was allowing farm - saved seeds .
Twenty - four million acres of land belonging to bankrupted small farmers are about to be auctioned by the banks .
— I - SIS
And that ’s without even looking the health dangers of genetically modified foods , and of course the documented increased usage of herbicides that result from using ’ roundup ready ’ crops .
Time for a change
It ’s time for a sea change .
Many people regard these mighty financial institutions as beyond redemption , and after years of their obstinately pushing their agenda , despite uprisings and protests against them the world over , I can only agree .
It seems that at their most fundamental level they are in conflict with real social and environmental development .
Real , tangible rural development is simply not their purpose in life .
All the evidence demonstrates that their role is to facilitate a South–North transfer of wealth .
It is economic colonialism — or corporate rape of developing countries .
Just as in the North , the people in the South need to return to the land .
They need policies in place that make it financially viable to become what people the world over should be — self - sufficient stewards of their local environment .
People need tools and knowledge — not genetically modified food ‘ aid ’ , which threatens their food sovereignty and pulls the rug out from under the few people still trying to grow food for local consumption .
Whilst charity is essential to keep people alive at the moment , this situation should not be used to push dangerous biotechnology , and all aid should be seen as a temporary stopgap measure while we help these people rebuild their farming communities , and thus their economies , their environment and our climate .
Nearly a quarter - century ago , an outright famine led to Live Aid , an international fund - raising effort promoted by rock stars , which produced an outpouring of global generosity : millions of tons of food flooded into the country .
Yet , ironically , that very generosity may have contributed to today ’s crisis .
Over time , sustained food aid creates dependence on handouts and shifts focus away from improving agricultural practices to increase local food supplies .
Ethiopia exemplifies the consequences of giving a starving man a fish instead of teaching him to catch his own .
This year the U.S. will give more than $ 800 million to Ethiopia : $ 460 million for food , $ 350 million for HIV / AIDS treatment — and just $ 7 million for agricultural development .
Western governments are loath to halt programs that create a market for their farm surpluses , but for countries receiving their charity , long - term food aid can become addictive .
Why bother with development when shortfalls are met by aid ?
Ethiopian farmers can’t compete with free food , so they stop trying .
Over time , there ’s a loss of key skills , and a country that does n’t have to feed itself soon becomes a country that can ’t .

It ’s Official : Fallout 3 Refused Classification In Australia
Yes , the rumour was true .
The Office of Film and Literature Classification has handed an RC to Bethesda ’s Fallout 3 , making it illegal to sell the game in Australia .
It ’s not known at this stage if the ban was for drug use , as the original rumour states , or gore as I was predicting .
I was ready to dismiss the rumour when I first heard it , but my suspicions were raised when Red Ant failed to confirm or deny it .
It ’s not unusual for a publisher to do this , but it seemed particularly odd as Red Ant had no problem in the past commenting about Fallout 3 and the OFLC .
We ’ll be on Red Ant and Bethesda ’s backs to see what they plan to do .
Most likely the game will be edited to remove the offending content and resubmitted , as AFA Interactive did with Dark Sector .
Even if it is edited , I do n’t think it ’ll stop some from importing the title , as was the case with Grand Theft Auto IV after it was censored for Australia .
Update # 1 : According to Bethesda ’s Pete Hines , the developer has no comment regarding the ban .
[ Thanks briosafreak ]
Update # 2 : A leaked OFLC report reveals exactly why the game was banned .

Oldham Council has confirmed an investigation is under way
Two council workers have been suspended for allegedly having sex in an office - cheered on by a crowd of onlookers .
The couple were seen through a window of the town centre building on Cheapside in Oldham , Greater Manchester , last Friday morning .
Up to 20 people watched from outside before a Police Community Support Officer ( PCSO ) went inside and told the couple they were being watched .
Oldham Council has confirmed two staff had been suspended .
A " full investigation " was under way , it said .
' Very concerned '
The incident , which happened at about 1020 BST , took place at the offices of the Unity Partnership , a sub- contractor for Oldham Council which provides some services on behalf of the authority .
It reportedly carried on for 20 minutes before the PCSO intervened .
Lee Robinson , managing director for the Unity Partnership , said : " We are aware of an alleged incident in Henshaw House on Friday involving two of our employees .
" The two individuals concerned have been suspended pending a full investigation .
" We do not wish to comment further since to do so would prejudice the investigation . "
Jackie Stanton , deputy leader of Oldham Council , added : " We expect Unity staff to share the same values and code of conduct as council colleagues and so are very concerned about these allegations . "
Tourists Trek to Mexico for ' Death in a Bottle ' Terminally ill travel to Mexico to buy pet drug called " death in a bottle . "
July 31 , 2008  --
If Don Flounders waits for the asbestos - related mesothelioma that is ravaging his lungs to kill him , it will be a slow , painful death .
But one day -- maybe just weeks away and at the moment of his choosing -- the 78 - year - old plans to drink a bitter mixture of alcohol and pentobarbital , a barbiturate that is used to euthanize pets .
Flounders told ABCNews.com that he flew halfway around the world from his native Australia to obtain the illegal drug in Mexico , which , like Switzerland , is fast becoming one of the recommended destinations for so - called death tourists .
The lethal drug , once widely available in the U.S. as a sleep aid and now used primarily in veterinary medicine , was an ingredient in the fatal cocktails that killed Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland in the 1960s .
Since 2001 , the pro-euthanasia group Exit International has helped nearly 300 people -- mostly Australians , New Zealanders and a handful of Americans -- to find what is being called " death in a bottle " in pet pharmacies in Mexico .
Commonly known as Nembutal , this concentrated drug will put Flounders to sleep quickly and quietly , by taking his breath away .
" I had no trouble whatsoever purchasing the poison , " said Flounders from his home near Melbourne .
" It will be completely painless .
Of the various means , this is the easiest and most reliable .
It 's a way of achieving a peaceful death . "
Drunk With Your ' Favorite Tipple '
He will take the Nembutal with a glassful of his " favorite tipple " -- gin .
" You swig it down and I 'll just close my eyes , " he told ABCNews.com .
" It 's that rapid . "
Exit International 's
Web site says the best places to obtain pentobarbital are " 20 - odd [ United States - Mexico ] border crossings , from Tijuana in California through to Matamoros on the Gulf of Mexico . "
The group provides information packets for these death tourists , with colorful photos of the packaging to help identify the drug among all the animal products for sale in these over - the - counter veterinary stores .
" There are n't that many drugs that a doctor can give you for a reliable , peaceful death , " said Exit 's founder and director Philip Nitschke .
" It 's always drunk quickly , " he told ABCNews.com .
" I 've never seen anyone finish their whiskey or French champagne . "
Nitschke co-authored " The Peaceful Pill Handbook , " the Australian version of the 1991 American Hemlock Society guide , " Final Exit , " which lays out precisely how to end your life .
The book is banned in Australia , where assisted suicide is now illegal .
" People know we are sympathetic , " Nitschke told ABCNews.com .
" We are drowning in patients coming along who are in dreadful trouble and say , ' Help us die . ' "
Flounders learned about Nembutal from Exit International .
He and his wife , Iris , had become members a decade before he was diagnosed with terminal cancer .
For 16 years , Flounders worked as an executive for Shell Oil in Melbourne , but he has since learned he had been working in a building contaminated with blue asbestos -- " the worst kind , " he said .
Wife May Join Husband
Since then , his condition has worsened .
Just this week , the couple was waiting for an ambulance to take him to the hospital for new tests because of excruciating back pain .
Iris , who is 85 , bought her own supply of Nembutal in Mexico and says she , too , might take her life at the same time .
Iris says she does not have a terminal illness .
The couple have been married for 57 years and have two grown children who have been supportive of their decision .
" We are perfectly happy to go with no reluctance on our part , " he said .
Australian television crews followed the Flounders across the border from California into Mexico , where they bought enough supplies for themselves and a dying friend and Exit activist , Anjy Belecciu .
Belecciu , who is 56 and dying of metastasized breast cancer , helped finance the trip because her bones are too brittle to travel .
The Flounders bought several 100 milliliter bottles of the sterile , liquid pentobarbital for under $ 50 each .
" People are comforted with the way it is packaged with an expiration date in the future and the seal intact , " said Nitschke .
" There is no evidence of a black market . "
But Robert Merrill , a Mexican - American veterinarian who practices in San Miguel de Allende , said it is illegal to sell the drug to death tourists and such an action raises ethical questions .
" I would hope that pentobarbital is only sold to licensed veterinarians , " he told ABCNews.com " But then the licensed veterinarians have to decide what their moral issues are and who they will sell it to . "
San Diego border agents told ABCNews.com that they had not confiscated pentobarbital at their busy crossing , where they see plenty of other animal drugs , like anabolic steroids and the " date rape " drug ketamine , smuggled in for human consumption , said Vincent Bond , spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
Local Pharmacists Surprised
Press reports in Mexico and the U.S. say veterinary pharmacists were surprised at the increased interest in Nembutal .
" We did n't have any idea what they were doing , " one Tijuana sales clerk told The New York Times in a recent report .
" It 's for animals .
Everything here is for animals .
We thought they were giving it to their animals . "
Six days after their highly publicized return , federal and state police raided both the Flounders ' and Belecciu 's homes , hoping to arrest them , but no drugs were found .
" There are a lot of rabbit burrows on my property , " said Flounders , who still retains his good humor .
If Belecciu takes her life first , Flounders can be charged with assisted suicide .
So , too , can she be charged if he goes first -- a crime that carries a 14 - year jail sentence in Victoria , the state where both live .
" Suicide is not a crime , " said Nitschke .
" It 's only a crime if someone helps you . "
Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland , the Netherlands and Belgium , where a pentobarbital - based elixir is often used .
For about eight months , it was legal in the remote Northern Territories of Australia .
There as a general doctor , Nitschke helped with the lethal injection of four of his patients until the law , similar to one in Oregon , was overturned by Parliament .
Using Nembutal for assisted suicide is not as common in the U.S. , according to Dr. Bruce Goldberger , director of toxicology at the University of Florida College of Medicine .
" The typical final exit case would be a mixture of drugs and a bag over your head , " said Goldberger , who investigates more than 3,000 homicides , suicides and accidental deaths a year .
He said a gas like helium can be bought at Wal - Mart .
" What prevents someone from overdosing on their medications that are routinely given from a physician ? " he asked .
" All you have to do is mix it with alcohol . "
But Nembutal is " comfortable and reliable , " according to Goldberger .
Using a cocktail of prescription drugs may not work as quickly and can fail and cause brain damage .
What puzzles the Australian death tourists is why more Americans , who are so close to the border , do n't take advantage of the easy availability of Nembutal .
" In the U.S. , at least the middle and upper classes who can afford to travel usually work out some sort of behind - the - scenes arrangement with their doctor , " said Dr. Art Caplan , director of the center for bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
" I write a prescription and you are not to take more than 30 pills , " he said .
" Doctors warn people , but there is a lot of winking and nodding . "
Americans also use " guns and bridges , " according to Caplan , who said typically doctors -- even in cases of the terminally ill -- try to avoid suicides and counsel on pain control and emotional support .
" As a culture , we seem to think that the medical way is better , " he said .
" Our society strongly condemns assisted suicide . "
But Barbara Coombs Lee , president of Compassion and Choices , a nonprofit organization that works to improve care and expand choice at the end of life , said " desperate and determined " people will travel the globe to find a " peaceful and humane way out . "
" Many people fear getting stuck in a prolonged and degrading process , " she told ABCNews.com , but crossing the border to buy drugs designed for pets may not be the safest alternative .
" Ask any woman , " she said .
" The back alley is a dangerous and degrading place to get medical care .
It used to be the VW bus and Dr. Kevorkian .
Now it 's the vet pharmacy . "
Meanwhile , Don and Iris Flounders say their decision was made of sound mind and not in haste .
" It has to be well controlled , or everyone is going in to the chemist [ pharmacist ] , " he said .
" It 's for people who have seen their doctor and have been thoroughly examined and mentally tested and cleared . "
For them , knowing they have the Nembutal -- just in case Flounders ' pain is out of control and his family is suffering -- gives them peace of mind .
" You do n't feel the need to use it nearly as much as the longing for it , " he said .
And bringing back a dose for his friend has also given him comfort .
" Anjy said before , she resented dying , " Flounders said .
" Now , she says , ' You have given me life . '
She did n't have a choice before . "
The expensive and arduous trip to Mexico was " worth it , " he said .
And Flounders has not changed his mind about taking his life when the time is right .
" We are quiet - living people and not excessively excitable , " said Flounders .
" I 'm the one who got the death sentence , but it does n't worry me .
As far as I 'm concerned , I 've had a good life . "

Natural Treatment for Clinical Depression
One of the byproducts of our contemporary isolated life is depression .
Depression can have devastating effects on our mind and body , the activities that we used to enjoy with friends and family could become lifeless .
First , they fail to correct the behaviors that contribute to depression , or even show direction towards behavioral modifications , so the disorder recurs .
Second , they do not improve the body ’s own mechanisms for rectifying such disorders ; rather , they temporarily force a change that gives symptomatic relief .
Third , for some the severe side effects of these drugs can create major implications .
Worse yet , studies show for many people there are no drugs that can help .
It is truly sad to hear about how many people commit suicide even when they are taking drugs regularly .
Below you will find four natural ways to overcome depression without the use of any drugs .
1. Simple Brain Shift
One of the best techniques neuroscience research and brain mapping have developed is Brainswitching .
Brainswitching is a power cognitive behavioral therapy that can be just as effective as anti-depressants .
Depression exists in the emotional part of the brain .
Brainswitching uses basic mental exercises to switch the neuronal activity from the emotional part of the brain ( the subcortex ) to the thinking part of the brain ( the neocortex ) which does not have the capacity for depression .
Here ’s an example of Brainswitching that you can try for yourself .
Lets say you find yourself being depressed , instead of thinking “ I am so down and depressed ” make yourself busy with some trivial logical exercises or games .
At such a time you can play games that involve logical thinking ( chess , soduku , online puzzles , etc ) or simply close your eyes and in your mind start singing your favorite song with full concentration .
Refuse to think that you are depressed .
Concentrating your mind on some thought or song will block the cognitive awareness of the depression going on in the subcortex , the emotional part of your brain .
This technique will increase the neuronal activity in the neocortex and decrease it in the subcortex , thus correcting the chemical imbalance that feeds depression .
2. Omega - 3 fatty acids .
Omega - 3′s aid in the brain ’s neuron connectivity and are important components of nerve cell membranes .
People who do not get enough omega - 3 fatty acids in their diet may be at an increased risk for depression .
They help nerve cells communicate with each other , which is a vital step in maintaining good mental health .
Studies show that people who ate a healthy diet consisting of fatty fish 2 - to - 3 times per week for 5 years experienced a significant reduction in feelings of depression and hostility .
If fish is not a regular part of your diet you can also take omega 3 fatty acids in a vitamin pill form ( 1000 mg daily dosage ) .
Omega -3
Fatty acids are not only helpful for overcoming depression , but they are also used as treatment in diabetes , Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder , High Blood Pressure , Arthritis , and many more .
3. Aerobic Exercise
“ A lot of what passes for depression these days is nothing more than a body saying that it needs work . ”
- Geoffrey Norman
“ Scientists recently discovered that exercise is as effective in fighting depression as Prozac and Xanax .
Ask your doctor if getting off your ass is right for you . ” – Bill Maher
Exercise and fresh air play a big part in keeping depression and mood swings at bay .
By aiming to get outside and jogging at least three times a week for half an hour at a time helps you clear your hear , think straight and aids concentration .
It also gives you that ‘ runner ’s high ’ by releasing your endorphins that can instantly cheer you up .
Exercising is a good way to work through and release stress as well .
It does not have to be fast paced jogging or running , just get your heart rate up to120 to 160 beats per minute depending on your age and condition .
Now an expanding body of research shows that exercise can improve the performance of the brain by boosting memory and cognitive processing speed .
Exercise can , in fact , create a stronger , faster brain .
This is possible because researchers believe that exercise can help the brain produce more seratonin which could prompt new neurons to grow .
Low levels of seratonin have been associated with clinical depression .
Most antidepressant medications , such as Prozac , enhance the effectiveness of serotonin .
Interestingly , these drugs take three to four weeks to begin working — about the same time required for new neurons to form and mature .
So the reason these drugs could be effective during depression is because they increase neurogenesis .
Just as exercise does .
4. Sleep
Improper sleeping patterns are both the cause and consequence of depression .
So why does depression cause insomnia ?
The answer lies in the fact that people suffering from depression have a difficult time controlling the different mood and sleep hormones .
The hormones you need to improve mood and energy are not the same ones you need to help you sleep .
Our body needs serotonin to be active and energetic during the day , and it needs melatonin to help us pull back and sleep .
So if the body starts producing melatonin in the daytime it can cause us to feel dull , unstable , irritable and moody .
Oftentimes , depression is the result of your body producing the wrong hormones at the wrong time of day .
This imbalance in the body clock can be caused from lack of sleep , stress , trauma , lack of light , or number of other factors .
In scientific terms this is referred to as the Circadian Rhythm Disorder .
Medical journals now report that depression is closely tied to circadian rhythm disorders .
Being out in the sunlight for 30 minutes a day helps keep your internal body clock set .
This daily rhythm helps to regulate our sleep / wake cycle and insures a good night ’s sleep that helps our mental and physical health .
In addition to going out in the sun light here are some good sleeping habits you can follow to readjust the body clock .
No activities before going to sleep – You should strictly avoid adrenaline before going to sleep .
Stay away from anything that is exciting or stressful and yes that includes exercise , TV , or even reading before going to sleep .
Follow a steady sleep routine – Try going to bed at the same time every night .
We all know how working in shifts and jet - lag affect sleep : do not emulate them by going to bed at random times each day !
Go to bed early -
By going to bed early you wake up naturally instead of being forced by an alarm clock , and it also prevents you from being out of sync with the solar cycle .
Going to bed early allows your body to slow crash down and fall asleep .
Only use your bedroom for sleeping - Dedicate a seperate room for sleeping where you do n’t do any work or stressful activities .
This subconciously tells your body this is the place to sleep and your body slowly forms a habit of it .
Conclusion
Turn these tips in to a routine like brushing your teeth , so that they become a part of your daily life .
You do n’t think about them , you just do them !
If you take these natural steps everyday it can be very effective in overcoming depression .
In fact , studies have shown these to be as effective ( or even more so ) than traditional therapies .
Incorporating these natural steps in your daily life will not only help you overcome depression but also improve the general quality of your life .

Mum 's the word among federal officials about the health benefits of eating organic foods .
The Department of Health and Human Services defers questions about organic foods to the Food and Drug Administration .
But the FDA has no policy on organics because it says they 're the domain of the Department of Agriculture , which will admit to using the " o - word , " but says its mandate is simply to regulate use of the certified organic label , not to judge the relative benefits of organic versus conventional foods .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
While the agencies entrusted with safeguarding our food and health pass the potato , a fast - growing body of scientific literature suggests that the connection between farm practices and the healthfulness of our foods merits attention .
Organic foods do n't come out ahead of conventionally grown foods in 100 percent of comparative tests , but they rise to the top often enough to suggest that organic farming can increase , sometimes dramatically , the nutrient density of what we put in our mouths .
Even a cursory look at recent peer - reviewed studies should be enough to get public health officials talking .
Researchers at the University of California at Davis found that 10 - year mean levels of quercetin were 79 percent higher in organic tomatoes than in conventional tomatoes , and that levels of kaempferol were 97 percent higher .
Quercetin and kaempferol are flavonoids that studies suggest protect against cardiovascular disease , cancer and other age - related ills .
Another Davis study compared organic and conventional kiwis and found that " all the main mineral constituents were more concentrated in the organic kiwifruits , which also had higher ascorbic acid ( a precursor of vitamin C ) and total phenol content , resulting in a higher antioxidant activity . "
A Spanish study measured 1.5 times more carotenoids - associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers - in peppers grown organically .
And Swiss researcher Lukas Rist found that mothers consuming at least 90 percent of their dairy and meat from organic sources have 36 percent higher levels of rumenic acid in their milk .
Research suggests rumenic acid may deter cancer and diabetes , and preserve and improve immune system functions .
These and other studies give hope that organic farming can reverse the nutrient decline of fruits and vegetables that appears to accompany the widespread use of agricultural chemicals and produce varieties selected primarily for yield .
And while it 's true that nutrition science is still a long way from understanding what the amount of a specific nutrient in a tomato , kiwi or glass of milk means for overall health , ignoring the opportunity to improve the nutrient density of foods at the foundation of the USDA 's food pyramid seems foolhardy .
Based on a review of data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , Brian Halweil , senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute , says , " Thirty percent or more of the U.S. population ingests inadequate levels of magnesium , vitamin C , vitamin E and vitamin A , all nutrients we get from plants . "
In a paper he published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Bruce Ames , professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of California - Berkeley , noted that vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common in the United States , and that these deficiencies may accelerate degenerative diseases .
Even our ever - expanding waistlines may be due in part to nutrient declines in our foods .
Paul Hepperly , director of research at the Rodale Institute , thinks we may be responding like cattle do .
" Cattle will eat more of hay that 's been rained on and had most of its nutrients leach out than they normally would , " he says .
" The animals get these big bellies , and they 're unhealthy , but they 're just trying to get their nutrients .
Ranchers know that if they have animals with hay belly , they have poor quality food .
What we 've done with the erosion of nutrient content in our foods - what we 've done with additives , processing and artificial agriculture production methods - is that we have basically produced a hay belly nation . "
Refusing to enter the discussion about how farming methods affect the nutrient density of our food helps our government duck the question of why it lends so much support to the status quo of conventional , nonorganic agriculture .
But failing to acknowledge the connection between what happens on the farm and the healthfulness of foods may be enough to make a nation sick .

Defendent from Kawasaki City receives 1.5 years in prison , suspended for 3 years
On July 24 , the Kyoto District Court sentenced 34 - year - old company employee Kasuhiro Maki from Kawasaki City to one year and six months in prison , suspended for three years , for unauthorized uploading of Gundam and other popular anime with the Share file - sharing program .
Three men were arrested for unauthorized anime file - sharing in Japan on May 9 , and Maki is the second of those three to be sentenced .
Moriyoshi Inoha , a 41 - year - old company employee from Tokyo , also received a 18 - month sentence , suspended for three years , on July 14 .
Maki , Inoha , and Takahiro Ōtomo from Hiroshima Prefecture were arrested on the same day by the Kyoto Prefectural Police 's High - Tech Crime Task Force .
They were the first to be arrested for using Share to allegedly share files without permission .
Prosecutors had requested 18 - month sentences for both Maki and Inoha .
Judge Hiroyuki Satō of the Kyoto District Court compared anime file - sharing to " distributing bread that was shoplifted from a supermarket , " which drew an out - of - court critique from Maki 's defense counsel about the appropriateness of the comparison .
Share 's developers had promised high anonymity for its users , but ever since security researchers found flaws in Share in 2006 , other successor applications have been developed .
Japan 's Copyright Law prohibits unauthorized uploaders but expressly allows people to download for private use .
The Japanese government is pushing for a ban on unauthorized downloads as well , despite receiving thousands of messages from citizens opposing the ban .

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf , facing impeachment on charges drawn up by the governing coalition , has announced that he is resigning .
He went on national TV to say that while he was confident the charges would not stand , this was not the time for more confrontation .
He is accused of violation of the constitution and gross misconduct .
The Speaker of the Pakistani Senate , Muhammad Mian Sumroo , automatically took over as caretaker president .
Mr Musharraf has been a key ally of the US in its " war on terror " since he took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 .
Reaction in Pakistan is overwhelmingly one of relief that a bruising and lengthy impeachment battle has been avoided , the BBC's Mark Dummett reports from Islamabad .
I leave myself in the hands of the people
Pervez Musharraf Musharraf 's mixed legacy Strongman and war on terror Musharraf in pictures India fears power vacuum
The key issue now is whether the ruling coalition , which had pushed for Mr Musharraf 's exit since winning the February election , can stay united and deliver on its promises , he says .
It will have to agree on a new president , then persuade allies like the US and UK , and its neighbours like India and Afghanistan , that it will be committed to defeating militancy and terrorism , our correspondent adds .
International reaction to Mr Musharraf 's resignation was mixed , with the US hailing him as strong ally against terrorism but Afghanistan welcoming his departure as a boost to democracy .
' No bravado ' Looking calm and dressed soberly in a dark suit and tie , Mr Musharraf said he had decided to resign after consulting his allies and advisers .
Pakistan faces hope and risk
In a defiant speech , he said he had believed it was his destiny to save Pakistan , helped by God , and that he had prevented it from being declared a terrorist state .
In a clear reference to his political opponents , he accused unnamed elements of putting themselves above the country and seeking to betray it .
" Not a single charge can be proved against me , " he said , while conceding he had made mistakes .
An impeachment process would have plunged the country into more uncertainty , he said , and it was no time for " individual bravado " .
The outgoing president listed social , economic and infrastructural improvements made during his rule .
" I leave myself in the hands of the people , " he concluded .
After making his speech , the former military leader inspected a guard of honour outside his white palace in Islamabad , stepped into a black limousine and left the presidency .
Cheering crowds poured into the streets of Pakistan 's big cities to celebrate Mr Musharraf 's departure .
In Karachi , lawyers danced in jubilation .
' A friend to the US '
The caretaker president is a member of the pro-Musharraf faction of the Pakistan Muslim League .
MUSHARRAF KEY DATES 12 Oct 1999 : Deposes PM Nawaz Sharif in coup 20 June 2001 : Names himself president while remaining head of the army 12 Jan 2002 : Declares war against extremism in Pakistan 14 December 2003 : Survives first of several assassination plots 3 November 2007 : Declares state of emergency before judiciary can rule on his re-election as president 28 November 2007 : Steps down as army chief to become a civilian president 18 August 2008 : Announces he will resign as president
Resignation speech excerpts Reaction in quotes
The eventual new president must be elected by both houses of Pakistan 's parliament and the four provincial assemblies .
Reacting to news of the resignation , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised him as a " friend to the United States and one of the world 's most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism " .
She said the US would work with Pakistan 's new leaders , pressing on them the need to stem " the growth of extremism " .
The UK government wished Mr Musharraf well but stressed that relations did not depend on one individual .
India said it had no comment to make on the resignation since it was an internal matter for Pakistan .
Neighbouring Afghanistan , whose own president , Hamid Karzai , had a very fraught relationship with Mr Musharraf , hoped his departure would boost democracy in both countries .
Mounting pressure Mr Musharraf 's resignation followed more than a year of turbulence .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is shame for Pakistan ; Musharraf was cleaning the 49 years old mess .
Salman lalwani , Houston , USA
The unrest began last March when he confronted the judiciary , suspending the chief justice .
After widespread strikes and protests , his decision was overturned by the Supreme Court .
Mr Musharraf won the presidential election in October - but the Supreme Court refused to confirm the result .
In November , he declared a state of emergency , citing increasing attacks by militants but eventually stood down as head of the army , giving up his main power base .
The parliamentary election this February , handed a clear victory to the two main opposition parties .
The coalition struck a deal to impeach the president earlier this month and finalised their charges against him hours before he stepped down .

What are these ?
" CHANGE " sounded like a really catchy thought two years ago , before we began this non -stop farce of political selections , amid the mountains of propaganda that rise from the open wastelands of the never - ending lies .
' Everybody knows ' that all government 's lie ; the bigger the government , the bigger the lies .
Most people also lie , but only politicians and criminals seek to make a career out of lying .
Yet most Americans still believe that they live in a free country with laws that govern this society and protect the citizens from any and all attacks : because to fail to believe in this ; is to be " Un- American " in some way .
The truth is that we have been using Doublespeak & Newspeak for so long now that many actually believe that " lies are truth " and that " freedom is slavery . "
The facts are that we have been living on the edge of CHANGE almost exclusively , or at least since Lyndon Baines Johnson declared " The Great Society . "
The real history is far too long and dusty for most to care about .
So let 's begin with the beginning of the end of our own time , which seriously began during Harry S. Truman 's stint in the Oval Office .
HST brought us the Atom Bomb and the end of the Second World War in the Pacific .
He also created the CIA and the National Intelligence Agency ; the same NIA that took over the day - to - day running of the federal government from the congress .
Truman also pushed the idea of " Israel , " as a " new state " to be decided upon by the U.N. " Harry " was however known to the public for his famous desk plate which read " The Buck Stops Here , " and for firing General Douglas MacArthur .
HST was followed by Eisenhower who presided over the formation of the military - industrial ( and congressional ) complex , while he slept his way through his presidency , between golf games .
He was remembered for the single line of warning he left for the world upon his departure from office : warning us all about the creation that was actually formed on his watch .
It was during these years that the revolving doors of government service began to lead directly to multi-million dollar profits for the connected who had figured out how to vote themselves money at the public 's expense .
This was the era of the Gray Flannel Suit and all things ' Corporate ' were great and good . '
America was in love with consumerism and two - car garages , in the Burbs : however the price for all this company loyalty was the beginning of the end of anything beyond the all - consuming passionate pursuit of money !
It was the 50's and the ' Beats ' were heard from in small towns and cities across the land As Allen Ginsberg 's HOWL made its paperback way into the heartland ; the revolt of the young against this mindless pre-occupation was finally on ~ " I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness , starving hysterical naked , dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix , angelheaded hipsters , burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night , " ~ And the youth of the late 1950 's began to vote with their feet against the sell - out by their parents and the sterile corporate lives that too many had begun to hate .
The ' Beats ' were educated but not tempted by the kind of ' security ' offered by the soulless corporate world .
Thought mattered to these people , as did excesses of all kinds , which killed so many in the end .
With the end of the Beats , came the beginnings of the Viet Nam War and a whole new generation called the Hippies .
Drop -outs druggies , flower - children free - love advocates and a whole range of wanderers , drifters and general non-conformists , most of whom simply hated any limitations on their ' care - free ' lives .
But with the war , the ' purity ' of the pre-pubescent children in the streets of San Francisco and elsewhere begin to lose its promise , in the direct degree , to which the drug culture began to reclaim the ancient ways of capital , and all the " isms " that naturally flow from that .
During this same period the old - world - order was re-inventing itself once more and beginning to test the limits of its new found status , beneath the ominous shield of the Cold War. ' Communism ' was the boogie man of the hour , especially since it was internationally linked with the labor movement which threatened the elite with loss of control over the economic - slavery - class - which is where their corporate wealth came from .
So discrediting communism became synonymous with stopping the international growth of trade unions , at any price !
They used the House Un- American Activities Committee hearings , to drive home their points , by instilling terror and fear into people in the government and the motion picture industry .
Senator Joe McCarthy led this charade and was assisted by staff attorney 's Richard Nixon and Robert Kennedy ; with Ronald Reagan serving as the scapegoat , who was then the head of the Screen Actors Guild .
The Blacklist was created by this committee and valuable lives were destroyed , in this opening bid to marginalize " political thought " for the nation - despite constitutional provisions against exactly that !
At the same time the fledgling Corporatocracy was beginning to get its collective act together , while they used Corporate Welfare , the IMF and the World Bank to subjugate dozens of struggling nations around the planet - supposedly in the " national security interests " of the United States .
However in reality this was just bare - knuckled bloody - capitalism , and it worked !
In 1970 Nixon replaced Johnson until he was forced out without facing impeachment proceedings that should have been held , but because too many key congressional players would have also been charged , Nixon was allowed to resign .
He was followed by Ford who pardoned him ( as was pre-agreed by all involved ) and that gave us Carter & the Iran hostages that led directly to Reagan .
But back when JFK was in the White House , America was not afraid of itself or of much of anything else .
Then it was November 22 , 1963 and JFK had been in the middle of denying nuclear weapons to Israel only weeks before , when he was assassinated in Dallas and now the American - world turned black .
Jack was replaced by a blood enemy of his , Lyndon Baines Johnston of Texas , and America had its second treasonous ' leader ' since Harry Truman .
With Kennedy 's death the Vietnam War belonged to LBJ who then brought us the Great Society , The War on Poverty , and the Age of Contradictions .
" The Great Society " was the first blow against a living wage for the middle class ; just as " The War on Poverty " was created not to solve poverty , but to expand that condition to the middle class by initiating the first of many redistribution of wealth schemes .
These masqueraded as " WARS " to improve the lot of Americans and their hard won earnings .
But the " New Age " LBJ ushered in was marked by the introduction of Doublespeak for government officialdom as well as for everyone else who wanted to be seen as " players " in the New ( NOT Great ) Society .
( 1 ) LBJ was duplicitous and the second of several would - be dictators of America .
His social engineering packages began the cultural destruction of the nation and the set - up the socialist - corporate - models for the unfettered greed of the ever - expanding corporate states within this country : Socialism for the Corporations ; and Fascism for the poor and middle classes - but at this stage velvet gloves still covered the iron fists of state - fascism .
Along the way a gruesome and unbelievable thing took place during the ' Six - Day - War ' in 1967 .
That is when Israel tried to sink the USS Liberty , an unarmed American spy ship off the coast of Israel .
During the attack the ship managed to get out a call for assistance and US Navy fighters were scrambled to come to her aid .
But at the last minute the fighters were ordered to turn back by the Pentagon .
Not satisfied with this order the US squadron commander ordered the jets to return to help the Liberty , at which point LBJ told that commander to stand down and ' I want that ship on the bottom of the Mediterranean ! '
The ' investigation of this " incident " was a charade that has no equal in US military history , and it was successfully covered up by the Pentagon and the US media until very recently - to the disgrace of everyone involved .
( 2 ) This cover - up left bloody footprints , because until very recently few could fathom why any American president would ever dare to order such a thing to happen .
Who could be that powerful to order LBJ to call for that outcome ; only one country comes to mind and that is Israel .
Who stood to gain the most from JFK 's death , if not LBJ :
Who had the motive and means to carry out the assassination of a sitting US president ?
I cannot prove that this is true , but it would certainly explain a great deal about why the US never challenges anything that Israel wants done in the world - regardless of the cost .
At the very least this ought to be officially investigated - and that 'll happen on the 32nd day of next month - no doubt !
Simultaneously , back in the late 1970 's the extreme left with its Political Correctness was also busy tearing this nation to pieces , and creating barriers everywhere for their own twisted ' new - realities . '
The War upon Americans was an equal - opportunity attack , in which CHANGE was the one true weapon that was used to destroy and desecrate everything of critical value to the lives of most of us .
It was from the Left that we got Political Correctness and Zero Tolerance along with every kind of barrier between all the different races , religions and even genders .
(3) All of the above was " CHANGE " yet nobody apparently knew that .
Because it received no in - depth coverage , and soon the radical nature of its real purposes joined the political sideshow of the investigations into the death of Kennedy - that ended in the official pack of lies issued by the Warren Commission .
Many potential leaders were also murdered most prominently among these were RFK , and Martin Luther King along with others like Malcolm X , and more recently Senator Wellstone and John F. Kennedy Jr. Is n't it strange that only those opposed to the Owners seem to meet with violent ends - while the dinosaurs in power just keep on living like animated cadavers .
Vietnam was the first of the ' new wars ' for corporate greed and global power , in the middle of the Cold War with the USSR .
But that war was televised and covered to a degree that let the public know enough to demand an end to it .
Afterwards , the Corporatocracy bought up the media in order to prevent this situation from ever - again interfering with the plans for the NWO , or any of its global plans for world dominance over all jobs , while at the same time removing all controls over price - fixing , Anti-trust laws , excess - profits taxes , and virtually everything else that had once kept our criminally - minded would - be - owners at bay .
With the 1980's came " Morning in America " and the Regan Revolution which began to decimate the remaining key components in everyday life .
" Greed is Good " was their motto .
When Ronnie crushed the Air Traffic Controller 's Union and essentially fired all 11,000 members - that marked the official end of any thoughts about the viability of unions in the USA .
Simultaneously Regan's Vice - President , George H.W. Bush , fresh from a stint as head of the CIA , negotiated the release of the American hostages held for 444 days in Iran ( this was done before the election so that when Ronnie won , the first thing that would happen is that all the hostages would be released ) .
He did this by agreeing to secretly and illegally sell weapons to Iran ( the Arms for Hostages Scandal ) and Poppy was granted total immunity from any disclosure in the first official act of his son , the 43rd president , George W. Bush .
The Reagan administration went on to create the Death Squads that were used in Central and South America in the 1980's and early 1990's .
This involved drug running and weapons smuggling by the CIA and the DEA , in an effort to maintain control over drugs and guns in the Western Hemisphere .
With this failure of the War on Drugs , government itself became the dealer .
The adventures of Oliver North were part of this charade and America quietly became a rogue - state , no different than the so - called ' Banana Republics ' where we were supposedly still fighting communism !
By 1995 Newt Gingrich declared his ' Contract on America ' that featured shutting down the government as the way of coercing congress to " play ball " or face certain failure in any political future :
This very public political murder killed politics and ended the pretence of a two - party system that we once had .
While there had always been degrees of corruption in the past , with the arrival of the Reagan Era the three braches of government became officially just two ; and with the death of congress we lost our " public representation . "
This was followed on December 12 , 2000 ( with the interference in the Florida vote ) when the Supreme Court too lost its independence and left the nation with only one branch of government - the now criminally - treasonous ' executive ' and his powers as ' the Decider . '
The presidency has been a dictatorship since even before George W. Bush took his stolen oath of office !
And now eight years on we still behave as if the two year long campaign for the presidency has meaning to the public .
The game is fixed , the choice was rigged by the owners - and after two stolen elections the public apparently still believes that voting matters and that the people they pay to represent them will actually listen to them .
Can the public still believe that congress will go against their own private interests just to honor their oath to the Constitution :
That same founding document which these same people have been destroying , both secretly and publically for the last eight years !
The selections do matter , but not to ordinary people because this is no longer " our " government .
By the time Clinton began we were already finished , but there were still some loose ends that needed to be cleaned up .
Clinton 's job was to privatize all that was left of what the public had once owned and controlled .
The FCC was tasked with destroying all competing interests in media : newspapers , television , radio and print : and they 've been very thorough !
One of Clinton 's star accomplishments was the Telecommunications Act , and all of its subsequent expansions .
He and Hillary also oversaw the gutting of much of the social legislation that remained from Roosevelt 's days and the congress joined with the White House in removing the fire - walls that would have prevented the current crisis in banking and commerce , which allowed the financial outrages that have led us to the brink of collapse today .
But Slick - Willy also brought us the big - time fast - tracking of GATT and NAFTA and paved the way for similar trade associations throughout this Hemisphere as well .
Clinton also secretly oversaw the beginnings of the North American Union , ( NAU ) , and the creation of a number of the components so necessary to the chessboard for the acting out of what came after 911 .
( 4 ) Then came " the Decider " to wrap it all up into a very public and very ugly Empire !
This too has been composed of nothing but change : CHANGE that now threatens the entire world , with massive slaughter and destruction for the private profits of the few that will end the planet as we knew it , and hasten the collapse of all authority that does n't come from the barrel of a gun !
Why do we pay taxes , or the salaries of these imposters that occupy those offices in the state houses or in Washington D.C. ?
The servants have taken over the mansion and we have refused to do anything about it .
Consequently our silence is taken for compliance and the abuse gets worse with every passing day !
In fact it has been all these CHANGES that have brought all this about - yet - the newbie 's in this presidential year have n't got a clue !
Our foreign policies are courting oblivion , and yet the ' players ' are the same ones that got us into this nightmare with our eyes wide shut against all constructive doubt or even any questions .
Have you noticed that no one is ever fired for their failures on the job !
This has to do with why the Decider began his political tyranny with ; " You 're either with us or against us , " the true mind - set of any professional criminal .
There is no longer any loyalty to the Constitution or the moral imperative , there is only loyalty to the Corporations and to the power - structure that controls them all .
The US is no longer a nation of laws - we are a Barbarian rogue - state - that answers to no law except the law of the corporate jungle !
That 's a bit of what happened to us , but what our silence and inattention has created goes far beyond destroying just our nation - we have threatened the world with semi-extinction .
We have created crimes against humanity and supported a state that makes Nazi Germany look like an amateur .
Millions of people have died and millions more have been crippled , tortured , deported or emotionally destroyed , not to mention the millions that our actions have permanently displaced : all because our owners want it all !
This appears to be a CHANGE from what we once said we stood for , but since everything is secret how can these be measured !
If we really sought to CHANGE things we could make a carburetor that gets between 60 and 100 miles to the gallon and we could commit to changing everything about the way we look at our union with the natural world and the environment .
There is at least three times as much of an economy to be made from resource uses and infrastructure repair than from oil and gas , but that will not happen so long as this private - stranglehold remains upon the world for the rights to all the oil and all the water .
We could put every man woman and child to work revitalizing our infrastructure ( instead of selling off our roads and natural resources wholesale to other nations ) : and if we were really serious we could bring back jobs and punish those who fled this country for no regulations and unlimited profits .
But all of this takes work and a real commitment to living under the rule of law - and that is much harder to resurrect than any commercial challenge could ever be !
On the plus side , the one thing that the Owners are not counting on is that thanks to the volume and variety of all the lies that have undercut our national foundations - the public is rapidly approaching saturation with this farce on every front .
There is the whisper of a thought - form growing with every new lie poured over all the old ones .
No longer can the public simply accept the word of any government agency or uniformed person ; in fact because these people now work for a fascist police state : they should be challenged at each and every turn about every single thing , no matter how small .
It the government or any of its minions say anything - if they 're lips are moving then it must be assumed that they are lying !
No sane person can come to any other conclusion !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche Holding AG will suspend its HIV research because none of its pending medicines represent significant improvement over existing drugs , a company spokeswoman said on Friday .
“ Research scientists currently working in HIV will be reassigned to other activities , ” Linda Dyson , a spokeswoman in Roche ’s U.S. office in New Jersey , said in an e-mail .
Dyson confirmed an e-mail sent on Wednesday to some activists informing them of the decision .
In that e-mail , the company said it “ decided to refocus our resources within virology on diseases in which we can deliver substantial improvements over existing medications . ”
Dyson declined to specify how much Roche has been investing in HIV research .
She also said she could not specify how many employees worked in the HIV research division .
Roche employs 5,000 people in the U.S. and 3,000 in its New Jersey office .
The company said in the e-mail to some activists that it initially had been excited about the potential for drugs in pre-clinical testing , but it has “ concluded that none would provide a true incremental benefit for patients compared to medicines currently on the market . ”
Roche said it would continue to support its molecular diagnostic tests and drugs already on the market , including the fusion - inhibitor Fuzeon .
Roche has partnered with Morrisville , North Carolina - based biotech Trimeris Inc to sell Fuzeon , which netted $ 266.8 million in sales last year .
But the drug struggled because of its cost -- $ 25,000 for a year ’s supply -- exceeding the cost of other HIV drugs on the market , said Peter Staley , founder of AIDSmeds.com , which tracks HIV - related news .
The launch of new drugs and an uptick in HIV cases is set to make AIDS medicine a $ 10.6 billion market by 2015 , according to a study published last year by independent market research firm Datamonitor .
More than 20 separate HIV drugs are available , with several combination pills also available .
None can cure the fatal disease , which infects an estimated 33 million people globally and which has killed 25 million .
The drugs fall into various classes , each of which interferes with the replication of the virus at a different stage .
The human immunodeficiency virus hijacks immune system cells , forcing them to create copies of itself .
Activists said they would not mourn the withdrawal of Roche from the field .
“ They ’re not beloved in the AIDS community , ” said James Love , Director of Knowledge Ecology International , an advocacy group that focuses on access to medication .
“ They are criticized a lot by people in the AIDS field because they are the least willing to give discounts on their AIDS drugs . ”
The decision reflects “ the lack of productivity among the groups that they have working in this area , ” he said , adding that “ a lot of the big pharma companies have n’t been very impressive in terms of their big internal pipeline . ”
Staley said Roche has never come up with an AIDS drug that has sold really well .
“ Roche is a big company and they ’ve been trying to get this right for many , many years . ”
Staley said .
“ It is disappointing that there is one less big pharmaceutical company in this field .
I do n’t think it ’s a sign of a serious problem in pharma ’s commitment . ”

The tendency toward obesity is directly related to the brain system that is involved in food reward and addictive behaviors , according to a new study .
Researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine ( TUSM ) and colleagues have demonstrated a link between a predisposition to obesity and defective dopamine signaling in the mesolimbic system in rats .
The mesolimbic system is a system of neurons in the brain that secretes dopamine , a neurotransmitter or chemical messenger , which mediates emotion and pleasure .
The release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the mesolimbic system is traditionally associated with euphoria and considered to be the major neurochemical signature of drug addiction .
" Baseline dopamine levels were 50 percent lower and stimulated dopamine release was significantly attenuated in the brain reward systems of obesity - prone rats , compared with obesity - resistant rats .
Defects in brain dopamine synthesis and release were evident in rats immediately after birth , " said Emmanuel Pothos , PhD , assistant professor in the department of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics at TUSM and member of the neuroscience program faculty of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences .
" Previous research has demonstrated that food intake leads to an increase in the release of dopamine , in the circuits that mediate the pleasurable aspects of eating , " Pothos explains .
" Also , chronic food deprivation resulting in decreased body weight leads to decreased dopamine levels .
Therefore , increased food intake may represent a compensatory attempt to restore baseline dopamine levels . "
Pothos says , " These findings have important implications in our understanding of the obesity epidemic .
The notion that decreased dopamine signaling leads to increased feeding is compatible with the finding from human studies that obese individuals have reduced central dopamine receptors . "
He speculates that an attenuated dopamine signal may interfere with satiation , leading to overeating .
Pothos and colleagues conducted their research using obesity - prone and obesity - resistant rats .
Adult obesity - prone rats consumed more food and were 20 % heavier than obesity - resistant rats .
The researchers measured electrically - evoked dopamine release from nerve terminals .
" We also measured regulators of dopamine synthesis and release in midbrain dopamine pathways , " explains Brenda Geiger , first author and graduate student in the pharmacology and experimental therapeutics department at TUSM .
" Our molecular analysis suggests that the central dopamine deficits are most likely caused by reduced expression of the genes encoding two proteins , one that is involved in dopamine synthesis , and another that is a transporter responsible for packaging dopamine into vesicles from which it is later released upon stimulation . "
" Obesity has so far been approached mostly as a metabolic rather than as an addictive disorder ; and obesity research has primarily focused on brain systems that regulate body weight through the maintenance of energy balance .
The current study challenges this approach by focusing on brain pathways implicated in pleasure and reward .
These pathways could override energy balance and induce hyperphagia and obesity by altering the reward value of food , particularly palatable high - energy food , very early in life , " says Pothos , who is the study 's corresponding and senior author .
According to Gerald Weissmann , MD , editor - in - chief of The FASEB Journal , " Now we know why so many people stay addicted to food : it fuels the mid-brain pleasure machinery .
We eat not only for nourishment , but also for pleasure .
This study provides the molecular link between eating and mental health . "
This research was funded by grants from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institute on Drug Abuse , both institutes of the National Institutes of Health , and the Smith Family Awards for Excellence in Biomedical Research .
The work was conducted in the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Tufts Center for Neuroscience Research ( CNR ) .
Introduction
The Boost .
Thread library provides portable wrappers under system threading primitives to create a concurrent environment and to apply synchronization on it .
It is fully enough to have Boost .
Thread library facilities to create full - fledged multithreaded programs with using of the lock & wait based synchronization there .
But Boost .
Thread library is just a first layer under system threading routines .
Interface of the Boost .
Thread is identical from functional point of view to the interface of the system threading interfaces such as PTHREAD or Win32 Threads .
That means that Boost .
Thread allows non-safe operations such as non-synchronized concurrent access to resources , and forces library users to make routine and dangerous work which can be fully done by using the C++ language .
The Lwsync library ( lock & wait synchronization ) provides implementation for two patterns that can be used instead of raw system synchronization facilities , to allow a user to create lock & wait synchronization on a concurrent environment .
Those patterns on one hand can be mapped on any synchronization facility ( by default , they are mapped on the Boost .
Thread , and so that they can be used anywhere the Boost library is available ) ; on the other hand , they fully rely on the C++ language .
So that one can use the Lwsync library as one more layer between any system synchronization facility and end the concurrent code to make the lock & wait synchronization more easy and safe .
The Critical Resource pattern allows one to create a resource object , and guarantee that all accesses to it will be synchronized .
All synchronization will be automatically done before and after such an access .
The Monitor pattern is a kind of a Critical Resource one , but it not only synchronizes all accesses to a resource object but also allows threads to wait until resource objects become in some defined state .
In most cases , it is fully enough to have those two patterns to make the lock & wait based synchronization .
Note that the Lwsync library allows one only to synchronize threads but not to start them , control thread attributes etc .
The Boost .
Thread library may be used instead .
Lwsync Library
Critical Resource Pattern
Critical Resource is a template that receives resource type in its parameter and allows to access resource objects only when all synchronization is done .
Critical Resource provides to the user a kind of smart pointers that are called accessors , which calls all the synchronization in its constructor and destructor , so that the user can access resource objects via accessors only when all the synchronization is done .
A single way to access resource object is to use accessor .
Critical Resource works well with both automatic and temporary accessors objects .
So resource access can be synchronized both by scope of code and by an expression .
In case if the critical resource is used with system synchronization facilities that allow recursive acquiring ( like boost : : recursive_mutex , which is used by default ) , resource accessors can even be escalated from within a scope of routine where it was created .
That means that accessors can be returned from function by value and caller can continue working with accessed object without loosing access over it .
Also , the user is able to use critical resources to synchronize an existing object if it is not synchronized yet by using reference specialization of critical resource templates .
Example 1 :
typedef lwsync::critical_resource<int > int_resource_t ; int_resource_t int_res ( 10 ) ; * int_res.access ( ) = 20 ; { int_resource_t::const_accessor int_res_access = int_res.const_access ( ) ; if ( * int_res_access == 20 ) std::cout << " Thread 1 has already changed int_res value . " ; else std::cout << " Thread 1 does n't change int_res value yet . " ; }
Example 2 :
lwsync::critical_resource<std::ostream&> sync_cout( std::cout ) ; * sync_cout.access ( ) << " Hello " << " from " << " thread " << N ;
Example 3 :
typedef lwsync::critical_resource<std::vector<int > > sync_vector_t ; sync_vector_t vec ; { sync_vector_t::const_accessor vec_access = vec.const_access ( ) ; for ( std : : vector < int > :: const_iterator where = vec_access -> begin ( ) ; where != vec_access ->end ( ) ; ++ where ) std::cout << * where << std::endl ; } sync_vector_t::accessor some_vector_action ( ) { sync_vector_t::accessor vec_access = vec.access ( ) ; vec_access ->puch_back ( 10 ) ; return vec_access ; } { sync_vector_t ::accessor vec_access = some_vector_action ( ) vec_access ->puch_back ( 20 ) ; }
Note that there exists an ability to use dynamic accessor objects ( with using of operator new ) or class data - members to manually control access time for some resource .
But in most cases , it is not a good idea to store accessors , because during all accessors ' lifetime resource remains blocked and there is no other ability to unblock it , except to destroy the accessor object .
It is possible to access more than one critical resource in one expression or scope , but in most cases , it is probably dead - lock unsafe to do that .
copy ( ) method can be used in expressions instead to get a copy of the resource and block only one resource in one moment of time .
Example 4 :
typedef lwsync::critical_resource<int > int_resource_t ; int_resource_t one_number ( 10 ) ; int_resource_t other_number ( 20 ) ; int result = * one_number.access ( ) + * other_number.access ( ) int result = * other_number.access ( ) + *one_number.access ( ) int result = other_number.copy ( ) + one_number.access ( )
In the example above thread 3 can't lead to deadlock when it is used with thread 1 or thread 2 .
But in this case there will be no guarantee that one_number and other_number together had result sum at one defined moment of a time .
Value of the one_number may be changed after a copy of the other_number is already obtained .
It is possible to construct an accessor object without explicit calling of the access ( or const_access ) method .
This ability can be used as a syntax sugar .
Example 5 :
typedef lwsync::critical_resource<int > int_resource_t ; int_resource_t critical_number ; { int_resource_t :: accessor number_access = critical_number ; } { int_resource_t::const_accessor number_access = critical_number ; }
Monitor Pattern
Monitor is a kind of Critical Resource , and one can access resource object by the same way as for Critical Resourced .
But monitor not only provides synchronization of resources , but also allow waiting until the resource becomes in some defined state .
The state of the resource is defined with predicates , so one can use STL predicates as well to monitor some resource .
After the monitor becomes in a defined state , the user will get an accessor to the resource , and it is important that the predicate is called within the same lock that this accessor handles .
So the monitor pattern guarantees that the user gets access to a resource within the same lock where the predicate was called .
Example 6 :
typedef lwsync::monitor<std::vector<int > > sync_vector_t ; bool is_not_empty ( const std::vector < int >& vec ) { return !vec.empty ( ) ; } { sync_vector_t::accessor vec_access = vec.wait_for(is_not_empty ) ; } { sync_vector_t::const_accessor vec_access = vec.const_wait_for(is_not_empty ) ; for ( std : : vector < int > :: const_iterator where = vec_access -> begin ( ) ; where != vec_access ->end ( ) ; ++ where ) std::cout << * where << std::endl ; }
Also , the monitor is able to wait for a resource if this resource is a bool or can be converted to a bool without predicates .
For example , one can wait for a moment when the pointer will not be null .
Example 7 :
typedef lwsync::monitor<my_data_t*> my_data_monitor_t ; my_data_monitor_t my_data_instance ( 0 ) ; { my_data_monitor_t::accessor data = my_data_instance.wait ( ) ; data->invoke_something ( ) ; } *my_data_instance.access ( ) = new my_data_t ( ) ;
Example 8 :
typedef lwsync::monitor<bool > notifyer_t ; notifyer_t notify_object ; for ( ; ; ) { notify_object ::accessor notify_access = notify_object.wait( ) ; * notify_access = false ; } * notify_object.access ( ) = true ;
Waiting predicate has access resource by value or const reference and cannot change even in case of waiting for no -const access for a resource .
Predicates which use the non-const reference are prohibited to avoid live - locks when two threads are waiting for some monitor and the entire time they are trying to re-evaluate the state of the resource after each other to detect possible changes .
Monitor Waiting Cancellation
All threads which are waiting for some monitor can be cancelled with the cancel ( ) method .
In this case , the thread will receive the monitor : : waiting_canceled exception instead of an accessor object .
Monitor in this case enters a cancelled state as well .
If some thread will try to wait for the canceled monitor , the thread will receive the monitor : : waiting _canceled exception also .
The monitor can be returned to the normal state with the renew ( ) method and all the threads will be able to wait for it again .
In some cases , it is a necessity to force the monitor to reevaluate all predicates .
It can be necessary if some predicate is a complex and change its state without changing the state of the monitor .
The method touch ( ) will force all threads to reevaluate its predicates .
Synchronization Policies
In most cases when Boost .
Thread is available one can use Lwsync without using of synchronization policies .
But they are still necessary for some special cases .
For example if it is necessary to log out all accesses for some critical resource .
Critical resource and monitor patterns use synchronization policies as a template parameter , so that it can be mapped to any synchronization facility .
By default , both synchronization policies use the boost :: recursive_mutex and boost : : condition portable synchronization facilities .
Note that the synchronization policies for the critical resource and the monitor are different .
The critical resource synchronization policy is based only on the locking facility but the monitor one has to have not only the locking but also waiting facility .
One can use the monitor synchronization policy to synchronize critical resources ( like monitor does , as a fact ) but not vice versa .
Critical resource synchronization policy has to provide a locker_type , which can be used as a data - member of the critical resource to associate resource objects with a guard .
Also , it has to provide four methods to perform synchronization :
template < typename Resource > static void const_lock ( locker_type* , const Resource * ) ; template < typename Resource > static void lock ( locker_type * , Resource * ) ; template < typename Resource > static void const_unlock ( locker_type* , const Resource * ) ; template < typename Resource > static void unlock ( locker_type * , Resource * ) ;
All those methods will be invoked by resource accessors .
The synchronization policy has the const_lock and const_unlock methods to naturally work with the rwlock synchronization pattern .
The monitor synchronization policy has everything from the critical resource one , but also it has to have two waiting methods :
template < typename Resource , typename Predicate > static void wait ( locker_type* , const Resource& , Predicate ) ; template < typename Resource , typename Predicate > static void const_wait ( locker_type * , const Resource& , Predicate ) ;
It makes it possible to implement waiting for a resource , and acquire a locking guard for reading when the resource becomes a defined state in case the Rwlock pattern is available and the waiting facility does n't require mutual execution .
It is safe to throw an exception from the waiting facility or the waiting predicate .
In this case , the user will receive an exception instead of an access to the resource .
One can implement the waiting facility as a cancellation point , and throw an exception from the wait ( ) method if the thread is canceled .
Or the predicate can throw an exception if it decides that the object becomes in a broken state .
The Monitor pattern will correctly handle all those situations .

The mortgage crisis has caused a " glut " of vacant homes in the U.S. But as Petrino DiLeo explains , under the free - market system , those homes are more likely to be destroyed than provided to the homeless .
IT'S NO secret that one of the key problems in the U.S. housing market is that there are more houses for sale than buyers for them .
Because of the mortgage crisis that caused home values to plummet and banks to tighten up their requirements for making new mortgage loans , the pace of sales has slowed way down .
Currently , there are 4.5 million existing homes for sale , or a nearly 11 - month supply at the current pace of sales .
There are also 453,000 new homes on the market , also an 11 - month supply .
In short , there are way too many homes than can be sold for a profit ( not to mention growing supplies of vacant condominiums and apartments ) .
Until a real dent is made in this supply of vacant housing , prices will continue to fall .
As it stands , even though construction of new homes has dropped precipitously , the vacant supply is rising , not falling , as homeowners who can't afford mortgages put their homes up for sale -- plus houses that were foreclosed upon also go on the market .
What 's the extent of the problem ?
New data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that the combination of people losing their homes and continued construction of unaffordable new homes means that 18.5 million out of the estimated 129 million housing units in the U.S. now sit vacant -- a whopping 14.3 percent .
According to the Census Bureau , U.S. households on average have 2.57 people .
So the vacant housing stock could provide homes to at least 47.5 million people -- or about 15 percent of the U.S. population .
And that 's a conservative estimate when you consider that many vacant houses could comfortably house many more people than the household average .
To put this number in perspective , the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that 3.5 million people in the U.S. experience homelessness in a given year , and about 842,000 people are homeless in any given week .
So there are enough vacant homes to house the homeless in any given week 56 times over .
Further , in 2005 , the United Nations Commission on Human Rights estimated the global homeless population at 100 million .
So , roughly speaking , there is enough vacant housing to provide shelter for nearly half the world 's homeless population in the U.S .
And when you factor in the growing amount of vacant commercial real estate , such as office buildings and shopping centers , an even further dent could be made .
UNDER
A sane system , this would be fantastic news -- homelessness could be wiped out entirely in the United States , and large parts of the globe .
But under capitalism , it 's bad news .
Consider the situation in New Orleans .
Nearly three years after Hurricane Katrina , up to 200 of the 1,000 " chronically homeless " in the city camp out nightly underneath a filthy highway underpass .
The camp sits literally a few hundreds yards away from a massive public housing project that the city emptied , surrounded with razor wire and has been trying to demolish ever since the storm .
Meanwhile , in the Southwest , tent cities are arising , occupied by people who lost their homes to foreclosure .
The city of Santa Barbara , Calif. , for example , has set aside 12 parking lots to allow people who lost their homes to live out of their cars .
In many cases , the people living in the lots still have jobs , but simply can't find affordable housing .
CNN interviewed Barbara Harvey , a 67 - year - old mother of three children currently living out of her SUV with two golden retrievers .
Harvey was laid off a year ago from a job that nevertheless paid so little she was still paying three - quarters of her income toward housing .
Two months ago , she was forced out of her condo .
" It went to hell in a hand basket , " she told CNN .
" I did n't think this would happen to me .
It 's just something that I do n't think people think is going to happen to them , is what it amounts to .
It happens very quickly , too . "
Harvey now works part time for $ 8 an hour , and she draws Social Security to help make ends meet , but that 's not enough to afford apartments in a community where the median house price is more than $ 1 million .
What other solutions are being offered ?
Rather than trying to occupy vacant houses , Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke suggested that cities and states should destroy vacant homes to help bring supply and demand back into balance .
In a speech in March , Bernanke praised the Genesee County Land Bank in Flint , Mich . --a " highly depressed " market , in his words -- for acquiring vacant units through tax liens and demolishing them .
Bernanke sniffed that such programs could " mitigate safety hazards and reduce supply . "
Meanwhile , Lawrence Lindsey , a former assistant to the president on economic policy in the Bush administration and a leading proponent of Bush 's $ 1.35 trillion tax cut for the rich , wants to tap immigrants to buy the houses .
Sounds great , right ?
Only it turns out that Lindsey is n't thinking of undocumented workers .
Instead , he has proposed a plan to grant " provisional green cards " to any foreign investors willing to spend at least $ 10 million to buy groups of residential properties and hold them for five years .
His logic ?
By luring up to 100,000 investors to buy properties , $ 1 trillion would be pumped into the housing industry .
How does that makes it any easier for people to actually live in these houses ?
That 's not something Lindsey has an answer for .
All these examples illustrate in stark terms that the interests of capitalism lie only in making a profit and not meeting human need .
Another kind of society is not only desirable , but necessary .
Dear Arch Developers ,
As a new Arch user , I wish to register a complaint .
Since setting up my 32 - bit install a couple of weeks ago , it 's been trouble - free and everything has ' worked as advertised ' in the wiki ( or at least once I got my AGP NVIDIA card working , but that was a BIOS issue ) .
As a user who prefers to tinker with my system as much as use it , I find this level of useability and flawless upgrading to be , frankly , boring .
I 'd much rather have to constantly solve problems , compile from source , and deal with out - of - date packages , extra bloat and obscure , hidden settings - just as I have done with other popular distributions .
I hope that the Arch developers will see their way to amending these annoying design oversights and come to grips with what the average user 's expectations are .
I therefore request that they abandon this outlandish philosophy of The Arch Way - which seems to me to be an excuse to " keep it simple not stupid " , in defiance of established OS norms .

RubyFringe Roundup : The Best Ruby Conference Ever ?
By Peter Cooper
( Photo credit : Kieran Huggins )
RubyFringe - described as a " pricey , limited - attendance smoozefest " by Ruby documentation co-ordinator James Britt or as " an avant - garde conference for developers that are excited about emerging technologies outside of the Ruby on Rails monoculture " by the organizers - went ahead last week and appears to have been a significant hit .
A small conference with a reasonably high ticket price ( though far less than RailsConf Europe ! ) , RubyFringe was set to be a very unique sort of conference with parties , drinks and out - of - hours entertainment laid on , and a limited number of tickets made available to ensure a more intimate gathering .
The gamble appears to have paid off .
Praise
I 'm not quite sure exactly what went down ( I had to pull out of attending ) but all references I 've seen have been almost over - the - top with excitement and praise :
Soleone says : " Rubyfringe was amazing !
So many good talks and great people .
Best talk : Giles ' presentation on computer generated music .
Laughed my ass off ! "
Rob Sanheim says : " rubyfringe was a blast , and now i can't sleep . "
Lennon Day - Reynolds says : " RubyFringe after - party unsurprisingly turned out to be awesome . "
Josh Merchant described it as " an amazing - inspirational - creative - experience . "
Heck , there are far too many positive mentions to read on Twitter .
Mark McGranaghan of TechCrunch wrote directly to Ruby Inside :
RubyFringe was a huge win .
Unspace set out to raise the bar for software conferences , and I think that they succeeded .
I hope that RubyFringe does for web conferences what Rails did for web development ; show others that there is a better way , that it does not require corporate sponsorship , and that it can fun , artistic , and productive all at the same time .
Content
There are over 1000 photos from the event on Flickr .
Joey deVilla has put together some handy notes for most of the presentations .
Rowan
Hick has put together a list of his RubyFringe highlights .
InfoQ attended the event and , I am told , will be putting up videos of several presentations on their site soon .
Until then , the content of the talks is summarized here .
The next RubyFringe ?
With such success , it 's inevitable another RubyFringe conference will take place within the next year .
If you 're interested , Pete Forde suggests joining the Google group , and keeping an eye on RubyFringe.com for more info ( although it 'll be here at Ruby Inside too ) .
It remains to be seen if the success of RubyFringe will encourage " avant garde " conferences elsewhere in the world or for non Ruby communities generally , but Ruby Inside wants to hear about them if so .
Appeals court denies Plame 's attempt to sue US officials Associated Press
Published : Tuesday August 12 , 2008
Print This Email
This A federal appeals court said Tuesday it would not resurrect a lawsuit that former CIA operative Valerie Plame brought against members of the Bush administration .
Plame accused Vice President Dick Cheney and several former high - ranking administration officials of revealing her identity to reporters in 2003 .
She and her husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , say that violated their constitutional rights .
It was an unusual case and even some on Plame 's legal team acknowledged the case was an uphill fight from the start .
A federal judge dismissed the case last year and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld that ruling Tuesday .
The appeals court said there was no constitutional basis for the court to step in and it declined to create one .
The judges said Plame and Wilson could bring their case under the Privacy Act , though it does not cover the president or vice president 's offices .
The court also said it must be reluctant to wade into national security issues .
Melanie Sloan , Plame 's attorney at the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , said Plame was considering an appeal .
" It is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power , " Sloan said .
The lawsuit named former presidential adviser Karl Rove ; Cheney 's former top aide , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby ; and former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage .
Armitage was the original source for a 2003 newspaper column identifying Plame as a CIA officer .
At the time , her husband was criticizing the Bush administration 's prewar intelligence on Iraq and had become a thorn in the side of the White House .
Rove also discussed Plame 's employment with reporters .
The leak touched off a lengthy investigation that led to Libby 's conviction on charges of obstruction and lying to investigators .
Jurors found that , when questioned by the FBI and a federal grand jury investigating the leak , he lied about his conversations with reporters .
Bush commuted Libby 's sentence , and he never served a day in prison .
The Justice Department declined comment .
Nobody was ever charged with the leak itself and Plame 's lawsuit is one of the last remaining legal issues associated with the case .
She can appeal to the Supreme Court .
Chief Judge David B. Sentelle wrote the opinion and was joined by Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson .
Sentelle was appointed by President Reagan and Henderson by the first President Bush .
Judge Judith Rogers , who was appointed by President Clinton , dissented from the ruling in part .
Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich announced that his impeachment resolution against President George W. Bush will be heard before the House Judiciary Committee on Friday .
He 's asking that everyone petition the mainstream media to COVER THIS HISTORICAL EVENT - we need your help !
- contact names , numbers and e-mail addresses are here .
" I want to thank you for the support which you have given to my efforts to hold this administration accountable for taking us into a war based on lies , and for the destruction of the rule of law and the destruction of cherished Constitutional principles , " Kucinich said .
He will make the case , he continued , that the President has violated his oath of office , violated U.S. and international law , has separated our nation from our Constitution , and has threatened the democratic core of our nation .
Now that all airlines have set a new standard for cost cuts and low service ( including charging for blankets and pillows ) , frequent flier programs can be scaled back with fewer worries about keeping up with the competition .
So Delta ( DAL ) , American Airlines ( AMR ) , et al , are getting out the hatchet ( NYT ) :
American ’s steps , which take effect Oct. 1 , came a week after Delta revised its frequent - flier program , including the addition of a three - tier system for travel using awards .
Beginning Oct. 1 , a one - way upgrade from a discounted coach seat on American will cost $ 50 , plus 15,000 miles .
Previously , American required 15,000 miles each way , but did not charge a fee .
A round - trip upgrade will now require a $ 100 fee , plus 30,000 miles .

Another great lecture from Google TechTalks .
This lecture is given by Neil Daswani , who has a Ph.D. from Stanford and currently works at Google as a security engineer .
He is also an author of a book entitled " Foundations of Security : What Every Programmer Needs to Know " , which teaches you state - of - the - art software security design principles , methodology , and concrete programming techniques you need to build secure software systems .
Neil talks about top three web application vulnerabilities that cybercriminals use to steal money .
These three vulnerabilities are :
SQL Injection attacks ,
Cross -Site Request Forgery ( XSRF ) attacks , and
Cross -Site Script Inclusion ( XSSI ) attacks .
I was surprised that he did not cover plain , old Cross - Site Scripting ( XSS ) attacks , but jumped right to dynamic XSS .
You 'll have to get familiar with this type attack on your own .
See the XSS Faq and XSS Cheat Sheet for more information !
Interesting points from the lecture :
[ 01:48 ]
Years ago cybercriminals were teenagers writing viruses and worms , today they are organized crime looking for stealing money .
[ 03:19 ]
Intermediate goals to stealing money are data theft , extortion and malware distribution .
[ 04:02 ] Russian Business Network ( RBN ) is an example of organized cybercrime .
[ 09:00 ] Attack # 1 : SQL Injection .
[ 16:30 ] Preventing SQL injections .
[ 17:00 ]
Do n't blacklist ( filter ) characters in queries .
Whitelist ( allow ) well - defined set of safe values for each field .
[ 18:30 ]
Take a look at mod_security if you use Apache web server .
Mod_security is a Web Application Firewall .
It allows you to define a set of rules the web application must follow .
[ 19:30 ] Prepared statements and bind variables help to avoid SQL injections .
[ 23:00 ]
Other mitigations strategies include - limiting web application user 's privileges on the sql server , hardenining database server and host operating system .
[ 23:45 ]
Second order SQL injections ( link to pdf ) abuse data that is already in the database .
[ 23:55 ]
Blind SQL injection ( link to pdf ) is a technique to reverse engineer the structure of the database .
[ 24:25 ] Attack # 2 : Cross - Site Request Forgery ( XSRF ) .
[ 26:00 ] How XSRF Works .
[ 31:30 ] Drive - By - Pharming ( pdf ) is an XSRF technique where the attacker changes DNS settings of a users broadband router ( fact - 50 % of home users do not change default router password ) .
[ 34:00 ] Preventing XSRF .
[ 34:20 ] Check Referer HTTP header .
That does n't always work because the user might be using a proxy .
[ 36:15 ]
Validate the user by asking him to provide his password or any other token only the user has knowledge of .
[ 37:15 ]
Validate requests via " Action Tokens " which add special tokens to forms to distinguish them from forged forms .
[ 38:30 ] Attack # 3 : Cross - Site Script Inclusion ( XSSI ) .

It ’s an exciting day for us at Directed Edge .
Today we ’re finally putting our Wikipedia - based technology preview out there for people to play with .
Before you click over to it , here ’s a little about what you ’re looking at .
As our name implies , we ’re graph theory nerds .
We look at the roughly 60 million links between the 2.5 million English Wikipedia pages , and with a few extra cues from the content , figure out pages related to the current one and put that in a little box in the upper left ( as evident from the image on our home page ) .
In some cases , if we ’re able to pick out what sort of page it is , we also drop in a second box with just other pages of the same type .
Finding related pages in Wikipedia is n’t fundamentally what Directed Edge is about .
We ’ve got a super - fast in - house graph storage system that makes it possible to do interesting stuff with graphs quickly , notably figure out which pages are related .
We ’ve already got a couple of pilot customers lined up and will be working with a more in the next weeks to analyze their sites and figure out how things are related there .
We ’ve got a prototype of our web - services API that they ’ll be using to send us break - downs of how stuff ’s connected on their site and we ’ll send back what we hope are some pretty groovy recommendations .
There are dozens of things in the pipe for us : ways to make recommendations better , ways to make the Wikipedia demo cooler , things customers want to see in our web services that we ’d previously not thought of , and we could ramble on that for a while , but there are a few things that are on the very near horizon that did n’t quite make it into this round :
An open web - services API for accessing the recommendations from our Wikipedia demo .
This will be a stripped down , read - only version of our commercial API usable in web mash - ups .
Better tagged ( i.e. music , movies , authors , companies ) recommendations .
Support for tagged articles was one of the last features that made it into the current demo , and we ’ve got some plans for improving the results for those .
Pulling in non-English Wikipedia variants .
We ’ll probably start with German and French .
More info about our commercial web - services API .
We ’re still nailing down some of the details , but as soon as we freeze the API for the first customers , we ’ll add more docs to the site .
If you subscribe to our news feed you ’ll see immediately when those services go live .
Even though we ’re still in the beta - phase and are only accepting a limited number of customers , if you think you ’d be interested in using our engine for your site down the line , we ’d encourage you to register now since we ’ll be offering a discount for our commercial services to everyone who fills out their info in the contact form during the beta phase .
More soon .
Enjoy !
Clay Shirky is a leading thinker about how the internet is changing the world .
In his writing , especially the recent book , Here Comes Everybody , he detailed how the networked world allows people to form leaderless groups that still do useful work .
Through illuminating examples like his calculation that Wikipedia was created in about the same amount of time that Americans spend watching commercials each weekend , Shirky argues that humans in the post - industrial age are just coming to terms with how to spend their " cognitive surplus . "
We talked with him about how that surplus might be directed at tackling global environmental degradation .
Shirky focused on the need for new legal and social structures – working through online media – to enable collective action .
Along the way , he touched on Facebook 's limitations , why conserving oil might not actually help the world , and why Linux programmers and Critical Mass cyclists might be the new models for political action .
Wired.com : Can you talk about how social applications could help solve environmental problems ?
Clay Shirky :
There is no larger collective - action problem than the environment .
The three biggest lies of the environmental movement is that every little bit helps , you can do your part , and together we can do it .
[ Compact fluorescent lightbulbs ] are nice , but people going down and changing CFLs in a handful of fixtures is n't going to cut it .
It 's a collective - action problem .
The difference between what all the people can do individually and the global consumption of nonrenewable resources is huge .
The tension is … what will it take to get people to act in concert ?
There is n't any additive solution to the problem .
It will be both governmental and social because that 's the scale of the problem .
Wired.com :
Have you seen any social applications online that begin to approach that scale ?
Shirky :
No , not yet .
This is something I discovered as a result of doing the book .
There are lots and lots of examples of large - scale sustained work in the world of IP .
Linux and Wikipedia .
These are large - scale , long - term efforts .
But in the domain of collective action , it 's almost all short - term and almost all protest - oriented .
There 's a couple of reasons for that .
Collective action is considerably harder to arrange than simple collaboration .
It 's a strange to say that something like Wikipedia is simple , but compared to large - scale collective action problems , it is .
The other big change is that there would have to be some structure for recognizing the groups taking the action .
There are examples from intellectual property .
The GNU public license , creative commons license , etc. …
These are ways of carving out the rights that participants have .
It seems to me that one of the things that 's missing on a collective action front is the ability for people to come together in a way that is similar to Linux and Wikipedia , but has specific , targeted policy goals .
Issue - oriented nonprofits , e.g . The Sierra Club , need to be involving more participants , but that seems to require new legal structure , not just a bunch of people trying to do the right thing .
If that was all it took , Wikipedia would have happened 10 years before it did .
It takes people who want to do the right thing and the structure to make that happen .
Wired.com :
What sort of online tools would enable that kind of collaboration ?
What 's missing ?
Shirky :
What 's missing is there 's no license .
There 's no equivalent of the GPL [ GNU General Public License ] .
There 's been some tools for collaborative production of thinking .
Anything from mailing lists to Wikis .
What we do n't have is tools for acting once a decision has been taken .
In Linux the final action is the compile step .
In Wikipedia the action is the latest edit .
Now we need to turn around and do X out in the world .
I do n't think that there 's anything digital that we could do that would solve this gap .
I think the gap is produced by the difficulty of translating thought into action .
I think the kind of things that help people turn thoughts into action are much more about social and legal structures .
What is the significant long - term policy we need to put in place to start replacing fossil fuel energy sources ?
That 's not a Facebook app in Facebook 's current incarnation .
The way I 'm asking myself the question is : who is the current Richard Stallman [ founder of the Free Software Foundation ] …
Is there someone working on the problem of translating thought into action in a way that all members of the group can agree on ?
This is the incredible thing about Linux .
Even when individual coders find decisions not to their liking , it 's still better to stick around with Linux as it is .
The legitimacy that Linux has acquired has kept the group together .
Who 's out there that 's thinking about the structural difficulties of turning thought into action ?
I know it 's not me .
I wish it was .
It may be David Johnson at New York Law School [ creator of Do Tank , Democracy Design Workshop ] .
Whoever gets that right is going to be providing the key thing that 's missing right now .
Wired.com :
When you talk about collective action , it sounds like you 're talking about local government .
Maybe it's not true in national government where each individual 's contribution to the decision - making process approaches zero , but you can change policy at the county or city level .
Shirky :
You can have some sustained impact on local policy .
A group worth modeling is Critical Mass , who have essentially said that there is absolutely no reason the streets have to be owned by cars .
We 'll demonstrate that by owning the streets for one day .
The NYPD is furious about these guys and they came out recently and – they so do n't understand what 's going on – they said , " We 're willing to sit down with these guys and make a deal .
We 're willing to sit down with their leader … "
Wired.com :
And co-opt them .
Shirky : Exactly , but they wo n't tell us who their leader is .
Critical Mass has a structure where that kind of negotiation is off the table .
Who the police deptartment is bargaining with is the populace , the bike - riding populace .
That is the kind of thing that is possible .
Wired.com :
What do you think about organizing efforts like Bill McKibben 's 350.org ?
Shirky : I sort of reflexively dislike McKibben .
He wrote a book with a section about the value of a duck swimming around a pond and contrasting that with the vast wasteland of television .
But he made a whole point of not telling people about where it was .
It 's private property .
He owns it and he 's able to go there .
Any solution that does n't work for cities does n't work .
McKibben 's natural splendor argument is so unfit for the 21st century .
That said , I have n't seen 350 .
Maybe his thinking has changed .
Wired.com :
What about currently existing apps that allow resource sharing or the like to push down demand ?
Could they have an impact ?
Like , say , something like the Carpool app on Facebook ?
Shirky : Obviously this is the type of thing where lots and lots of different efforts add up to something .
Certainly the social networking services have a role .
For those sorts of point - to - point matching , social networks are quite good .
There are a lot of effects there where if you take a group of people that just needs a coordination layer , to come together and do something , the Facebooks of the world are great .
Here 's the problem : Lowering demand alone tends to lower the price , and lowering the price lowers it for everybody .
Everything that reduces an individual 's purchase on the fuel network ends up subsidizing businesses ' use of the same fuel .
You can conserve aluminum .
You can see that the can goes into recycling .
But if you do n't use oil , that oil is available to use .
Then the cost comes down so demand rises again .
As useful as carpooling might be in the short - term … anything that only reduces demand is subsidizing price .
Carpooling is important for urban density , air pollution and other reasons but carpooling is not the kind of thing that actually changes the energy equation .
Wired.com :
But what about a world in which the supply of energy is limited ?
Shirky : The Peak Oil argument .…
If the factors driving the price of oil up are much more tied to supply than demand , which is n't this year , and probably not in five years , but maybe in 10 years , we 'll be carpooling as a kind of crisis response .
But the effect of carpooling will be to lengthen the crisis of oil .…
The longer we can use oil as efficiently as we do , the longer it postpones the search for alternatives .

The great urban journalist Jane Jacobs probably had New York City in mind when she wrote about the potentially devastating effects of government - sponsored “ redevelopment ” on the inner city , but her lesson applies in many cities across the world .
San Francisco ’s Fillmore District is a prime example of an “ urban renewal ” disaster .
“ The agency ’s time there has not been a happy story , ” Fred Blackwell , the new executive director of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency , recently told the San Francisco Chronicle .
“ There is no way to make up for clearing large swaths of land and displacing thousands of people . ”
In 1948 , city officials declared the Fillmore , an ethnically diverse but largely African American neighborhood , to be “ blighted ” under the California Redevelopment Act of 1945 .
Over the next few decades , and with the help of eminent domain and federal funding , 4,729 businesses were forced to close , 2,500 households were pushed out of the neighborhood , and 883 Victorian houses were demolished .
What the Fillmore got in return for its troubles — a high - rise residential project , some fast - food restaurants , and , late last year , a posh jazz nightclub — was too little , too late .
What went wrong ?
Several things .
First , the urban planners of the day got it wrong : Rather than being “ blighted , ” the Fillmore was the center of the city ’s vibrant , black commercial district , providing goods and services , gainful employment , and upward mobility for thousands .
If it was n’t broken ( and in the eyes of many of the Fillmore ’s residents and shopkeepers at the time , it was n’t ) , it did n’t need fixing .
Second , the economic opportunities and complex social networks that fostered economic empowerment and community spirit were fragile things :
Hoping that they would boldly spring forth years after they had been dramatically disrupted was no more realistic than trying to unscramble an omelet .
Third , the powerful politicians , bureaucrats , and contractors who profited from “ redevelopment ” had different short - term interests than those displaced by program .
What can be done to prevent future “ urban planning ” disasters ?
Several things .
First , eminent domain must be drastically curtailed .
( That ’s no real loss : Bruce Benson argues forcefully that the “ holdout problem ” is a bogus rationale for eminent domain . )
Second , rent control , which , as Paul Krugman notes , inhibits the creation of new rental property and contributes to the deterioration of existing rental properties , must be dismantled .
Similarly , below - market housing mandates , which curtail the creation of new housing and therefore drive up housing prices , should also be scrapped .
Third , the power of politicians to dole out favors to special - interest groups should be greatly restricted .
( The harms of interest - group politics and other sources of “ government failure ” are ably explained in Beyond Politics , by William Mitchell and Randy Simmons . )
Fourth , urban planners and residents themselves must better learn the nature and positive potential of the voluntary institutions , networks , and patterns that arise without government planning .
( For details , see the Independent Institute book The Voluntary City , edited by David Beito , Peter Gordon , and Alex Tabarrok . )
San Franciscans better learn these lessons fast : Last June , the city ’s voters passed a redevelopment initiative for the Bayview / Hunters Point area .
The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to ban plastic carryout bags in the city ’s supermarkets and stores by July 2010 -- but only if the state fails to impose a 25 - cent fee on every shopper who requests them .
Council members said they hope an impending ban would spur consumers to begin carrying canvas or other reusable bags , reducing the amount of plastic that washes into the city ’s storm drains and the ocean .
“ This is a major moment for our city , to bite the bullet and go with something that is more ecologically sensitive than what we ’ve ever done before , ” said Councilman Bill Rosendahl , who represents such coastal neighborhoods as Venice and Playa del Rey .
Tuesday ’s vote comes as the plastic bag industry , formally known as the Save the Plastic Bag Coalition , is fighting efforts to regulate its products .
The group filed a lawsuit last week challenging a Los Angeles County plan to reduce plastic bags about 30 % by 2010 .
Advertisement
Still , a lawyer for the coalition said that as long as the council ’s decision remains a policy and not a law , he sees no need for a legal fight .
“ Why challenge it ? ” asked coalition attorney Stephen Joseph .
“ It ’s not an ordinance . ”
The council also voted to require city agencies to stop purchasing polystyrene food containers starting next year .
The plastic bag ban was hailed by environmental groups , including Heal the Bay and the Surfrider Foundation .
Opponents warned the policy will have a devastating effect on the region ’s packaging companies .
Advertisement
“ When we start banning things and closing factories , where are the blue - collar workers going to go ? ” asked Anatolio Riegos , a Highland Park resident who works for Pactiv , a packaging company in the city of Industry that has roughly 1,300 workers .
City officials estimate that Los Angeles consumers use 2.3 billion plastic bags each year .
An estimated 5 % of plastic bags are recycled statewide , according to the city ’s Bureau of Sanitation .
The ban was proposed by Councilman Ed Reyes , who called plastic bags “ the graffiti of the L.A. River , ” which passes through his district .
Although the plan originally called for the bag ban to go into effect in 2012 , council members Janice Hahn and Richard Alarcon persuaded their colleagues to embrace an earlier deadline .
Advertisement
Alarcon said the council would eventually pass a law regulating plastic bags .
But for now , the council ’s vote is designed to persuade state lawmakers to impose a fee on them .
“ If they do n’t do [ a fee ] , then we do a ban , ” said Alarcon , who represents the northeast San Fernando Valley .
“ So yes , at some point there would be an ordinance . ”

FDIC Warns of More Bank Troubles
The government insures depositors when banks fail , but does it have enough cash ?
Aug. 26 , 2008  --
The health of U.S. banks is quickly deteriorating , and the government fund set up to protect depositors might not have enough money to insure everybody , analysts told ABCNews.com .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , or FDIC , insures bank deposits of up to $ 100,000 at nearly 8,500 of the nation 's banks and also keeps a watch list of banks that it considers in trouble .
Thanks to a collapsing housing market and a weak economy , a growing number of banks are struggling to stay afloat , with not enough cash on hand to cover losses from bad loans .
At the beginning of the year , 90 banks were on the FDIC watch list .
There are now 117 , FDIC chairwoman Sheila C. Bair announced at a news conference this afternoon .
That is the highest number in five years , but some analysts expect the list to grow even more in coming months .
" I think there 's going to be a steady drip , drip , drip of bad news , " said Sean Ryan , a banking analyst with Sterne Agee .
" We 've only seen the very tip of the iceberg in terms of bank failures . "
Sign Up for Our RSS Feed and Get the Latest Business Headlines From ABC News
Even though only nine banks have failed so far this year , Ryan expects that to quickly climb with more than 100 failures before the end of 2009 .
" I would be quite surprised if we did n't reach triple digits , " he said .
" Most of them are going to be relatively small institutions , but they will add up . "
" I fully expect the FDIC insurance fund to be depleted , " Ryan added .
" The FDIC is going to be one of what is going to be an increasing string of government bailouts . "
If that happens , ultimately taxpayers will be on the hook .
The FDIC borrows money with a line of credit from the U.S. Treasury , which essentially is taxpayer money .
Robert Reich , former secretary of labor under President Clinton , told ABC News that " it 's obvious to anyone who is following these numbers that our banking system is very weak right now . "
Reich , now a public policy professor at the University of California at Berkeley , said that while the situation is not a crisis , " it 's very serious . "
" How long will it be before this clears up ?
It could be another year at least , " Reich said .
" I do n't think we will see a huge number of bank failures , but undoubtedly as government oversight intensifies and capital requirements have to be met , some banks will be in trouble . "
" Probably between 10 and 25 small , mostly regional banks are treading water right now , " Reich added .
Some of those might cease operations , he said , " but depositors should have no problem at all " because of the FDIC insurance .
Reich said the chances of the FDIC completely depleting its reserve fund is " unlikely but certainly not impossible . "
Banks in Trouble
Profits at the 8,500 FDIC - insured banks fell by 86 percent in the second quarter of this year , the second lowest quarterly total since 1991 .
Many banks also lost money .
Almost 18 percent of all banks covered by the FDIC were unprofitable in the second quarter , up from 9.8 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
" By any yardstick , it was another rough quarter for bank earnings , " said the FDIC 's Bair .
The FDIC does n't publicize the names of the banks on its watch list .
The theory is :
If the list were disclosed , customers would pull their money out of the troubled banks , causing them to fail .
Taxpayers to the Rescue
Normally , when a bank fails there is adequate money to pay back depositors .
But since the start of the year , nine banks have been closed by the government , the largest being IndyMac on July 11 .
These banks had a combined $ 25 billion in assets , although the federal government is not on the hook for all of that money .
For instance , of IndyMac 's $ 19 billion in assets , about $ 1 billion in deposits were not insured , and the bank had enough other assets to pay back an additional $ 9.1 billion .
The FDIC estimated today that it would have to pay out $ 8.9 billion in insurance , up from previous estimates of $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion .
The FDIC , created in 1933 during the Great Depression to help restore the public 's confidence in the nation 's banking system , receives no federal tax dollars and is funded through the institutions that it insures .
Currently it has $ 50.2 billion set aside to cover bank failures , nearly 20 percent of which is likely to be depleted in the IndyMac insurance payback alone .
If a few more large banks -- or a lot of small banks -- fail , that fund could quickly become depleted .
Sean Egan , who heads the ratings desk of Egan Jones , sees more bank failures on the horizon but took a bit more conservative approach than Ryan .
" We would n't be surprised by another 15 banks , " failing before the end of the year , Egan said .
" But keep in mind , that many of them are smaller institutions . "
He said another half dozen or so could also fail next year .
Despite the lower estimate , Egan said that " absolutely " there is a chance that the FDIC could deplete its reserve fund .
" It would put a lot of pressure on the FDIC if another major bank were to fail , " he said .
Most Public Money Safe
When a bank fails , the FDIC has to pay money out to depositors immediately while it takes time to sell off the bank 's remaining assets to replenish those funds .
In that circumstance , Egan said , the Treasury might be forced to loan the FDIC money .
Ultimately though , Ryan said depositors with less than $ 100,000 in the bank have nothing to worry about .
" The reality is anybody who is within that threshold should n't lose any sleep at night , " he said .
" For all the kind of unjustifiable bailouts being done on Wall Street there 's no chance that the government is going to let John Q. Public 's money disappear . "
Keep Your Money Safe
The FDIC protects deposit accounts including checking and savings accounts , money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit up to the federal limit .
The insurance does not cover products such as stocks , bonds or mutual funds , even if they are sold by your bank .
The basic insurance protects up to $ 100,000 in deposits at each institution for each type of ownership category .
That means one individual could be insured for up to $ 100,000 for a single account and another $ 100,000 in a joint account with a spouse or somebody else .
There is also a separate $ 250,000 insurance limit for various types of retirement accounts , including IRAs , Section 457 plans and Keogh plans .
The type of account or bank branch makes no difference when calculating your insurance limit .
You do not double your insured amount by opening both a checking and savings account at a single bank or opening accounts at separate branches of the same bank .
Peter K Austin has published 11 books on minority and endangered languages , including 12 Australian Aboriginal languages , and holds the Märit Rausing Chair in field linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies where he is also director of the Endangered Languages Academic Programme .
His most recent book is 1000 Languages : The Worldwide History of Living and Lost Tongues , which explores the state of languages around the world .
Buy 1000 Languages from the Guardian bookshop
There are more than 6,900 languages used around the world today , ranging in size from those with hundreds of millions of speakers to those with only one or two .
Language experts now estimate that as many as half of the existing languages are endangered , and by the year 2050 they will be extinct .
The major reason for this language loss is that communities are switching to larger politically and economically more powerful languages , like English , Spanish , Hindi or Swahili .
Each language expresses the history , culture , society and identity of the people who speak it , and each is a unique way of talking about the world .
The loss of any language is a loss to both the community who use it in their daily lives , and to humankind in general .
The songs , stories , words , expressions and grammatical structures of languages developed over countless generations are part of the intangible heritage of all humanity .
So how to choose a top 10 from more than 3,000 endangered languages ?
My selection is a personal one that tries to take into account four factors : ( 1 ) geographical coverage - if possible I wanted at least one language from each continent ; ( 2 ) scientific interest - I wanted to include languages that linguists find interesting and important , because of their structural or historical significance ; ( 3 ) cultural interest - if possible some information about interesting cultural and political aspects of endangered languages should be included ; and ( 4 ) social impact - I wanted to include one or more situations showing why languages are endangered , as well as highlighting some of the ways communities are responding to the threat they currently face .
1. Jeru
Jeru ( or Great Andamanese ) is spoken by fewer than 20 people on the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean .
It is generally believed that Andamanese languages might be the last surviving languages whose history goes back to pre-Neolithic times in Southeast Asia and possibly the first settlement of the region by modern humans moving out of Africa .
The languages of the Andamans cannot be shown to be related to any other languages spoken on earth .
2. N|u ( also called Khomani )
This is a Khoisan language spoken by fewer than 10 elderly people whose traditional lands are located in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa .
The Khoisan languages are remarkable for having click sounds – the | symbol is pronounced like the English interjection tsk !
tsk ! used to express pity or shame .
The closest relative of N|u is !
Xóõ ( also called Ta'a and spoken by about 4,000 people ) which has the most sounds of any language on earth : 74 consonants , 31 vowels , and four tones ( voice pitches ) .
3. Ainu
The Ainu language is spoken by a small number of old people on the island of Hokkaido in the far north of Japan .
They are the original inhabitants of Japan , but were not recognised as a minority group by the Japanese government until this year .
The language has very complicated verbs that incorporate a whole sentence 's worth of meanings , and it is the vehicle of an extensive oral literature of folk stories and songs .
Moves are underway to revive Ainu language and cultural practices .
4 . Thao
Sun Moon
Lake of central Taiwan is the home of the Thao language , now spoken by a handful of old people while the remainder of the community speaks Taiwanese Chinese ( Minnan ) .
Thao is an Austronesian language related to languages spoken in the Philippines , Indonesia and the Pacific , and represents one of the original communities of the Austronesians before they sailed south and east over 3,000 years ago .
5. Yuchi
Yuchi is spoken in Oklahoma , USA , by just five people all aged over 75 .
Yuchi is an isolate language ( that is , it can not be shown to be related to any other language spoken on earth ) .
Their own name for themselves is Tsoyaha , meaning " Children of the Sun " .
Yuchi nouns have 10 genders , indicated by word endings : six for Yuchi people ( depending on kinship relations to the person speaking ) , one for non -Yuchis and animals , and three for inanimate objects ( horizontal , vertical , and round ) .
Efforts are now under way to document the language with sound and video recordings , and to revitalise it by teaching it to children .
6. Oro Win
The Oro Win live in western Rondonia State , Brazil , and were first contacted by outsiders in 1963 on the headwaters of the Pacaas Novos River .
The group was almost exterminated after two attacks by outsiders and today numbers just 50 people , only five of whom still speak the language .
Oro
Win is one of only five languages known to make regular use of a sound that linguists call " a voiceless dental bilabially trilled affricate " .
In rather plainer language , this means it 's produced with the tip of the tongue placed between the lips which are then vibrated ( in a similar way to the brrr sound we make in English to signal that the weather is cold ) .
7. Kusunda
The Kusunda are a former group of hunter - gatherers from western Nepal who have intermarried with their settled neighbours .
Until recently it was thought that the language was extinct but in 2004 scholars at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu located eight people who still speak the language .
Another isolate , with no connections to other languages .
8. Ter Sami
This is the easternmost of the Saami group of languages ( formerly called Lapp , a derogatory term ) , located on the Kola Peninsula in Russia .
It is spoken by just 10 elderly people among approximately 100 ethnic Ter Sami who all now speak Russian as their daily language .
Ter Sami is related to Finnish and other Uralic languages spoken in Russia and Siberia , and distantly to Hungarian .
9. Guugu Yimidhirr
Guugu Yimidhirr is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken at Hopevale near Cooktown in northern Queensland by around 200 people .
A wordlist was collected by Captain James Cook in 1770 and it has given English ( and the rest of the world 's languages ) the word kangaroo .
Guugu Yimidhirr ( like some other Aboriginal languages ) is remarkable for having a special way of speaking to certain family members ( like a man 's father - in - law or brother - in - law ) in which everyday words are replaced by completely different special vocabulary .
For example , instead of saying bama dhaday for " the man is going " you must say yambaal bali when speaking to these relatives as a mark of respect and politeness .
10 . Ket
Ket is the last surviving member of a family of languages spoken along the Yenesei River in eastern Siberia .
Today there are around 600 speakers but no children are learning it since parents prefer to speak to them in Russian .
Ket is the only Siberian language with a tone system where the pitch of the voice can give what sound like identical words quite different meanings .
( Much like Chinese or Yoruba ) .
To add to the difficulty for any westerner wishing to learn it , it also has extremely complicated word structure and grammar .
Yesterday 's CD post of a graph of 1,000 gallons of gas as a percent of per-capita disposable income ( top graph above ) shows that we 're still nowhere near record highs for gasoline , when measured as a share of income .
Warren Meyer at Coyote Blog thoughtfully suggested adjusting the analysis to account for the significant increases in fuel efficiency over time , see middle chart above , which shows the 64 % increase in fuel efficiency from the early 1980s to 2005 .
The bottom graph above shows the results of Warren 's analysis ( see his chart here ) , which calculates the percent of per-capita disposable income required to buy enough gasoline to drive 15,000 miles , at the average fuel efficiency in each month from 1980 to 2008 .
This adjustment for increased fuel efficiency makes the initial results even more dramatic .
After adjusting for : a ) higher incomes and b ) greater fuel efficiency since 1980 , we are nowhere near record highs for gas .
In fact , to match the 13.75 % level in 1980 when average fuel efficiency was only 16 mpg ( and gas was $ 1.26 per gallon and per-capita disposable income was $ 8,575 ) , gasoline today would have to reach $ 7.53 per gallon , almost twice today 's prices !
Bottom Line : Gas prices today are almost 50 % below the record highs of 1980 , after adjusting for higher incomes today and much greater fuel efficiency .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Japan 's government downgraded Wednesday its assessment of the economy to " worsening , " acknowledging that the expansion that 's run more than six years -- the nation 's longest in its postwar history -- may have ended .
The leading coincident index , which tracks various economic data , fell to a reading of 101.7 in June from 103.3 in May , the Cabinet Office said .
The index of lagging indicators , which measures economic performance in the recent past , also fell , slipping to 102.3 from 103.4 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans buying food for their Fourth of July cookout will be paying more , the nation ’s largest farm group said on Wednesday , with prices up 8.5 percent from this time last year .
An informal survey conducted by the American Farm Bureau Federation in May showed much of the increase occurred during the second quarter , when the cost of 16 grocery items -- including apples , pork chops and oat cereal -- was $ 46.67 , up about 3.5 percent , or $ 1.64 , from the first quarter .
“ Prices of many food items continue to creep upward , ” Jim Sartwelle , a Farm Bureau economist , said .
“ Those increases , however , pale in comparison to the huge increases in energy costs -- for fuel , natural gas , and electricity -- that American families have become accustomed to over the past two or three years , ” he added .
Food prices rose for 14 of the 16 items , with much of the increase fueled by tight supplies of grains and oilseeds worldwide .
Cooking oil and bacon showed the largest retail price increases , with a 32 - oz.
bottle of corn oil up 47 cents at $ 3.48 and one pound of bacon increasing 22 cents to $ 3.57 .
The only items that posted a decrease were a dozen large eggs , down 34 cents at $ 1.82 , and a pound of cheddar cheese , which declined 11 cents to $ 4.60 .
The Farm Bureau , which represents livestock and crop producers , said farmers received just under $ 8.90 of the total $ 46.67 cost of the basket of products .
That was a decline from the first quarter , when farmers got about $ 10 of the $ 45 basket .
A total of 87 volunteer shoppers in 36 states participated in the latest survey .
Higher feed and energy costs are driving up beef and poultry prices at grocery stores across the country , the U.S. Agriculture Department said last month .
Food prices will rise by 5 percent this year , according to USDA , marking the sharpest increase since 1990 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department inspector general Thursday blasted the security of U.S. passport files , saying the repeated access of over 100 celebrities ' files had gone undetected and unpunished .
The State Department inspector general blasted the passport system 's lax security .
Harold Geisel , the department 's acting inspector general , launched the investigation after the department admitted in March that the files of three presidential candidates -- Sens. Hillary Clinton , John McCain and Barack Obama -- had been breached .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called them to apologize .
On Thursday , in a heavily redacted report , the inspector general revealed that a test showed the files of at least 127 famous persons had been accessed repeatedly , although it was unclear whether the access was authorized .
Geisel tested the passport system 's security by reviewing the files of 150 famous individuals consisting of musicians , athletes and movie , television and media personalities .
The inspector general developed the list by reviewing the most searched names on Google in 2006 and 2007 , Forbes magazine 's top 100 celebrities and 400 richest individuals and Sports Illustrated 's 50 highest paid athletes .
The report suggested an overhaul in how the department protects the information and follows up on any breaches .
" OIG [ Office of the Attorney General ] found many control weaknesses -- including a general lack of policies , procedures , guidance , and training -- relating to the prevention and detection of unauthorized access to passport and applicant information and the subsequent response and disciplinary processes when a potential unauthorized access is substantiated , " the report said .
" In some cases , department officials stated that the lack of resources contributed to the lack of controls and to the department 's ability to assess vulnerabilities and risk , " Geisel wrote .
The inspector general 's report suggests the State Department follow privacy procedures already used by the Social Security Administration , the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies .
Sen .
Joe Biden , D - Delaware , called the report " deeply disturbing . "
Biden is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee , which oversees the State Department 's operations and funding .
" The inspector general found that there were ' many weaknesses ' in the State Department 's passport records system , including a general lack of policies , training and procedures to prevent , detect or punish the kind of illegal passport file breaches that occurred earlier this year .
This is unacceptable , " he said in a written statement .
" The report makes it clear that the private information of over 100 million Americans is vulnerable to unauthorized access .
I urge Secretary [ of State ]
Rice to act promptly on the inspector general 's recommendations and correct these system - wide failures . "

NRA fights to allow guns at Disney World Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Walt Disney World , backed by the Florida Retail Federation and the Florida Chamber of Commerce , has sparked a row with state lawmakers and the National Rifle Association over Florida 's " Preservation and Protection of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms in Motor Vehicles Act of 2008 , " enacted July 1 , which allows employees with concealed weapons permits to store their guns in their cars during work hours .
Disney maintains its zero - tolerance policy towards guns , warning that taking a gun onto company property could be grounds for termination .
Disney 's Animal Kingdom security guard Edwin Sotomayor , accordingly , was fired on Monday following a Friday suspension ; Sotomayor had announced to local media that he would be storing a gun in his car in accordance with the law but in violation of Disney 's policy .
He refused to let his employer search the car .
" It seems if you work for Disney , " the NRA said on its website , " you give up not only your Second Amendment rights , but your First Amendment rights as well . "
Tampa's Busch Gardens Africa and three Anheuser - Busch - owned parks in Orlando cite their employees ' Second Amendment rights in accepting the new law , the Orlando Sentinel reported , while continuing to prohibit guns inside the parks themselves .
Universal Orlando , to the contrary , claims exemption from the law because the park houses the Universal Education Center , staffed by Orange County Public Schools , and they are " required to follow school district policies . "
State Rep. Stan Mayfield , who helped pass the law , insisted that it was meant to safeguard workers '
Second Amendment rights , and that the guns would be inside locked cars , and not inside the theme park itself .
He disagreed with Disney 's claim that they were entitled to an exemption written into the law for employers that " deal in explosive materials , " saying that the language was meant for companies that transported and handled explosives , not " a theme park that happens to be launching fireworks on the other side of their property . "
Mayfield also denied to MSNBC's Dan Abrams that the coalition of lawyers that lobbied him and his colleagues for the exemption were actually representing Disney .
" I 'd say hooray for Disney here , " said Brian Siebel of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .
" Thank goodness the Magical Kingdom ( sic ) does n't want to have guns on its property , and is willing to fight for that . "
" I have kids , " he continued .
" I like to go to Disney World , I like to take them there .
And I 'll really have to think twice if 60,000 employees of Disney can bring guns to work every day . "
Siebel noted the June 25 incident in which a press operator at a Kentucky plastics plant , after arguing with his supervisor , pulled out a gun and shot the supervisor and four coworkers before committing suicide .
Interpreting the new Florida law to allow Disney 's employees to keep guns in their cars during work hours , he said , could facilitate a scenario much the same .
Siebel asked : " How are [ Disney ] going to protect those people if they can't decide who gets to have guns on their property ? "
Siebel also disagreed with Rep. Mayfield that the law 's requirement to hold a concealed weapons license made it a " higher standard . "
" I have a list of hundreds of concealed carry licensees in Florida who have committed crimes all the way from rape to robbery to murder , " Siebel countered .
" Just having a concealed carry license in Florida does not mean you 're a law - abiding citizen . "
The accompanying video , with an exchange between Rep. Mayfield and Mr. Siebel , was broadcast on MSNBC's Verdict with Dan Abrams on July 7 , 2008 .

This is in response to the " Who 's the creepiest person you 've gamed with ? " thread .
While it 's a great thread ( and very fun to read , in a horrific sort of way ) , I wanted to hear the other side .
I want to know about the niceset , coolest , most fun gamer ( or group ) you 've had the distinct pleasure of playing with .
For example , one of the coolest people I 've ever played with was my grandma .
No , really .
This was back in the mid-70's , when AD&D had just come out in hardback .
I thought these books were the best things on the planet , but I could n't find anybody to play with .
The game was simply too new .
Anyway , one day my mom had dropped me off at my grandma's for the day , and I was bored and fussy as eight - year - olds are wont to be on a Saturday in July .
I had my game books with me and was leafing through them when my grandma asked about them .
I tried my best to explain role - playing to her , and she asked if she could play .
I was so stunned that she wanted to play a game that my jaw actually dropped open .
So I whipped up a character for her and took her on the classicdungeoncrawl .
What gets me is , to this day , she was one of the best players I 've ever known .
This daffy little woman , who rocked in a chair and knitted blankets , who was born in 1910 fer chrissakes , was an excellent roleplayer and a power - gamer to boot .
One of my favorite memories was when her character , after taking out a handful of orcs , found the last orc on his knees and begging for mercy .
Without looking up from her knitting , she said " I finish him off , dear .
" God , I miss her .
So , who are yours ?

The PageRank algorithm that first set Google on a path to glory measures the importance of a page in the world wide web .
It ’s fair to say that an entire field of study has grown up around the analysis of its behaviour .
That field looks set for a shake up following the publication today of an entirely new formulation of the problem of ranking web pages .
Nicola Perra at the University of Cagliari in Italy and colleagues have discovered that when they re-arrange the terms in the PageRank equation the result is a Schroedinger - like wave equation .
So what , I hear you say , that ’s just a gimmick .
Perhaps , but the significance is that it immediately allows the entire mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics to be brought to bear on the problem–that ’s 80 years of toil and sweat .
Perra and pals point out some of the obvious advantages and disadvantages of the new formulation .
First , every webpage has a quantum - like potential .
The topology of this potential gives the spatial distribution of PageRank throughout the web .
What ’s more , this distribution can be calculated in a straightforward way which does not require iteration as the conventional PageRank algorithm does .
So the PageRank can be calculated much more quickly for relatively small webs and the team has done a simple analysis of the PageRanking of the .eu domain in this way .
However , Perra admits that the iterative method would probably be quicker when working with the tens of billions of pages that make up the entire web .
But the great promise of this Schroedinger - like approach is something else entirely .
What the wave equation allows is a study of the dynamic behaviour of PageRanking , how the rankings change and under what conditions .
One of the key tools for this is called perturbation theory .
It ’s no understatement to say that perturbation theory revolutionised our understanding of the universe when it was applied to quantum theory in the 1920s and 1930s .
The promise is that it could do the same to our understanding of the web and if so , this field is in for an interesting few years ahead .

Ach .
That floppy hair , and that sodding bicycle .
Has any man ever before managed to persuade such a huge number of people that he was a decent chap on two such flimsy , trivial , irrelevant , modish pieces of ephemera ?
Never mind what a laughing stock we ’d be , internationally , if we elected Boris Johnson as mayor .
Never mind what a mess he ’d make of the whole thing , how unproven he is in anything beyond having a big gob , never mind that if we think Ken Livingstone lives high on the taxi hog , God alone knows what this moneyed creep would get up to .
Never mind all that for the moment .
Let ’s just concentrate on this myth of his being a nice guy .
He is not a nice guy .
Two mistakes we make about Boris : the first is that , because he says “ unacceptable ” things , then he must be honest ; he must be outside the airless bubble of PC .
This is bilge .
He is no more honest than any other philanderer before him .
He has lied flagrantly , flamboyantly , to save his marriage , and given how little else he ’s prepared to do for it , one must conclude that he does n’t put a very great premium on telling the truth .
So if he gives out these apparently harsh truths about gay people or Liverpudlians or the people of Congo , it is not because the fire of truth burns so brightly within him that he ca n’t snuff it out .
It is because he genuinely despises these people .
He despises gays and he despises provincials ( you are all right with Boris if you come from Liverpool but do n’t sound like a Liverpudlian .
Once you ’ve been to public school , then you are from postcode POSH ) , and he despises Africans .
He despises them , and he despises those of us who would hold such judgments to be bigoted and inhuman .
Am I being unfair ?
Let ’s recap - he pooh - poohed gay marriage with an assessment that was actually pretty droll , but contained within it , of course , total derision for the outlandish idea that you might be homosexual and also have feelings of love and permanence .
“ If gay marriage was OK - and I was uncertain on the issue - then I saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men , as well as two men ; or indeed three men and a dog . ”
OK , at this point , maybe he ’s just saying it for a laugh .
Maybe he does n’t mean it .
That would be fine , except he does mean it .
As recently as 2000 - he was n’t just some young man in a hurry , trying to make a point about Clause 28 to curry Thatcher ’s favour - he was on about “ The essence of that Tory case is unchanged ... it is more sensitive to spare parents ’ anxieties than to allow leftwing local authorities to waste taxpayers ’ money on idiotic and irrelevant homosexual instruction . ”
Irrelevant homosexual instruction ?
He would have us believe that , conversely , the Labour party wants children to give up maths and concentrate on gay sex ?
Come on !
He has all the mendacity , the slyness , the patronising sleight of hand that the Daily Mail spews out , only he does n’t seem so outright unpleasant , because of ... that sodding hair and that poxing bicycle .
His views on Liverpool were remarkable only because they led to his sacking ; I ’ll wager he feels the same about anywhere that is n’t Mayfair or the Highlands , pretty much .
His line on Africa he gave out in 2002 , when Blair visited Congo : “ No doubt , ” he said , “ the AK47s will fall silent and the pangas will stop their hacking of human flesh , and the tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles to see the big white chief touch down in his big white British taxpayer - funded bird . ”
It ought to beggar belief , ought n’t it ?
Not that this self - satisfied creature of privilege should hold such views , but that he should be able to spout them and then have us all instantly forget about it .
What are we , idiots ?
The second mistake , by the way , is to think he singles out any one group for his casual bile .
It ’s not just gay people or Muslims or Africans , it ’s not just people from Portsmouth or indeed anywhere else on the south coast .
He despises people who are not of his class because he is a snob .
That , pretty much , means all of us .
A snob ’s London is a Monday - to - Thursday kind of affair , behind fusty doors , in clubs that only just let women in , let alone plebs , in restaurants that do n’t have prices on the menus , in the Regency offices of magazines whose only distinction is that all the staff are shagging each other .
They disappear to the country at weekends , then come back muttering on Monday about how the poor generate litter .
That is not London .
I ’m not going to do some New Labour drum - roll about creativity and youth and multiculturalism , since we do n’t need it .
We know what London is .
Boris is not London .

“ Boris has as little knowledge of multiculturalism as I have of life on Jupiter .
He used to go to this club in Oxford called the Bullingdon Club , full of snobs and creative conmen .
The man has not only no physical ability to run anything , he is immoral and a bully .
Boris as mayor would be like discovering you had piles and there was no cure for it . ”

“ Boris as mayor ?
Unthinkable .
It just exposes democracy as a sham , especially if people do n’t vote for Ken - he ’s the best thing in politics .
Unthinkable . ”
Ossie Blake , 48
Housing officer
“ Apart from the fact that Boris is a buffoon and I think he ’s racist , he has n’t had experience of running things and he ’s not a true Londoner .
I do n’t think he ’s supported London issues during his time as an MP .
Even in suburban parts of London there is a real shortage of affordable housing .
The Conservative - controlled local authorities in London have been fighting Ken over his affordable housing policy , but where is the social housing going to come from if it ’s not from that ?
It would probably be taken to bits if Boris comes in . ”
Will Self
Novelist
“ If Johnson were elected ?
I ’d feel that he had neither the acumen nor the gravitas to resist becoming the teddy bear of the 4x4 - driving , Laura Ashley headscarf - wearing , inherently inegalitarian and snobbish denizens of Chelsea .
I ’d feel that we had a buffoon as mayor instead of a reptile , and whatever my disagreements with Livingstone - and they are legion - at least he understands what a swamp this city is . ”
Roy Cumberbatch , 40
Businessman
“ I have n’t been voting for a while but I ’m going to vote for Ken .
It ’s quite scary that Boris could get in .
It would be like going back to the days of Thatcher with Boris - promises , promises , but no one does anything about it .
I ’m quite a positive person and I am born and bred here but I ’m afraid that London is a racist place .
Someone verbalising it out there in the open like Boris did is only going to make things more unbalanced .
If he is mayor , it ’s going to make it 10 times worse . ”
Bonnie Greer
Writer
“ Boris Johnson in the role of mayor would feel like being trapped on the set of The Wizard of Oz minus the soundtrack and the Technicolor .
His election would be the ultimate triumph of the Kensington and Chelsea gulag and the Bullingdon Ascendancy .
Please , London .
I moved from New York City , for God ’s sake , to live among you .
Do n’t choose the clown ! ”
Daniel , 42
Office manager
“ In Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , there is a scene where a character is talking about another who is a card player and he ’s described as ‘ a fucking liability ’ .
That ’s my idea of Boris .
The mouth engages before the mind does .
He does n’t have any sense of diplomacy or tact .
London is a cosmopolitan city .
You ca n’t have someone who makes quotes like that [ Johnson ’s “ piccaninnies ” comment ] representing London , regardless of the fact it was in the past [ Johnson wrote the comment in 2002 ] .
Of all the things people say about Ken , in my view he ’s done a lot for London .
When you go into the city it looks like a European capital now with all the regeneration , and it did n’t before .
Trafalgar Square is a much more welcoming place . ”

“ Everyone who thought he ’s quite a funny chap will have a bit of a realisation if we wake up on Friday with Boris as mayor .
I used to enjoy watching him cycling through London without his helmet , but he is just a massive Tory .
A lot of young people are entertained by Boris but he does n’t say anything of substance .
He ’s someone you ’d want to invite round to dinner and laugh at - not someone you ’d want in charge of London .
He would n’t do anything to help the fact that no one can afford to live anywhere in London , even if you have a reasonably all right job . ”
Arabella Weir
Actor and writer
“ I will go on hunger strike and throw myself in front of the next horse at Ascot if he wins .
Failing that I was going to say I ’ll sleep with him , but he ’d probably say yes .
So instead I ’ll chain myself to the railings of his house .
And then I ’ll move out of London .
How do we trust a guy who says he knows about London , when he ’s just taken three of his kids out of state school and put them into private schools ?
That ’s a man in touch with the people .
He ’s loathsome .
He ’s everything that ’s wrong with the upper classes at their worst .
Limited , pompous , without any breadth of vision or sense of inclusion .
But I do n’t even think he thinks he ’s up to the job .
He said it for a laugh , is my guess , and now he ’s got to go through with it . ”
Sky Lafoucade , 37
Race and welfare officer
“ I would be really upset if Boris got in .
He ’s made a lot of racist comments and he ’s just not for the working class .
I ca n’t believe people would vote for someone who makes racist comments at a time when we should all be coming together .
I love the diversity in London , the mix of cultures .
Ken has done a lot for London .
I do n’t like the congestion charge , but it has cut down pollution .
I have never done this before , but this week I have been handing out flyers to support Ken .
Boris has been very active , but people are not hearing what he ’s saying - even if you are n’t black , the stuff he says is wrong .
It ’s as if he does n’t care . ”
Blake Morrison
Writer
“ I ’m about to go to Australia and if Boris gets in maybe I ’ll stay there .
If London ’s cleaner , friendlier , better run and more integrated than it used to be , that ’s partly down to the current mayor .
What will Boris do to it ?
His policies are vague , but past views he has expressed on race and gay marriage inspire no confidence .
And the contempt he once showed for the inhabitants of another British city , Liverpool , should rule him out of running this one .
All he ’s got going for him is fun straw hair and toffish insouciance .
London deserves something more serious . ”
Peter Kerr , 80
Clapham
“ Boris should be in a three - ring circus .
He ’s a clown .
I like him but I do n’t think he ’s serious enough for the job .
There ’s too much personality and not enough on policy .
If you ask a question that ’s important , they seem evasive all the time .
He ca n’t be a mug , but he does n’t seem to take anything seriously . ”
Inayat Bunglawala
Muslim Council of Britain
“ I ’m supposed to be nonpartisan but I think a win for Boris would cause great concern in the Muslim community .
Despite all his idiosyncrasies , Ken is widely respected as a longstanding anti-racist campaigner and for his welcoming attitude to all minority groups .
Boris , on the other hand , has caused a lot of concern , particularly in his writing - he has described Islam , in his own words , as “ the most viciously sectarian of all religions ” .
I just do n’t think that sentiment is one you expect from the mayor of a city as diverse as London .
The role of a mayor must be to bring people together , but Boris does n’t seem to have the touch , the common sense , to do that . ”
Ron Bennett , 58
Schoolbus driver
“ Boris is mad .
He wants to bring back bus conductors , but that ’s never going to happen .
I think he talks rubbish .
He ’s out of touch and he does n’t understand Londoners .
People say Ken is obnoxious , but what can you do ?
One thing about him is he knows London . ”
Charlie Brooker
Guardian columnist
“ I ’d sooner vote for a dog than Boris Johnson .
Cartoon characters should only run cartoon cities .
You can indicate a second preference , so it ’s Paddick or Livingstone or no one .
Do n’t toss London to a rightwing moron , no matter how funny you find his bumbling persona . ”

“ If two years ago someone had told me Boris Johnson stood a good chance of being elected mayor of London , I ’d have pissed myself laughing .
But we have learned , through seeing George Bush in the US , that you can be a buffoon and also be a very destructive and a malign force politically .
Johnson does n’t have a strong instinct for a city that ’s as multicultural as London .
He ’s not an inclusive politician in that way . ”

“ If Boris gets in I will be very unhappy .
As amusing as he may appear , for someone from an ethnic minority , I do n’t appreciate his comments [ on race ] and you ca n’t whitewash them away .
I felt extremely offended by his comments on black children - you ca n’t take things like that out of context .
He ’s got away with insulting the black community because it ’s not powerful enough and there ’s so much negative reporting about black people in the media .
I love London - whenever I go away I miss it .
This is my home and where I was born .
I love the diversity of London .
It used to be diverse in different places , but now it ’s all over .
I love the colour of London .
I love everything about being a Londoner !
The people who would benefit under Boris would be rich people - and mainly rich white people . ”

“ I like Boris as an individual - I would go for a drink with him .
But as someone who is going to run something for us ?
I do n’t think so !
If he got in , I would laugh and think ‘ What ’s going on ? ’
If he gets in , I think the cost of living will go up .
There will be less stuff for youngsters to do .
There will be more stop and search .
He ca n’t seem to help himself on race - I do n’t think he ’s racist , he ’s just had a privileged upbringing and does n’t get what he ’s saying .
I like the people in London , and the fact it ’s very multicultural - that ’s a great thing .
I think bring everyone in !
I do n’t think that will change because of one individual , but he will make things harder . ”

“ As a human rights campaigner who is concerned about climate change , I am personally supporting Ken Livingstone for Mayor of London .
He is committed to addressing the impending climate change disaster .
I regard him as a ‘ Mayor for Peace ’ : he opposed the war in Iraq and he opposes nuclear weapons .
He does n’t make decisions because they are popular , but because he feels they are morally right . ”

“ As a person I do n’t think Boris is sympathetic , and what he says is ridiculous .
London is an alive and inspiring city to be part of and Ken has a record of supporting arts and culture here .
It ’s not my impression that Boris would do that .
I think this may suffer if he gets in .
And the congestion in London would get worse . ”

“ If Boris loses , that will be bad news for David Cameron .
But if he wins it will be much worse news , because the Boris campaign has shown that without the jokes there is nothing there .
He just ca n’t do seriousness and responsibility .
So with two years to go before the next election , Boris will have had more than enough time to demonstrate his lack of bottom ; a demonstration which will call into question the whole Cameron - a horse from the same lightweight stable - enterprise , rather as - for a very different reason - it would have discredited the whole Blair enterprise if Gordon Brown had been sent in to bat first . ”

In terms of doing something for the greater good of the capital , Livingstone is the best suited . ”

“ If I woke up and Boris Johnson was mayor I ’d want to give Ken Livingstone a big kick up the arse because it ’s all his fault .

“ I ’ve traditionally voted Tory but in this election I ’ll vote green , just because I do n’t agree with Boris ’s environmental policies .

“ If Boris got in , I ’d be petrified .
When I read what Boris seems to stand for , it ’s clear to me that someone of my background means little or nothing to him .
His comments have crystallised for me that he ’s no good for multicultural London , which Ken has done a lot for .
As a musician and someone who ’s watching what ’s going on in the world politically , I ’m happier with giving Ken another chance than I ever would be letting a joker like Johnson get in . ”
Kathleen Streifeneder , 36
“ I ’m not at all pro-Boris .
I ’ve seen real improvement on the buses and public transport since Ken Livingstone became mayor .
When I came here from New Mexico eight years ago , public transport in London was terrible - there used to be huge queues to buy tickets on the tube .
Boris is not the right image for London - all that he represents through his accent , his upbringing , the fact he ’s a Conservative .
He wo n’t do a lot of good for normal Londoners , people who have been getting by OK with Ken .
Boris would represent the people in Kensington and Chelsea , but not normal Londoners . ”
Kwame Kwei Armah

“ If Boris were elected , I ’d feel confused .
I would find it challenging that we so willingly condescend to America , and laugh that someone like George Bush could be made president , and then elect someone who is willing to play the buffoon to run one of the most important capitals in the world . ”
Adam Blencowe , 27
“ I ’m worried .
I ’m worried about Boris ’s environmental policies .
I enjoy him personally , but I ’m not confident about him as a politician .
I ’m not sure it ’s right to have a Conservative in charge of a city like London .
He ’s made numerous gaffes .
He ’s MP for Henley - London is a very different set - up . ”
Dave Rowntree

“ It ’s hard to know what a Boris victory might mean for London because all he offers are vague , uncosted , headline - grabbing policies .
He says he ’ll cut crime , but how ?
He says he ’ll tackle immigration , but his proposal is to have a debate - well , what the hell does he think is happening at the moment ?
The upshot for London could be disaster : he can’t possibly do what he says he ’s going to do because he ’s got no clue as to how he ’s going to do it .
It ’s all part of his programme to come across as some bumbling , lovable moptop , but the reality is he ’s a rightwinger posing as a moderate and that ’s very dangerous for London . ”

• This article was amended on 16 June 2016 .
An earlier version attributed the following quote to Johnson , writing in the Telegraph in 2005 : “ Gay marriage can only ever be a ludicrous parody of the real thing . ”
In fact the quote was from a Telegraph column by Tom Utley .
Sorry to be a little late to the party on the Fannie / Freddie debacle ; I managed to burn my right middle finger rather spectacularly last night on a pot handle , and though JP Freire , the American Spectator 's MacGyver - like managing editor , rapidly sped to the rescue with a silicone oven mitt full of ice , typing is still somewhat slow .
Back to Fannie and Freddie .
For those who have n't been following along at home , last night , in another " Sunday Save " , the Fed and Treasury announced that they stand ready to bail them out .
For years , there 's been a moderately lively debate over whether Fannie and Freddie 's status as Government Sponsored Entities ( GSEs ) means that the government has implicitly guaranteed their portfolios .
Those who have wasted hours arguing this burning question in the nation 's bars and debating clubs can settle up your bets and argue no more : it does indeed .
As Clive Crook says :
US taxpayers are about to find out what their long - standing and ( strictly speaking ) non-existent guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will cost them .
One way to think of it is this : take the US national debt of roughly $ 9,000bn and add $ 5,000bn .
Not bad for an obligation still officially denied .
Steven Bainbridge adds :
Fannie and Freddie should have been fully privatized years ago , so that they were subject to market competition ; alternatively , although less ideally , they should have been brought back into the government to be regulated more effectively .
Leach was right that leaving them as they were was a disaster waiting to happen .
And now it looms larger than ever , with potential disastrous implications . . .
Want a worst case scenario ?
The government takes over Fannie and Freddie .
The immense increase in the national debt causes the bond rating agencies to cut their rating of Treasury securities from their traditional AAA .
Along with other economic problems ( whether its mostly whining or not ) , this spooks investors , especially foreign investors .
Foreigners abandon the dollar for the euro , dumping treasuries .
The collapse of foreign investment in Treasuries makes our massive current account deficit unsustainable .
At which point , things really go to pot .
All because our leaders in Washington failed on a bipartisan basis to address the problems at Fannie and Freddie .
Why did n;t they do something ?
Because Fannie and Freddie bribed them and because they ’re petrified of being painted as anti-consumer , as even the Times finally noticed . . .
Arnold Kling also has some rather pungent commentary :
1 . For some reason , I am reminded of a Vaudeville scene in which firemen are squirting hoses at the set to try to put out an apparent fire , and management comes out on stage to say , " Do n't worry , folks .
It 's all part of the act . "
My point is that it 's very important at this time for people like Treasury Secretary Paulson and Fed Chairman Bernanke to make it seem like they know what they are doing .
2 . It seems as though nobody wants to admit that the FM's are done for .
Yet the new proposal on the table to have the government back more of the firms ' debt and perhaps buy equity is so radical that I have to assume that there is no returning to the status quo .
3 . If you could do it over again from a regulatory perspective , you would want to see the FM 's market shares a lot lower and the market shares of other institutions , notably banks , a lot higher .
I have to assume that this will be the thrust of policy going forward .
It 's just not something that is going to happen tomorrow .
4 . I used to work at Freddie Mac , in the late 80's and early 90's .
Back then , the capital regulations gave the FM's an advantage over banks in holding low - risk mortgages .
We understood that , and we stuck to low - risk lending .
As times changed , and the market shifted to high - risk loans , it would have been logical for the FM's to say , " This is not our market , " and allow their market shares to drop .
But top management , at least at Freddie , is pretty green ( I 'm not sure they could spell " mortgage " when they took over in 2003 .
When friends of mine described the behavior of the new management team , I decided to sell my Freddie Mac stock .
This was at least four years ago . ) .
Between that and government pressure to provide " affordable housing , " the FM 's decided that they needed to get on the subprime bandwagon rather than stop it .
5 . A fundamental debate in economics is between central planning and the spontaneous order of the market .
The collapse of the FM's , and of the housing market in general , can be viewed as a failure of central planning .
Unfortunately , the dynamics are such that when central planning fails , you typically get more central planning .
In my view , the central problems with FM / FM are two :
1 ) Because they are government sponsored , the government let them get away with practices that would never fly in the private market .
Contrary to the belief of many on the left , this is par for the course ; just take a look at what 's happening to state and local government pensions now that the federal government has forced them to account for their liabilities like normal pension funds do .
2 ) They are too big not to fail .
Their mortgage portfolios cover so much of the market that any significant problems in the mortgage market will make them technically insolvent as soon as they mark their securities to market .
Any attempt to clean up their portfolios , by , for example , selling off some of their underperforming securities , will move the MBS markets against them , making the problem worse .
It 's not clear that bringing them fully into the government is even a second - or third - best solution ; the government is not set up to be a hedge fund , nor should it be .
Once the immediate crisis is over , it 's time to strip their GSE status and break the companies up into less risky firms .
Of course , that 's easy for me to say , sitting here on my couch in my comfy pajamas .
Actually doing this is going to be a monstrous messy task .
Some audio- equipment makers and producers fear trouble if Google pushes ahead with plans to petition the FCC to open up a part of the radio spectrum know as " white space . "
Courtesy aaronescobar / flickr Cross one off the list of Google 's friends .
Wireless audio-equipment manufacturers and producers of live events are up in arms against Google 's efforts to open up a little - used patch of radio spectrum .
What 's being contested is the so - called " white space " spectrum , the vacant bands between ultra- high frequency television channels .
As U.S. broadcasters transition from analog to digital transmission in time to meet the February 2009 deadline imposed by the Federal Communications Commission , the unused spectrum has become a battleground , pitting not just audio professionals but organizations such as the National Football League , movie studios and Broadway producers against Google .
Google turned up the heat Monday by launching a " Free the Airwaves " campaign with a website and a petition lobbying the FCC to open up the spectrum .
" Remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old TVs ? " says the site .
" Today more than three - quarters of those radio airwaves , or ' white space ' spectrum , are completely unused .
This vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds , including universal wireless Internet . "
But for audio - equipment manufacturers and live sound producers , the fuzzy static is their meal ticket .
" We are worried the FCC will buckle and allow white space to be used by personal portable devices seeking wireless services , " says Karl Winkler , director of business development for Lectrosonics , a manufacturer of wireless professional audio systems .
The result , say audio industry professionals , could be disastrous .
Wireless audio equipment could face significant interference from personal devices searching for wireless connectivity on the spectrum already being used by high - end audio equipment .
" The radio frequency environment is going to become more crowded and more difficult to use , " says Mike Torlone , director of marketing services at AKG Acoustics , a division of audio - equipment manufacturer Harman International .
That could potentially lead to loss of signal and interruptions in transmissions , and could force audio producers and production managers to change the way they do business , say experts .
" In that case the number of wireless microphones used will be reduced significantly and it cost big productions millions of dollars to redesign what they do , " says Winkler .
The kinds of performances affected are n't limited to the next Justin Timberlake concert or a video shoot for American Idol .
While Broadway productions and live shows at Las Vegas are expected to bear the brunt of the decision to open up white space , even local bands , fast - food restaurants , political rallies and church pastors delivering their Sunday sermons could find themselves facing more than a few glitches .
The efforts to unlock the white space has been one of the biggest issues facing the audio - equipment industry and the professionals involved in it , says Bill Evans , editor of trade publication Front of House .
" Everybody is not only angry and upset , they are very , very worried , " he says .
" We are talking about the livelihood of people here . "
The move from analog to digital TV transmission allowed the Federal Communications Commission to reclaim a part of the spectrum , between 698 MHz to 806 MHz .
Recently the FCC successfully auctioned the 700 MHz spectrum , a large chunk of which was won by Verizon Wireless .
While a portion of the remaining spectrum has been reserved for future public - safety networks , white space between TV channels remains , and that has caught the attention of companies such as Google , Motorola , Microsoft and Philips .
The tech giants are lobbying to use the white space to deploy new wireless technologies to deliver broadband internet services to portable devices .
That 's where the hitch lies , says Chris Lyons , manager of technical and educational communications at Shure , a professional audio - equipment manufacturer .
Lyons says it's not the broadband access per se that will cause problems , but the way devices would have to search through the spectrum for free bands .
Audio professionals claim that prototypes of devices capable of spectrum - sensing have failed some key tests .
The FCC is expected to release a final report about the results next month .
For its part , Google says it does n't want devices that could interfere with wireless audio equipment in the market either .
" From the beginning we have said that no white space device should come to market unless the FCC signs off on it , " says Dan Martin , a Google spokesman .
Industry professionals hope there will be a technological fix for the problem soon , one that could allow wireless audio equipment to co-exist with devices using wireless broadband on the same spectrum .
But till then , the FCC needs to stay strong , says FOH magazine 's Evans .
" We are not ready yet , " he says .
" We need more time . "
Google says it has suggested the use of a geolocation database that would ensure no white space device could transmit without first getting the all - clear from the database .
That would allow manufacturers to prevent the use of white space bands in the vicinity of a Vegas show , for instance .
Meanwhile , companies are preparing for the worst .
For instance , Lectrosonics is now offering a wider range of frequencies for its wireless microphones .
Until last year , the company 's wireless microphones spanned a range of 537 MHz to 768 MHz .
Now that a part of that band has been auctioned off , the company has reworked its devices to operate in the 470 MHz to 691 MHz spectrum .
It has also added another band , the 944 MHz to 952 MHz spectrum , to the mix .
Those changes have n’t been easy .
Over the course of a year , Lectrosonics reallocated engineering resources and spent " several thousand dollars " getting each new product certified by the FCC .
" We have a limited amount of engineering resources and there are hard costs such as FCC licenses that we have had to get , " says Winkler .
Smaller wireless audio- equipment manufacturers may not have a choice , says Winkler .
" We think a number of manufacturers will be shaken out .
Lower quality , lower power systems will have a difficult time . "

Intel Fellow Calls BS on White Space ' Interference ' Claims
Industry Giants Face Off Amid Interference Claims
It ’s the perennial thorn in the colonialist ’s side .
It ’s the war that wo n’t go away .
It ’s a wasp sting that swells , slowly choking the life out of the sting ’s recipient .
It is the nearly seven - year old occupation of Afghanistan by the United States and various NATO allies .
Nearly forgotten by most Americans , the situation in that country has taken headlines away from the occupation of Iraq because of the resurgence of the anti-occupation forces .
Nine US troops were killed in one day , easily topping any recent US fatality figures coming out of Iraq in recent months .
The growing ferocity of the resistance was brought home to me when a young man whom I have known since he was three years old was removed from the battle zone with wounds serious enough to send him stateside for surgery and recovery .
( He ’s scheduled to get out of the Marines in October ; hopefully he wo n’t get stop - lossed and sent back over there ) .
Like that wasp mentioned above , the Afghani resistance is not necessarily anything a Westerner can support wholeheartedly .
Almost all of its elements , Taliban and otherwise , have a history of misogyny and antagonism toward values we consider essential to freedom .
However , also like that wasp , their resistance to those attacking their lives and their homes is seen by them as essential to the survival of both .
To carry the analogy a step further , the imperial forces arrayed against the Afghani resistance are like a predator insect that sets up a parasitic home on the host and then attempts to take over the host .
There are those wasps that fight the invading parasite and there are those who merely exist within their nest .
The US and NATO occupiers are the parasites hoping to install their host –the Unocal president Karzai–on the people of Afghanistan .
At this point the parasites have failed to achieve their goal .
Because of this failure , the parasite army is planning to intensify their assault .
This is where we leave the analogy and ask why Washington thinks it can achieve what the British and the Soviets could not ?
The Afghanistan region has always been the piece of the puzzle known as the Great Game that refuses to fit into the proscribed plans of any colonial power .
It is as if this particular puzzle piece was cut from another die .
No matter how much firepower is brought upon the Afghani people , they have been able to resist any type of lasting fit into any of the pictures hoped for by the colonial power of the day .
They have done so by manipulation of the invader ’s desires and by playing the various invaders off each other ; and they have done so through sheer determination and the unforgiving nature of the land .
Most recently , they used the US secret services to fend off the domination of their capital by the Soviets , and now they are using their own devices to fend off the domination of their country desired by Washington .
Despite what the majority of the western media tells its readers and viewers , there is more to the Afghani resistance than the Taliban .
In fact , according to a recent report in the US News and World Report , U.S. forces are facing an increasingly complex enemy here composed of Taliban fighters and powerful warlords who were once on the payroll of the Central Intelligence Agency .
As a military official stated in the aforementioned article : “ You could almost describe the insurgency as having two branches .
It ’s the Taliban in the south and a ‘ rainbow coalition ’ in the east . ”
Add to this the various armed drug traders and their backers and you have a mix at least as volatile as that in Iraq during its worst periods over the last five years .
Despite the apparent failure of the armed approach taken by Washington in Afghanistan , both presidential candidates and the majority of Congress support not merely continuing this approach but intensifying it .
McCain and Obama are not only in agreement that the Pentagon needs to send more troops into Afghanistan , they are also in agreement that it is the war that the US must win .
Operating under the pretext that killing more Afghanis is somehow going to end the desire of Washington ’s Islamist enemies to attack it has not only created the current stalemate in Afghanistan , it has also spread the anti-American resistance into the tribal areas of Pakistan and threatens to engulf the Pakistani city of Peshawar .
The recent killings of civilians by US and NATO forces only adds to the resistance , especially when the US denies the killings ever happened .
As hinted at above , the Taliban and other resistance forces are difficult for most Westerners ( and many others , as well ) to support .
Their stance against women and their distaste for certain values we consider essential to the human experience creates a quandary for some of us who understand the imperial nature of the US / NATO presence but find the fundamentalist society created by the Taliban in the wake of their defeat of the Soviets an undesirable alternative .
Without going into the role the CIA and Pentagon played in the rise of the Taliban , suffice it to say they continue to exist primarily because they resist the imperial aggressor , not because the Afghani majority necessarily agrees with their understanding of Islam .
Apparently less sophisticated than other religiously oriented anti-imperialist movements like Hamas and perhaps the Sadrist movement in Iraq that also feature a political wing more inclusive of those who do n’t share either organization ’s religious viewpoints , the Taliban would probably have no more political power than the polygamist Mormon sects in the US west if it were n’t for the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan .
Back to US politics and Afghanistan .
This is not the “ good ” war .
It is just as wrong as the US adventure in Iraq .
Likewise , it can not be won , no matter what the politicians and the generals say .
The government put in Kabul by Washington is comparable to a new branch head of a multinational corporation .
Its power is dependent on the whim of corporate headquarters and will never garner the support of those not on its payroll .
There are clearly human rights being abused in Afghanistan , but those abuses are committed as much by the occupying forces as they are by the forces opposed to the occupier .
The solution to Afghanistan begins , just like in Iraq , with the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the US military .

Mental health problems are somewhat common on campus , according to a new survey of students .

1 -10 times : 38 %
7 or more times : 7 % If you 've been diagnosed with depression , was it in the past school year : Yes : 33 %

Yes , medication : 35 %
Yes , therapy : 25 % Source : 2007 American College Health Association survey of 71,860 students at 107 colleges By Julie Snider , USA TODAY
In the year since Seung Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty at Virginia Tech , colleges dramatically have expanded efforts to catch dangerous students in a safety net before they crash and take innocent victims down with them , school officials say .
" It 's a different world since Virginia Tech , " says Gwendolyn Dungy , executive director of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators .
Colleges are trying to reduce the chances of violence by creating or beefing up risk assessment teams that typically include faculty , residence advisers , psychologists , administrators and police , college administrators say .
The teams meet often to review reports on students who seem disturbed .
The reports are submitted by professors , residence advisers , police and students .
About 20 % of colleges had assessment teams before the Virginia Tech murders , says Keith Anderson , a veteran counselor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y .
" Now I do n't know any college that has n't either created a team or strengthened the one they had , " Dungy says .
Although troubled students rarely attack classmates — suicide is a far more common problem — more students have mental disorders , and their problems are getting more serious , experts agree .
The percentage of students diagnosed with depression was 15 % in 2007 , up from 10 % in 2000 , according to surveys by the American College Health Association .
And 23 % coming to campus counseling centers are on psychiatric medicine , up from 9 % in 1994 , another survey shows .
The shift to more rigorous monitoring of students ' lives comes as experts agree there is no sure way to prevent shootings .
" Anyone who wants to get a gun in this society can get a gun , " says Richard Bonnie , a specialist in psychiatry and law at the University of Virginia School of Law .
An independent report in August on the Virginia Tech shootings recounts in chilling detail how many people noticed Cho 's disturbing behavior and how little they communicated with one another .
The risk teams provide a central place to lodge concerns .
" Very often , trouble with a student who 's becoming psychotic or manic will surface in several areas at the same time — athletic staff , sorority sister , professors will see changes , " says Joan Whitney , counseling center director at Villanova University outside Philadelphia .
Many schools are training professors and staff members to look for troublesome signs , Dungy says .
More professors and others on campus are consulting with counseling centers about " students of concern " since Virginia Tech , according to 66 % of center directors in a new survey of 272 colleges .
" We coach professors in how to deal with students , and usually students welcome the attention , " Whitney says .
" They 'll often say , ' Yes , I 'm having trouble .
I think I 'm depressed . '
Sometimes there 's a painful breakup or another problem .
It 's rare that there 's nothing going on when professors see students they 're concerned about . "
If there are serious problems , a student may be asked to get treatment .
Parents may be informed if college officials are concerned , counselors says .
At Virginia Tech , Cho 's parents were never told he was judged by a psychiatrist to be mentally ill ( and ordered in a court hearing to outpatient treatment , which he never received ) .
Now many colleges , including Virginia Tech , according to spokesman Larry Hincker , say they 're making sure they follow through on troubled students asked to get psychological help .
Most legal scholars agree that colleges have the right to expect students to get mental health evaluations and treatments if there is cause , to contact parents and to ask students to withdraw if there is a documented concern about safety , says Bonnie , the University of Virginia law professor .
Medications have improved , allowing people who have bipolar disorder ( manic depression ) and even some with schizophrenia to get an education .
" Before , they would have stayed home , " says John Greden of the Depression Center at the University of Michigan .
It can be a rough transition .
" They leave home , lose their support systems .
If they had therapy at home , it 's gone .
Their workload increases , sleep is erratic , and they may be exposed to lots of alcohol . "
Depression and bipolar disorder often surface for the first time during college , Greden says .
Students who feel they have nobody to confide in are most vulnerable to mental health problems , suggests a new study by University of Michigan researcher Daniel Eisenberg .
Men are more at risk than women , though fewer men come to counseling centers , and minorities tend to be more isolated , his study shows .
Pressure is turned up Competition has turned ferocious for college - bound kids of every race , and that also is triggering mental health problems , suggests Susan Lipkins , a psychologist practicing in Port Washington , N.Y .
" They burn themselves out through high school trying to have a résumé much more impressive than adults have , " Lipkins says .
" It 's become a culture of winner vs. loser , reflected in the reality shows .
There 's just more acceptance of demeaning , humiliating behavior if you 're a loser . "
Lipkins says the reported rates of students on psychiatric medicine , high as they are , are underestimated .
" Most do n't even tell the schools they 're on meds , " she says .
Susan Putnins , a senior at Harvard , came to college on medication for bipolar disorder and did n't tell anyone at the school .
" The transition was really hard .
The biggest difference was , I had a fantastic support system of friends in high school .
At Harvard I did n't . "
She has gradually made friends and learned to curb stress during exams .
In new surveys , students say they 're most likely to share their anxieties and depression with other students .
Efforts to raise students ' awareness of mental health problems and the value of treatment are underway .
For example , cable channel mtvU has teamed with the Jed Foundation to run more than 8,000 public service announcements on the widely watched college network , says Courtney Knowles of the foundation .
They 're also airing videos of popular musicians , such as Mary J. Bilge , talking about their mental health at halfofus.com .
Troubled students can find links to counseling centers at a site created by Jed Foundation , ulifeline.org .
Active Minds ,
Inc. ( activeminds.org ) is a student group that sponsors activities to inform students about mental disorders and decrease stigma .
Executive director Alison Malmon , 26 , who founded the first chapter in 2001 , says chapters are on 119 campuses .
Emily Parsons , 21 , started a chapter at Central Michigan University in Mt. Pleasant in November .
Depression had disabled her so much , she could n't go away to college after high school .
During the next spring she felt a surge of energy , her thoughts raced , and she started spending lots of money .
After not sleeping for four nights , she began hallucinating .
Parsons was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar disorder .
" It 's a real shocker to get a diagnosis like that when you 're 18 . "
By taking medicine and staying in close touch with doctors , she has been able to go away to college .
" One thing that helps me a lot is ceramics .
It 's such a stress reliever , it keeps me centered . "
She has become philosophical about her illness : " This is not going to go away .
I know I need to take good care of myself . "
The stigma deepens Students need to stay on their medicine or reduce amounts only under a doctor 's care , " but there 's still a learning curve for young people .
They want so much to be like everyone else , " says Joy Himmel , director of the health and wellness center at Pennsylvania State University - Altoona .
Steven Kazmierczak , who killed five students and himself at Northern Illinois University in February , had stopped Prozac abruptly because of side effects , his girlfriend told CNN .
After the Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois shootings , too many people are drawing a link between mental illness and murder , says Lucas Ebaugh , 26 , a student at the University of Colorado - Colorado Springs .
He has depression and an anxiety disorder , " but I am not a violent person .
I know a lot of people with mental illness , and they are n't violent , either .
This false equation just contributes to stigma . "
Most mentally ill people are not violent , says Edward Mulvey , an expert on mental disorders and violence at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School .
The best predictor of violent behavior is prior violence , says Mulvey , but Cho had no record of physically attacking people .
" Massacre killings are almost impossible to predict , " he says .
Horrific as they are , such mass campus shootings are rare , says James Alan Fox , a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston .
With about 16 million U.S. college students , " the chances of being murdered on campus are about as likely as being fatally struck by lightning , " he says .
Nobody knows whether the vigilance with troubled students will prevent mass murders .
But colleges must try , says Richard Kadison , chief of mental health services at Harvard .
" The pendulum is swinging away from being laissez faire . …
If you 're going to make a mistake , it 's better to err on the side of keeping students safe . "

WASHINGTON  A newly disclosed Justice Department legal memorandum , written in March 2003 and authorizing the military ’s use of extremely harsh interrogation techniques , offers what could be a revealing clue in an unsolved mystery :
What responsibility did top Pentagon and Bush administration officials have for abuses committed by American troops at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and in Afghanistan ; Guantánamo Bay , Cuba ; and elsewhere ?
Some legal experts and advocates said Wednesday that the document , written the month that the United States invaded Iraq , adds to evidence that the abuse of prisoners in military custody may have involved signals from higher officials and not just irresponsible actions by low - level personnel .
The opinion was written by John C. Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel , the executive branch ’s highest authority on the interpretation of the law .
It told the Pentagon ’s senior leadership that inflicting pain would not be considered torture unless it caused “ death , organ failure or permanent damage , ” and it is the most fully developed legal justification that has yet come to light for inflicting physical and mental pressure on suspects .
While resembling an August 2002 memorandum drafted largely by Mr. Yoo , the March 2003 opinion went further , arguing more explicitly that the president ’s war powers could trump the law against torture , which it said could not constitutionally be enforced if it interfered with the commander in chief ’s orders .
Up to 4 billion people left without water .
Up to 5 billion at risk of flooding .
Half a billion left hungry as agricultural yields decline by 15 - 35 % in Africa with entire swaths of the world ceasing food production altogether .
More than 80 million exposed to malaria in Africa .
The Amazon collapses and 50 % of species go extinct .
It 's basically the end of the world .
And it 's reported in this morning 's Guardian .
There is such a gaping chasm between the matter - of - fact reporting of this nightmarish 4C scenario that government scientists now say we should be planning for , and the total failure of apparently rational people to understand what is happening on the Hoo peninsula this week .
Reports from Kingsnorth , the site of this year 's climate camp , completely fail to scrutinise the pin-striped criminals who are pushing the planet towards the brink .
Instead , the Press Association runs stories on apparent conspiracies to attack police with knives without even phoning the accused activists for a reaction to these smears .
What other set of people could be accused of conspiracy to commit cop killings without being asked for any reaction ?
This is a victory for the police and the rightwing media they leak to .
Equally , E.ON UK 's greenwashing PR campaign is run without any question .
Every report repeats the myth that the proposed new power station would be a " cleaner coal " plant .
No one reports that in fact , this coal plant will pollute as much as more than 30 developing countries combined , that there will be no use of carbon capture and storage ( CSS ) technology , and that the plant will be so inefficient as to waste half of all the energy it creates .
No mention of the fact that Chris Davies , the Lib Dem MEP , who is notoriously pro-CCS coal , has pledged to attend the camp precisely because Kingsnorth wo n't be a " cleaner coal " plant .
E.ON UK keeps pumping out the spin that " we need coal to keep the lights on " , even following reports in the Financial Times that independent energy experts , Pöyry , have proven ( pdf ) that if the UK hit its existing renewables and efficiency targets , no new coal would be required .
Even when emails expose close contact between E.ON UK and the business department , they are only reported in the Guardian .
As the prime minister has a last look at a bit of beautiful coastline already succumbing to the sea , the media frenzy focuses on the same old soap opera personality politics .
Is so - and - so too remote / young / jaded / damaged to be the next majorette marching us over the cliff ?
Whoever it is , we know it 'll be one of the same crew who got us into this mess and can't get us out because the solutions do n't fit the electoral cycle .
There is an echo here too of the US media 's response to Iraq .
Even now , anyone who opposed the war is on some sort of " radical fringe " , and having supported the war , at least at the time of its inception , is a necessary qualification to be seen as " serious " .
With climate change , in order to be " serious " you need to acknowledge that the end of the world is an interesting detail in the broader pattern of economic " progress " , but never succumb to the incredible naivety of the protesters , who fail to realise that the survival of life on earth is a bourgeois luxury which we can ill afford in these times of economic constraint .
The harsh reality is that there is no way we could plan for a 4C rise .
No amount of adaptation is going to make that liveable for most of the world 's population , and it 's going to be pretty damn nasty for those lucky few of us living in the north as well .
Despite this , we end up with two possible stories – the front page banner " dangerous anarchists threaten chaos " , or , tucked away at the back of the paper , " peaceful protest passes without incident " .
And all the time , not even the liberal press is concerned that , even if every single person at the camp arrived with a heavy machine gun , they could n't kill half the number of people who will die as a result of the effects of climate change .
A Press Release issued on August 19 , 2008 , by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , contains a striking finding and conclusion :
The 20 to 40 million deaths worldwide from the great 1918 Influenza ( " Flu " ) Pandemic were NOT due to a virus , but to pneumonia caused by massive bacterial infection of the lungs weakened by the flu virus ( The full NIAID report is attached at the end of this report ) .
The research of Lawrence Broxmeyer first proclaimed that the 1918 pandemic was due to bacteria , particularly mutant forms of fowl , bovine and human tuberculosis ( TB ) bacteria .
In 2006 , in a Medline paper published in Elsevier 's Medical Hypothesis , he wrote : " Influenza is Italian for " influence " , Latin : influentia .
It used to be thought that the disease was caused by a bad influence from the heavens .
Influenza was called a virus long , long before it was proven to be one . "
Elsevier is a major medical publisher which also publishes The Lancet .
In 2005 , an article in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated that a recurrence of the 1918 influenza epidemic could kill between 180 million and 360 million people worldwide .
A large part of the recent bird - flu hysteria is fostered by a distrust among the lay and scientific community regarding the actual state of our knowledge regarding the bird flu or H5N1 and the killer " Influenza " Pandemic of 1918 that it is compared to .
And this distrust is not completely unfounded .
Traditionally , " flu " does not kill .
Experts , including Peter Palese of the Mount School of Medicine in Manhattan , remind us that even in 1992 , millions in China already had antibodies to H5N1 , meaning that they had contracted it and that their immune system had little trouble fending it off .
In 2000 Dr. Andrew Noymer and Michel Garenne , UC Berkeley demographers , reported convincing statistics showing that undetected tuberculosis may have been the real killer in the 1918 flu epidemic .
Aware of recent attempts to isolate the " Influenza virus " on human cadavers and their specimens , Noymer and Garenne concluded that : " Frustratingly , these findings have not answered the question why the 1918 virus was so virulent , nor do they offer an explanation for the unusual age profile of deaths " .
Bird flu would certainly be diagnosed in the hospital today as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) .
Roger and others favor suspecting tuberculosis in all cases of acute respiratory failure of unknown origin .
And the same techniques used by Burnett in isolating Infulenza from the allointoic sac of chicken embryo's is also an ideal culture medium for TB and the mycobacteria .
By 1918 , it could be said , in so far as tuberculosis was concerned , that the world was a supersaturated sponge ready to ignite and that among its most vulnerable parts was the very Midwest where the 1918 unknown pandemic began .
It is theorized that the lethal pig epidemic that began in Kansas just prior to the first human outbreaks was a disease of avian and human tuberculosis genetically combined through mycobacteriophage interchange , with the pig susceptible to both , as its involuntary living culture medium .
What are the implications of mistaking a virus such as Influenza A for a disease caused by TB - like bacteria ?
They would be disastrous , with useless treatment and preventative stockpiles .
The obvious need for further investigation is presently imminent and pressing .
In commenting on the new NIAID report , Broxmeyer writes that euphemisms like " pneumonia " , " bronchitis " , " chest ailment " , " the flu " etc. have been with us since time immemorial to describe tubercular involvement .
This was noted in 1944 in pathologist Arnold Rich 's classic test , " The Pathogenesis of Tuberculosis . "
It is also well known that bacterial secondary infection in TB cases is common .
Pioneer TB physician Sir John Crofton ( 1912 - ) was convinced that bacteria ( not viruses ) in the form of Haemophillus Influenza were at the root of the great the Pandemic of 1918 .
He claimed it was bacteria ( not viruses ) , which started the epidemic of 1918 .
Haemophillus Influenza itself is but a small bacillus , and was discovered by Richard Pfieffer in Koch 's laboratory ( the doctor who discovered the mycobacterial cause of TB ) .
During the pandemic , one - third of patients who had Haemophillus influenza where also found to have tuberculosis and many other cases went undiagnosed .
Broxmeyer was never able to prove a direct link between between H. influenza and the mycobacteria that cause TB , but he continues to speculate that TB was a big factor in the many deaths in the pandemic , specifically because it is well known that secondary bacterial infections , be they from Haemophillus influenza or any other common bacteria , can also create pneumonia in TB - infected lungs .
Whatever the " connection " between TB bacteria , and influenza bacteria , and a virus - caused " flu " epidemic , the new report by the NIAID is a reminder that epidemics and pandemics are complex disease processes , which should not simply be assumed to due merely to a " virus " of great ferocity .

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) For Immediate Release Tuesday , August 19 , 2008 Subscribe Contact : Anne A. Oplinger 301-402-1663 Bacterial Pneumonia Caused Most Deaths in 1918 Influenza Pandemic Implications for Future Pandemic Planning
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918 - 1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone , report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , part of the National Institutes of Health .
Instead , most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection .
The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs .
A future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner , say the NIAID authors , whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online .
Therefore , the authors conclude , comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well .
The work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion .
" The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths , " says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci , M.D. " In essence , the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch . "
NIAID co-author and pathologist Jeffery Taubenberger , M.D. , Ph.D. , examined lung tissue samples from 58 soldiers who died of influenza at various U. S. military bases in 1918 and 1919 .
The samples , preserved in paraffin blocks , were re-cut and stained to allow microscopic evaluation .
Examination revealed a spectrum of tissue damage " ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe , acute , secondary bacterial pneumonia , " says Dr. Taubenberger .
In most cases , he adds , the predominant disease at the time of death appeared to have been bacterial pneumonia .
There also was evidence that the virus destroyed the cells lining the bronchial tubes , including cells with protective hair - like projections , or cilia .
This loss made other kinds of cells throughout the entire respiratory tract - including cells deep in the lungs - vulnerable to attack by bacteria that migrated down the newly created pathway from the nose and throat .
In a quest to obtain all scientific publications reporting on the pathology and bacteriology of the 1918 - 1919 influenza pandemic , Dr. Taubenberger and NIAID co-author David Morens , M.D. , searched bibliography sources for papers in any language .
They also reviewed scientific and medical journals published in English , French and German , and located all papers reporting on autopsies conducted on influenza victims .
From a pool of more than 2,000 publications that appeared between 1919 and 1929 , the researchers identified 118 key autopsy series reports .
In total , the autopsy series they reviewed represented 8,398 individual autopsies conducted in 15 countries .
The published reports " clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities , " says Dr. Morens .
Pathologists of the time , he adds , were nearly unanimous in the conviction that deaths were not caused directly by the then - unidentified influenza virus , but rather resulted from severe secondary pneumonia caused by various bacteria .
Absent the secondary bacterial infections , many patients might have survived , experts at the time believed .
Indeed , the availability of antibiotics during the other influenza pandemics of the 20th century , specifically those of 1957 and 1968 , was probably a key factor in the lower number of worldwide deaths during those outbreaks , notes Dr. Morens .
The cause and timing of the next influenza pandemic cannot be predicted with certainty , the authors acknowledge , nor can the virulence of the pandemic influenza virus strain .
However , it is possible that - as in 1918 - a similar pattern of viral damage followed by bacterial invasion could unfold , say the authors .
Preparations for diagnosing , treating and preventing bacterial pneumonia should be among highest priorities in influenza pandemic planning , they write .
" We are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions , " says Dr. Fauci .

Obama , The Democratic ‘ War President ’
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
CALGARY — Barack Obama wants to withdraw US troops from Iraq and send them to Afghanistan , which he calls the real front on the " war on terror . "
He also has repeated threats to attack Pakistan " if necessary . "
One understands Obama ’s need to sound macho .
Rival John McCain has been beating his chest , proclaiming , " I know how to win wars . "
Polls show Americans trust McCain three to one over Obama as a war leader .
Unfortunately , recent US presidents seem to require small military conflicts to prove their political virility .
But Obama has long called the US - led occupation of Afghanistan a " good war , " a view most Americans and Canadians share .
They see Afghanistan — and now Pakistan — as hotbeds of al - Qaida and Taliban terrorists that must be eradicated .
It is distressing to see Obama succumb to the blitz of war propaganda over Afghanistan and adopt George Bush ’s faux terminology of terrorism .
Before Obama urges widening America ’s war there , he should consider :
Al - Qaida never numbered more than 300 men .
There are hardly any left in Afghanistan .
Survivors scattered into Pakistan .
Finding them is police and intelligence work , not a job for thousands more western troops .
US policy towards Afghanistan is driven by energy geopolitics .
Pacification of rebellious Pashtun tribesmen is necessary in order to build energy pipelines south from the Caspian Basin .
That is the primary strategic mission of US and Canadian troops .
Taliban fighters are not " terrorists . "
Taliban was founded as a fundamentalist Muslim religious movement of Pashtun tribesmen to fight banditry , rape , drugs , and Afghan Communists .
Taliban received millions in US aid until four months before 9/11 .
It had no part in 9/11 and knew nothing about them .
The US overthrow of Taliban resulted in the Communists resuming control over half of Afghanistan .
Under US occupation , Afghanistan has become a narco - state that supplies over 90 % of the world ’s heroin .
Pashtun tribes comprise half of Afghanistan ’s population , and 15 % of neighboring Pakistan ’s people .
The western powers are involved in an old - fashioned , colonial - style pacification campaign against the Pashtun Taliban .
Imperial Britain , the Soviets , and now the US and its allies all employed the same classical colonial strategy : using puppet rulers , local mercenary troops , and lavish bribes to enforce their will .
Afghans who resist get bombed .
Before urging expansion of the Afghan war , Obama should total up the bill for America ’s military misadventures .
As of last January , according to the Pentagon and data revealed under the Freedom of Information Act , the Iraq and Afghanistan wars cost 72,043 American battlefield casualties .
Veteran ’s Administration hospitals have treated 263,909 veterans from these wars and registered over 245,000 disability claims .
No one knows how many Iraqis and Afghans have been killed .
The number could be over one million .
Just last week over 50 Afghans in a wedding party were killed by a US air strike .
But without the constant use of massive air power , including B - 1 bombers , the US could not maintain its occupation of Iraq or Afghanistan .
According to a Democratic Congressional committee report , the two wars will cost $ 1.6 trillion by the end of 2008 , or $ 16,500 per US family of four — not counting the cost of borrowing money to pay for the wars .
Obama and McCain believe Afghan resistance can be crushed by more brute force .
They are wrong .
More western troops and more bombed villages will mean fiercer Afghan resistance .
The war is now seeping into Pakistan , a nation of 165 million .
Obama ’s threats to attack Pakistan and go after its nuclear arsenal are reckless and extremely dangerous .
He appears headed over the same cliff as those would - be " war presidents , Bush and McCain .
As the head of NATO recently admitted , political settlement , not bombs , is the only way to end the unnecessary Afghan war .
Is Obama beginning to fall under the influence of the same military - petroleum complex that guided Bush ’s imperial - minded presidency ?
Could Pakistan become a disaster for the Democrats as Iraq was for Republicans ?

You know what ?
It 's not ok to invade sovereign nations using a B.S. reason , kill a million of one of the country 's citizens , rob and destroy their artifacts and hang their president after a puppet trial .
And it 's NOT ok to torture people and hold them in a hell hole because you think , maybe , possibly , they might be one of the great modern day Boogie Men , a.k. a a “ terrorist ” .
It 's also not ok to take my rights away and yours , and spit on the Constitution because those amorphous Boogie Men might be lurking around disguised as , well , you or me .
And do we really expect and want good ol '
Big Brother and the modern equivalent of storm troopers to protect us ( remember what a fine job they did in New Orleans after Katrina , ripping legally owned guns out of people 's illegally barged into homes ) ??
Bottom line : it 's not ok for our so - called leaders , the neo-con ( emphasis on “ con ” ) regime to break international laws and just pretend that it's ok because we 're the great US of A and not like those meanies of Germany and Japan who deserved to be held accountable when they did the same .
Well , finally someone has the fortitude ( I 'd say “ gonads ” but I do n't want to be TOO brazen ) , smarts and courage to DO SOMETHING about the above .. and it's a lawyer !
Who'd a thunk it !!
And he 's one who knows his stuff and is saying ENOUGH .
Someone has decided to step up to the proverbial plate and go after these criminals .
I 'm thrilled .
I 'm encouraged .
I 'm telling you about it because I 'm hoping some of you will feel the same way and maybe use some of your creativity and energy and the kind of inspiration and guts that went into the grassroots Ron Paul campaign and get behind this effort .
What effort ?
I thought you 'd never ask .
I just found out from the American Bar Association news desk that the dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , Lawrence Velvel , is getting together a September conference to map out war crimes prosecutions .
Yep , the criminals he is going to prosecute include our own King George , er , President George W “ the Decider ” Bush , other administration officials and possible some federal judges .
And thank HEAVENS he 's talking about going after John “ I Never Met A Horrendous Torture Device I Didn't Think Was Just Fine And Dandy ” Yoo , the former Justice Department official who wrote one of the so - called torture memos .
Velvel said in a statement that “ plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up , to pursue the guilty as long as necessary and , if need be , to the ends of the Earth … We must insist on appropriate punishments including , if guilt is found , the hangings visited upon top German and Japanese war criminals in the 1940s . ”
Velvel explains in excruciatingly accurate detail just what 's what , and why he 's going after the Bush regime , in a series of articles called The Long Term View that you can read here : [ link edited for length ]
He says , flat out , “ there is no question ” that Bush and other officials are guilty of the federal crime of conspiracy to commit torture .
And he succinctly sums up Bush senior 's sonny boy 's persona , the loser ad infinitum :
“ The man ultimately responsible for the torture had a unique preparation and persona for the presidency : he is a former drunk , was a serial failure in business who had to repeatedly be bailed out by daddy 's friends and wanna - be - friends , was unable to speak articulately despite the finest education (s ) that money and influence can buy , has a dislike of reading , so that 100 - page memos have to be boiled down to one page for him , is heedless of facts and evidence , and appears not even to know the meaning of truth . ”
I say “ BRAVO ” and I also say , let 's figure out a grassroots way to support Velvel 's effort .
But you know what a Wall Street Journal editorial just published says ?
I am not making this up .
The Wall Street Journal actually PUBLISHED SOMETHING THIS STUPID and illogical — an editorial that chews into House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers for issuing subpoenas trying to get information about the possible torture of Sept. 11 suspects and the same article attacks UK professor Philippe Sands , who also says ( GO Professor Sands !! ) that U.S. officials are guilty of war crimes .
Why ?
Get this rationale : “ Nearly seven years after 9/11 , the U.S. homeland has n't been struck again and American civil liberties remain intact , ” the newspaper insanely blithers .
“ So how does Congress say thank you ' ?
By trying to ruin the men who in good faith set the legal rules that have kept us safe . ”
They honestly think our rights are INTACT ?
Do they not read the news ?
Do n't they know the government can now listen into private conversations because , well , they can ?
These “ legal rules ” are what have kept us safe from the big bad Boogie Men terrorists ?
And forget about the fact our borders remain wide open … we are all secure because we have Homeland Security , duct tape and orange and red and maybe polka dot this week terror levels .
Let me get another thing straight here .
Was it ok for “ good Germans ” to say , “ Well , those Jewish bankers and shopowners and professors down the street I did n't like are gone now and we are happier without them … so why does anyone want to look into what happened to them ?
… whatever it was , they must have deserved their fate , even if it included a bit of torture , because our fatherland security forces would never do anything that was n't necessary … our government is keeping us safe in good faith .
Heil Hitler ! ”
The good Germans who were just “ following orders ” were told that did n't cut it after WWII .
A war crime against humanity is just that .
We fought to hang 'em high .
Should n't the war criminals who have ordered and approved torture this go round , in the 21st century , who have broken law after law , who are directly responsible for the lost and destroyed lives of countless thousands of our own people and innocents of other lands , be held accountable , too ?
Do n't look back one day and say , well , you were just going along with your government , just being a “ good American ” when you looked the other way as our country was destroyed for the selfish , even sadistic vision of the neocons .
Thank you , Lawrence Velvel , for giving me hope that justice and law still exist .
And so do brave Americans who will not give up fighting for what is right .
Medical marijuana use has a history stretching back thousands of years .
In prebiblical times , the plant was used as medicinal tea in China , a stress antidote in India and a pain - reliever for earaches , childbirth and more throughout Asia , the Middle East and Africa .
In recent decades , medical researchers have investigated marijuana ’s effects on various kinds of pain -- from damaged nerves in people with HIV , diabetes and spinal cord injury ; from cancer ; and from multiple sclerosis .
Marijuana has also been hypothesized to help with nausea induced by chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy , and with severe loss of appetite as seen in people with the AIDS wasting syndrome .
The weed ’s actions are due to the active ingredients tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) and some 60 other cannabinoids , which mimic the action of chemicals -- known as endogenous cannabinoids -- that exist naturally in the brain .
Those cannabinoids activate receptors in our nerves , triggering physiological responses .
A legal prescription form of THC ( Marinol ) exists , yet researchers say it ’s far from a perfect drug .
Taken orally , its absorption is highly variable and unpredictable and often delayed , says Dr. Igor Grant , a UC San Diego psychiatrist who directs the university ’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research .
“ Smoking is a very efficient way to deliver THC , ” he says .
As a result of its federally illegal status , medicinal use of marijuana is restricted to carefully vetted clinical research studies or to patients in states such as California that have passed laws to allow for personal medical use .
Research on the medicinal use of marijuana relies on government - issued marijuana cigarettes , which come in different strengths and are supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
The UC Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research in San Diego helps coordinate clinical studies to investigate the safety and effectiveness of marijuana .
Here ’s what they ’ve found .
Neuropathic pain
Recent research suggests that marijuana can assuage this chronic - pain syndrome in which burning sensations occur and simple touch can feel like hurt .
It is unaffected by aspirin - like drugs and fairly resistant to stronger analgesics such as opiates .
In a 2007 study on neuropathic pain related to HIV infection , 50 patients smoked marijuana cigarettes three times a day or marijuana cigarettes from which active ingredients had been extracted .
Subjects then rated their pain on a scale ranging from “ no pain ” to “ worst pain imaginable . ”
The results , published in the journal Neurology , showed a 34 % reduction in ratings of pain in the marijuana group compared with 17 % in the placebo group over five days of treatment .
Another study in 44 patients reported in June in the Journal of Pain found that marijuana alleviated neuropathic pain arising from a variety of conditions , including spinal - cord injury and diabetes .
Participants smoked marijuana on a set schedule -- first two puffs , then three puffs an hour later , then four puffs an hour after that -- from a single cigarette containing either 0 % , 3.5 % , or 7 % THC .
Average pain ratings before smoking were 55 on a 100 - point scale and decreased by 46 % in both treatment groups and by 27 % in the placebo group one hour after the last puff .
Analgesic drugs are often tested against experimentally induced pain .
Such studies have been conducted for marijuana too .
In one 2007 report in the journal Anesthesiology , 15 healthy volunteers received skin injections with capsaicin -- the chemical behind that fiery spice in chile peppers -- and then smoked different - strength marijuana cigarettes .
The medium dose , with a 4 % THC concentration , lessened the burning pain .
These three pain studies all concluded that smoked marijuana can bring relief to sufferers of neuropathic pain comparable to other analgesic drugs .
It is not a cure , Grant says : “ It ’s like other pain medicines , you have to keep taking it . ”
Study subjects did feel high , an effect that varied among individuals .
Marijuana also affected thinking , shown as problems with tasks of memory and complicated reasoning after the strongest marijuana cigarettes were used .
Potentially problematic , these effects were tolerated by subjects -- no one opted out of the study because they could n’t think straight .
Grant says it ’s important to have a choice of treatments because not everyone responds to or can tolerate the available drugs .
Antidepressants are used for neuropathic pain but cause dry mouth , constipation and urinary problems , and must be avoided by people with conditions such as glaucoma .
Others ca n’t take aspirin - like drugs .
“ Having an alternative compound is always good , ” Grant says .
Multiple sclerosis
Patients with multiple sclerosis suffer muscle spasms , pain and tremor .
Anecdotal reports suggest that marijuana may be helpful , but controlled studies are few .
One , presented at an April meeting , had 51 multiple sclerosis patients smoke 0 % or 4 % THC marijuana cigarettes daily for three days .
Intensity of spasms was reduced by 32 % and pain ratings by 50 % after smoking marijuana , compared with 2 % and 22 % reductions after placebo cigarettes .
Five subjects withdrew , citing side effects : feeling too high , dizzy or fatigued .
Other studies in patients with multiple sclerosis used a cannabis extract that can be taken orally .
In a 2007 European Journal of Neurology study , nearly half of 184 patients experienced at least 30 % improvement in muscle spasms .
But a 2004 Neurology paper showed no reduction in objective measures of arm tremor with cannabis extract , although five subjects out of 13 reported feeling improvement .
This might have resulted from mood - altering effects of the drug or from some aspect of tremor not measured .
Nausea
A 2008 review published in the European Journal of Cancer Care analyzed 30 clinical studies using cannabinoid drugs synthesized in the lab and concluded that they were better than standard antinausea drugs in alleviating the nausea and vomiting that accompanies chemotherapy .
One such drug is Marinol , a THC preparation approved by the Food and Drug Administration for precisely this purpose .
Survey studies suggest that some people with HIV smoke marijuana to counteract nausea caused by antiretroviral therapy .
Researchers at the UC Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research have tried to study the effect of smoked marijuana on nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy but have struggled to enroll enough subjects , Grant says .
Bruce Mirken , director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project -- a group that lobbies for the decriminalization of marijuana -- says he is all for research on the chemical components in marijuana with the goal of making more - purified and perhaps more - targeted drugs that do not deliver a “ high , ” but does not see “ criminalizing use of that plant by people who are ill when you are making its main psychoactive ingredient legal in the form of a very expensive pill . ”
Tom Riley , a spokesman for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , says marijuana advocates are seeking a free pass .
“ They want to be exempted from the regular [ drug ] approval process , ” he says .

BBC News Online science staff in Denver
The hunt is well and truly joined .
Scientists report here that one of the greatest observatories ever constructed works as expected and is now ready to go for goal .
We 'll have the joy of discovering things about the dark side of the Universe that cannot be discovered in any other way
Prof Kip Thorne
The Ligo facility , built at a cost of nearly $ 300 m , is trying to detect gravitational waves , the ripples created in the fabric of space - time that occur every time a star explodes or black holes collide .
If it succeeds , scientists will not only confirm cherished theories , they will also have a new window on the Universe that will enable them to probe the nature of the cosmos right back to the beginning of time itself .
Researchers connected with the project came to the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Denver with good news .
They said initial experiments showed Ligo could achieve the extraordinary sensitivities required to pick up the waves .
The installations ' tunnels are in an L - shape " We 've been through a very complicated commissioning phase but we have now started to do what we can call science , " said Professor Barry Barrish , the director of Ligo .
" We 've improved the sensitivity and over the next year or two we will slowly move to the design performance . "
The researchers also reported they would be putting in a request this week for $ 150 m of further funding to boost the power of the facility .
Ligo ( Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ) is a huge engineering undertaking .
It consists of two widely separated installations - one in Washington State , the other in Louisiana - in which lasers are bounced off mirrors at the end of two four - kilometre - long vacuum tunnels .
The returning light beams are recombined in detectors .
If a gravitational wave passes through the beams , the light will be ever so slightly disturbed .
Passing lorries
The UK's Dr Harry Ward , an international partner on Ligo , explained : " The effect of a gravitational wave - if you imagine it propagating towards you - would be to lengthen space between your head and feet , and contract your width .
It distorts you in that way .
" So the way we try to detect gravitational waves is to lay out , L - shape , a set of mirrors .
The gravitational waves would shorten one arm between two mirrors while simultaneously lengthening the other arm between two mirrors . "
LIGO FACTS
Building started in 1996 and finished in 2000 Facilities located at Hanford WA and Livingston LA Include the most sensitive interferometers ever built
But the weak nature of gravity means these disturbances are unimaginably small , even when they originate from some of the Universe 's most violent events , such as the collapse of supermassive stars .
The scientists at Ligo have to measure deviations in their light beams equivalent to one one - thousandth of the width of a proton , one of the particles that make up all atoms .
One of the major tasks for engineers has been to insulate the installations from vibrations - from passing lorries and earthquakes - that might swamp the real data .
Having the two installations so far apart helps scientists see past the extraneous " noise " in the system .
Joy of discovery
After initial adjustments to instrumentation , researchers felt confident to start their first 60 - day " science run " on Ligo this weekend .
They do not expect to find gravitational waves immediately .
Ligo 's sensitivity is still some way short of the level needed to detect an event with confidence .
But when the eureka moment arrives , we will cross the threshold into a new era of science .
Professor Kip Thorne , one of the lead researchers on the project , told the BBC : " It 'll be wonderful .
We 'll have the joy of discovering things about the dark side of the Universe that cannot be discovered in any other way .
" We 'll have the joy of testing theories about black holes that can not be tested any other way .
We 'll be seeing the Universe and the fundamental laws of space - time in a manner that we have never seen before . "

What are these ?
Young Catholics attending World Youth Day celebrations in Sydney may find themselves swamped with offers of free condoms after a court overturned legislation giving police the power to arrest anyone who " annoys " pilgrims .
Activists opposed to the church 's stance on contraception and abortion successfully appealed against the laws , passed by the New South Wales government .
Members of the NoToPope coalition argued in a federal court challenge on today that the anti-annoyance regulations , which carry fines of $ 5,500 , were invalid and contrary to civil liberties .
Three judges agreed , saying the measures designed to help police keep order during the six - day festivities " should not be interpreted as conferring powers that are repugnant to fundamental rights and freedoms " .
University students Rachel Evans and Amber Pike , who challenged the legislation , said they and other protesters would now hand out condoms , stickers and leaflets to pilgrims .
" Symbolic coat - hangers " , designed to draw attention to the problem of backyard abortions , would also be distributed .
Evans said protesters wearing T - shirts with slogans such as " The Pope is Wrong – Put a Condom on " and " Pope go Homo " would picket a cross-city march due to be held on Saturday .
" We now have a lot more confidence to go onto the street to campaign against the condemnation of condoms , homosexuality and abortion , " said Evans .
" We do n't want to inconvenience anyone .
We want to talk to them about the Pope 's position on these matters . "
The Catholic church has not yet commented on the ruling , which came on the official opening day of the event .
But World Youth Day coordinator Bishop Anthony Fisher earlier said people were free to protest in a peaceful and respectful way .
Referring to the distribution of condoms , he said : " We have had this before at other events and our pilgrims just drop them to the ground and ignore them . "
The row has only slightly overshadowed celebrations for the faith - based event , billed as a festival of peace , love and Christianity , which 500,000 people are due to attend .
Tens of thousands of pilgrims attended an opening mass on Sydney harbour foreshore tonight where they were welcomed by the Australian prime minister , Kevin Rudd .
Pope Benedict XVI , who flew from Rome for the longest trip of his three - year papacy , will preside over the event from Thursday .
Pesky telemarketers at it again - Do Not Call offers little relief
" Your auto warranty is about to expire . "
The first time I got that recorded phone call , I tried to figure out which vehicles in my household it could be .
Since two were 10 years old and one was almost new , I hung up .
The next time , I hung up more quickly , and the time after that .
Consumers in the Bay Area and nationwide have been bombarded with such calls , including people like me who have signed up for the National Do Not Call Registry , which is supposed to prevent most telemarketers from calling your home or cell phone .
Larry Miller of San Francisco says he has received multiple calls in the past month pitching auto warranties and loan products , despite being on the do - not - call list .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Because he does n't have Caller ID , " Each time I have waited for the real , live person to come to the phone .
I have asked him or her what company they represent .
Within seconds , the person hangs up quickly if any question is asked about the source of the call .
What 's the point of having a do - not - call list if you can't identify the company that 's tormenting you ? " he says .
The Federal Trade Commission , which operates and helps enforce the registry , says it has received complaints about auto warranty pitches , but wo n't disclose whether it is investigating them .
Attorneys general in several states have issued alerts about the calls , warning that some could be so - called phishing scams designed to trick people into disclosing credit card numbers and other personal information .
In March , Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon sued seven companies , most in the St. Louis area , for " misrepresentation and deception " in the sale of auto warranties by mail and phone .
He charged National Auto Warranty Services Inc. of Wentzville , Mo. , with violating state law by calling people on the Missouri Do Not Call list and federal law by calling people who had asked not to be called .
Elizabeth Kirkpatrick , a spokeswoman for the company , said it acquired telemarketing lists from credit bureaus but first " scrubbed them " against the registry to avoid calling people on the list .
She says her company , which does business as Dealer Services , stopped telemarketing a few weeks ago because " we have had a tremendous amount of complaints " from people who said they were called by a company or companies using its legal name , National Auto Warranty Services .
When consumers tried to call the number that popped up on their Caller ID screens , the calls went nowhere or were disconnected .
John O'Connor , an outside spokesman for National Auto Warranty Services , says the attorney general 's lawsuit will be resolved shortly .
" The majority of complaints that have occurred over the last several months can be tracked to rogue companies that we cannot identify that used National Auto Warranty Services and others for phishing expeditions , " he says .
" They always came from unrecognizable numbers .
Our numbers were trackable .
They came to us . "
He adds that the company never made calls to California .
Registry rules
It is illegal for most telemarketers to call individuals who have added their home or cell phone number ( but not business or fax number ) to the National Do Not Call Registry , with a few exceptions .
People making political calls , taking surveys or representing charities may call people on the list .
Even if you ask these exempt callers not to bother you again , they can - except for paid telemarketers representing charities .
If you ask them not to call you , they must stop , says FTC spokesman Mitch Katz .
Companies also can legally call people on the registry with whom they have an " established business relationship . "
Such a relationship exists if you have made an inquiry , application , purchase or other transaction with the company .
The relationship ends 18 months after your last transaction or three months after your last inquiry or application .
However , if you tell these firms not to call you , they must add you to an " entity - specific " list and stop calling .
Telemarketers must make their phone numbers visible on Caller ID .
Providing no number or a fake number is illegal .
Companies also can be fined for " abusive use of auto dialers , " Katz says .
This happens when a telemarketer sends out tons of prerecorded calls but does n't have enough people to quickly answer responses .
The FTC can take action against companies that violate these rules , except for banks , insurance and credit card companies .
The Federal Communications Commission , which also enforces the registry , could bring actions against those firms , Katz says .
The FTC has brought more than 30 enforcement actions against companies for violating the rules .
In 2005 , " we got a $ 3.5 million penalty against DirectTV , " Katz says .
Recently , it fined telemarketers representing Dish Network $ 95,000 .
Sign - up , complaints
To sign up for the national registry , go to donotcall.gov or call ( 888 ) 382-1222 from the phone you want to register .
If you sign up online , you will receive an e-mail that must be confirmed before you are registered .
It can take up to 30 days for companies to stop calling you .
There is no fee , and your number will stay on the list until you delete it or it goes out of service .
You can verify that your number is still registered at donotcall.gov .
If you get a call that violates the rules , you can file a complaint with the FTC online at www.donotcall.gov or with the FCC at esupport.fcc.gov/complaints.htm .
Katz recommends filing with both agencies .
Or you could send an e-mail to fccinfo@fcc.govor call ( 888 ) 225-5322 .
Provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number , the time and date of the call , the name and number of the caller and what the pitch was .
If the caller hid his or her identity , give as much information as you can .
You can also file a complaint with your local district attorney , state attorney general or the Better Business Bureau .
If the caller was from out of state , consider filing a complaint with that state as well .
" If people in California have information about Missouri - based businesses , they should contact us , " says Scott Holste , a spokesman for Nixon 's office .
United States of Anxiety
The floods , the California wildfires , and the violence in Chicago are nothing compared to what the slow - motion disaster of a crumbling economy is doing to us .
A personal account of a breakdown .
Paul Hoppe
When people ask me why I sold my house in Madrona last month and moved to a rental apartment on Capitol Hill , I say , " Because the economy is going to tank . "
But that 's not exactly accurate :
The economy has been tanking since last August .
I just sense that things will get much worse before they improve .
When I call my brother Paul , in California , he insists , " There will be a depression in two years like nothing we 've seen before . "
Paul is a bankruptcy lawyer .
He 's very busy at the moment making money off other people 's bad judgment and bad luck .
And , being Irish , he has a genetic tendency to catastrophize .
Ca n't you feel the tension rising ?
We 're in the middle of a major cultural and economic shift .
Tension is rising with the cost of gas and food .
Gas has doubled in price over the past year and food costs are intimately connected to transportation costs .
Food banks are coming up short against increasing demand in cities all over the U.S. Jobs are less certain , school and home loans are less abundant , credit - card companies are less aggressively marketing to us .
We are selling large chunks of major financial companies to foreign countries .
Last December , Morgan Stanley sold a $ 5 billion stake in its investment firm to the Chinese government .
General Electric recently sold its plastics unit to a financial entity of the Saudi Arabian government for $ 11.6 billion .
Anheuser - Busch just got a $ 46.3 billion buyout bid from a Belgian beer company called InBev .
What 's more American than an ice - cold Bud on the Fourth of July ?
The number of Europeans buying condos in Manhattan doubled in the past year ; the weak dollar has made real estate on both coasts a bargain for foreigners .
Tension is also rising , literally , with tornadoes and floodwaters bombarding otherwise peaceful Iowa and the banks of the Mississippi threatening to spill over , while at the same time , hundreds of wildfires are ravaging northern California and an intense heat wave is burning southern California .
Violence is on the rise in several urban areas where poverty is rampant .
One weekend two months ago , there were so many shootings in Chicago — 36 to be exact — that the Chicago Sun - Times called it the " weekend of rage . "
I keep reading in local newspapers and hearing gossip about Seattle existing in a precious , protected economic bubble — and of course , we are doing better than , say , Miami — but you do n't have to look very hard to find people who are tapped and edgy .
The gruff man from Everett who patched the cracked walls in my house a month before I put it on the market said , " If the damned media would shut up , everything would go back to normal . "
More and more people are tapped and edgy .
And they should be .
Everybody has a theory about the future of the economy , or a theory about why the American infrastructure is crumbling .
It 's easiest to pin the failing economy on the blundering George W. Bush , who has become our misery mascot .
Or on SUVs that suck the oil fields dry , or arrogant meat eaters who kill by proxy politely in their kitchens .
One of my friends blames the fall of the American empire on a tax structure that favors the wealthy and deconstructs the middle class .
Barack Obama blames the Iraq war .
Then there 's blaming corporate greed , which is like pinning responsibility on a nameless star in a hardly visible solar system ; big money moves in abstract glyphs around us .
Corporations change shape and eat each other so quietly .
Daily stock - market numbers read like charts of tides .
In the end , we could get down to blaming ourselves and our own greed but that is a primal and tricky affair .
We do n't seem to be biologically wired for moderation .
Our primitive , sometimes inarticulate emotional systems often trump our reasoning powers .
Or we can just as easily unconsciously use our brains to elaborate theories to justify how we deserve everything we want .
We 're hungry , humans .
We like pretty , aromatic , tasty things .
We use things and the promise of things to attract each other .
We prefer pleasure , and we like our pain meted out in controlled doses .
We get outraged at one - dimensional Enron executives , but forgive less - conspicuous , less - ravenous acts of greed .
Think how weird it gets .
A single person can appear righteous when he drives around in a $ 30,000 hybrid car or uses green building materials to construct his $ 2 million house or to fix up his 15th rental property .
But a double - income couple with five children who buy a three - bedroom house beyond their means because they need it are easily , publicly made to seem irresponsible and greedy .
And what about the poor guy who spends most of his income on lottery tickets ?
Is n't he just part of the same continuum of greed , the same restless hunger to be filled , as the woman who invests all of her time and energy amassing a fortune in the stock market ?
Despite the fact that tension and uncertainty make me feel physically itchy , I have some sense that the credit bubble popping might drop some unexpected and pleasant surprises on us .
As the economy crumbles further under the weight of stacked illusions , we 're going to have to keep finding more creative ways to adapt .
That might make us more interdependent , more connected to one another .
I mean locally and globally — the world is becoming so intimate .
We 're going to survive by unsettling one another 's lives a little more .
We have reached the end of what author Philip Cushman in a 1990 article in American Psychologist called the " post World War II empty self " era .
Cushman writes about the change in America from the Victorian era of saving money and restricting impulses ( sexual and otherwise ) to the consumer self who is " soothed , organized , and made cohesive " by being filled up with food , objects , and celebrities .
Cushman blames psychology and advertising as tools of the financial power structure that created the consumer self by preying on humans ' abiding feelings of insecurity and doubt .
Credit made us more interesting and glamorous and more competitive with one another even if the things we purchased never did deliver the promised redemption of saving us from our limitations .
Maybe our next incarnation has to do with coming to terms with our repressed and twisted American ideas about money .
The way we culturally hold money is much like the way we used to hold sex in the 1950s .
Maybe someone should do an intensive Kinsey - style study on the money habits of Americans .
We can't talk openly about the subject .
It 's charged with more shame and self - consciousness than sex .
I tend to be kind of quirky and secretive around money , even from myself .
I make arbitrary limitations .
Like the other day , my friend found me a really good deal on a car , but I said it was too soon .
I want to want a car for a while longer before I get one .
I have to have a whole game in my head around it .
Suspended desire makes getting something more interesting .
Money is all wrapped up in psychological intrigue for me .
I 'm slow .
I ponder .
My old girlfriend always had to push me to buy things I basically needed .
Jackets , hair products , towels , whatever .
She was always trying to get me to put money into the house , too — fix up the floors , put in new window coverings — but I did n't see the point .
It seemed arbitrary .
We had fights about it , and later when we 'd finally get a rug or a new set of speakers or something , and she was exhausted from the effort , I 'd be happy .
But that did n't make it easier for her the next time .
Maybe I like the process , the whole narrative of being pushed .
I want money to buy me a good story .
Ikea furniture , or even walking into Ikea , makes me feel like a confused cow and sick to my stomach .
It 's like being in a poorly written romance novel full of flat , dowdy characters .
Nothing symbolic , nothing mysterious .
I think I 'm some kind of aesthetic monk .
In my family , this is called being Swiss .
My mom comes from dairy farmers .
They 're scrappy and kind of cheap except when it comes to the handful of things they 're passionate about , like Herefords and chocolate and opera tickets and plastic surgery .
That 's why I would be fine living in a tree house with the collected works of Sigmund Freud .
I got all excited a few weeks ago when I visited a friend 's house .
It was very small and full of beloved objects from her years living in Paris .
" I love this house , " I said .
She said , " Trisha , it 's kind of a dump . "
And I said , " What are you talking about ?
It feels like Paris in here . "
It was n't a knockoff of anything else ; it did n't have that inherent money - injected anxiety of needing an audience to confirm its beauty .
I have another friend who fills her much more elegant home with weird portraiture paintings from estate sales like she 's making her own chorus of ancestors .
That 's nice , too .
Money does n't motivate me .
But that 's not quite true , because I 'm also obsessed with it : understanding it , monitoring it , ticking off economic changes like I 'm an earthquake 's catfish .
When I was selling my house , I followed the real - estate market until I could feel the pulse of it .
Then I liked calculating out how much money to put into fixing it up and bargaining out the sale price , even though it was tense and made me have to pee a lot .
If I 'm going to buy a car , I have to do the same calculating thing .
I circle around a long time .
When I 'm ready , I hunt out the salesman I want to buy it from and court him or her before the bargaining phase .
What the hell .
I know that 's kooky .
What 's worse : I think it 's entertaining .
I 'll spend money easily when it comes to education or books , or anything that 's related to a kind of investment in depth , but I could give a shit about having expensive sunglasses , or whether my old car has seven or eight dents in it and smells like a dog .
It 's getting worn out in its temporary way .
It 's a car .
And when I 'm done with that car , like all the furniture I was done with from the house I just sold , I 'll probably just give it away or sell it cheap to someone I know .
I spend more money on plants than clothes .
I have a safe - deposit box , which I adore .
I like that it's in a special room at the bank .
I like that it 's a secret and you can sit in a little stinky - carpeted room and look at the contents .
I like that I 'm part of some secret invisible community of people who come and go from the speakeasy of the bank vault .
It satisfies my latent paranoia , and my need for mystery , and it 's kind of archaic .
Like looking in the Oxford English Dictionary for the microscopic history of a word using a magnifying glass .
Same strange , scientific feeling .
This is one more inherited Swiss trait , the love of the safe - deposit box .
When my uncle died , I had to go and empty the contents of his box , which was in a San Francisco bank .
At the time , I did n't even know people kept safe - deposit boxes anymore .
Now , my uncle — let me tell you — was a genuine kook .
I do n't hold a candle to him .
In his narrow metal box he kept his baby teeth , his mother 's gallstones , and a long lock of his mother 's hair from when it was still light brown .
It scared the shit out of me when I opened it , like stepping by surprise on a grass - covered grave .
I even got out of my chair .
Then I sat back down and my horror turned to fascination .
For the record , I do n't keep body parts in my box .
Just papers .
All of us have intimate and convoluted relationships with money that get entangled with the way we relate to ourselves and to other people .
It 's an uncomfortable process , exploring the nuances of what money means to us — owning the paradoxes of being cheap in some ways , impulsive and extravagant in others , fearful , irrational , arrogant , judgmental , desperate , calculating , hungry , narcissistic , dependent , easygoing , careless — all of the things we are .
There is some confusing equation involved in the basic capitalist notion that I am a functional object who is trying to improve my sense of value by adding pretty or useful objects to myself .
" Value added " — what the hell has that term come to mean ?
You hear it everywhere .
It 's become part of educational assessment , like the student is an object to add value to .
You can go online and read about nonprofits that deliver value - added services to clients who apparently become more value added by using the services .
Then there 's adding value to objects by how they are packaged so that they further enhance our lives .
Wired magazine reviewed the lamest value - added products last year to underscore the absurdity of the whole concept .
Among the lamest were H2 Om , a bottled water imbued with music to calm you ; BigOx , oxygen pressed into colorful cans to help you breathe better and give the mitochondria in your cells a lift ; and lemon - flavor - enhanced Aqua Ice cubes in sealed trays , because plain ice is n't quite enough .
In all of this , are n't we losing the intrinsic value of just being an awkward human being who wants to eat a half - decent burger and drink a glass of water ?
It drives me nuts , especially because we 're heading into the straits of value - diminishing times .
If my whole function is to acquire and consume , and my means to consume and my ability to consume are diminished , then who am I ?
I 'm an empty shell with some designer furniture that I 'm still trying to pay off .
I'm a clothes hanger with a stupid grin and a God in the closet .
I 'm bloated and bored , and too out of my own body to know that I 'm numbed out and half dead .
This is where the American business model of modern living has led us — to this place where we fall apart , and try to fix ourselves by filling ourselves with not - yet - broken things that are getting so damned expensive that it 's harder to get enough of them or to not notice that the pleasure they give is getting thinner .
I am just talking about myself .
I am talking about being a product , a product among products , an American .
It is tricky ; we have been so well sold to ourselves that we consider our access to potential debt as a kind of twisted freedom .
We are of money , from money , made for money .
From here , if I magnify out into the billions and trillions — all the couches and sweaters , all the guns and Hummers , all the corporate lunches , and Aveda conditioners , and doughnuts , and iPods , and George Foreman grills , and domain names , and DVDs , and erotic - sounding perfumes that smell bad , and billowy white drapes , and ottomans , and avatars , and pine - shaped air fresheners , and chicken Caesar salads with dressing on the side , and martinis and designer martinis , and tricked - up bikes , and DIY knitted socks from recycled yarn , and farmers ' market organic lettuce , and songbird - loving coffee from some South American farm where no one gets exploited , and Prada purses , and knockoff Rolex watches from Hong Kong , and cupcakes with purple frosting , and comic - book art , and lapsang souchong tea in a plain white cup , and flowing blouses that make someone look pregnant unless they 're already bone thin , and Che Guevara T - shirts , and fashionable Fidel Castro–style caps , and all of the other things that have been bought on the illusion of keeping us whole and special — then I feel closer to the idea of America 's debt , close enough to feel its anxious breathing .
No wonder we are a nervous country .
Our torn laundry , and our particular pathology around money , is hanging on the clothesline for everyone in the world to see .
Other countries have their own dirty laundry : Japan 's crashed stock market that it 's still climbing back from and France 's suburban riots over access to work and opportunity .
But we 're the country that has still been offering up the illusion that a person can pull herself up by the bootstraps and participate in the dream .
So what has a home become in all of this ?
And what is the American dream of owning a home — which was a promise among promises , a kind of birthright we were told we were entitled to ?
Owning makes good sense , right ?
It shows stability and maturity .
Ironically , the image of stability has become more important than actual emotional and financial stability .
When that uncle of mine died , he left me money specifically earmarked for purchasing a home — that 's why I had one .
His probate lawyer , who also represented people who wanted to leave all their money to their pets , said , " Now you can live in your dream house . "
The concept baffled me .
The only dream house I could conjure was an Airstream trailer in Pozo , California — which is to say , a home in the middle of nowhere , a home that I could relocate if need be .
Suddenly I had access to a dream that was n't necessarily my own , but was an existing pressure in me , a family pressure , a cultural pressure .
At the center of my deepest doubt was an object , a house , that had been placed in me , and I had to find it externally .
So I started to look for " a dream house . "
I looked at 100 houses .
Fortunately , as the child of two real - estate agents , I have the gene that helps me find a great house .
Plus I have , as I mentioned , that obsessive , restless need to search while I home in on the perfect purchase .
I just lack the other requisite gene that makes me want to live in the house I find .
I picked a house that my uncle would have loved and that the woman I was in love with would have loved , and did love .
And I loved it , too , but it always felt like a shirt four sizes too big .
I was more attached to the image of what owning that pretty house made me , as if it stood for me and I could hide my insecurities in its rooms .
At that point , I did n't recognize my insecurities as being market hooks or triggers or whatever I 'm beginning to understand that they are now .
I was n't big on reflecting at that point .
I just felt driven and tense .
I thought something like : I have to have this house .
It 's me .
The girl will love it .
Maybe I 'll leave the kids ' pirate fort up in the backyard because it 's quirky .
I picked a house with a territorial view in a coveted neighborhood ; it had good bones .
Most of all , it was very private : a real urban retreat .
There were 36 steps up from the street .
A friend of my girlfriend 's referred to it as " the ziggurat . "
Initially , that was funny ; later , that became symbolic of everything that was disconnected and wrong about living there .
What first seemed like a retreat became a kind of citadel .
Plus , in order to stay there , I had to live beyond my means , which I could have kept doing by juggling around equity loans and going on medication for the extreme anxiety it caused in me .
But just the money acrobatics did n't cap it .
What capped it all in the end is that I ran square into my own isolation .
I was working at the time , working at a job that involved listening to people talk about feelings of loneliness and emptiness all day .
Being in proximity to those dark feelings , which I was trying to avoid in myself , was disturbing .
Then my dog died of acute leukemia .
He was young .
It was a freak thing , like a tornado or a Midwestern flood , both dreadfully slow and sudden at the same time .
It continued the process of unraveling me ; it exposed the void I was trying to inhabit .
The false dream house seemed to grow more ominously large and lonely .
Next , my relationship fell apart , but not in a dramatic way .
Like the economy , it had been crumbling for a while and left us stumbling around for words .
We just looked at each other one sad day and knew it was over .
After all that , the house was just an empty thing I 'd awkwardly wrapped around myself .
I felt like I could n't stay there ; but I also was n't going to get the opportunity to just walk away unscathed .
In order to sell a house , you have to make someone else covet it .
You have to take yourself back out of it and make it into an empty object of consumption for someone else to invest a self into .
The relationship between the seller and the buyer is formal and made awkward and angular by that formality .
There is no direct communication ; everything is herded and corralled and legally bordered by real - estate agents and mortgage companies so that you do n't get to pass on discoveries and stories as you pass along the object to the next owner .
There are contracts ; there is a mutual acceptance of illusions .
It all seemed desperately disappointing .
Every nook and cranny of the house needed to be fixed or touched .
The basement needed to be dug out , the upstairs bathroom torn apart .
Walls had cracks to be fixed and then needed painting .
For four months , the house was full of unfamiliar , curious people from the suburbs and the islands .
My precious privacy was turned upside down .
Within a small window of time , my bathroom was being gutted by a guy who lived in a yurt on Vashon , and there were two burly men , like the grave diggers from Hamlet , digging out my basement with shovels and discovering all these cool artifacts like glasses and health cards and combs and toys and old bottles .
It was fantastic , really : Being unsettled became equated in my mind with being alive .
I started to feel like I was as much under construction as the house .
My sense of self was all mixed up in the house as a reflection of my being okay in the world .
I had to decathect myself ( if to cathect is to fall in love with or to invest one 's whole being into , in a Freudian sense ) from the hardwood floors and the appliances .
It was strange to finally be fixing up the house as my old girlfriend had always been pushing me to do , knowing all the while the improvements were n't going to benefit me .
All of that was fine and abstractly beautiful until there were problems with the sewer system .
Then I was filled with an overwhelming , generalized limbic dread .
I mean , if we stick with the house metaphor , then having to scope out , clean , and repair old sewer pipes was kind of like mucking around in the root - bound hollows of my own unconscious .
Not a pretty place .
My deepest doubts were like golems , like root - balls and shit .
I hated it .
I further resisted the vision of all the private sewer pipes joining together under the street into one larger , collective sewer .
I have never seen the insides of my own intestinal system , but if I imagine that I were made of clay instead of tissue and someone was pushing a camera through me , the repulsion factor and the grip of the stomach would be about the same .
It is strange that we all share a foreign , wormlike core .
That was way too much for me , except that even the sewer experience was lifted by this joke - cracking plumber who made fixing clay pipes seem like bowling .
There are people who show up in crises and lead you through really uncomfortable places , people like hospice workers , anesthesiologists , midnight taxi drivers , and plumbers .
What I 'm describing here is an existential crisis : a bunch of seemingly solid things , including my sense of myself , crumbling .
What was emerging was less numb and more interesting , less isolated and more vulnerable to the rising tension in the air .
I gave away most of my furniture on Craigslist , which brought more intriguing visitors from the suburbs .
I liked helping strangers carry heavy meaningful things down the ziggurat staircase and then away , strapped with bungee cords to shiny trucks .
I was reentering a world of incongruities that I had shut out .
Where I used to embrace isolation , I was now becoming obsessed with the idea of relationship and being in the center of more chaos .
I moved to an apartment on a very busy street .
There 's a construction site next door , which makes me tense and happy simultaneously .
I continue spending my days hearing stories of emptiness and loneliness , but I 'm not trying to hold myself apart from that anymore .
If it is possible to feel more like a human and less like a functional object among objects , that 's what I feel .
That is my microcosmic experience of what the country seems to be undergoing .
The infrastructure of our collective American illusions is breaking down , but on some level that is only conceptual .
Money is conceptual .
It acts like a hormone or a dopamine trigger .
Once the mortgage crisis ends , there will be a crisis of credit - card defaults , a crisis of car - loan defaults .
There are going to be some pissed - off people who feel betrayed , and some deflated people who feel completely worthless — both are defenses against an impending feeling of emptiness .
I realized yesterday that my tax rebate check , which may never find its way to my new apartment , seems more like a cry for help from the government than an act of assistance .
It is a last - ditch , shortsighted attempt to prop up the illusion of a way of life that can't be sustained on a national — or a personal — level .
It 's enough to buy something pretty or pay one ledge off a big credit - card bill .
It 's enough to make the heart slow down , just for a second , before the backhoe loader next door starts crashing around again , taking dirt out of a big hole and piling it somewhere else .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wachovia Corp WB.N and Washington Mutual Inc WM.N led several large U.S. banks in posting weak second - quarter results on Tuesday , hurt by soaring losses from mortgages and other debt .
Wachovia reported a $ 8.86 billion loss , while Washington Mutual said it lost $ 3.33 billion .
Two Ohio - based regional banks , Fifth Third Bancorp FITB.O and KeyCorp KEY.N , also posted losses .
Southeast regional banks Regions Financial Corp RF.N and SunTrust Banks Inc STI.N each said profit fell .
Wachovia and Regions also slashed their dividends , while Wachovia , Fifth Third and KeyCorp incurred charges from their tax treatment of some lease transactions .
Lenders are suffering as the U.S. housing crisis deepens , making it harder for consumers , businesses and homebuilders to stay current on their loans .
“ There is no easy fix , ” said Michael Nix , who helps invest $ 750 million at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood , South Carolina .
“ We have to see stabilization in housing and , until we see that , it ’s hard to get comfortable . ”
Bank shares nevertheless soared after Wachovia said it would not sell common stock to raise capital .
Wachovia shares closed up 27.4 percent , Fifth Third up 11.7 percent , KeyCorp up 4.3 percent , SunTrust up 16.2 percent , Regions up 9.6 percent and Washington Mutual up 6.2 percent .
The KBW Bank Index .
BKX rose 8.9 percent and has risen 39.7 percent in the last week .
Part of those gains came as Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N , JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N , Citigroup Inc C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N reported results that were not as bad as investors feared .
Still , “ the banking industry is suffering from the tail - end effects of a burst housing bubble , ” said Gerard Cassidy , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Portland , Maine .
“ What dominates results now is good , old - fashioned credit deterioration .
We ’re going to see more . ”
WACHOVIA , WASHINGTON MUTUAL
The $ 8.86 billion loss at Charlotte , North Carolina - based Wachovia , the fourth - largest U.S. bank , equaled $ 4.20 per share , and compared with a profit of $ 2.34 billion , or $ 1.22 per share , a year earlier .
Wachovia slashed its quarterly dividend 87 percent to 5 cents per share , its second cut this year , and set plans to eliminate more than 10,700 jobs .
Excluding items , the loss was $ 2.67 billion , or $ 1.27 per share , compared with the average analyst estimate for a loss of $ 1.30 per share , according to Reuters Estimates .
Wachovia wrote down $ 6.06 billion for assets that lost value and added $ 4.19 billion to reserves for bad loans .
It was hurt by its disastrous $ 24.2 billion purchase in October 2006 of mortgage specialist Golden West Financial Corp .
On a conference call , new Chief Executive Robert Steel said Wachovia would be “ realistic and balanced and cautious , ” as well as “ prudently paranoid , ” in working through the credit environment .
Seattle - based Washington Mutual ’s loss equaled $ 3.34 per share , excluding the effects of a recent capital raising , and compared with a profit of $ 830 million , or 92 cents per share , a year earlier .
Analysts expected a loss of $ 1.09 per share .
The largest U.S. savings and loan set aside $ 5.91 billion for loan losses and expects cumulative residential mortgage loan losses to be “ toward the upper end ” of the $ 12 billion to $ 19 billion range it forecast in April .

Built back in the 10th century , the incredible well of Chand Baori , India was a practical solution to the water problem in the area .
The arid climate forced the locals to dig deep for a dependable water source , one that would last throughout an entire year .
Chand Baori well is 30 meters deep , it has 13 floors and 3,500 steps .
Legends say that ghosts build it in one night and that it has so many steps to make it impossible for someone to retrieve a coin once it ’s been dropped in the well .
The taxpayers ’ predicament over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is already grave enough .
The Bush administration has asked Congress for a massive rescue package for the twin “ government - sponsored ” mortgage investors and insurers , and the Fed has announced that it will extend short - term lending to both Fannie and Freddie .
Graver still , though , is the fact that the rest of the world of supposedly “ high ” finance is becoming more like Fannie and Freddie , with potentially disastrous consequences for the American economy and taxpayer .
What are Fannie and Freddie — and why should we care ?
The two behemoths sponsor about half of the nation ’s home mortgages , mostly of the old - fashioned , fixed - rate variety .
They ’ve guaranteed three - quarters of recent mortgages since the credit crisis began , up from 40 percent a couple of years ago , when investors were so optimistic about housing prices that they did n’t find the guarantees necessary .
These mortgage guarantees , as well as the companies ’ borrowing to support their own investments in mortgages , account for virtually all of Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s $ 5.4 trillion in liabilities .
A trillion here , a trillion there , and soon you ’re talking about real money — more than one - third of the annual gross domestic product , in fact .
Yet this mass of obligation sits on a razor - thin base .
Fannie and Freddie hold only about $ 80 billion in actual capital , or under 2 percent of all of those potential liabilities .
They get the rest of their money through borrowing .
And because their borrowing matures regularly , they must raise new billions every month .
What this precarious capital structure means is that Fan and Fred have scarily little room for error .
If the value of the mortgage loans they hold or guarantee declines by just a few percent , their capital is wiped out .
William Poole , former chief of the St. Louis Fed , helped set off a run on the firms ’ shares last week by noting that Freddie was already technically insolvent , thanks to the decline in home values over the past two years ( though the situation had been clear in May ) .
Why did lenders and shareholders , then , give such dangerous companies money to play with , especially on Fan ’s and Fred ’s customarily cheap terms ?
The answer is that while Fannie and Freddie are technically private firms , their debt has come with an implied government guarantee .
Everyone has long believed that Fannie and Freddie are “ too big to fail ” : that is , that the feds would never let them fall into bankruptcy , for two reasons .
One , they ’re crucial to the nation ’s mortgage markets , partly because it ’s hard for other firms to compete with their once - implicit government backing .
Two , they ’re crucial to the nation ’s broader financial markets , having wrapped themselves in a web of guarantees , insurance contracts , and derivatives that makes Bear Stearns ’s business look as straightforward as a lemonade stand .
As for shareholders , sure , back in March the Fed allowed Bear Stearns ’s shareholders to lose nearly everything while rescuing its bondholders , and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has said that he does n’t want Fan ’s and Fred ’s shareholders to benefit from any bailout .
But the government ’s role is more complicated in this case .
Uncle Sam could never find someone to buy Fannie or Freddie in a crisis at a cut-rate price the way JPMorgan bought Bear ; Fannie and Freddie are just too big .
The financial disaster that their failure would create , however , would mean near - certain depression , and the government ’s alternative , a federal takeover that would mean increasing the national debt by half , is only slightly more attractive .
The Bush administration ’s move this week — asking Congress to allow the federal government to step in , if necessary , to buy shares of the two companies and lend them potentially hundreds of billions of dollars — bears out this stark reality .
But how did the government get into the business of protecting Fannie and Freddie ?
Back in the 1930s , private lending for most activities , including home building and buying , had pretty much stopped , partly because banks had lent heavily against both stock - market and real - estate securities in the twenties and simply had no money left to lend once the value of that collateral evaporated .
John Fahey , the chair of the Federal Home Loan Bank , said in 1938 that “ overspeculation in real estate ” had proven “ as dangerous to the general welfare as is overspeculation in securities . ”
The solution to the problem of banks ’ inability and reluctance to lend was to create a new federal home - loan agency that would , in the words of the National Association of Real Estate Boards ’ finance chair , Edward A. MacDougall , provide a “ balance wheel . ”
The lender “ wants stabilized practice as the best assurance of the safety of his loan , ” while the borrower “ wants assurance against getting caught in any such dearth of mortgage funds as was experienced in recent years . ”
The Federal National Mortgage Association — the parent of today ’s Fannie Mae — was born in 1938 , and the New York Times reported that “ a better and sounder mortgage structure is being built out of the experience of past mortgage difficulties . ”
Fannie and Freddie are close to the government , then , partly because Fannie used to be part of the government , from its creation until the feds quasi- privatized it in the late sixties .
Today , though , the American taxpayer faces the worst of both worlds .
Government involvement in the mortgage industry through modern history made all mortgages seem safer than they were , while private - sector speculation over the past decade infected Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s government - supported mortgage market with huge risk .
Fannie and Freddie were n’t responsible for most of the mortgage industry ’s worst excesses over the past decade .
Neither led the way in risky subprime or exotic mortgages ( though they were hardly innocent victims ) .
But part of the reason private investors were so happy to lend all that money to customers of Countrywide and IndyMac — two major private mortgage lenders — was that the long history of largely government - backed mortgage bonds lulled them into thinking that any mortgage was a safe investment .
Last week , the FDIC took over IndyMac , a huge California bank that specialized in mortgages not backed by either Fannie or Freddie , while Bank of America ’s purchase of Countrywide , which threw itself into the most exotic mortgages , likely saved the feds from intervening there .
Though most of Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s loans did n’t seem as risky as those held by the banks , the collateral that backs them — that is , homes — was bloated by the asset speculation fueled largely in the private markets .
Today , Fannie and Freddie , and thus taxpayers , face the risk that as property values fall , even borrowers of the 30 - year , fixed - rate mortgages that Fannie and Freddie guarantee will walk away from assets that are n’t worth anywhere near what they owe on them .
Because Fannie and Freddie operate on such razor - thin margins , only a relative few homeowners have to make this decision , or be forced into it by economic straits , to plunge the companies into catastrophe .
Just as worrisome is the fact that Fannie and Freddie are actually loosening their lending standards today to help the government in its effort to stem foreclosures .
If even moderate losses force Fannie to conserve its cash , then it ca n’t make new mortgages , even to good borrowers — freezing an already chilly market .
So the government has put taxpayers in an unenviable position .
It ’s true that we ’ve made Fannie and Freddie so powerful that we ca n’t let them fail .
But if home prices continue to drop , the government ’s now - explicit backing of Fannie and Freddie , into the trillions , imperils the sterling credit rating of the U.S. government itself , just as that government needs to conserve its resources to pay the coming bill for retiring baby boomers ’
Social Security and Medicare benefits .
Even if Fannie and Freddie were isolated cases , the situation would be bad .
But the squeeze gets worse .
The U.S. government has spent the past few months creating mini-Fannies and mini-Freddies out of the nation ’s supposedly risk - taking investment banks .
The Fed ’s engineering of the Bear Stearns bailout and its decision to allow surviving investment banks to borrow from the Fed — a privilege previously reserved for tightly regulated commercial banks — demonstrates that Uncle Sam wo n’t let a big investment bank go bankrupt .
Now , just as lenders to Freddie and Fannie never worried much about what the companies were doing with all that money , lenders to the investment banks can worry less about the risks those banks are taking .
And as the Fed ’s guarantee of $ 28 billion of Bear Stearns ’s riskiest assets and its lending to other investment banks shows , it ’s taxpayers who will bear the ultimate cost .
As for the idea that better regulation of investment banks can cut this new risk for taxpayers : armies of Washington regulators have long overseen Fannie and Freddie .
Those regulators did n’t stop the current meltdown .
Instead , they contributed to it by making the government - coddled mortgage industry seem insulated from speculation .
Fannie and Freddie artfully captured their regulators long ago , seducing them into allowing tiny capital margins and greater risk .
Does anyone doubt that the investment banks , with immense wealth and sophistication , can do the same ?
Giving the Fannie and Freddie treatment to investment banks , along with the attendant government regulation , could make investment - bank risk - taking seem risk - free — just as it made homeownership seem bulletproof .
Meanwhile , even riskier activity will escape such regulation , moving into new areas that financiers will enlarge or invent to escape regulators , until it , too , becomes “ too big to fail . ”
The government long ago painted itself into such a tight corner with its socialization and ratification of market risk via Fannie and Freddie that we ’ll need luck to escape the current crisis without serious long - term damage to our economy and national finances .
At this point , the government ca n’t do much to reduce the risk that the two mortgage giants — and the investment banks — have already taken on .
Its recent actions only transfer that risk to taxpayers .
All of that concentrated risk could go sour as the values of the assets backing existing loans continues to decline , pushing ever more borrowers and guarantors into default .
If the government ’s responsibility for this risk starts to fray America ’s finances in earnest , its backup plan is apparently to hope that the taxpayers ’ creditors — including the Chinese government — continue to consider America too big to fail .
IN HIS farewell address , George Washington gave warning of the dangers of political parties .
Whenever possible , he said , each party would “ make the public administration the mirror of the ill - concerted and incongruous projects of faction . ”
Mexico 's state - run oil company , Pemex , is accustomed to being the victim of ill - concerting , probably because it provides close to 40 % of the government 's revenue .
It is also in decline .
Since 2005 , daily production has dropped more than 300,000 barrels per day , or some 10 % of the total .
Reserves have been falling since the mid-1980s .
Since the beginning of the year , Mexican politicians have been wrapped up in a debate about how to revive Pemex , which controls all aspects of petroleum in Mexico , from offshore exploration to the pump .
It is riddled with wastefulness .
Mexico has to import over 40 % of its petrol because of a lack of refining capacity .
It then resells it at subsidised prices to the public .
Some $ 20 billion will be spent on the subsidy this year .
It is hard to get rid of , both because of the direct political impact that ending it would have and because of fear of provoking inflation .
All parties agree that things look bad .
There is also some consensus that deepwater exploration of the type that has been so successful in Brazil is now necessary .
But there is no agreement on how to fund it , or where to get the technical expertise for deepwater drilling from .
This wrangling reveals much about Mexico 's underlying thinking about the respective roles of the state and the private sector .
The country 's constitution states that the petroleum industry is the exclusive province of the state .
The centre - right government of Felipe Calderón decided not to attempt to change this , reckoning that the secondary laws that spell out what the constitution means allow enough wiggle room for its plan .
Mr Calderón proposed a package of reforms in April after months of behind - the - scenes negotiation with the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , a centrist opposition party that had been his ally in previous reforms to the state pension system and the public finances .
Mr Calderón wants incentive - based contracts for deepwater exploration , to allow private industry to build refineries , and to make a series of changes to Pemex 's corporate structure that would give it more autonomy while remaining part of the government .
The opposition dislikes even this limited involvement of the private sector .
It can draw on popular antipathy towards the privatisation of banks and telecoms , which left assets in the hands of a small number of wealthy people and did not always result in the promised vigorous competition .
Besides , argues Francisco Javier Castellón Fonseca , a senator in the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , the oil price is so high that private capital is hardly necessary .
Despite being split by an internal struggle over the party leadership , the one thing that unites the various factions of the PRD is opposition to the government 's plan .
Not all of the debate has been so high - minded .
Much of it has been driven by political posturing , with each party trying to stake out a favourable position for the mid-term elections to be held next year .
Mr Calderón had hoped to get a reform passed quickly .
This was stymied by the opposition PRD , which seized the floor of the Chamber of Deputies and forced Mr Calderón and the PRI to subject the reform to several months of expert testimony in the Senate .
This process came to an end on July 22nd .
To keep the brakes on the changes , the opposition is now organising a series of unofficial referendums on the government 's proposal and on privatisation .
The first will be on July 27th in Mexico City and nine states , with two more rounds to follow on the August 10th and 24th .
These votes will have no legal standing but they do have the power to irritate the government .
The referendum “ is an action that can not be recognised if we live under the rule of law , ” says Jordy Herrera , the under - secretary of planning in the energy ministry .
“ The only goal of the referendum is to divide Mexicans . ”
Turnout is likely to be low , and those who do vote will almost certainly reject the government 's proposals by an overwhelming majority .
Despite the president 's high approval ratings , Ricardo Samaniego of ITAM , a university in Mexico City , says that Mr Calderón now needs to make a calculation as to how much he is willing to dilute his reform .
In any case , the plan will not be approved wholesale when Congress reconvenes in September .
César Hernández of CIDAC , a think - tank in Mexico City , reckons the president may be ready to compromise .
“ I believe the government is willing to invest political capital even in a mediocre reform , ” he says .
That would at least allow the government to declare victory and move on to the 2009 elections .
The outcome of Mexico 's energy reform therefore looks like being just the sort of thing that George Washington warned against .
Perhaps next time the oil company should try reforming the parties instead .
SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) -- James Robinson is a retired Air National Guard brigadier general and a commercial pilot for a major airline who flies passenger planes around the country .
James Robinson is a retired brigadier general and a commercial pilot .
His name is on the terrorist " watch list . "
He has even been certified by the Transportation Security Administration to carry a weapon into the cockpit as part of the government 's defense program should a terrorist try to commandeer a plane .
But there 's one problem : James Robinson , the pilot , has difficulty even getting to his plane because his name is on the government 's terrorist " watch list . "
That means he can't use an airport kiosk to check in ; he can't do it online ; he can't do it curbside .
Instead , like thousands of Americans whose names match a name or alias used by a suspected terrorist on the list , he must go to the ticket counter and have an agent verify that he is James Robinson , the pilot , and not James Robinson , the terrorist .
" Shocking 's a good word ; frustrating , " Robinson -- the pilot -- said .
" I 'm carrying a weapon , flying a multimillion - dollar jet with passengers , but I 'm still screened as , you know , on the terrorist watch list . "
The American Civil Liberties Union estimates more than 1 million names have been added to the watch list since the September 11 attacks .
The FBI , which manages the Terrorist Screening Database , disputes that figure .
It says that there are about 400,000 actual people on the list and that about 95 percent of those people are not U.S. citizens .
Watch how three people found themselves on terror watch list »
" There 's going to come a point in time where everybody 's on the list , " Robinson said .
Robinson is not the only person with that name flagged on the list .
Since airing a story this summer about how Correspondent Drew Griffin began getting told he was on the watch list -- coincidentally after he wrote a series critical of the TSA 's Federal Air Marshal Service -- CNN has received dozens of e-mails and iReport submissions from viewers who also have found themselves on the watch list .
It turns out that three people named " James Robinson " found their names on the list in early 2005 .
iReport.com :
Do you think your name is on the list ?
Besides the airline pilot , there 's the James Robinson who served as U.S. attorney in Detroit , Michigan , and as an assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration ; and James Robinson of California , who loves tennis , swimming and flying to the East Coast to see his grandmother .
He's 8 .
The third - grader has been on the watch list since he was 5 years old .
Asked whether he is a terrorist , he said , " I do n't know . "
Though he does n't even know what a terrorist is , he is embarrassed that trips to the airport cause a ruckus , said his mother , Denise Robinson .
Denise Robinson said that no one in the government even told her her son is on the watch list but that it was n't hard to figure out .
Checking in at curbside three years ago , the family was told they could n't get boarding passes and were hustled to the ticket counter .
She said the ticket agent made a number of phone calls and kept asking which among her husband and two sons was James .
" And all of a sudden he says , ' How old is he ? ' " Robinson recounted .
She said she responded numerous times , " He 's 5 . "
The agent handed them paperwork and refused to tell them what the problem was but urged them to fill out the forms .
The documents were Department of Homeland Security paperwork to get off the watch list .
Not knowing which of the three might be targeted , she sent in the required documents for the entire family -- and got back one letter , addressed to James .
Congress has demanded that the TSA and Homeland Security fix the problems with the list that are making travel so difficult for so many Americans .
Prominent lawmakers , including Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and civil rights leader - turned - Georgia congressman John Lewis , also have encountered watch list difficulties .
" I want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities : the Department of Homeland Security and the attorney general of the United States , " said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D - Texas , who has called for investigations into why Griffin wound up on the list after his critical reporting .
The FBI wo n't confirm any name on the list .
And the TSA says Kennedy and Lewis are n't on the list , even though they have been stopped .
But although the list is clearly bloated with misidentifications by every official 's account , CNN has learned that it may also be ineffective .
Numerous people , including all three Robinsons , have figured out that there are ways not to get flagged by the watch list .
Denise Robinson says she tells the skycaps her son is on the list , tips heavily and is given boarding passes .
And booking her son as " J. Pierce Robinson " also has let the family bypass the watch list hassle .
Capt .
James Robinson said he has learned that " Jim Robinson " and " J.K. Robinson " are not on the list .
And Griffin has tested its effectiveness .
When he runs his first and middle name together when making a reservation online , he has no problem checking in at the airport .
The TSA has said the problem lies with the airlines and threatened to fine airlines that tell passengers they are on the watch list .
That did n't sit well with the airlines , who through the Air Transport Association said they have been waiting for four years for the TSA to come up with a fix .
Those comments apparently sparked a recent meeting between TSA chief Kip Hawley and airline representatives .
Following that meeting , a spokesman for the ATA said the airlines and TSA would cooperate to make things work .
But then last week , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff seemed to re-ignite the controversy over who is to blame for the watch list failure .
" We told the airlines we would allow them , if someone gave a birth date , to exclude that person from the list , " Chertoff said during a question - and - answer session at the University of Southern California .
" Let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk , just like everyone else .
Some airlines have done this ; some have chosen not to because they do n't want to spend the money . "
Chertoff then implied that the financially strapped airlines might comply if they could make money from the process .
" And their attitude is , ' Well , TSA gets the blame for it , ' so I guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it -- but I hate to suggest that .
I may give them an idea , " he said .
The ATA , the trade association for the airlines , said carriers will work with the TSA and said enrolling in a frequent - flyer program could help .
" We are now awaiting TSA 's announced January 2009 implementation of the Secure Flight Program , which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers , " the association said in a written statement .
" In the meantime , the airlines worked collaboratively with TSA to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience .
...
A key part of that short - term solution relies on frequent - flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll . "
All the Robinsons are enrolled in frequent - flyer programs , and all have filled out the paperwork that Chertoff said is an easy way to get them off the watch list .
But it has been three years since all three James Robinsons filled out those forms , and their cases have yet to be resolved .

The Buddha 's ' Undetermined Questions ' and the Religions
( pdf available here )
In considering the ' conflicting truth claims ' of the different religions we need not only a theory of religious knowledge but also a theory of religious ignorance .
And we have a very good start to this in the Buddha 's doctrine of the avaykata , the undetermined , or unanswered , questions .
The ten undetermined questions
There are two main texts in the Pali scriptures , Suttas 63 and 72 of the Majjhima Nikaya , each with the same list of ten propositions or ' views ' ( ditthi ) :
1 . The world is eternal .
2 . The world is not eternal .
3 . The world is ( spatially ) infinite .
4 . The world is not ( spatially ) infinite .
5 . The soul ( jiva ) is identical with the body .
6 . The soul is not identical with the body .
7. The Tathagata ( a perfectly enlightened being ) exists after death .
8 . The Tathagata does not exist after death .
9 . The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death .
10 . The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death .
The issues dealt with by these ten propositions fall into two categories , which I shall call respectively unanswered questions and unanswerable questions .
( Whether this distinction was in the mind of Gautama , or in the minds of the editors
of the Pali canon , I do not profess to know . )
The Buddha refused to give any teaching about these issues , although the monk Malunkyaputta challenged him , ' If the Lord knows that the world is eternal , let the Lord explain to me that the world is eternal .
If the Lord knows that the world is not eternal , let the Lord explain to me that the world is not eternal .
If the Lord does not know whether the world is eternal or whether the world is not eternal , then , not knowing , not seeing , this would be honest , namely to say , ' I do not know , I do not see ' .
And likewise with the other questions ( Majjhima Nikaya , 63:427 ) .
But the Buddha 's fundamental point - which was always for him the soteriological point - was that to know the answers to these questions is not necessary for liberation and that to treat them as though they were will only hinder our advance toward liberation .
To make his point he told the parable of the man pierced by a poisoned arrow .
If he insists , before receiving medical treatment , on knowing who shot the arrow , and of what clan he is , what kind of bow he was using , what the bow string and the shaft of the arrow were made of , from what kind of bird the feathers on the arrow came , and so on , he will die before his thirst for knowledge is satisfied .
Likewise , if we distract ourselves from the path to enlightenment by trying to settle these disputed cosmological and metaphysical issues we may well fail to be healed from birth , ageing , dying , grief , sorrow , suffering , lamentation and despair .
And so these matters are set aside by the Buddha because such knowledge 'is not connected with the goal , is not fundamental to the Brahma - faring , and does not conduce to turning away from , nor to dispassion , stopping , calming , super - knowledge , awakening nor to nibbana ' ( Ibid. , 63:431 ) .
Unanswered and unanswerable questions
This applies to both of the two kinds of issues .
The difference between them is , however , of considerable interest .
The first , consisting of what I am calling the unanswered questions , are questions to which there is a true answer although we do not in fact know what it is .
On the face of it Malunkyaputta 's protest is reasonable .
The world must be either eternal or not eternal , etc .
He reckons that if the Buddha has attained insight into all things he will know which .
And indeed it may be that the Buddha does know ; this is not clear from the Pali scriptures .
But whether or not he knows , he insists that the answer is not necessary for liberation and that to treat it as soteriologically important would only distract Malunkyputta from a single - minded striving to attain nirvana .
The second kind of issue is illustrated by the question , asked by the monk Vaccagotta , about the state of the Tathagata after death .
A Tathagata is a fully enlightened being , a Buddha , and the question concerns the ultimate conclusion of the process of finite human existence .
This is not the question of the fate after death of ordinary unenlightened individuals ; the Buddha 's answer to that was the doctrine of rebirth .
In response to Vaccagotta 's question he rejects as inapplicable the entire range of possible answers in terms of which the question was posed - namely , by specifying in what sphere the Tathagata arises after death :
' Arise ' , Vaccha , does not apply .
Well , then , good Gotama , does he not arise ?
' Does not arise ' , Vaccha , does not apply .
Well then , good Gotama , does he both arise and not arise ?
' Both arises and does not arise ' , Vaccha , does not apply .
Well then , good Gotama , does he neither arise nor not arise ?
' Neither arises nor does not arise ' , Vaccha , does not apply ( Ibid. , 72 : 486 ) .
Vaccha then expresses his bewilderment and disappointment , and the Buddha responds , ' You ought to be at a loss , Vaccha , you ought to be bewildered .
For Vaccha , this dhamma is deep , difficult to see , difficult to understand , peaceful , excellent , beyond dialectics , subtle , intelligible to the wise . . ' ( Ibid. , 487 ) - referring all the time to the mystery of parinirvana , nirvana beyond this life .
It is misleading to say that after death the Tathagata - that is , the fully enlightened individual that we know in this life - exists , or does not exist , or both exists and does not exist , or neither exists nor non-exists beyond this life .
The Buddha then illustrates the idea of a question which is so put that it has no answer by speaking of a flame that has been quenched .
In which direction has the flame gone - east , west , north or south ?
None of the permitted answers applies .
Likewise what happens after the bodily death of a Tathagata cannot be expressed in our available categories of thought .
For the analogy of the quenched flame is not intended to indicate one particular answer , namely nonexistence .
For ' Freed from denotation by consciousness ' , Gautama says , 'is the Tathagata , Vaccha , he is deep , immeasurable , unfathomable as is the great ocean ' ( Ibid. , 488 ) .
The difference , then , between the two kinds of avaykata is this .
The unanswered questions are legitimate questions to which there are true answers , but to which we do not in fact know the answers .
It is not excluded , in logic , that human beings might some day come to know the truth of these matters .
But it would still be the case that salvation / liberation neither depends upon not is assisted by such knowledge , and that the search for it as a religious end is not conducive to salvation / liberation .
In distinction from these , the unanswerable questions are about realities transcending the systems of categories available in our human thought and language .
They are matters which , in St Paul 's words , ' No eye has seen , nor ear heard , nor the heart of man conceived ' ( I Corinthians 2:9 ) .
It seems appropriate to refer to the subject matter of these unanswerable questions as mysteries , matters that are beyond human comprehension and expression .
But once again we do not , according to the Buddha , need to be able to penetrate these mysteries in order to attain to liberation ; and to feel that we must hold a view concerning them is soteriologically counterproductive .
The sciences , then , are left to do their own legitimate work of finding out what the physical universe is composed of , and how it works , without it 's conclusions affecting either way the dharma , the saving religious truth .
The Buddha would not , then , have endorsed the contemporary attempts to use the Big Bang or the anthropic principle or the concept of emergence , or any other aspect of physics or of scientific cosmology , as a new form of natural theology leading ' from science to God ' .
Nor , on the other hand , would he have supported the labours of theologians over the centuries , using Christian examples , who have developed complex systems of doctrine about the attributes of God , and whether or not God has ' middle knowledge ' ( knowledge of what all humans would freely do in all possible circumstances ) , and how one person ( Jesus ) could have two natures , one human and the other divine , and whether or not the members of the Trinity are three distinct centres of consciousness , etc. , etc .
All such matters would come , for him , under the heading of speculative views , the pursuit of which is not relevant to salvation .
Living in a ' need to know ' universe
Those of us who are not Buddhists should nevertheless be open to benefiting from the Buddha 's very challenging insights .
It could be that the universe operates on a ' need to know ' basis and that what , religiously , we need to know is soteriological rather than metaphysical .
If so , the doctrinal differences between the religious traditions , responding in their distinctively different ways to the various unanswered and unanswerable ( because wrongly posed ) questions , will not affect the all - important matter of salvation / liberation .
This is the possibility that I now want to explore .
The ' conflicting truth claims ' of the different religions are of three kinds : in ascending order of importance , first , historical issues ; second , what I shall call ( for want of a better name ) trans - historical issues ; and third , conceptions of the ultimate reality to which the religions are , on a religious interpretation of them , different responses .
I want to suggest that these three sets of issues all concern either unanswered or unanswerable questions , which naturally evoke theories and guesses but concerning which knowledge is not necessary for salvation / liberation .
Historical issues
Consider first conflicts of historical truth - claims .
( I mean ' historical ' here in the sense of referring to alleged past events in world history which , if they occurred , would have been able , had the necessary technology been available , to be recorded with camera and / or microphone . )
There are in fact very few conflicts of this kind between the different traditions .
In general the historical affirmations of the religions refer to different and non-overlapping strands of history , and the doctrines of tradition A have nothing to say , either positively or negatively , about the distinctive historical beliefs of tradition B . For example , Judaism tells the story of the conflict between Elijah and the priests of Baal , whilst the Hindu , Buddhist , Confucian and Taoist scriptures are not concerned to confirm or deny this - it belongs to a quite different universe of discourse from their own .
Indeed the only instances I have been able to identify of direct inter-traditional conflict of historical beliefs are the Christian belief that Jesus died on the cross versus the Muslim belief that he only appeared to die ( Qur'an , 4 : 157 ) , and the Jewish belief that it was Isaac , versus the Muslim belief that it was his brother , Ishmael , who was nearly sacrificed on Mount Moriah .
What are much more common are historical disagreements within a tradition , producing splits between rival subtraditions - for example , the Mahayana - Theravada debate as to whether the latter preserves the original teaching of the Buddha ; the Catholic - Protestant dispute as to whether Jesus appointed Peter as head of his church and whether the popes are Peter 's successors in this office ; and the Sunni -Shia dispute as to whether Muhammad appointed his nephew ' Ali as his successor in the leadership of the Muslim Ummah .
Such historical issues - both inter- and intra-traditional - can only properly be settled by historical evidence .
In practice , however , they are not usually today definitively settleable because adequate historical evidence is no longer available .
The historian , qua historian , has to be content to live with uncertainty .
These , then , are examples of unanswered questions - questions to which there are true answers although we do not , and indeed may perhaps sometimes never , know with certainty what those answers are .
However , it is possible to hold that even though we lack conclusive evidence , such beliefs are nevertheless so integral to a whole religious system that it is necessary for salvation / liberation to hold certain views as a matter of faith .
Thus many Christians would hold that if Jesus did not die on the cross , then ( a ) the New Testament records are unreliable , ( b ) Jesus ' did not die to atone for the sins of the world , and ( c ) his subsequent resurrection cannot have occurred , and that these implications would be fatal to the system of Christian doctrine .
If it is then added that it is necessary for salvation to accept the traditional system of Christian doctrine , it will follow that only those who believe by faith that Jesus died on the cross are able to be saved .
This particular question of Jesus ' death raises well some of the issues that we have to look at .
As a strictly historical question it is fairly nonthreatening to Christian faith .
For the historical evidence is distinctly onesided .
Although the Gospel accounts come from two generations after the event , they all concur in affirming a death , as do the letters of St Paul , earlier than the Gospels , and there is also an independent reference in Josephus ' Antiquities to Jesus being crucified ( though there has been much discussion about the authenticity of this passage ) ; and the only basis on which his death is denied within Islam is the theological inference that God would not allow so holy a prophet to be killed .
But this inference does not constitute historical counter - evidence .
Any strictly historical question mark is a very slight and shadowy one arising merely from the general fact that we cannot attain one hundred per cent certainty about any historical details of the remote past .
So there is ( in my view at least ) no serious purely historical dispute here .
There is however a theological dispute .
Here I can only express my own view .
On the one hand , I have no doubts as to the historicity of Jesus ' death on the cross .
But on the other hand I think that the ideas that his death was an atonement for human sin , and that his disciples ' experience of his presence after his death was a physical experience , are later creations of the church and are optional Christian beliefs .
Those fundamentalist Christians who do affirm that it is essential for salvation to believe the church 's doctrines occupy the exclusivist position , mirroring exclusivism within the other traditions , a stance which has always been used to validate ethnic and political hatreds and wars .
For my part , I find the idea that God has ordained a scheme under which the large majority of the human race , who were not born into a Christian society , are condemned to perdition , so morally repulsive that it would negate the Godness , or worship - worthiness , of a being who was said to be God .
It would thus be , to me , a religiously self - refuting view .
I shall therefore pass on to the next type of conflict of belief .
Trans - historical issues
This consists of matters of what I am calling , for want of a better name , trans - historical fact .
These are matters of fact which are not settleable by historical evidence .
Whether or not the universe had a beginning is such a question .
But the Buddha 's point was that it is not necessary for , or conducive to , liberation to know whether the universe is infinite in time and / or infinite in space .
I would go further and say that no scientific knowledge can in itself be religiously significant except in so far as the religions unwisely adopt dogmatic views , as they have often done , on questions in astronomy , geology , biology , neurophysiology , astrophysics or any other of the special sciences .
( They have usually done so because they accepted the science of the time when their scriptures were written as divinely revealed and so have lagged behind advancing scientific knowledge ) .
Religiously , the physical universe is ambiguous , in the sense that everything we know or can conceive of knowing about its physical structure and workings is capable of being construed both religiously and naturalistically .
Thus if the postulated big bang of some 13 - 15 billion years ago was unique , it does not necessarily follow that there is a God who created it ; and on the other hand if the universe is going through an infinite succession of expansions and contractions , it does not necessarily follow that it is not a divine creation .
Nor is there any objective sense of probability in which scientific discoveries can render the existence of God either more or less probable .
The only way to pull a divine rabbit out of the scientific hat would be to reduce the concept of God to that of an aspect of the physical universe - such as energy , or life , or order , or creativity or complexification .
Certainly , if we choose to call any of these God , then science can indeed lead us to God .
But the move will inevitably be unacceptably reductionistic from the point of view of belief in a transcendent divine reality .
The doctrine of reincarnation or rebirth is another response to an unanswered trans - historical question .
Of course , the Buddha himself did not classify it in this way .
It seemed obvious to all within his religio- cultural world that human life is part of a vast karmic process involving repeated rebirths in this and other worlds .
Further , during the hours of his progressive enlightenment under the Bo tree at Bodhgaya the Buddha remembered all his previous lives , as recounted in several places ( e.g. , Majjhima Nikaya 36 : 247-8 ) , as also did disciples who had attained to enlightenment ( Ibid . ,73:496 ) .
But so far as the West is concerned the idea of reincarnation conflicts both with traditional Jewish , Christian and Muslim beliefs and with contemporary western naturalism .
Thus looked at on the world scale , we have to categorise reincarnation as one of the avyakata or undetermined issues .
And if we accept the Buddha 's basic soteriological insight , we shall conclude that it is neither necessary for salvation / liberation to know whether reincarnation occurs , nor conducive to salvation / liberation to devote one 's energies to establishing such knowledge .
Unanswerable questions
Let us turn now to an instance , not of an unanswered , but of an unanswerable question .
Here the Buddha 's example was the state of a Tathagata - that is , a perfected human being - after death .
This is the question of the ultimate state to which the projectory of human spiritual growth finally leads .
And the Buddha said that this cannot be described in our present set of human concepts .
None of the options of which we can conceive is applicable .
The notion of what we mean by a self either existing or not existing does not apply .
What lies beyond what we now think of as the self cannot be expressed in our present conceptual system or pictured with our present imaginative resources : ' Freed from denotation by consciousness is the Tathagata , Vaccha . '
And once again the Buddha 's point was not only that we cannot at present know what the ultimate state is but also that we do not now need to know , and that it is not be conducive to salvation / liberation to speculate about it - and still less ( I think we may add ) to insist that everyone must accept our own speculation .
I shall come presently to the third level of disagreement , which concerns conceptions of the ultimate .
But let us pause here to draw some interim conclusions .
The belief systems of the great world faiths consist very largely of assertions regarding what I have called matters of trans - historical fact .
I shall consider some Christian examples , though each of the other world faiths deals in the same or similar issues .
The traditional Christian dogmas include : that the universe began through an act of divine creation ; that the first human beings fell from grace , so that all of us since have inherited their original sin ; that we can be forgiven by God only as a result of his Son dying on the cross ; that Jesus had a virginal conception , a bodily resurrection and a bodily ascension into the sky ; that after death , we go either to heaven or to hell ( or to heaven via purgatory ) ; that the Bible is the divinely inspired and therefore authoritative Word of God to humanity ; that there is no other way in which humans can be saved except by faith in Christ .
These are dogmas which nearly all Christians from about the end of the second to about the end of the eighteenth century confidently believed .
However , during the last 200 or so years thoughtful Christians have been treating this belief system as more open to development in the light of new knowledge and new thinking than was possible during the ages of dogmatic faith .
When the traditional way of construing a basic concept leads to mounting difficulties , it is now regarded as possible to explore other construals of it .
The cumulative result has been gradually to disentangle the Christian life from commitment to particular dogmatic answers to both the unanswered and the unanswerable questions .
This is the direction in which Christian theology has been going for more than a century , and in which it seems likely to continue .
Accordingly , forms of Christian theology which leave open the unanswered questions , and which respond with what are accepted as mythic stories to the unanswerable questions , are at present being experimentally developed .
It will , however , be a long time before any new consensus develops , and when it does , it may well prove to be not another monolithic consensus at all but rather a pluralistic range of differing theoretical frameworks for the same soteriological process .
Further , there will probably always be some , indeed probably many , who need a simple , unproblematic belief - system such as the older tradition provided .
Indeed in the early 21st century we are seeing a reversion towards fundamentalism all round the world , within Islam and Hinduism as well as Christianity .
Application to Buddhism
Let us now consider how the Buddha 's doctrine of the unanswered and the unanswerable questions might apply to the developments in Buddhist thought after his time .
I would suggest that any doctrine that generalises dogmatically beyond the scope of experience , including crucially the experience of enlightenment , will be affected by it .
Thus , first , to say that we find ourselves to be part of a vast continuous process of interdependent change ( pratitya samutpada ) , in which there is no aseity , or self - existence , but everything is mutually co-constituted by everything else , is to affirm a doctrine based upon experience and the analysis of experience .
But to go beyond this to assert that this continuum of pratitya samutpada is uncreated , and not structured towards any end or fulfilment , is to go beyond the witness of experience .
The existence of a creator is not dogmatically denied , according least to some well - known scholars of Buddhism .
Thus Edward Conze , who was himself a Buddhist , wrote that ' Buddhist tradition does not exactly deny the existence of a creator , but it is not really interested to know who created the universe .
The purpose of Buddhist doctrine is to release beings from suffering , and speculations concerning the origin of the universe are held to be immaterial to that task '
( Buddhism , Its Essence and Development , Harper Torchbooks , 1975 , p. 39 ) .
I suggest that dogmatic insistence upon the nonexistence ( as also of the existence ) of a creator , and a dogmatic insistence that the universe does not have a teleological structure moving towards what we can refer to , in Buddhist language , as universal nirvana , would be to go beyond what is known within Buddhist experience .
In practice , not many Buddhists doubt that there is such a soteriological structure ; but to insist that such views are essential in order to find liberation would be soteriologically counterproductive .
But further , consider the doctrine that the ultimate reality indicated by the Mahayana term sunyata ( ' emptiness ' ) is identical with pratitya samutpada , the world process .
Is this a truth necessary for liberation , or an optional speculative view ?
One possible Buddhist position , I suggest , is that the ultimate reality , sunyata , is manifested within Buddhist experience as pratitya samutpada , but is not exhausted by or limited to the world process .
Rather , it is itself beyond all concepts , including the concept of pratitya samutpada , being empty of everything that human thought can attribute to it .
Thus Masao
Abe in his important paper ' A Dynamic Unity in Religious Pluralism : a Proposal from the Buddhist Point of View ' ( in The Experience of Religious Diversity , ed. John Hick and Hasan Askari , Gower 1985 ) , suggests that sunyata , which is ultimate reality , the Real , is manifested as the various personal Gods , and presumably also ( though he does not say this ) the nonpersonal Absolutes , of the different world religions .
It is the ground of these different experienced manifestations within human consciousness .
If he were to add that the absolute of distinctively Buddhist experience , namely pratitya samutpada , is also a manifestation of sunyata , we would then have what would in principle be a field theory of religion .
We would be saying that the ultimate reality , in itself inexperienceable and beyond the scope of human conceptualization , is experienced in a range of different ways made possible by the different spiritual disciplines and systems of religious thought .
There are Jewish , Christian , Muslim , Hindu and other theistic experiences of sunyata as a personal deity .
There is the advaitic Hindu experience of sunyata as Brahman .
And there is the Mahayana Buddhist experience of sunyata as the world - process , pratitya samutpada .
Here the ultimate is experienced as wholly immanent within the immediately experienced .
But the kind of theory I am now suggesting would not claim that this is the only authentic mode of experience of the ultimate .
Rather , there is a range of different but , so far as we can tell , equally valid modes .
Application to Christianity
So what l am suggesting in relation to questions of trans - historical fact is that it would be a mark of wisdom and maturity frankly to acknowledge our ignorance .
We should recognise that there is a range of possibilities , and should not try to insist that everyone - neither all Christians nor ( still less ) all human beings - must affirm the position which appeals most to ourselves .
Rather , we should realise that it is not necessary for salvation / liberation to know whether , for example , the universe had a beginning and will have an end ( as western thought has generally supposed ) , or whether on the contrary it goes in a beginningless and endless series of cycles ( as eastern thought has generally supposed ) .
Further , we should take very seriously the Buddha 's insight that to regard such questions as soteriologically vital can only hinder the salvific process .
And concerning the unanswerable questions - unanswerable because posed in human terms about realities which transcend our human conceptualities - it would again be a mark of wisdom and maturity to accept our ignorance .
We do not know , for example , the nature of the ultimate eschatological state - whether it is a state of what we now call ourselves , whether it is in what we now know as space or in what we now know as time , and so on .
The questions that we pose about it may be so wide of the mark that any answers to them are worse than useless .
If a caterpillar could ask , concerning its own future post - chrysalis state , how many legs it will then have , how fast it will be able to walk , and what kind of leaves it will be able to eat , the Buddha would say , ' Number of legs , speed of walking , eating of leaves , Vaccha , do not apply .
Freed from denotation by caterpillar consciousness is the butterfly . '
The suggestion , then , that we derive from the Buddha 's words is that we should sit very lightly to our inherited Christian dogmas concerning creation , fall , eschatology and method of salvation .
In this last item I would emphasise the word ' method ' .
The fact of salvation / liberation , in the concrete sense of the progressive transformation of human existence from self - centredness to Reality - centredness , or ( in Christian terms ) to God-centredness , is not in question .
It is an observable fact - observable indirectly in its fruits in human life .
But the dogma that this is made possible only by the death of Christ is a distinctively Christian theory ; and it is to this and to all such theories that we should sit lightly , realising that each has been developed in the context of a particular tradition and has its use only within that context .
The reality of salvation / liberation is limitlessly more important than particular theories about it ; and to try to insist that all Christians , or all human beings , must accept the traditional Christian theory , or family of theories , would be - and has I think in fact been - soteriologically counterproductive .
Parallel considerations apply , of course , to the dogmas of the other great world faiths , though I do not have space to develop these here .
But the outcome , so far as interfaith relations is concerned , is that the kinds of doctrinal differences that we have been considering should be matters of keen speculative interest rather than matters of ultimate concern in which our religious existence is felt to be at stake .
Different conceptions of ultimate reality
Finally , let us turn to the most fundamental differences of belief between the great traditions , namely , their different conceptions of the ultimate reality to which the religions constitute our human responses .
In speaking of the ultimate focus of religious thought and experience , I propose to use the term ' the Real ' .
Is the Real , then , personal or nonpersonal ?
If personal , is it the Adonai of rabbinic Judaism , or the Holy Trinity of Christianity , or the Allah of Islam , or the Shiva or Vishnu of theistic Hinduism , or the wah guru of Sikhism ?
If nonpersonal , is it the Brahman of advaitic Hinduism , or the Tao of Chinese religion , or the Dharmakaya or Sunyata or Nirvana of Buddhism ?
The hypothesis that I should like to consider is that the nature of the Real in itself , independently of human awareness of it , is the ultimate unanswerable question .
Our human concepts , drawn as they are from our earthly experience , including personality and impersonality , do not apply to the Real in itself , but only to the Real as humanly thought , experienced and responded to within the different traditions .
' Thou art formless ' , says the Hindu Yogava ' sistha , ' Thine only form is our knowledge of Thee ' ( I : 28 ) .
In Buddhist terms we could say : The Real is sunyata , empty , formless , but takes different forms within human experience .
And in theistic terms : the Godhead in itself is unknowable , but in relation to human consciousness it becomes the range of divine personae worshipped within the different theistic traditions .
Such manifestations are formed at the interface between the Real and the various streams of human life .
They consist both in the personae of the Real - Adonai , the Holy Trinity , Allah , Vishnu and so on - and its impersonae , Brahman , the Dharmakaya , the Tao and the rest .
And our concepts - such as personality , consciousness , goodness , love , justice , power , unity , plurality , substantiality - apply literally , in either the univocal or the analogical mode , to these manifestations .
But in speaking literally in these ways about a manifestation of the Real we are at the same times speaking mythologically about the Real in itself .
Thus , that the Real is love is literally true of its manifestation as the heavenly Father of the New Testament or as the Krishna of the Bhagavad Gita , and mythologically true of the Real in itself ; and that the Real is rahman rahim ( gracious and merciful ) is literally true of its manifestation as the Allah of the Qur'an , and mythologically true of the Real in itself ; and that the Real is being - consciousness - bliss ( satchitananda ) is literally true of its experienced manifestation as Brahman and mythologically true of the Real in itself .
By ' mythologically true ' I mean tending to evoke in the human hearer an appropriate dispositional response .
For in so far as the personae and impersonae of the Real are authentic manifestations of it , they are in soteriological alignment with the Real , so that a right response to one of these manifestations constitutes a right response - not the only right response but a right response - to the Real .
Thus in responding to the heavenly Father as love by loving our neighbour , or in responding to the Dharma by seeking to attain unselfcentred existence , we are responding rightly to the Real .
If this is so , the different conceptions of the Real , in terms of which the different forms of religious experience and response are structured , are not literally true or false descriptions of the Real but are mythologically true in so far as they are soteriologically effective .
And there is no evident reason why a variety of such mythological conceptions of the Real should not prove to be equally soteriologically effective and hence equally mythologically true .
To what extent this is in fact the case cannot be decided a priori , but only by observing the fruits of salvation / liberation in human life , individual and communal , within the contexts of the different traditions .
Such a comparative assessment is extremely difficult , except as a very rough impression .
I would only say that we have at this point no adequate reason to think that any of the great world traditions is soteriologically superior to any other .
Conclusion
To conclude , then , I have suggested that the doctrinal differences between the great world faiths consist in different responses , formed within different cultural histories , to a range of unanswered and unanswerable questions .
These questions are either good questions to which we do not at present know the answer , but in relation to which a variety of hypotheses and guesses are permissible , or questions to which there can be no non-misleading answer because the terms in which they are posed are not applicable to the realities to which they refer .
Although dogmas concerning these realities are therefore not appropriate , myth - making is not only appropriate but needed , and religious myths are true in so far as the dispositional response which they tend to evoke makes for the transformation of human existence from self - centredness to Reality - centeredness .

Klein : Neocons think 'it 's raining Nazis ' in Georgia Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This
As shells explode over South Ossetia and Russian troops press further into Georgian territory , America 's most recognized neoconservative thinkers are calling for confrontation with Moscow .
And not satisfied with just dealing with the players on hand , Time 's Joe Klein observes that they all seem to think that 'it 's raining Nazis . '
' Neoconservative Naziphilia , ' he calls it .
" But it is important , yet again , to call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies , mini-Hitlers , " opines Klein .
" It is the product of an abstract over - intellectualizing of the world , the classic defect of ideologues .
It is , as we have seen the last eight years , a dangerous way to behave internationally .
And it has severely damaged our moral authority in the world ...
I mean , after the U.S. invasion of Iraq , after Abu Ghraib , after our blithe rubbishing of the Geneva Accords , why should anyone listen to us when we criticize the Russians for their aggression in the Caucasus ? "
Comparing the Russian invasion of Georgia to the beginnings of World War II , Robert Kagan , co-founder of the think tank Project for a New American Century -- which openly lobbied for war with Iraq during Bill Clinton 's presidency -- also a regular contributor to the Washington Post editorial pages , opined in Monday 's edition : " Do you recall the precise details of the Sudeten Crisis that led to Nazi Germanys invasion of Czechoslovakia ?
Of course not , because that morally ambiguous dispute is rightly remembered as a minor part of a much bigger drama .
" The mood is reminiscent of Germany after World War I , when Germans complained about the ' shameful Versailles diktat ' imposed on a prostrate Germany by the victorious powers and about the corrupt politicians who stabbed the nation in the back . "
In New York , William Kristol , also a co-founder of Project for the New American Century and publisher of National Review , believes the US owes Georgia a ' serious effort ' in defense of its sovereignty .
" But Georgia , a nation of about 4.6 million , has had the third - largest military presence  about 2,000 troops  fighting along with U.S. soldiers and marines in Iraq .
For this reason alone , we owe Georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty , " he writes in Monday 's New York Times .
" Surely we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of  and perhaps destabilizes all of  a friendly democratic nation that we were sponsoring for NATO membership a few months ago .
" ... When the ' civilized world ' expostulated with Russia about Georgia in 1924 , the Soviet regime was still weak .
In Germany , Hitler was in jail .
Only 16 years later , Britain stood virtually alone against a Nazi -Soviet axis .
Is it not true today , as it was in the 1920s and 30s , that delay and irresolution on the part of the democracies simply invite future threats and graver dangers ? "
Likewise , Washington
Times follows suit , claiming : " It is in America 's interest to exert maximum pressure on Russia to withdraw its troops and halt the interference in Georgian territory .
This latest act shows the need for greater resolve in establishing a European security system that can be an effective check on Russian power . "
Pushing the talking point further still , National Review contributor and American Enterprise Institute fellow Michael Ledeen asks , " What 's the difference between this and the annexation of the Sudetenland ?
Including the paralysis of the so - called Western World in the face of deliberate , systematic military conquest . "
He concludes that Russia is an enemy of the US , and shirks efforts of the American peace movement .
" The silence of the Left is notable , since they so often pose as defenders of peace .
Once again it turns out that American military action is judged evil , while our enemies can do the same without a word of protest .
Where 's Code Pink ?
Where 's Ron Paul , for that matter ... "
The employment of Nazi analogies in any opportunity to prop up an enemy figure before the US public , has been a frequent meme for the neoconservative ideology 's followers , says Matthew Yglesias .
" The habit that the Kristols of the world have of deploying this kind of rhetoric is infuriating , " he writes .
" If Kristol really thinks we should go to war with Russia , hes being crazy and irresponsible .
If he doesnt think that , then he has no business busting out these Munich analogies . "
Doomsayers predict new world oil crunch
Oil , the black gold of the world economy , is almost insanely cheap - but it wo n't be for long , warns a small but growing band of doomsayers .
Based on a controversial theory , they fear world oil demand will begin to exceed supply as early as about 2010 .
That might revive sights not seen since the oil crises of the 1970s : traffic jams at gas stations , Saudi Arabian princes buying U.S. skyscrapers , and news stories about inventors whose cars allegedly burn corn oil , wood chips or beets .
" Anybody who wants to drive their motor home up to Alaska better do it now while the supply of oil is cheap , " says veteran oil geologist L.F. " Buzz " Ivanhoe .
" It 's not a joke .
I hope I 'm wrong as hell , but I fear that I 'm not . "
Such claims have sparked a debate among oil geologists , economists , engineers and industry officials , most of whom insist there 's plenty of oil left for many decades to come .
Nowadays , the world is awash in cheap oil .
Prices are so low that they are hastening the collapse of the economy of Russia , a major oil exporter .
Bay Area residents - not satisfied with eternally blue skies , excellent restaurants , high employment and adoring tourists - complain about paying $ 1.31 for a gallon of regular unleaded gas .
They 're living in a fool 's paradise , the doomsayers say .
Mechanical engineer Ron Swenson , president of EcoSystems Inc. in Santa Cruz , uses the Web to warn about " the coming global oil crisis . "
While the American Petroleum Institute insists that the world 's known oil reserves increase every year , Swenson dismisses such talk as a play on words .
" Between 1973 and today , we have consumed a quarter of the world 's entire endowment of oil from the beginning of history until the end , " says Swenson , who received his master 's degree in mechanical engineering at Stanford .
" If we 've consumed a quarter of our oil in that time , we do n't have more oil - we have less . "
But such fears of a post - millennium oil crunch are " primarily bunk , " replies economist Mike Lynch of MIT , an expert on oil - supply trends .
Lynch laughingly recalls past flubbed forecasts of an oil apocalypse .
One of the leading doomsayers at present is Colin Campbell of Petroconsultants in Geneva , who , Lynch says , " predicted in a 1989 article . . . that world ( oil ) production had peaked . . . and that the price would go to $ 40 to $ 50 ( a barrel ) in the early 1990s .
" And now it 's about $ 12 to $ 13 . "
The fate of oil supplies is starting to attract attention among scientists .
" The Next Oil Crisis Looms Large - and Perhaps Close , " is the headline on a four - page story in the Aug. 21 issue of Science magazine .
Peak of production in sight <
Pessimists like Ivanhoe " gained a powerful ally this spring when the Paris - based International Energy Agency ( IEA ) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) reported for the first time that the peak of world oil production is in sight , " said author Richard Kerr .
According to Kerr , even with exploitation of huge new reservoirs such as the Caspian Sea , some experts think that " between 2010 and 2020 the gush of oil from wells around the world will peak at 80 million barrels per day , then begin a steady , inevitable decline . . . "
The latest doom - casts are based partly on a controversial forecasting tool developed in the 1950s by M. King Hubbert of the U.S. Geological Survey , who died a decade ago .
Hubbert forecast - correctly - that the nation 's oil production would peak about 1970 .
Hubbert 's disciples have updated his calculations by using high - speed computers and far better databases .
They argue that oil demand will begin to exceed supply sometime in the next two decades .
Simplistic prediction <
But Lynch calls the Hubbert curve " very simplistic . . .
( It ) relies on certain assumptions that do n't work . "
While oil - supply forecasting is extremely difficult , and is complicated by political choices and unexpected global events , Lynch expects the world to have enough oil for the next 300 years .
He says new technologies will allow oil geologists to extract fuel from presently unappealing crustal sources , such as tar sands and oil shale .
Lynch and many other economists overrate technology 's promise , Swenson argues .
Rather than trying to find ways to exploit oil shale and tar sands - which would be costly and environmentally risky - he prefers to develop alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power .
" It is n't just the " left - wing kooks ' who say this , " jokes Swenson , who has written about the subject for a conservative periodical , National Interest .
" These economists are not grounded in reality . "
The nation should begin preparing for an oil crunch - perhaps by developing oil resources or alternative energy sources - lest a future price surge severely damage the world economy , says Ivanhoe , who coordinates activities at the M. King Hubbert Center for Petroleum Supply Studies at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden , Colo .
" If the captain on the Titanic had had a few hours to change his course , he would n't have run into the iceberg , " Ivanhoe says .
" It 's when he does n't have enough time to prepare that all hell breaks loose . " <
The UN found evidence during an internal investigation
The UN has found that its peacekeeping troops from India may have engaged in abuse and exploitation while serving in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply troubled by the findings .
The Indian authorities say they are investigating the allegations and the vice chief of the Indian army had visited Congo in May to look into them .
India has said it will take strict action against the perpetrators if the allegations are proved .
One UN official said there may have been abuse of young girls and boys by at least 10 Indian peacekeepers .
' Wholly unacceptable '
A UN statement said an internal investigation " revealed prima facie evidence " that the Indian troops in the UN's Congo mission Monuc " may have engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse " .
The cases occurred over a period of several years , a UN official told Agence France - Presse and the troops were now back in India .
The UN statement said Mr Ban " reiterates , in the strongest possible terms , that such behaviour , if substantiated , is wholly unacceptable " .
No further details were released of the allegations .
But UN officials say the cases occurred in North Kivu province , where peacekeepers have been policing a truce between the government and militiamen .
It 's not even out yet and people have already hacked Mac OS X to run on the MSI Wind .
Like with other non-Apple Leopard boxes , the little computer believes it is a Mac Pro , which is OK because we all want to be Mac Pros when we grow up .
This version is still lacking some fine tuning , but it runs quite well according to Insanely Mac forum member Jav :
Well , here it is .
The new MSI Wind running Kalyway 10.5.2 ( modified Leopard install ) .
I still have to make some small adjustments , like the resolution and the wireless network card , but I could n't resist posting these images that I 'm sure will get the interest of more than one person .
Ethernet and Bluetooth work right out of the box , so I 'm really expecting a lot from this small notebook .

Alrawandi
A free minded blogger , a teacher who has had enough , has finally revealed his true identity and fled the atrocities of the Islamic system of his country ; Saudi Arabia .
A revolutionist who has gone astray without prior planning
His book is already circulating the Net
He has much to say to the world
Enough is enough
This is his blog
http://rawndy.blogspot.com
Has the age of enlightenment started in this part of the world ?
Or could dictatorship prevail in the twenty - first century ?
Alrawandi is a fighter and he chose to single - handedly fight the system his own way .
He may be mad
He may be acid - tongued
He may be gone overboard
But one thing is for sure :
He is freedom fighter
And he deserves our support
For the fight is not only his , even if we did not agree with the means
But , at the end of the day ; who are we to judge ?
Kudos to Alrawandi

Why “ Alrawandi ” ?/ Eman Ali Albadah
Sun , July 19 , 2009
“ Alrawandi ” was able in a very short time to enforce himself as one of the most infamous atheist of the Golf region and the whole Arab blogging communities .
It is evident from his writings that he is educated , an avid reader , and somewhat learned .
But the most distinct feature ( in his writing style ) is his wrath and disgust with his kin , religion and country in a very peculiar fashion for a young man of his age who has a lot to look forward to .
Alrawandi , in a very strange move , has published his full name , address , photographs of himself and photo copies of his IDs and certificates ; ( a move ) which is considered suicidal in our Islamic World .
So what had prompted an educated youth to dwell into dismay and resort to suicide ?
What is behind his endless wrath and public display of atheism against all what his society is found on ?
What pushed him to this limit is – as he explains in detail in his blog - is the social , political and religious hypocrisy ( of a society ) that sheds tears on the veils ( hijab ) of Moslem women in France and Turkey , while misusing and suppressing women publicly in all the Islamic world under a lawful creed umbrella , rant human rights Justus and , at the same time , practice slavery in its most vicious forms under the same umbrella .
( Society ) that calls for a dialog and tolerance and , at the same time , chases and sues others with different faiths or even different opinions .
What pushed him to insanity boarders is the utter silence of the government against the Islamic Fatwas ( advisory opinion ) that encourages , and militarizes the youth for fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan in their blooming ages .
What made him lose his sanity was the ( legal ) permission to court an infant , ban alcoholic - based disinfectants in cleaning detergents , and absolve drinking urine .
It killed him to see the waste in Arab youths and identities while their sheikhs ( clerics ) discuss trivialities such as menstruation , post pregnancy , and what invalidates ablution as if they were novelties of the twenty - first century .
Alrawandi , with his own conviction , is alcoholic , and his writing style has surpassed any limits of morality and public properness .
But in any case , ( Alrawandi ) is one of many cases that symbolizes the vast number of his likes , in different age groups , who are prone to self - destruction and slow - pace suicide ?
Most of the commentators on his blog are the educated youth , who had the courage to think and search , outside the boundaries of school curriculums and official books .
They have queries , comments and opinions that are not very popular , but remain legitimate .
On the opposite side there are the grand “ sages ” of the nation , ready with mockery , disowning , belittlement and terrorism , ( so ) nothing was left for them but to disbelieve everything and resort to remorse and suicide .
Thinking ( out of the box ) is a blessing that caused humanity to evolve ; contemplation and criticism are two beneficial traits that broke the barriers of “ the shortcoming ” of culture .
It opened doors for creativity and novelty .
( Now ) how to deal with these traits is the difference between societies that are destined to evolve and survive , and those that ( chose to ) eat themselves to extinction .
As for the fear over “ founding ethics ” and “ historical facts ” ( rhetoric ) , this is nothing but a veil under which terror against renovation and change is concealed .
Truth is obvious for any sane person to conceive in his heart before his mind , does n’t the youth deserve some of our time and tolerance ?

It ’s getting a little nippy at night on Mars .
The Phoenix lander ’s Surface Stereo Imager took this image at 6 a.m. on Sol 79 ( August 14 , 2008 here on Earth ) , and a thin layer of water frost is visible on the ground around the landing area .
From subsequent images , the frost begins to disappear shortly after this image was taken as the sun rises on the Phoenix landing site .
The sun was about 22 degrees above the horizon when the image was taken , enhancing the detail of the polygons , troughs and rocks around the landing site .
This view is looking east southeast with the lander ’s eastern solar panel visible in the bottom lefthand corner of the image .
The rock in the foreground is informally named “ Quadlings ” and the rock near center is informally called “ Winkies . ”
This false color image has been enhanced to show color variations .
Earlier images taken in June , and put together here in sequence to form a movie , appears to show frost forming on Phoenix ’s own legs .
But this is n’t the first time that frost has been imaged on Mars .
The Viking lander took the picture below in 1979 of its landing site at Utopia Planetia showing ample amounts of frost on the surface .
In other news , the Phoenix lander also announced on Twitter that it has opened another TEGA oven door in preparation for receiving another sample of Martian soil to “ bake and sniff . ”

It appears that 3 Police Forces , the dedicated Metropolitan Police National Joint Unit which specialises in terrorism legislation authorisations , the Home Office , and the Home Secretary , all find it too difficult to use a calendar to count up to the clearly laid down 28 days statutory limit correctly .
See our current , outstanding Freedom of Information Act request ( currently in the Complaints queue at the Information Commissioner 's Office ) - HO Terrorism Act 2000 s44 Authorisations
Incredibly , there is also some details of further bureaucratic bungling over the supposedly strictly time and location limited , temporary Requests and Authorisations , for the extraordinary Terrorism Act 2000 section 44 stop and search without reasonable suspicion powers .
The Government seem to have shuffled the deckchairs and budgets around a bit , with regard to Lord Carlile 's previous concerns regarding the lack of permanent Special Branch officers and offices at Ports , and regarding the growing threat of General Aviation ( private corporate aeroplanes at private airfields )
This Reply contains what we have come to expect from the Government - they seem to think that rolling out even more complicated , repressive legislation ( e.g. the 42 days malarkey ) and even more privacy destroying data sharing .
of , in this case , international and domestic airline or ferry or rail tunnel passenger and freight information , is somehow an effective anti-terrorism policy .
Stop and search powers - section 44
As you acknowledge in your report , in addition to the errors reported to Parliament in December 2007 , a further incident occurred in South Wales Police Force area in June 2005 .
There was insufficient detail available in December 2007 for us to inform the House of this error .
However I am now in a position to provide additional information .
See Home Office Minister Tony McNulty 's Ministerial Written Statement : Commons Hansard 12th December 2007 Column 41WS
Why has there been no further Ministerial Statement to Parliament then ?
The Home Office authorised a request for use of section 44 powers by South Wales Police until 2359 om 21 June 2005 .
However , a new request was not signed by an ACPO rank officer until 0925 on 24 June 2005 .
The force continued to use the power on 22 and 23 June During this period 4 people were stopped and searched , 6 people were stopped only and two unattended vehicles were searched .
24th June 2005 was a Friday , so this was not a " weekend " problem .
[...]
No arrests occurred as a result of these stop and searches .
However , South Wales police will shortly be writing to all of the individuals concerned to apologise
Note that this apology will be over 3 years after the incidents !
Further to the incidents highlighted above , Tony McNulty requested that a review of section 44 authorisations was carried out at the Home office to ensure that there had been no further occurrences .
From the Home Office files available , 5 instances were noted in 2007 when the authorisation period was granted for longer than the 28 day limit set by Parliament .
How is that possible ?
Has nobody at the Home Office or at ACPO been trained in the use of a Calendar ?
One instance took place in South Wales ( 30 days ) , two instances in Susses ( 29 days each application ) and two instances in Greater Manchester Police ( 29 days and 30 days ) .
These errors resulted from human error throughout the application process by the Police Force , the National Joint Unit of the MPS and the Home Office .
Investigations following these errors have concluded that in two of the five occasions a subsequent application was submitted prior to the 29th / 30th day and resulted in no potential unlawful use of the power .
In the remaining three cases , the subsequent applications did not cover the ' additional ' 1 or 2 days and resulted in the potential for the power to be used unlawfully .
If , by some remote chance , they had actually found any " articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism " , then they would have had to have let the terrorists or their accomplices walk free in Court .

The TSA is dressing its agents in make - believe police outfits , and real police officers do n't like it , according to USA Today .
The Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is starting to equip its 48,000 screeners with 3 - inch - by - 2 - inch , silver - colored , copper and zinc badges that will be worn on new royal - blue police - style shirts .
The attire aims to convey an image of authority to passengers , who have harassed , pushed and in a few instances punched screeners .
" Some of our officers are n't respected , " TSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe said .
Actual airport police , who carry guns and have arrest powers , worry that their own authority will be undercut by screeners who look like police .
Every major airport has its own police department or is patrolled by local police .
" A lot of cops at airports are not real thrilled about it , " said Duane McGray of the Airport Law Enforcement Agencies Network , an airport police association .
" It 's another way of saying ( to airport police ) , ' You 're not important . ' "
Genetic variation in the DNA of mitochondria – the “ power plants ” of cells – contributes to a person ’s risk of developing age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , Vanderbilt investigators report May 7 in the journal PLoS ONE .
The study is the first to examine the mitochondrial genome for changes associated with AMD , the leading cause of blindness in Caucasians over age 50 .
“ Most people do n’t realize that we have two genomes , ” said lead author Jeff Canter , M.D. , M.P.H. , an investigator in the Center for Human Genetics Research .
“ We have the nuclear genome – the “ human genome ” – that makes the cover of all the magazines , and then we also have this tiny genome in mitochondria in every cell . ”
Canter teamed with Jonathan Haines , Ph.D. , and Paul Sternberg , M.D. , experts in AMD genetics and treatment , to examine whether a particular variation in the mitochondrial genome is associated with the disease .
The genetic change occurs in about 10 percent of Caucasians , referred to as mitochondrial haplogroup T .
“ We suspect that this variant will be one of a small group of important genetic variations that underlie AMD , ” Canter said .
“ By knowing this , we have a better chance of predicting accurately who will get the disease . ”
AMD affects as many as 10 million people in the United States , robbing them of the sharp central vision necessary for everyday activities like reading , driving , watching television , and identifying faces .
The toll of the disease is expected to mount as the U.S. population ages .
The genetics of AMD has been a “ hot ” area lately , Canter said .
Haines led a team that identified a variant in the Complement Factor H ( CFH ) gene as accounting for up to 43 percent of AMD .
Variations in ApoE2 and a gene called LOC387715 on chromosome 10 have also been linked to the disease , and Haines and colleagues demonstrated an interaction between the chromosome 10 gene and smoking in raising AMD risk .
The current study also examined variation in these nuclear genes in 280 cases and 280 age - matched controls , and demonstrated that the mitochondrial genome variation was independent of the known nuclear factors .
“ We ’re at the stage where we can use genetic information to predict who is likely to develop AMD well before they actually develop it , ” said Haines , director of the Center for Human Genetics Research .
“ Now we can conduct trials of preventive treatments – something ’s that never been possible before . ”
Sternberg , G.W. Hale Professor and Chairman of the Vanderbilt Eye Institute , is leading a trial to test preventive measures in AMD .
Variation in the mitochondrial genome reflects human migrations and different environmental exposures .
Changes in the mitochondrial DNA can alter the efficiency of energy generation and lead to over - production of “ reactive oxygen species ” – free radicals that can damage the cell .
“ By identifying genetic changes associated with the mitochondria , our results lend additional confirmatory evidence for the role of oxidative stress in AMD , ” Sternberg said .
“ This supports study of interventions that attempt to bolster our antioxidant defenses . ”
“ I can see a day when physicians order genotyping on patients at a certain age to determine risk for AMD and put things in place – dietary changes , antioxidants , increased screening – that could prevent the disease , ” Canter added .
“ This would be truly personalized medicine . ”
Canter emphasized that variation in the mitochondrial genome has been linked to a wide variety of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s as well as breast cancer and trauma survival .
“ It ’s important to realize that there ’s another genome in the mitochondria , and even though there are not many genes there , they ’re important , ” Canter said .

TRACES of milk found in 9000 - year - old ceramic pot fragments have pushed back the earliest known consumption of animal milk by people by a millennium .
Cattle , sheep and goats were domesticated in the Near East about 10,000 years ago , but many archaeologists believe people used only their meat and hides at first , with secondary uses such as wool , power and milk coming much later .
Richard Evershed at the University of Bristol , UK , and his colleagues collected 2225 pottery fragments from the Near East , dating from the seventh to fifth millennia BC .

New Vulnerabilities Discovered in Ruby ( August 2008 )

In June , a serious security advisory was put out about the official ( MRI ) Ruby interpreter for all versions prior to 1.8.5 , 1.8.6 prior to patch 231 , 1.8.7 prior to patch 22 , and 1.9.0 prior to 1.9.0 - 2 . Now ( August 8 , 2008 ) a new set of vulnerabilities have been discovered and announced .
They affect all 1.8.5 releases , 1.8.6 patch 285 and prior , 1.8.7 patch 70 and prior , and Ruby 1.9 r18423 and prior .
This almost certainly means an upgrade is required for most users as all but very recent versions are affected .
The vulnerabilities discovered this time around are n't , on the surface , quite as serious as those last time around .
Several vulnerabilities in safe level have been discovered ( essentially there are some clever ways of getting around a few safe level restrictions ) , WEBrick 's default file handler has a bug that results in certain operations taking exponential time , resolv.rb is open to the recently popularized DNS spoofing tactics , and dl does n't check whether variables used in calling functions are tainted or not .
These issues are all covered on the official Ruby news page about the vulnerabilities , along with some advice on how to upgrade .
Upgrading to the latest stable version is always a good idea ( assuming you check if your apps will still work - Rails had / has problems with certain 1.8.6/1.8.7 versions ) but if you 're sure you ( and your libraries ! ) are not using any of the features mentioned above , this set of vulnerabilities does n't present any reason to panic , unless you 're heavily reliant on safe mode or allow tainted variables to even reach something as powerful as dl .
The two brands who lost and gained the most sales last month ( MINI and HUMMER ) sum up nicely what happened to auto sales during May in the U.S. Brands armed with small cars weathered the storm and big trucks and SUVs continued to nose dive .
In fact , after 17 years worth of being this country 's best - selling vehicle , the Ford F - 150 full - size pickup ( 42,973 ) has fallen for the first time to fifth place behind the Honda Accord ( 43,728 ) , Toyota Camry ( 51,291 ) , Corolla ( 52,826 ) and your new best - selling vehicle in the U.S. , the Honda Civic ( 53,299 ) .
Note to automakers : that would be the sound of the canary in your coal mine hitting the floor .
U.S. automakers continued their year of suffering last month ( Chrysler LLC had not yet broken down its numbers by brand at the time of posting ) , with General Motors taking the beating of its life and Chrysler LLC not far behind .
Every single GM brand was down not just in the double - digit range , but all were down more than 20 % with HUMMER falling off the map at less than 2,000 units sold .
FoMoCo was down nearly 20 % , but can at least take heart knowing that its new Focus ( 32,579 ) has found a lot fans .
Toyota was also down , but was buoyed by the aforementioned incredible popularity of the Camry and Corolla .
Nissan and Honda were both up , however , with the big ' H ' bucking all trends and posting a gain of 11.3 % .
Because there were 27 selling day in May 2008 versus 26 in May 2007 , all percentages represent the change in average Daily Sales Rate , i.e. the average number of vehicles sold per day , rather than the change in raw number of vehicles sold .

Announcing Braid ,
Anniversary Edition
I 'm very happy to reveal that we 've been working in secret on Braid , Anniversary Edition for a while now .
Back when I was originally working on Braid , even when it was a simple project with ugly programmer art and looked nothing like a respectable game , I knew that one of the primary goals of the project was to treat video games as a medium with serious artistic potential .
That potential involves longevity : many great works of painting , sculpture , and architecture have lasted for centuries and inspired generations of people .
Video games were n't like that back then ( and still mostly are n't today ) , and I knew I could n't predict what would be necessary to keep the game alive and available many decades into the future ; but I knew it was part of the project , and that I would try my best .
Back when Braid was originally being developed , with its launch platform being the Xbox 360 , 720 p seemed like a pretty high resolution .
Neither the Xbox 360 nor the PlayStation 3 could render most games at higher resolution than that ; a few games could barely do 1080 p , if they were very spare with regard to per-pixel detail , which Braid was not ( Braid 's style involves drawing lots of translucent particles over each other , which means each pixel is drawn many times ! ) .
But when David Hellman came on to the project to do the game 's visuals , we decided we would future - proof the game by drawing all the source art at * twice * 720 p , then scale it down for the game 's release .
At the time , around the year 2007 , this was difficult to do ; the tools we were using would chug unresponsively when trying to edit such large bitmaps .
But surely this would all be worth it , because it would allow us to re-release the game with sharper graphics later on !
We just did n't think far enough ahead , I guess ; before too long , 4 k monitors became available , some folks are using 5 k monitors , and 8 k is on the horizon ( though that seems pretty excessive to me , right now ! )
If you play original Braid on a 4 k monitor , the result is blurry and unpleasant to look at .
The original double - scale art that we had archived for Braid would still be blurry at 4 k , and anyway it was never really meant to be seen at that level of detail .
So , if we want people with modern computers to be able to enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played , how do we do that ?
Well , I guess the answer is for David to repaint the whole game at much higher levels of detail , so that is what we did .
While we were at it , we could add extra animations and effects to make movement feel better ; we could use more sophisticated brush - stroke effects to animate the foregrounds and backgrounds ; we could go to some of the scenes that , in retrospect , could have used more attention in terms of visual concepts like unique landmarks , and build them out into what they deserved to be .
Then we could upgrade the sound and music ( the original sound effects were mostly bought by me for 99 cents each from a random sound - effects web site ) ; Martin Stig Andersen ( who worked on Control , Inside , Limbo , and other games with great audio ) and Hans Christian Kock ( who has done extensive film and TV work ) have been handling this and the results are very moody .
Do n't worry though , the soundtrack is all the same music , though the guys have done some great mixes that really amplify the mood in the late - game .
In fact , the whole time , one of the guiding principles has been that we must not _Star Wars Special Edition_ the game .
Greedo does n't shoot first , we do n't add a bunch of CGI that sticks out like a sore thumb and ruins the mood , and so forth .
So whenever we add a graphical enhancement , we 're careful to respect the original game , and to ensure the new thing fits well .
Sometimes this is very difficult !
But it 's important that we do n't change the fundamentals of the game in the process of upgrading it .
If you miss old Braid , you can toggle between the original and the _Special Addition_ at any time by pressing a controller button or keyboard key .
This changes not only the level of graphical detail , but the sound effects and music and the extra elements in the scene .
It 's a cool effect , and we use it sometimes in the commentary when talking about the changes we 've made .
Oh , I have n't mentioned the commentary yet !
Of course it was natural to think of doing commentary in a re-release like this .
I wish more games had good developer commentary in them .
But as I think about the games that have commentary , my impulse is , I want to push this a lot further .
I want to go much deeper into the subject matter than developers usually do ; I want to say stuff that really gets to the heart of why things are the way they are , rather than just saying some surface stuff for the sake of doing commentary , as often happens .
I want to cover all subjects involved in the game -- art , programming , game design , level design , history of independent games , whatever else -- and if you want a high - level , short explanation , you can get that , but if you want a 20 - minute - long explanation of why a particular puzzle is the way it is , you can get that too .
You can follow particular threads of commentary spatially , through wormholes that go from level to level , to see examples of particular concepts ; the commentary has lots of markup so we can circle stuff on the screen , point arrows at whatever visual detail we are talking about , show diagrams , play back recordings of gameplay to show what happens if you try doing this or that in a particular level ... and many other capabilities .
The goal is to make it the craziest , most - in - depth commentary ever put in a video game .
We 're aiming for a release in the first quarter of 2021 , and we 'll be showing much more about the game in the run-up to release !
For what platforms , you may ask .
The plan is to release simultaneously on : PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Nintendo Switch , Windows , Mac , and Linux .
That 's a lot for a small studio like ours ( original Braid only launched on 1 platform , and The Witness only launched on 3 platforms ! )
So , it 's going to be ... interesting .
If you want to sign up for a mailing list , to know more as it is announced , you can do that here .
See you later ,
- Jonathan .
August 6 , 2020
In our ever - changing world , a world where Brett Favre is now a Jet , things can happen very quickly !
So it should be expected that another FREE Warhawk Update be released with equal quickness ! :-)
OMG …he ’s a Jet … I still ca n’t get over it but , whatever .
We just released our v1.4 Update a month ago and we ’re ready to upgrade our players to the latest version–Warhawk v1.5 which is tentatively scheduled for release on August 27th .
We ’re currently in the final phase of global Sony certification testing and all is looking good so far !
“ Tell us Dylan … What ’s in the latest Update ? ? ? ”
Custom In - Game Music
This feature was asked for by a bazillion players !
Now players can use the XMB music player to play their own custom music .
Warhawk will also detect if you are using the XMB player and automatically disable the in - game Warhawk music .
Convenience for the win !
XMB Trophies
I have talked about this several times before so this is by no means new - news …especially with the recent leak of our full trophy list – gotta love the internets .
BTW , the team and I are really flattered that someone would risk their job to leak confidential info about our game —
Makes us feel good in a weird kinda way .
Anyhoo… .
There are 56 trophies included in the Warhawk v1.5 Update .
These also include trophies for the booster packs , some of the trophies are , or rather * were * , hidden and some are retroactive based on your server - side stats .
Here are just a few of the trophies that are included .
Training Tutorials
As more and more people join the Warhawk community , we are seeing an even greater difference between skill - levels than ever before .
New Warhawk players had to go online in order to learn the game and , invariably , they would encounter enemy players that were , shall we say , not too kind to newbies :)
This made it really hard for players to learn the ropes , get familiar with the controls , weapons , etc .
So … The new v1.5
Update includes 4 very simple tutorials that can be played off - line .
Each one focuses on the core principals of each of the 3 modes of gameplay : Infantry , Ground Vehicles and Aircraft .
Now these tutorials are very , very simple and It would n’t surprise me if some of our more hardcore players find them way too pedestrian .
But we ’re looking to help the * new * player , a player that may not be that familiar with Warhawk or the shooter genre .
These tutorials are an invaluable help to a newbie !!!
After completing each of the 3 core tutorials a trophy is unlocked – a nice incentive for new players and , well … all you avid Warhawk players can think of them as “ easy - money ” .
The forth training tutorial , “ Flight Practice ” is intended to be replayed over and over again , and help players get familiar with the most rewarding , and most challenging of the 3 gameplay modes : Piloting Aircraft !
In this one , you are tasked with destroying as many attack drones as possible in 3 minutes .
These simple , hovering turrets fire swarm missiles at you as you practice flying and “ scrubbing ” missiles .
This tutorial is a huge help for new players by giving them a safe , offline way to practice their piloting skills .
Now I know that there are many players out there that often engage in 1v1 dogfights for fun and bragging rights .
And while these tutorials are way , way below your skill - level , you may find it fun to do “ speed - runs ” and compare kill counts .
Retract Clan Invites
Another feature that players , or more specifically , clan - leaders have asked for , is the ability to retract a clan invite that they have sent to a player .
For whatever reason , that player maybe never responded to the invite , was being a…a … what ’s a blog - safe term that I wo n’t get in trouble for using ???
How about “ tool ” , yes I ’ll use the term tool .
So if a player is being a tool and just camping on your invite … you can pull it back .
This is important to clan admins because there is a fixed number of clan invites ( 64 ) that an admin can have pending at any one time .
New Paint Schemes & Insignias
Awhile ago you all may recall that we held a competition in the USA where players could submit their own Warhawk and Nemesis paint schemes .
We selected the 20 best ones and integrated them with the v1.3 update .
Well , we held another competition but this time for our players in Europe .
We got some great submissions for paint schemes and insignias , and we ’re glad to show you all the winners !
All of these , the 20 new paint schemes and 50 new insignias are included in the v1.5 update and of course they are free as are all of our updates .
GGL Ceremonial Blades
The GGL recently held a Warhawk tournament and you probably saw the post from our Sr. Producer at SCEA , Harvard Bonin .
Below is an image of the new GGL - Ceremonial Knife that participants in the GGL tournament will receive automatically when the v1.5 update is released .
You do n’t have to do anything to enable it … the global Warhawk server knows if you were in the tournament and will auto - grant you the award .
For you members ARMED ^ASSASSIN ’s , the next time you player after the v1.5 update is released , your infantry combat blade will be replaced by the Champion ’s Blade ( seen below ) and you ’ll be the only players on the planet with this item !
What ’s more fun than a Trophy that you can beat someone with ?
– I submit… NOTHING :)
“ Rookie ” Server Color - Coding
We also have added an attractive green color to all official “ rookie ” server names in the server list .
Players that are eligible to play on rookie servers will find these servers sorted to the top of the list automagically for easy selection .
To recap the color coding , Blue servers are official Sony hosted servers , Yellow servers are games launched from HOME , and Green servers are reserved for “ rookies ” .
We have also fixed the exploit that allowed some players to host unlimited flag capture games , get underneath and into the battlefield and act like …. like tools .
We also fixed the issue with Quick Join that required you to have stats previously posted in order for it to work properly , and a few other items … ohh yeah , and the 1 - minute farming of the Winning Team Ribbon has been fixed .
Oh …and one more thing , we are going to be rolling - out version checking on the EULA and announcements so if you have already seen them and they have n’t changed , Warhawk will automatically bypass those screens for you .
Some of you may have read some rumors about our next Booster Pack … I can neither confirm nor deny anything …at least for right now :)
Keep your eyes peeled for an update here on the blog and the media coverage at Leipzig which is right around the corner !!!
Last hint …and this is an easy one :
With one of these equipped , a soldier can escape quickly …even bail out if needed !
As always – Rock on !

[ Our Editor At Large Chris Remo has returned from Los Angeles in one piece , and he posted something E3 - related on his own blog that 's a ) informative to fans of GlaDOS and b ) worth reprinting here , if you like .
So I asked nicely , and here it is . ]
There is much confusion over what exactly Portal : Still Alive , an upcoming Xbox Live Arcade release of Valve ’s excellent platformer - thing , is .
After all , it was announced amazingly vaguely during Microsoft ’s E3 press conference , and there was little followup .
So I asked Valve ’s Doug Lombardi , and he explained it to me .
Portal : Still Alive is a standalone version of the original Portal that can be purchased through Xbox Live Marketplace .
In addition to Portal itself , it will include a number of levels that are not part of the game ’s story , and do not feature story - related elements such as GLaDOS voiceover .
The game is exclusive to Live Arcade , at least for a while , but PC players can get basically the same experience right now anyway .
Here ’s why .
You may have seen Portal : The Flash Version , a clever Flash - based tribute to Valve ’s game .
You are slightly less likely to have seen the Portal : The Flash Version MapPack , which recursively ports the Flash game ’s levels to Portal itself .
Still Alive ’s bonus content consists of 360 - certified versions of the levels from that pack .
So if you ’re a PC Portal owner who , like me , was feeling excluded by Still Alive ’s bonus content , fear not : you get to play that content first , and for free .
Centrica is being barred by the government from making a solo bid for British Energy , according to one of the nuclear generator 's largest institutional shareholders .
The shareholder , who spoke on condition of anonymity , also questioned why preferred bidder EDF retains the ' irrational total support ' of the government .
He said that a merger with Centrica to create a British champion would be better for shareholders because they could get a higher price and retain shares in the combined entity .
' But Centrica is unable to do a deal because the government is discouraging it , ' he added .
Takeover talks between French group EDF , run by Vincent de Rivaz in the UK , and British Energy , continue to drag on .
A £ 10bn , 765 p per share all - cash deal with EDF was almost clinched at the beginning of the month .
But British Energy 's two largest institutional shareholders - Invesco and M&G , owning about 22 per cent of the company - rejected it at the eleventh hour , saying the offer was too low .
They believe that soaring electricity prices justify a bid closer to £ 10 per share .
Last week , Secretary of State for Business John Hutton reiterated the government 's backing for a takeover of British Energy , in which it holds a 35 per cent stake , by EDF .
The government prefers the French suitor because it has a good track record in operating modern reactors .
Centrica has no nuclear industry experience .
Ministers want a deal concluded soon so that EDF can kick - start the building of a new generation of reactors on British Energy 's existing sites and avert an energy crisis .
Last week , fund manager Neil Woodford of Invesco , which holds almost 15 per cent of British Energy shares , made a presentation to the Shareholder Executive , which oversees the government 's holdings .
Woodford urged officials to reconsider a merger with Centrica as an alternative to the EDF deal .
Centrica does not want to antagonise the government by making a bid which is clearly not welcome .
It also hopes to benefit from an EDF takeover by snapping up a large minority stake in British Energy , and wants to keep this option open .
Speaking to The Observer , the top - four shareholder said that British Energy , EDF , Centrica and the government were engaged in an ' unsightly quadrille ' .
He added that unless EDF ' materially improved ' its offer , he would continue to reject its advances .
EDF tried to sweeten its bid by offering to include complicated securities called SVRs , which would increase the payout to British Energy shareholders as electricity prices rose .
' It seems bidders only use this type of thing when they do n't have the resources to buy a company , ' he said .
Hutton said last week that a deal between EDF and British Energy could be done in the next fortnight .
Sources close to the talks said it would probably take longer .

Who Killed the Constitution ?
The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush .
By Thomas E. Woods Jr. and Kevin R.C. Gutzman .
Crown Forum , 2008 .
Viii + 259 pages .
The question posed by the title of this book raises a further question , as the authors are well aware .
If the Constitution is indeed dead , why does this matter ?
American conservatives have in past days been accused of " Constitution worship " : why should we care whether actions of the government conform to this particular legal document ?
Woods and Gutzman respond that the Constitution provides a way to limit the government .
It is far from the best conceivable arrangement ; but while we stand under its legal authority , we should use it as a weapon against the state ’s continual grasp for power .
They put the point with characteristic force :
To be sure , our federal government has perverted beyond recognition the system that the Founding Fathers created .
The chief restraint on government officials is merely their sense of what they can get away with .
Nonetheless , the Constitution can still serve a purpose , as it remains a useful bludgeon to employ against government power grabs .
By calling attention to what the Constitution really says , we can alert the people to just how consistently and dramatically their fundamental law has been betrayed .
( p. 202 )
Woods and Gutzman have selected twelve cases to illustrate this disregard of the Constitution .
By no means are all of these examples of judicial misconduct ; the legislative and executive branches have been as least as guilty as the judicial in seeking to enhance government power .
One instance of what we are up against took place immediately after World War I .
In 1917 , Congress passed the Espionage Act and in the following year , the Sedition Act .
These forbade with heavy criminal penalties attempts to interfere with the American war effort , especially with recruitment of troops .
Under this harsh legislation , many people were imprisoned , including the famous socialist Eugene V. Debs , who ran for the presidency in 1920 from his jail cell .
The legislation blatantly violated the text of the Constitution .
The First Amendment states that " Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech " ; and as Justice Hugo Black liked to say , " ’ no law ’ means ‘ no law ’ . "
Congress had earlier violated the First Amendment with the Sedition Act of 1798 ; but along with the Alien Act of the same year , it was repudiated by Thomas Jefferson and was generally regarded as a disaster .
Nevertheless , the Supreme Court said that the Espionage Act was constitutional .

The Best of David Gordon
Chapter 4
The Role of the Jury IN a jury trial , the judge represents the letter of the law as voted by legislators and interpreted by the highest court of the land , and also considers the precedents of other court decisions .
The prosecutor represents the interests of the society and the judicial system .
The defense counsel represents the interests of the accused .
But it is the jury that judges the validity of the law , its intent , and the guilt or innocence of the accused .
A juror has the responsibility to vote his convictions , no matter what the other jurors vote .
Frequently we hear of a jury ’s vote which is not unanimous when the first polling is conducted .
Eventually , however , all jurors finally yield to persuasion or to the pressure to support the jurors who are the strongest or most numerous voices in the group .
Each juror ’s vote of guilty or not guilty must be respected by other members of the jury and by the court .
To yield one ’s own conviction to the pressure of the majority is to fail in God - given responsibility as a juror .
In reality , each juror stands as a judge .
He / she represents the highest judge in the land .
The judgment of the jury in favor of the accused cannot be overturned .
If one juror withstands the pressures of his fellow jurors and maintains a " not guilty " verdict , even though the other jurors have voted for the " guilty " verdict , it is a hung jury and the judge cannot pronounce guilt on the accused .
However , in such a case , the prosecutors do have the right to reprosecute the case in court .
The juror must take his role seriously , and it is his responsibility to understand his duties and obligations .
Ultimately , in any trial it is the jurors who are the judges .
In that sense , the term judge is a misnomer .
Sometimes , however , equally significant as the evidence that is presented , is the kind of evidence which the judge rules as inadmissible , or to be struck from the record .
While such evidence may be legally inadmissible , it may have great impact upon the guilt or innocence of the accused .
Of course every juror must take a common sense and responsible attitude to his duties .
For the most part , judges will attempt to be impartial and to direct the trial according to the best principles of fairness .
But it is important that jurors not take this matter for granted .
If it were true that judges never erred in these matters , then there would be no likelihood of a higher court overturning a lower court judge ’s decision .
The juror must do all in his or her power to ensure that he / she is not so overawed by the law , nor by his own lack of legal training , as to allow himself to put aside his good judgment when evaluating the facts of a case .
In 1794 , the Supreme Court conducted a jury trial , and during that trial , stated , It is presumed , that the juries are the best judges of fact ; it is , on the other hand , presumed that the courts are the best judges of law .
But still both objects are within your [ the jury ’s ] power of decision Citizen ’s Rulebook , p. 11 In another case , the State of Georgia versus Brailsford , et al. , it was stated , You have the right to take upon yourselves to judge of both , and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy .
Ibid .
In the case of U.S. versus Dougherty it was stated that , The jury has an unreviewable and unreversible power . . . to acquit in disregard of the instructions of the law given by trial judge .
Ibid .
It is almost certain that a majority of jurors who accept jury duty have no understanding of these principles ; and without understanding of them there is no likelihood that they are going to exercise this responsibility in the jury deliberation .
The Dougherty trial spoke of jury lawlessness as follows , Jury lawlessness is the greatest corrective of law in its actual administration .
The will of the state at large imposed on a reluctant community , the will of the majority imposed on a vigorous and determined minority , find the same obstacle in the local jury that formerly confronted kings and ministers .
Ibid .
The term lawlessness used here does not mean that the jury has broken the law or that the jury is in danger of indictment .
Rather it means that the jury displays a willingness to nullify bad law .
( Ibid . )
That is a power rarely understood by jurors .
When a judge instructs the jury that it must judge according to the law as explained by the judge , this is in violation of the very intent of trial by jury , and of the protective justice of the nation .
Jurors are at liberty to put aside any such instruction from the judge if it flies in the face of the concept of common justice .
To follow such instruction from a judge will often lead honorable men and women on a jury , who , while recognizing the injustice of the law in respect to the person on trial , will nevertheless wrongly believe it their duty to convict the defendant because he has indeed broken the law .
The greatest loyalty that a citizen can exercise in such circumstances , both to uphold the civil and religious freedom of the citizens of the nation and the intent of the Constitution , is to return a " not guilty " verdict in the face of the specific details of the law .
For this principle to operate properly , the jurors must come to a trial without preconceived notions as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant .
Nor are the jurors to come with an anti-government mind - set , otherwise such a juror will be inclined to vote in favor of the defendant , even when he is patently guilty of a hideous felony .
In this way , the jury is able to maintain the justice of a nation , or to peaceably restore the liberty of the nation .
( Ibid. , p. 13 ) .
Such freedom is the cornerstone of the strength of a great nation .
In an article published in the Minneapolis Star and Tribune , entitled , " What Judges Do n’t Tell the Jury , " it was stated , At the time of the adoption of the Constitution , the jury ’s role as defense against political oppression was unquestioned in American jurisprudence .
This notion survived until the 1850s when prosecutions under the Fugitive Slave Act were largely unsuccessful because juries refused to convict .
Then judges began to erode the institution of free juries , leading to the abused compromise that is the current state of the law .
While our courts uniformly state juries have the power to return a verdict of not guilty whatever the facts , they routinely tell jurors the opposite .
Further , the courts will not permit the defendants or their counsel to inform the jurors of their true power .
A lawyer who made . . .
Hamilton ’s argument would face professional discipline and charges of contempt of court .
By what logic should jurors have the power to acquit a defendant but no right to know about that power ?
The court decisions that have suppressed the notion of jury nullification cannot resolve this paradox .
More than logic has suffered .
As originally conceived , juries were to be a kind of safety valve , a way to soften the bureaucratic right of the judicial system by introducing the common sense of the community .
If they are to function effectively as the " conscience of the community , " jurors must be told that they have the power and the right to say no to a prosecution in order to achieve a greater good .
To cut jurors off from this information is to undermine one of our most important institutions .
Perhaps the community should educate itself .
The citizens called for jury duty could teach the judges a needed lesson in civics .
Minneapolis Star and Tribune , November 30 , 1984
As presented in Citizen 's Rulebook .
The issue of jury rights and responsibilities was featured on CBS Evening News , June 10 , 1995 .
Anchorman Dan Rather stated , A jury is supposed to decide facts .
Before a jury begins deliberating , the judge gives instructions about what the law is and how to apply the law to the case .
But some jurors are now getting instructions from another source , and the message is that they should ignore any law they do n’t agree with .
Reporter Peter Van Sant commented ,
These people reporting for jury duty in El Cajon , California , are being told they have an absolute power : the power to simply vote not guilty if they do n’t like the law that ’s been broken .
Van Sant was reporting upon the activities of an organization known as the Fully Informed Jury Association .
Van Sant described the organization as — a collection of patriots who simply want jurors to know that they have power to judge the law as well as the defendant , that they can vote their conscience , even if it grieves the evidence and the judge ’s instructions .
An unidentified judge was quoted as telling a jury , You may not question the wisdom of any rule or law that I have announced to you .
The convictions of the founding fathers of the American nation were on the side of the Fully Informed Jury Association , not that judge .
An article in The Washington Times prescribed a rather ambivalent view of the concept of jury nullification .
In the article , Ron Christie addresses the issue raised by unnamed legal scholars who advocate jury nullification [ of a law ] as a moral alternative to sentencing criminals guilty of non-violent crimes .
Christie acknowledges the valid role of jury nullification in past history , e.g. in the cases of those who violated the 1793 and 1850 Fugitive Slave Acts .
Thus many guilty of breaking the law were found not guilty by compassionate juries who determined that the particular law was unfair .
Christie then asks ,
Is an unfair law a law at all ?
While this is a good question in theory , in practice a bad law is law until overturned by Congress , a court or a jury .
( Ron Christie , The Washington Times , July 22 , 1997 ) What concerns Christie is that whereas in the past jury nullification has been used to overturn unjust laws , presently he believes that many advocates of jury nullification are urging such nullification for laws that do serve a justifiable role .
We agree with him that efforts to use nullification to overthrow laws against possession , use and distribution of street drugs is a dangerous misuse of jury nullification .
But we would add that the misuse of jury nullification is not a ground for denying its use when unjust laws have been passed .
We believe juries should seek , in future cases whenever possible , to nullify laws such as the limitation of human religious liberty as voted by the Supreme Court in Smith versus the State of Oregon , 1990 .
( See chapter 7 entitled " Erosion of the First Amendment , " and for the protection of citizens against being subjected to torture in any form to obtain confessions , see chapter 8 entitled " The Supreme Court Overrides the Fifth Amendment . " )
Of course there are those who fear anarchy if juries exercise absolute power to judge the merits of the law .
That is a real fear , yet the framers of the principles of the judiciary saw this danger as preferable to the danger of a legal system that would provide absolute power for judges to bind the citizens to the law as decided by the highest court of the land .
In reality , the exercise by a jury of the right to judge the law is much more common than most citizens believe .
Van Sant stated ,
That same power [ of the jury to judge the law ] was often used in the Vietnam era , when many juries refused to enforce laws against the burning of draft cards .
We could add that this has happened more recently in cases such as the assisted suicides of Dr. Kevorkian .
While the authors oppose euthanasia ( assisted suicides ) , the juries that have declared his innocence have invoked a principle provided by the early jurists of the United States .
Here is a delicate balance .
We do not share many of the concepts of the more radical elements of society , and we certainly do not advocate anarchy .
It takes a truly Christian ethic for the juror to properly exercise the power that is his by right .
Ultimately , a juror is answerable to God alone for his decision , and this solemn responsibility should ever be in each juror ’s mind .
A republic is a three - vote system of government .
It is the three votes , viz. , of the ballot box , of a grand jury and of a regular jury , that are meant to safeguard , as well as is humanly possible , the civil and religious freedoms of the citizens of the nation .
In a free society , the first vote is at the election of chosen legislators : the right to cast a vote in terms of those who will represent the citizens in the legislative bodies of the nation , state , city , or county .
In many places , citizens possess the right to vote for those who will be the judges and law enforcement leaders of the people .
The second vote comes , when in a major criminal trial , a grand jury is elected .
A grand jury ’s purpose is to protect the public from an overzealous prosecutor .
Minneapolis Star and Tribune , March 27 , 1987
It is the grand jury ’s right to decide that the evidence before the court is not sufficient to warrant the sending of the accused for trial .
In many British Commonwealth nations a Coronial Inquiry serves a similar purpose to the United States grand jury .
The third and final vote in a free society is that of the jury .
A " not guilty " verdict is the final disposition of a case from which , under normal circumstances , there is no review .
Thus in this sense , it is the juries of the nation which finally define the laws .
This places the power of the jury , in this respect , above that of the supreme court of the nation .
Britons who still have any wealth to invest are turning their backs on the property portfolios , stocks and shares , and sports cars that have long constituted conventional investments , and pumping their savings into old - fashioned gold bullion and coins .
Leading gold bullion suppliers BullionVault , ATS Bullion and Baird &
Co have all revealed record levels of investment in gold bars , and the World Gold Council ( WGC ) has reported a big increase in the number of gold coins being bought .
Last year saw an 81 per cent increase in UK investment in gold coins , taking the amount bought to 4.5 tons .
Traditionally , in Indian and Asian markets , gold jewellery and coins have often been traded , while in France and Italy the trade in ingots – small pieces of gold – has previously been much stronger than in the UK .

But this is changing .
" We have seen a rising level of interest in gold as an investment in the UK , " said Matthew Graydon of the WGC .
" Retail investors have realised that gold offers an effective hedge against currency movements , is an effective inflation hedge , and is a proven safe haven in times of financial turbulence . "
New figures from BullionVault reveal the amount of gold bars purchased through them has doubled in the past year to 7.5 tons , more than half of which is owned by British clients .
ATS Bullion claims its turnover has doubled in the past year , while Baird & Co reports customers queueing around the block to buy its gold .
With minimum outlays of around £ 1,000 at most bullion companies , tangible investments are looking increasingly attractive for middle - income savers .
It seems that factors which once deterred people from investing in gold – such as bullion not paying interest – are no longer putting savers off .
" I put a significant percentage of my investments in gold bullion about two years ago , " said David Walker , an account manager for a media company .
" Some people thought it was an odd thing to invest in , but there is a great sense of actually owning something ...
If you put your money in pension funds , it could lose money , if you give it to a fund manager , they might lose it , but having it in gold makes you sleep a lot better at night . "
Buying shares in gold - mining companies is also on the rise , with firms such as BlackRock Gold and General Investment Managent reporting an increase in clients keen to invest in gold funds .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama now leads John McCain among national registered voters by a 49 % to 40 % margin in Gallup Poll Daily tracking conducted July 24 - 26 .
This represents a continuation of Obama 's front - runner position evident in the last three Gallup Poll Daily tracking updates .
The margin , coincident with the extensive U.S. news coverage of Obama 's foreign tour , is the largest for Obama over McCain measured since Gallup began tracking the general election horserace in March .
A key question remains as to whether this " bounce " is short - term ( as happens to bounces in some instances following intense publicity surrounding a convention ) or if his lead will persist -- the answer to which will become evident in the next several days .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from July 24 - 26 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,692 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

War threats against Iran overshadow US elections
By Bill Van Auken
24 June 2008
The US election campaign , rather than offering the American people any real opportunity to vote for an end to the war and occupation in Iraq , is increasingly overshadowed by threats of new acts of military aggression against Iran .
This is the significance of a series of provocative actions and statements coming out of both Washington and Tel Aviv in recent days .
Speculation about the likelihood of imminent air strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities were heightened by a report published last Friday in the New York Times detailing a long - range exercise staged over the Mediterranean earlier this month involving over 100 Israeli F - 15 and F - 16 fighter jets , refueling planes and rescue helicopters .
Citing unnamed Pentagon sources , the Times reported that the operation was a dry run for an attack on Iran .
“ Israel carried out a major military exercise earlier this month that American officials say appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities , ” the Times reported .
Responding to this military threat , Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations organization charged with oversight of the Iranian nuclear program , said it was not justified by any “ current , grave or urgent danger ” and threatened to quit his post in response to any such an attack .
Air strikes against Iran , he warned , would “ turn the region into a fireball ” and cause Iran to “ launch a crash course to build nuclear weapons with the blessing of all Iranians . ”
The report was widely seen as a deliberate leak by Washington and Israel aimed at ratcheting up pressure on Teheran to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
The Iranian government has rejected Western demands that it halt these efforts , insisting that they are dedicated exclusively to the development of domestic nuclear energy and are not in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
The Times report came less than a week after a trip to Iran by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana , who offered the Iranian government a package of economic and political incentives in exchange for Teheran bowing to demands that it halt its enrichment program .
As of early this week , the Iranian government had yet to respond officially to the offer .
Meanwhile , the European Union Monday adopted a resolution imposing new sanctions against Iran , banning the country ’s largest bank , Bank Melli , from operating in Europe .
The Israeli press presented the published report of a supposed dress rehearsal of air strikes on Iran as part of an orchestrated pressure campaign .
“ When the diplomacy of economic and political pressure fails to produce results , a shift is made to gunboat diplomacy , ” wrote Alex Fishman , the military affairs columnist for Israel ’s largest newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth .
“ As the Iranian regime discusses the European Union representative ’s most recent offer to halt its nuclear programme in exchange for extensive benefits , the Americans opted to add a bit more pressure in the shape of Israel ’s air force , ” he wrote .
An unnamed Israeli official quoted in the Times of London Sunday put the matter somewhat more bluntly .
Iran , he said , should “ read the writing on the wall . ”
He continued : “ This was a dress rehearsal , and the Iranians should read the script before they continue with their program for nuclear weapons .
If diplomacy does not yield results , Israel will take military steps to halt Tehran ’s production of bomb - grade uranium . ”
Citing an unnamed US military official , the Wall Street Journal reported that “ US policy makers were divided over reasons for the exercise .
Some viewed the maneuver as an actual practice run for a future strike on Iran , while others see it mainly as a show of force designed to remind both Tehran and Washington of Israel ’s concern . ”
Such an exercise — and the publicity about it in the US media — has another and crucial objective .
It is aimed at preparing the American public for being dragged into another war of aggression .
Military analysts agree that the Israeli air force by itself lacks the strategic capacity to carry out any attack on Iran that would even have the possibility of destroying its nuclear program , much of which is housed in fortified underground bunkers .
The only viable purpose for such threats is either as part of a joint campaign with the US or to draw Washington into such an attack .
There is an important constituency for such a course of action among influential elements of the Republican right , who are openly expressing support for a US - Israeli attack on Iran — as well as their frustration with Washington for not moving more rapidly to carry one out .
This was clearly the message of an editorial published Monday in the Wall Street Journal , among the most consistent mouthpieces for the right - wing layers that have dominated the current administration .
Entitled “ Israel on the Iran Brink ” the editorial states :
“ Israelis surely do n’t welcome a war in which they will suffer .
Yet they have no choice but to defend themselves against an enemy that vows to obliterate them if Iran acquires the weapon to do so .
The tragic paradox of the past six years is that the diplomatic and intelligence evasions offered in the name of avoiding war with Iran have done the most to bring us close to this brink .
Appeasement that ends in war is a familiar theme of history . ”
Meanwhile , two prominent supporters of the administration — who played significant roles in promoting the war against Iraq six years ago based on the same pretexts of weapons of mass destruction and terrorist ties — spoke over the weekend in chilling terms about the timing and political calculations concerning an attack on Iran .
Speaking on the television interview show “ Fox News Sunday , ” Bill Kristol , the publisher of the right - wing Weekly Standard , warned that President Bush could be driven to launch a war against Iran by the prospect of a victory for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in the November election .
“ If the president thought John McCain was going to be the next president , he would think it more appropriate to let the next president make that decision than do it on his way out , ” said Kristol .
However , he warned , “ if President Bush thinks Senator Obama ’s going to win , does he somehow think — does he worry that Obama wo n’t follow through on that policy . ”
Asked by Fox ’s Chris Wallace whether he was saying that Bush could “ launch a military strike ” either in the run-up to or aftermath of the election , Kristol replied : “ I do n’t know .
I mean , I think he would worry about it .
On the other hand , you can ’t — it ’s hard to make foreign policy based on guesses of election results .
I think Israel is worried though .
I mean , what is , what signal goes to Ahmadinejad if Obama wins on a platform of unconditional negotiations and with an obvious reluctance to even talk about using military force . ”
Meanwhile , also appearing Sunday on Fox , the right - wing network owned by Rupert Murdoch , former US ambassador to the United Nations , John Bolton , gave a more precise prediction about an Israeli attack .
“ I think if they are to do anything , the most likely period is after our elections and before the inauguration of the next president .
I do n’t think they will do anything before our election because they do n’t want to affect it .
And they ’d have to make a judgement whether to go during the remainder of President Bush ’s term in office or wait for his successor . ”
Following up these remarks in an interview with the British Daily Telegraph , Bolton , a long - standing advocate of military action against Iran , repeated that the “ optimal window ” for an Israeli attack would be after the November 4 election and before the inauguration on January 20 , 2009 .
“ The Israelis have one eye on the calendar because of the pace at which the Iranians are proceeding both to develop their nuclear weapons capability and to do things like increase their defences by buying new Russian anti-aircraft systems and further harden the nuclear installations , ” he told the Telegraph .
“ They ’re also obviously looking at the American election calendar .
My judgement is they would not want to do anything before our election because there ’s no telling what impact it could have on the election . ”
There has been ample speculation about an “ October surprise , ” i.e. , a military action or terrorist attack on the eve of the election aimed at shocking the American public into rallying around the Republican administration .
But as Bolton suggests , some of Bush ’s closest supporters are less than confident that such an event would have the desired effect .
They have the example of the Spanish election of March 2004 , when their right - wing ally Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar attempted to exploit and distort a terrorist attack for political advantage and instead provoked a popular backlash that swept him from office .
Despite the Republican drumbeat about Obama and the Democrats being unreliable in terms of their attitude towards Iran , the policies of militarism and the provocation clearly enjoy bipartisan support .
Democrats in Congress are pushing through a resolution that calls for Washington to mount a blockade against Iran — an act of war — as a means of tightening pressure over the nuclear issue .
Sponsored by Representative Gary Ackerman ( Democrat , New York ) in the House and Senator Evan Bayh ( Democrat , Indiana ) in the Senate , “ demands that the President initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political , and diplomatic pressure on Iran , ” including by “ imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran . ”
Such a unilateral action is an act of war under international law and could well provoke a military confrontation between the US and Iran .
For his part , Obama was asked at a press conference in Florida last Friday whether he believed Israel was right to carry out such a threatening military exercise .
He responded :
“ There is no doubt that Iran poses an extraordinary threat to Israel and Israel is always justified in making decisions that will provide for its security . ”
One can only assume from such a remark that an Israeli air strike on Iran , dragging the US into a conflagration that would eclipse the war in Iraq would , in the view of the Democratic presidential candidate , be justified as well .
This is a complete beginners guide to codecaves that covers the main topics of : what a codecave is , what a codecave can be used for , and how to use a codecave .
Contents
A " code - what " ?
Unless you have spent some time working in the area of reverse engineering , chances are you have not heard of the term " codecave " before .
If you have heard of it , you might not have read a clear definition of it or quite understand what it is or why it is useful .
I have even asked seasoned assembly programmers about the term before and most of them had not heard of it .
If it is new to you , do not worry , you are not the only one .
It is a term that is scarcely used and is only useful in a reverse engineering context .
Furthermore , is it " codecave " or " code cave " ?
I am not quite sure , but I will try my best to refer to it consistently as a " codecave " .
A space may sneak in there from time to time .
If you search around on the internet , you will not find much on the topic of codecaves .
If you do , most of the resources are found on " shady " sites .
It is true that codecaves have an important and useful place in the underground world of hacking , but they can be used for legitimate reasons as well ( as with anything programming related that can be used for good or bad ) .
Regardless , codecaves are just another tool a programmer or reverse engineer can use to enhance their skills and toolset .
You may not have an immediate use for it now , but perhaps one day you will and you will be glad that you know how to use the concept .
The purpose of this article is to provide a complete guide to understanding and using codecaves .
By the end of this article , you will know what a codecave is , what it is useful for , and how to use it .
In addition , you will be exposed to a practical example to reinforce what you have learnt , so you can see the concept in action .
This article is written as a guide for all levels of expertise , even beginners , but it is assumed that you have some basic knowledge of C/C++ , Assembly , and Reverse Engineering concepts .
As you read along in the article , you might want to search the net for additional reference material if something is not quite clear .
This article is broken down into four main sections with various subsections .
The " Introduction " , what you are reading now , will setup the article and cover what this article is about and what you will hopefully learn .
The " Theory " will discuss the theory of codecaves in regards to what they are and how they are used .
The " Application " will show the " Theory " section in action with a complete example of using codecaves to accomplish a particular task .
Last but not least , the " Conclusion " will quickly recap what the article has discussed and present parting words .
Now that the boring stuff is out of the way , it is time to get started !
A codecave can best be defined as " a redirection of program execution to another location and then returning back to the area where program execution had previously left . "
In a sense , a codecave is no different in concept than a function call , except for a few minor differences .
If a codecave and a function call are so similar , why do we need codecaves at all then ?
The reason we need codecaves is because source code is rarely available to modify any given program .
As a result , we have to physically ( or virtually ) modify the executable at an assembly level to make changes .
At this point a few alarms and whistles may be going off for a few readers .
What legitimate reason would we ever have to do so , modify an existing program for which no source is available ?
Consider the following hypothetical , but not too farfetched , scenario :
A company that has been using the same software system they developed for the past 10 years .
The software system they are using has served them well , but it is time to upgrade it to reflect a mandatory change in the output data format .
The only problem is the original programmers are long gone and there are no hopes of getting the original source code to update the program .
Now , this company has trained it's now veteran employees and grown the past 10 years using this specific software system , so a complete rewrite would be quite disastrous to the company .
Retraining all their employees to a new system and having to reprogram things differently is not only time consuming but very costly .
It would take about a year to do such and this is out of the time frame that the company has .
The worst part of it all is that you are the programmer that was hired to solve this issue .
You could just throw up your hands and say it is not possible , but that would not do much to help your professional career .
Instead , imagine if there was a way that you could keep using the same program , but you have an additional DLL that is used to dynamically update the output data from the company 's program so it fits the new standard that is required .
Best of all , it is a solution that can be implemented well before your deadline and requires minimal changes to be made to the company 's existing procedures of using the program .
Enter codecaves .
Now that we have a definition of codecaves and a purpose as to why we might ever need one , it is time for a visual presentation of this concept .
Consider the following image as normal program flow :
In the image above , execution flows through the three points marked A , B , and C respectively in that order .
The points A , B , and C are just any given areas of code ; they could be one line of assembly code or multiple lines of assembly code .
The point is ( no pun intended ) , execution passes through them all at some point in time .
If we were to codecave point B , we would end up with the following image :
In this image , execution first passes through A as usual .
However , it is then directed into the codecave , which then executes in place of point B .
After that execution is competed , the program execution is redirected back to after B and continues on through C .
If you look closely at the picture , it may be a little vague as to where the codecave is in relation to the program .
This is done intentionally just to show the concept first , therefore reference points of A , B , and C are used and nothing code related is shown .
Hopefully , the concept of what a codecave actually is makes more sense now .
Now that we understand what a codecave is a little better , we can move into the different attributes of codecaves that you will need to be familiar with .
I will discuss three main attributes that we need to be aware of and understand before we can use them .
The first is the codecave location , or more simply where the codecave is implemented .
The second is the codecave entry and exit points , which refers to how we get from the EXE into the codecave as well as from the codecave back into the EXE at the proper location .
The final attribute is the codecave stack and register modification , which discusses the different logics we can use to make sure we do not modify the final stack and registers in the codecave .
The first attribute is the location of a codecave .
This attribute of a codecave describes where the codecave is implemented .
There are two parts to this attribute , a general location description and a specific location description .
Since codecaves must be in the process space of the application , there are two possibilities , in the EXE or in a loaded DLL .
When a codecave is in the EXE , it is usually coded inline .
This simply means the codecave is placed somewhere in an unused portion of the EXE that is empty or not used on a regular basics , such as exception handling code .
Here is an example of a codecave that is contained in the program itself :
In this image , execution never leaves the program 's module for the execution of the codecave .
The codecave is placed in some area of the EXE marked " T " that is assumed to be suitable for a codecave .
There are several advantages and disadvantages to this approach .
The advantages are that it is very fast to implement , efficient , and easy to test and distribute .
The disadvantages are that you must modify the EXE itself , it is not flexible , and you must code in assembly .
Let us carefully take a look at each set of advantages and disadvantages now .
Advantages
Fast to implement -
This advantage comes from the fact that there are disassemblers that are freely available which allow you to modify a program and save the changes immediately ( such as OllyDbg ) .
With this approach , you can locate a suitable location in the EXE for the codecave , make the appropriate changes to implement the codecave ( not yet discussed in this article ) , and save the final EXE .

Efficient -
By placing the codecave in the EXE , this approach is efficient in the sense that you do not have to load anything additional into the program to implement your changes .
As a result , this leads to the disadvantage of flexibility , but as long as you are using base API functions that the program imports and not doing any complicated logic , this point holds .

Easy to test and distribute - Since you are modifying the EXE itself and saving it , you can fire it up in a debugger and set breakpoints before the codecave is executed to verify everything is working correctly .
When everything is working well , you can just distribute the EXE and replace the original one .
You could perhaps even write a file patcher that patches the original EXE into this final one that works to cut down on the distributed file size .
Disadvantages
EXE modification -
The first disadvantage comes from the fact that you do have to modify the EXE itself .
If there is any physical file CRC check in place , then this approach will require those checks to be bypassed or faked .
There is limited space in an EXE and there might not be a place that is large enough for you to place your desired codecave at .
It is hard to figure out a " safe " place to overwrite , so placing new code over old might lead to future program instability .

Not flexible -
This approach is not flexible since any updates to the EXE that are made will require the codecave to be updated in a new EXE .
It is also not flexible in respect to the next disadvantage .

Must code in assembly language - Since you are modifying the EXE itself , you must implement all your code in assembly language .
This may or may not be a disadvantage for you depending on what you need to do , but for the most part , this is a big problem since assembly language code takes up quite a bit of space .
Now that we know the basics for a codecave in the EXE , we can take a look at the second option for the location attribute , and that is implementing a codecave in a DLL .
I will reemphasize the fact that codecaves must be in the process space of the application , so the visual image of a codecave in a DLL is the same as it is for an EXE .
Nevertheless , here is an image of it just for completeness :
In this image , program execution will leave the program module for the execution of the codecave .
The codecave is located inside some loaded DLL in some region marked as " Z " .
The advantages and disadvantages to placing a codecave in the DLL are the converse to those in the EXE .
The advantages are that this method is very flexible , programmable in a higher level language , and dynamic in nature .
The disadvantages are that it takes a bit longer to implement , adds overhead to the process , and is more difficult to test and distribute .
Once again , we will take a look at each set of advantages and disadvantages .
Advantages
Flexible -
This approach is very flexible because any code that changes in the EXE can easily be updated in the codecave inside the DLL .
If locations of the location of where the codecave belongs change , that too is easily updated by the DLL Loader that is used to get the DLL into the process .
Refer to the disadvantages that result from this side effect as well .

Refer to the disadvantages that result from this side effect as well .
Programmable in higher level languages - Since the codecave is now in a DLL that we create , we are free to code our DLL into a higher level language such as C/ C++/C++ CLI .
This allows us to have more control and implement more complicated logic than is possible in the previous means of placing the codecave in the EXE itself .

This allows us to have more control and implement more complicated logic than is possible in the previous means of placing the codecave in the EXE itself .
Dynamic nature - Since this method does not require the EXE to be physically changed , we can virtually enable and disable our codecaves if setup properly .
This leads us to be able to create " one shot " codecaves that are executed only once and restore the bytes that once were written to lead into the codecave itself .
Due to the other advantages , more complicated conditions of execution can be implemented as well to allow codecaves to be executed only under certain conditions .
Disadvantages
Longer implementation time - A big issue in this method is that you first have to develop your codecave in a DLL , then load the DLL into the program , and finally make the EXE redirect into your codecaves .
If you are new to this topic , getting your DLL " just right " so the codecave works as expected takes a bit of time , but once you are used to it , this will not be as big of a disadvantage .

Additional overhead -
This is an obvious disadvantage but still important to mention .
Since you are loading an additional DLL into the program and executing more code than there was before , you might degrade performance if you do not correctly implement your logic .
For the most part , you will have a negligible impact on the program 's performance , but only if you do not write inefficient code that is executed inside the codecave .

More difficult to test and distribute - This disadvantage correlates to the flexible advantage above .
Since the codecave is in a DLL , you must write a DLL loader to get the DLL into the program .
This " DLL injection " makes it so you cannot easily launch the target process with a debugger .
Instead , you must attach it to a running process .
This leads to some tricky cases if you must debug the codecave when the EXE is just starting .
Now we know the two main options we have for where to implement our codecaves .
We can place them in the EXE with quick and easy convenience to test out relatively simple logic .
If we need a bit more of flexibility and power we can resort to implementing the codecave in a DLL .
The second part of this attribute that has to be discussed is the location of the codecave itself in relation to an assembly listing .
The guideline that we must follow is that we will almost always need at least 5 bytes of space to setup a codecave using one of the methods discussed in the next section to get into the codecave .
Wherever we place the codecave , we must be able to easily restore the bytes that were overwritten inside our codecave .
This means instructions that involve PUSH , MOV , CMP , or unconditional long JMP s are the most ideal locations to place a codecave if it is 5 bytes or more .
We want to find a location that we will have to do the least additional work to restore .
This paragraph is a bit hard to digest , so here are some examples and explanations of what is meant .
Consider the following code listings of an arbitrary function from the Pinball game :
Let us say that we need to set a codecave somewhere in that function to get access to some arbitrary data elsewhere in the program .
The only condition we have is that the codecave must fall in this function ; we can get access to what we need once the codecave is setup .
Where is the " best choice " location for our codecave ?
Since we only need at least 5 bytes of space to place a codecave , we could put it in the first 3 instructions , which take up exactly 5 bytes .
However , that means we would have to implement that code in our codecave .
" That code " , being :
01017441 /$ 8BFF MOV EDI , EDI 01017443 |. 55 PUSH EBP 01017444 |. 8BEC MOV EBP,ESP
This solution would work out well for us because there is nothing version specific about this assembly code .
Assembly code at the beginning of the function is usually generated by the compiler ( referred to as prolog code ) and remains constants between all versions .
Since this code is also always guaranteed to be executed , it would make for a great choice to place a codecave .
However , let us consider the other possibilities .
If we look at the following line :
01017449 |. E8 6545 FFFF CALL PINBALL.0100B9B3
This instruction takes up exactly 5 bytes as well , so would this make a good candidate ?
The answer is , " it depends " .
If there was no other suitable location for a codecave and we had to choose this place , it would be fine .
However , there are some drawbacks to using this location .
If the program should change during an update , chances are the CALL address would be different .
This would result in the necessity to update the codecave address as well as the code that is called inside the codecave .
In short , we have more work to do in the long run .
If we look at the next two lines :
0101744E |. F645 08 01 TEST BYTE PTR SS :[ EBP+8 ] , 1 01017452 |. 74 07 JE SHORT PINBALL.0101745B
We can see the total combined takes up 6 bytes , which is more than 5 , but a conditional jump is part of the logic .
We want to avoid placing a codecave in code that involves conditional jumps at all costs .
They add a lot of work to properly reprogram in our codecave .
How about the call made after the conditional jump ?
01017455 |. E8 249D0000 CALL < JMP.&msvcrt .??3@YAXPAX@Z >
For similar reasons to the CALL above , this line carries the same drawbacks that on a program update , the address might change thus creating us more work , but the real no - no in this line is that it is not always going to be executed !
This code could be the error condition of the comparison made above , so our codecave would never be executed .
We have to pay particular attention to conditions such as these when looking for a location to codecave .
Finally , at the end of the function we have a set of 5 bytes made up by the instructions :
0101745A |. 59 POP ECX 0101745B |> 8BC6 MOV EAX , ESI 0101745D |. 5E POP ESI 0101745E |. 5D POP EBP
Would this be a suitable codecave location ?
Absolutely not !
This example right here is the minefield of codecaves that leads you down the path of crashing your program .
If you look above at the conditional jump , it will jump to the line MOV EAX , ESI .
This means that when the conditional jump is taken , the program will execute an invalid byte sequence since our codecave started one byte before .
This scenario is very important to be on the lookout for .
After looking at most of the possibilities of where to place the codecave , the best one would be at the beginning of the function .
In this example , we had a lax requirement of only needing to have a codecave in that location .
This is a best case example that rarely happens .
Most of the time , we have a particular place the codecave has to be at , so we must carefully read the code to make sure we will not crash the program if we place a codecave there .
The main bit of information to take from this example is that you must carefully read the assembly listing code in full context before you select a location for placing a codecave .
With this attribute fully covered now , we can move on to the next attribute , which involves the ways we can actually get into our codecave .
The second attribute of codecaves that must be covered is the actual entry and exit points of the codecave .
We must be able to get the EXE to execute our codecave or we will just have added useless code .
For this attribute , there are two ways we can go about this , both of which involve indirectly modifying the Instruction Pointer in the program .
The first method is to use a JMP instruction to directly jump into the codecave .
The second method that is possible is to use a CALL instruction to call the codecave .
The JMP method is the easier method of the two to use since we can directly JMP to the codecave and then JMP back through a PUSH and RETN to where we belong .
The advantage of this method is that the stack is preserved when we make the JMP , so as soon as we are in the codecave , it is as if we had not made the JMP at all .
This is important since we must execute the code that was overwritten in the codecave location in the first place .
If we are not careful with the stack , we might crash the program if things get out of order .
The disadvantage of this approach is that the return address must be hardcoded in the codecave .
If the EXE is not going to change , there is nothing wrong with this approach , however , if it does change often , it will get annoying to update the return address each time .
It is easy to forget to update the return address and end up crashing the program since you are returning to a bogus location .
There will be more on this disadvantage later on .
Here is an example of this method in action :
If you are not used to OllyDbg , it may take a bit of reading the image to understand fully , but there is no rush .
Read it over carefully and continue once you get what is going on .
The left column is the addresses .
Labels have been added to help with the important address identification .
The middle two columns are the HEX and ASM code listings respectively .
The forth column is additional comments .
This example is only to show a quick means of how this method works .
As a side note , the first JMP usually will not be a SHORT JMP , but a LONG JMP , since the codecave will not be so close to the location that is codecaved .
As mentioned above in the disadvantage , it is your job to maintain the codecave to return back to the correct location to continue execution .
In the above image , that is at address 0x401002 .
If code is inserted before that location , then we would have to update the codecave to PUSH the new return address before the codecave returns .
Otherwise , we will be returning back into an invalid code sequence .
In accordance with the first attribute , if you may have noticed , this example was done using the codecave in the EXE itself .
It is a bit harder to completely present the alternative method visually , so that is why I chose this way .
That is all there is to the JMP method .
It is quite easy to implement and use , but requires a bit more maintenance for when the EXE changes .
The CALL method is a little more complex than the JMP method because we must save the return address from the top of the stack before we execute our codecave and then push it back onto the stack before we return .
The advantage to this method is that we do not have to maintain the return address ourselves since it is pushed onto the stack to begin with .
If we do not , all of our codecave operations have to operate in respect to a stack pointer that is 4 bytes off from what is expected .
That is a mess to work with , so it is better if we take care of it ourselves .
Now , that last paragraph will either make total sense to you or will leave you scratching your head .
Let me assume the latter and present some pictures to illustrate what I just said .
Let us assume this is our original code presented in this image :
If we trace up to the CALL , our stack will look like this :
If everything works out well , the call stack will look the same when we make the CALL as it would in the JMP method ( this will not be the case ) :
If we look carefully , the top of the stack now has the return address from the CALL we made .
As a result , we must pop off this value .
However , we cannot simply discard it ; we must save it so we can return to this address when we are done with the codecave .
That is why we have the line of code that POPs off the top of the stack into our variable ( the instruction at address 0x00401017 ) .
Once that line executes , the top value of the stack is stored into our variable and the stack will look like it should , and that is with the top being 0x6FFBC point to rather than 0x6FFB8 , which points to the return address for the CALL .
Once we have taken care of this slight inconvenience , we are free to continue on just as if we were in the JMP method .
This CALL method also offers a bit of flexibility since the return address is already saved , we can actually modify that with various offsets so we can return wherever we want .
Assuming the EXE changes and the function we are codecaving inside does not change , the offsets are still valid !
That is not to say we could not do the same in the JMP method , but it would be a little more work for that extra complicated logic .
With these two methods covered , we know the theory of how to get into our codecave from the EXE and back to the EXE from the codecave .
It should be noted that while the above examples were done with the codecave in the EXE , it would look the same as if it were in the DLL , except the addresses would be different .
We have one more attribute left to cover now and that deals with the theory of working with the registers and stack inside the codecave .
The last attribute of codecaves that we have to be aware of is the stack and register modification that takes place inside the codecave .
This attribute is an extremely important aspect that must be carefully observed when designing your codecaves , or disastrous results may occur .
Take for example the next snippet of code :
Big oops !
In our codecave , we modified the EAX register , so when the codecave returns , we will execute a CALL 0 instruction , which will result in an exception and a crash in the application .
Now it is obvious why we must pay particular attention to the stack and registers .
This example is pretty trivial , but when you are working with more complex code , you may inadvertently modify the stack or a register and crash out your program .
There are a few things we can do to help preserve the stack and registers as we go along in our codecave .
We can use this instruction set pair to preserve one register at a time .
For example , if we need to use only the ECX register , we can do the following :
push ecx ... ; Use ecx ... pop ecx
The advantage of this instruction set is that we can only save and restore what we need if we are sure that we only need to modify a few registers .
If we need to access the stack contents , we know we only have to modify it by 4 , so it is an acceptable calculation to make .
We can use this instruction set pair to preserve all general purpose registers at the same time .
We will want to use this if we were calling a function from inside our codecave that might modify one or more registers .
pushad ... call MyFunction ; Modifies quite a few registers ... popad
It is very important to remember that the PUSHAD instruction modified the stack with 8 32 bit values , so if you have to access or use the stack , you will want to do it before you actually use a PUSHAD instruction .
Otherwise , you will have to modify the stack accessing by 0x20 each time .
Here is an example of how the stack looks before a PUSHAD is executed and then afterwards .
Note how much the stack has changed :
In the original stack , the topmost value of - 1 is accessed as ESP + 8 .
After the PUSHAD , we must use ESP + 0x28 .
This is what is meant by recalculating the stack address in the codecaves if we modify the stack .
Also note that $ is just ESP .
This instruction set pair is similar to the PUSHAD and POPAD pair , but it saves the flags to the stack .
This instruction set only saves one 32 bit value onto the stack , so you work with updating stack access calculations just like you would with a PUSH , you just add 4 .
pushfd ... test eax , eax ... popfd
Here 's an example of the stack before a PUSHFD is executed and then afterwards :
As you can see , the stack has only been modified by 4 bytes .
Note that I did not change the address reference in the second picture above , so that is why the topmost address is ESP - 4 rather than ESP as the second picture is in the PUSHAD example .
Here 's a look at the flags themselves before the TEST EAX , EAX is executed in my example and after :
After the POPFD is executed , the flags are restored to the original states seen in the first image above .
The last technique we can use to help preserve the stack and registers is to use temporary variable storage .
Rather than store an original register on the stack , we can save it to a memory location , use the register , and then restore it back ourselves .
mov [ VariableAddr ] , EAX ... ; Use EAX ... mov EAX , [ VariableAddr ]
Here is a visual example :
In this code , we first move the EAX register into the memory location , use EAX , and restore it back from the saved memory location .
By doing this , we do not modify the stack at all , so we do not have to change any stack calculations !
It is a bit more work and we must ensure that we restore the right variables back into registers , but aside from that , it is an interesting approach to take .
There is one caveat that I must bring to your attention here .
This section was written in regards to beginning codecave writing .
In this case , it is important for a beginner not to modify the stack or registers .
However , as more experience is gained , you will find at times that you do want to modify the stack or registers .
If you want to intentionally modify the stack or registers , this is fine .
Just make sure you know what you are doing before you do it .
Now that the three main attributes of codecaves have been discussed , we have a more complete knowledge and understanding of codecaves combined with the earlier knowledge of the basic theory .
What is left now is to take a look at the practical application of codecaves and get a good feel of how to develop and use them in a real world example .
With the theory of codecaves covered , we can now put that knowledge to use .
Before we continue though , there are some tools we need to obtain .
Once we have our set of tools , we have to then get the program that we will be working on .
For this article I choose to use the Space Cadet Pinball game that comes with WinXP .
Reading over the EULA of Windows components , I do n't think I can redistribute the exact version I have .
I will provide a little tip to help those that have different versions when we get to working with the actual program .
Once we collect the tools discussed in the next section , we can move on to making a codecave !
Here is an image of the version of the Pinball game that I will be using :
The first tool we need is a memory scanner .
For this tool , I will recommend TSearch .
The purpose of this tool is to scan the memory of a process to find the address of data .
There is a link to the program on the Wikipedia page , but be sure that you scan it carefully , as with anything you download on the internet .
The next tool we need is a disassembler and debugger .
For this , I will recommend that you use OllyDbg since it is free , powerful , and easy to use .
The final tool we will need is a C++ compiler .
For this I will recommend that you use Visual C++ if you have it .
If you do not , you can get the Express Edition .
Please note that another free alternative such as Dev-Cpp will work , but the source code is not compatible with it since it does not use Intel style inline assembly .
To recap , we will need three tools : a memory scanner , a disassembler , and a C++ compiler .
If you have never used any of these tools before , this section of the article might take a bit more time for you to understand .
You might want to reference some additional tutorials on these tools if the images and text provided here are not enough for you .
Just remember to be patient and reread the places that you get stuck at .
This stuff is by no means easy .
Here is additional overview information ( taken from Wikipedia ) on the tools we will be using .
I did not include links to tutorials and additional resources due the nature of the sites they are hosted on .
" TSearch ( similar to ArtMoney and the open source Cheat Engine ) is a memory scanner / debugger utility developed by Corsica Productions .
TSearch 's primary function is to scan open processes for byte addresses ; restricting searches to either ' Exact Value ' , ' Range ' or ' Unknown Values ' .
The searches can be refined by using a ' Search Next ' ( or sieve ) option : this re-searches already found results to display results suiting a further refined criterion .
TSearch also features a hex editor and ' auto hack ' option , and is commonly used within the game hacking community to develop 3rd party game ' trainers ' and ' hacks ' . "
" Olly Dbg is a debugger that emphasizes binary code analysis , which is useful when source code is not available .
It traces registers , recognizes procedures , API calls , switches , tables , constants and strings , as well as locates routines from object files and libraries .
According to the program 's help file , version 1.10 is the final 1.x release .
Version 2.0 is in development and is being written from the ground up .
The software is free of cost , but the shareware license requires users to register with the author . "
" Microsoft Visual C++ ( also known as MSVC ) is an Integrated development environment ( IDE ) product engineered by Microsoft for the C , C++ , and C++/CLI programming languages .
It has tools for developing and debugging C++ code , especially that is written for the Microsoft Windows API , the DirectX API , and the Microsoft . NET Framework . "
Now that we have the tools we will be using and our target program , we can get started with applying the theory of codecaves to get something done .
What follows are the three main steps we must follow .
The first step is to find a purpose for the codecave we wish to create .
Usually , you would already know why you need a codecave , but for the sake of the article , we will work through this step from the beginning .
The next step is writing the actual codecave .
For this article , we will write a codecave that is located in a DLL and uses the CALL method .
The last step is putting it all together to get our DLL into the process and watch our codecave in action .
Let us start up the Pinball game and take a look at what is there for us to mess with .
Here is an image of the main game screen for reference :
If we consider what is displayed and what changes the most , the only thing we really have to work with is the current score .
What if we wanted to make a program that displayed the current score for us outside of the program ?
We could then do some sort of score logging or other statistical analysis if we wished .
Either way , we are trying to do something that cannot currently be done since only the game knows the current score .
We could just read it from memory , but in some cases , such things might not be possible , so we will assume our only option is to make a codecave to extract out the data .
As a quick recap for step 1 , we will define our purpose to be to create a codecave in the Pinball game so we have access to the score .
Now that we know what we want to do , we have to start our reverse engineering procedures to figure out how to actually find a suitable location in the program to extract the score from .
To do this , we will use TSearch .
Go ahead now and start up TSearch .
In the menu bar at the top , select the Open Process button and choose our program , " Pinball.exe " .
Once you have done that , the title of the window will change to " TSearch - PINBALL.EXE " .
This lets us know that the process has been loaded .
With TSearch loaded , our first order of business is to find the address where our score is being held at .
To do this , play the Pinball game a little to get a non -zero score and press F3 to pause the game .
I stopped when my score was 6750 .
Once you have your score handy , switch back to TSearch , we will search for the memory address of the score .
Look at the top leftmost area that contains a grid control .
We will use the first button to search for the score .
Click on the first icon , the magnifying glass to start a new search .
A new dialog will open that will allow us to select some data type options , search options , as well as actual values .
Since the score is displayed as what looks like an integer , we will use the default search parameters to look for our score .
In other programs or games , you might have to play around with the settings to find the right type for what you are looking for .
Go ahead and enter your score and press OK .
If everything goes well , TSearch will scan the program 's memory and tell us the addresses of data that match our score .
In my case , it was exactly 2 .
Depending on the value , you might get more .
If you do get more , I would change your score by playing a little more and searching again so you get exactly 2 results .
Here is an image of the results dialog that pops up after a search :
After we hit OK and look back at the grid control that we used to search from , we can see two addresses being listed that contain our score :
Now , why do we have two addresses listed ?
Considering that we have a variable to store the score , there is probably a second variable that holds the score to display it to the main GUI .
As a result , there may be two or more values that contain the data we are looking for in other programs .
This is something that is important to keep in mind .
We know that one is the real score and one is a dummy score , how do we tell them apart ?
There is no easy answer other than trial and error .
Referencing the image above , click on the button with the " boxed , green plus sign " that reads , " Add all line found to the table " .
After we click that button , the two entries are copied into the panel dialog on the right .
We will now figure out which one is the real score .
We will now work from the right side of the screen where the two addresses were just added to .
Click inside the column that reads Value of the first entry and change it to 0 .
Switch to the game and play it until you get a few more points .
If the memory layout is similar to mine , then you will see that your displayed score continues to go up and the memory location we just set to 0 is reset back to the current score .
This means that address is not our real score .
To verify this , hit F3 to pause the game again and go back to TSearch .
In the second address , change its value to 0 and repeat the same procedure .
Once we get a few more points in game , we will see our score is now reset , and we are playing from the beginning again .
This is a clear indicator that we have found the correct score address .
Now that we have the address of our score , we must find where in the EXE the game accesses or modifies it so we can setup a codecave at that location .
To do this , we will attach OllyDbg to the process .
Take this time to start up OllyDbg .
If this is your first time launching the program , you will need to click " Yes " at the first message box if you get one :
With OllyDbg open , click on " File " and then " Attach " .
Select the Pinball process from the list and click the Attach button .
You can click on the Name heading to sort the list by name to make finding the process a lot easier .
As soon as you attach OllyDbg to the process , you will be greeted with another message box .
Simply press OK .
At this point , OllyDbg is attached to our program and we should see something like this :
There are a few important things to be aware of at this point .
Right now our program is in the suspended state .
We know this because at the bottom right corner in yellow , it says " Paused " .
The module that is currently being displayed is not our program , but the ntdll.dll file .
This is foretold by the window caption , which says " module ntdl " .
We will first need to unpause our program by pressing the F9 key or the blue ' Play ' button ( sideways triangle pointing to the right ) at the top of the menu bar .
You will know that you did it correctly if the bottom right corner changes from " Paused " to " Running " .
With the program running again , we need to actually look at the Pinball module rather than the ntdll.dll module .
Right click on the assembly listing pane and choose " View " and then " Module ' Pinball ' " .
You must do this a few times until the main window says " CPU - main thread , module PINBALL " .
If you do it once and it still says " module ntdll " , you will have to do it again !
Once you are in the main PINBALL module , press " Ctrl + A " to do an analysis of the code .
This will make things a little cleaner to read .
Alternatively , right click in the assembly listing and choose " Analysis " and then " Analyze Code " .
You might also want to change the appearance of the code so it is not all black and white .
Right click again in the assembly listing window and choose " Appearance " , " HighLighting " , and then " Jumps ' n ' Calls " .
At this point , we have OllyDbg attached to the Pinball process and we know the address of our score from TSearch .
Copy the real score 's address from TSearch into the clipboard .
Switch to OllyDbg and press " Ctrl + G " and paste in the address .
Prefix the address with " 0x " so Olly Dbg knows it is an address since it starts with a letter .
After you press OK , you will be taken to the address in the main disassembly dump window .
You should see something that looks like this :
What you are seeing now is the disassembly of the memory contents at that location .
However , this is not the view we want to look at this data .
Make sure the main line is highlighted and right click .
Choose " Follow in Dump " and then " Selection " .
In the bottom portion of the screen , you will see the data in a HEX view .
Highlight the first 4 bytes , this is our score variable :
The next thing we have to do is set a memory breakpoint on this location so OllyDbg will pause the program when the game writes to this memory location to update our score .
By doing this , we know of one location we can place a codecave at to get the current score .
Right click on the 4 highlighted bytes and choose " Breakpoint " and then " Memory , on write " :
With the memory breakpoint in place , we can switch back to the game and unpause it .
As soon as you get points , the game should pause and the debugger should become active .
Your debugger should look something like this when it is focused from the breakpoint :
Note in the bottom right corner the process is " Paused " again .
In the status bar , the text reads " Memory breakpoint when writing to [ 00AFFC82 ] " .
This lets us know that the debugger has caught the process writing to our score 's memory location .
Let us take a look at the assembly instructions that pertain to the score being modified .
01017579 |. 8D41 52 LEA EAX , DWORD PTR DS :[ ECX+52 ] 0101757C |. 0130 ADD DWORD PTR DS :[ EAX ] , ESI 0101757E |. 8B10 MOV EDX , DWORD PTR DS :[ EAX ] 01017580 |. 81FA 00CA9A3B CMP EDX, 3B9ACA00
Here is a rough translation of what is going on .
By looking at the above , we know the score 's address is loaded into EAX from DS : [ ECX + 0x52 ] .
Then , the ESI register is added to the score 's value .
Finally , the score variable is loaded into EDX and then a comparison is made to the static constant 0x3B9ACA00 , or decimal 1,000,000,000 .
Having seen at least one different version of the code above in the different Pinball versions , I will choose to place the codecave on the instruction CMP EDX , 3B9ACA00 .
Since that instruction is 7 bytes , it meets the requirements of a codecave needing at least 5 bytes .
Furthermore , reprogramming that logic in a codecave is simple ; we just execute that line at the end of the codecave before we return to the EXE .
Placing the codecave is really convenient at that location since we know the score is stored in EDX .
We can simply move the register to our own variable for use without any additional work .
If your listing is a bit different than above , it is ok .
As long as you see something that resembles the above and have some CMP instruction that compares a register against 0x3B9ACA00 , you are fine .
If you did not break at a location such as this , you might have chosen the wrong address as the score variable .
This is ok too since you can hit CTRL + F and do a search for CMP EDX , 3B9ACA00 .
You should land in the right area now .
We should remember the address that the CMP instruction is on since we will be using that in the next step .
This is a good place to stop for a moment and recap what we have done so far .
We first started out by looking at our Pinball game and found a task to do .
We decided we wanted to be able to have access to the score outside of the game .
Once we established that goal , we then moved into finding the address of that data in the process using TSearch .
Once we correctly identified the location , we used OllyDbg to find where the process modifies the address , which in turn gives us a location to codecave to extract out the current score .
With all of that done , we have completed step 1 .
Now , we can move on to the next step , which is to write the codecave itself .
At this point in the article , a slight problem arises .
It will not be a problem to implement our codecave , but it will be a problem to actually write it to the process .
The concept of dynamically changing a loaded program 's code is another article in itself .
Because of this limitation , I will provide the basic functions we will use to accomplish our goals for this article .
It will be up to you to research more into them to fully understand what they do and why things are the way they are ( something that takes a bit of time and practice ) .
The code is well commented though so only a few concepts need to be explained .
We will generally have at least two functions for each codecave we make .
The first function will be the codecave itself .
The remaining functions are support functions that are called from the first function to handle additional logic that cannot go in the first function .
The codecave function itself has to be a special type of function , a naked function .
Here is an excerpt taken from MSDN :
Functions declared with the naked attribute are emitted without prolog or epilog code , enabling you to write your own custom prolog / epilog sequences using the inline assembler .
Naked functions are provided as an advanced feature .
They enable you to declare a function that is being called from a context other than C/C++ , and thus make different assumptions about where parameters are , or which registers are preserved .
Examples include routines such as interrupt handlers .
This feature is particularly useful for writers of virtual device drivers ( VxDs ) .
For additional information on prolog and epilog code , take a look at this Code Project article : Playing with the stack and do additional Google searching for the terms " prolog " and " epilog " .
When we use a naked function , we have a few guidelines that we must follow .
For a list of guidelines that you must follow , please take a look at this article : Rules and Limitations for Naked Functions .
An important thing to remember is that you cannot declare variables inside a naked function .
Instead , they must be declared outside of the function .
If you place a variable declaration in a naked function , you will be referencing an address on the stack .
Aside from that , it is advisable to only place the least amount of non-assembly code in the main codecave function as possible .
You should place everything else in the support functions .
Since we are using a codecave in a DLL and using the CALL method , we will need a total of two variables and two functions .
The first variable will hold the current score obtained from the game .
The second variable will hold the return address when we enter and exit our codecave .
For this simple example , we will just display the current score to a console window to show that everything works .
What follows now is the relevant code for the codecave implementation .
The DllMain and extra utility functions are not shown .
DWORD currentScore = 0 ; DWORD ExtractScoreRetAddr = 0 ; void DisplayCurrentScore ( ) { printf ( " Current score : %i
" , currentScore ) ; } __declspec ( naked ) void CC_ExtractScore ( void ) { __asm { pop ExtractScoreRetAddr MOV currentScore , EDX PUSHAD PUSHFD } DisplayCurrentScore ( ) ; __asm { POPFD POPAD CMP EDX , 0x3B9ACA00 push ExtractScoreRetAddr ret } } extern " C " __declspec ( dllexport ) void Initialize ( ) { Codecave ( 0x01017580 , CC_ExtractScore , 1 ) ; CreateConsole ( ) ; }
That is not so bad now , is it ?
Remember that only the codecave related code is shown , the rest of the code is part of the project .
If we recall all of the theory we learned in the second section of this article , everything seems to be here .
We first have our codecave save the return address to a variable .
That is seen in the line pop ExtractScoreRetAddr .
Next , we save our data to another variable as seen in the line MOV currentScore , EDX .
Before we call our support function , we save the registers and flags to the stack and then restore them later .
We finally execute the code that was taken out for the codecave , which was the line CMP EDX , 0x3B9ACA00 , and return to where we are supposed to be using the stored return address .
The Initialize function is an exported function that our Loader will use to inject the DLL into the Pinball game so the EXE will call the codecave .
The function Codecave will do most of the work for us in writing out the codecave itself .
Since we are using the CALL method to get into the codecave , the Codecave function creates a CALL instruction using the address of the function that we pass in .
The last parameter is the NOP count that we specify to erase extra bytes that need to be taken out .
This number is simply the total bytes you want to codecave minus 5 .
In this case , there are 6 bytes in the CMP EDX , 3B9ACA00 instruction as we can see from the assembly listing .
Five of these bytes are for the codecave , so that leaves on extra byte we must NOP so the program does not crash on resume due to an invalid byte sequence .
If there were exactly 5 bytes , we would not need any NOP s .
If there were 7 bytes we would need 2 NOP s .
To create future codecave DLLs yourself , you can use the provided project as a template .
You will have to update the Initialize function as well as implement new codecaves for yourself .
Now that we have the Codecave DLL completed , it is time to move to the last step in this process , putting it all together !
In order to see the final product of what we have just made in action , we must find a way to get our DLL into the Pinball process .
Once we do that , the Initialize function has to be called to make the DLL patch the program so the codecave is called .
After that , whenever the score is updated , our codecave will be triggered and we will see our score being displayed to the console .
To accomplish this last step , I will refer to and use a previous article I have written : A More Complete DLL Injection Solution Using CreateRemoteThread .
I will use that project to create the Loader to inject our DLL into the process .
The loader itself is pretty simple ; the WinMain shown at the end of that article has only been modified slightly for this one :
int WINAPI WinMain( HINSTANCE
hInstance , HINSTANCE hPrevInstance , LPTSTR lpCmdLine , int nCmdShow ) { STARTUPINFO si = { 0 } ; PROCESS_INFORMATION
pi = { 0 } ; BOOL result = FALSE ; char exeString [ MAX_PATH + 1 ] = { 0 } ; char working Dir [ MAX_PATH + 1 ] = { 0 } ; char dllPath [ MAX_PATH + 1 ] = { 0 } ; GetCurrentDirectory ( MAX_PATH , workingDir ) ; _snprintf ( exeString , MAX_PATH , " \ " %s\\PINBALL.EXE\ " - quick " , workingDir ) ; _snprintf( dllPath , MAX_PATH , " PinballCodecave.dll " ) ; si.cb = sizeof ( STARTUPINFO ) ; result = CreateProcess ( NULL , exeString , NULL , NULL , FALSE , CREATE_SUSPENDED , NULL , working Dir , &si , p ) ; if ( ! result ) { MessageBox ( 0 , " Process could not be loaded ! " , " Error " , MB_ICONERROR ) ; return - 1 ; } Inject ( pi.hProcess , dllPath , " Initialize " ) ; ResumeThread ( pi.hThread ) ; return 0 ; }
Remember that only the WinMain is shown above , the rest of the code is in the project file itself .
At this point we now have all of the main pieces .
It is time to test !
Copy over the " PinballCodecave.dll " and " PinballLoader.exe " files into your Pinball folder , which is " C: \Program Files \ Windows NT \ Pinball " by default .
Run the " PinballLoader.exe " file to start up the Pinball game , you should see a DOS console popup as well .
If everything works out well , you should be able to play the game .
When you score points , your current score should be outputted to the console window .
Neat , huh ?
If anything goes wrong , take a look over the address you are placing the codecave on as well as all of the minor details .
The good thing about this low level stuff is if you mess up , 90 % of the time you will be aware of it since the program crashes or does something unexpected .
It has been a long and challenging journey , but you have finally reached the end .
At this point , you should have gained a basic , but complete , understanding of what a codecave is .
We have seen through the theory section of what a codecave does and how it can be used .
You now know three important attributes of codecave that you have to keep in mind when designing your own .
They are the location of the codecave , the entry and exit points , and the stack and register preservation techniques .
You have a practical example to reference as well as a template code at your disposal for your future projects .
You might have even gained a little knowledge of a few new tools that you can use in your future endeavors .
The big question left that always comes at any end is " what now ? "
From here , you can continue to explore using codecave to accomplish various tasks that you might not have been able to do before .
Sometimes it is challenging to figure out " what to do " , so if you do not have anything to work on immediately , do not worry about it !
Just remember what you have learnt and perhaps you can apply it someplace else in the future .
I hope you have enjoyed this article , I know it is very long but I hope to hear your feedback .

WHAT is the secretary of Veterans Affairs thinking ?
On May 5 , the department led by James B . Peake issued a directive that bans nonpartisan voter registration drives at federally financed nursing homes , rehabilitation centers and shelters for homeless veterans .
As a result , too many of our most patriotic American citizens  our injured and ill military veterans  may not be able to vote this November .
I have witnessed the enforcement of this policy .
On June 30 , I visited the Veterans Affairs Hospital in West Haven , Conn. , to distribute information on the state ’s new voting machines and to register veterans to vote .
I was not allowed inside the hospital .
Outside on the sidewalk , I met Martin O’Nieal , a 92 - year - old man who lost a leg while fighting the Nazis in the mountains of Northern Italy during the harsh winter of 1944 .
Mr. O’Nieal has been a resident of the hospital since 2007 .
He wanted to vote last year , but he told me that there was no information about how to register to vote at the hospital and the nurses could not answer his questions about how or where to cast a ballot .
I carry around hundreds of blank voter registration cards in the trunk of my car for just such occasions , so I was able to register Mr. O’Nieal in November .
I also registered a few more veterans  whoever I could find outside on the hospital ’s sidewalk .
Leading neocon Daniel Pipes ( director of the Middle East Forum ) said in an interview posted Wednesday at National Review Online , that if Barack Obama is elected , George Bush would attack Iran in the remaining ten weeks of his term .
“ Should the Democratic nominee win in November , President Bush will ‘ do something . ’ and should it be Mr. McCain who wins , he ’ll ‘ punt , ’ and let Mr. McCain decide what to do .
He called on powers such as Russia and China to prevent a US unilateral strike by helping Washington increase pressure on Tehran .
“ Look , if you do n’t want an American attack , then you have to join us in being very serious with the Iranians and making clear to them we will attack if they do n’t stop . ”
Later in the interview , Pipes commented that Israel ’s nuclear capability is “ substantial . ”
The National Right to Life Committee has launched an automated calling campaign against Illinois senator Barack Obama .
The calls target voters in Indiana who are headed to the state 's presidential primary polls ,
reports The Politico's Ben Smith , who links to a recording of the call .
As Shaun Dakin , CEO and founder of The National Political Do Not Contact Registry notes in a couple of blog posts on the subject of robo - calling in Indiana , state legislators have tried to outlaw such calls , but it 's questionable as to whether the law can encompass political messages .
Dakin notes that Indiana 's State Attorney General Steve Carter has a history of strictly enforcing the law nevertheless .
His efforts have met with mixed success .
Threat Level made a call to the state AG 's office to find out whether he would go after the NRLC , but the press office has primary day off .
According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project , about two thirds of American voters received robo-calls in the final weeks before the 2006 congressional elections .
A call to the NRLC was n't returned .

One of the most closely - watched copyright infringement lawsuits brought by the RIAA appears to be coming to a screeching halt , much to the music industry 's delight .
A judge ruled Monday that a defendant had willfully and intentionally destroyed evidence of his P2P activities after being notified of pending legal action by the RIAA .
Furthermore , since it was done in bad faith , it " therefore warrants appropriate sanctions . "
The order in Atlantic v. Howell was issued at the end of a pretrial conference held in an Arizona courtroom .
Jeffery Howell , the defendant who represented himself throughout the case , was accused of copyright infringement for sharing music over the KaZaA P2P network .
Howell denied the charges , saying that the music MediaSentry saw in his shared folder was for his own private use .
Howell won a major victory against the RIAA this past April , when a judge rejected the RIAA 's cornerstone legal theory that simply making a file available on P2P network constituted copyright infringement .
Judge Neil V.
Wake denied the RIAA 's motion for summary judgment , ruling that " a distribution must involve a ' sale or other transfer of ownership ' or a ' rental , lease , or lending ' of a copy of the work .
The recording companies have not proved an actual distribution of 42 of the copyrighted sound recordings at issue , so their motion for summary judgement fails as to those recordings . "
After that ruling , it appeared as though Atlantic v. Howell was headed for a bench trial this fall , but at the end of July , the record labels filed a motion seeking judgment in their favor due to what they characterized as Howell 's attempts to cover his tracks .
According to the RIAA 's brief , Howell destroyed evidence on four separate occasions after first receiving the prelitigation settlement letter and later being served with the lawsuit .
The RIAA 's forensics experts found that Howell uninstalled KaZaA and deleted everything in the shared folder , reformatted his hard drive , downloaded and used a file - wiping program , and then nuked all the KaZaA logs on his PC .
" Defendant 's intentional spoliation of computer evidence significantly prejudices Plaintiffs because it puts the most relevant evidence of their claim permanently beyond their reach , " argued the RIAA .
" The deliberate destruction ... by itself , compels the conclusion that such evidence supported Plaintiffs ' case . "
Judge Wake agreed with the RIAA , and will inform Howell of his fate ( and presumably the amount of damages he 'll have to pay ) in a forthcoming written order .
Howell elected to defend himself in the case due to his limited financial resources and the difficulty in finding a lawyer who would take the case with the possibility of not getting paid at the end .
" What this really underscores is how difficult it is for individuals who can't afford counsel to defend themselves , " EFF staff attorney Fred von Lohmann told Ars .
" He never had an adequate opportunity to explain what happened on his PC , while the RIAA had forensics experts and lawyers to tell the story .
I think if Howell had an expert and lawyer to speak for him , he would have told a different story . "
von Lohmann became involved in the case back in January when the EFF filed a brief on the making available issue .
von Lohmann told
Ars that he also tried to find Howell a lawyer , but failed due to Howell 's inability to pay as well as the law firms that might otherwise take such a case as a " training exercise " deciding not to once they realized that they'd be facing the likes of Sony and the other Big Four labels .
" Lawyers who do cases for free are n't willing to make enemies , " said von Lohmann .
It appears that the RIAA 's case against Howell will end in much the same way that the MPAA 's lawsuit against TorrentSpy did : with the defendant ordered to pay damages due to mucking with the evidence .
TorrentSpy was ordered to pay $ 110 million in damages to the MPAA after the judge found that the site 's admins had intentionally destroyed evidence .
So while opponents of the RIAA 's legal campaign did win a very significant ruling out of the Atlantic v. Howell case , they 've also learned another lesson .
Once you 're sued by the RIAA , reformatting your hard drive and nuking your P2P apps is likely to get you in hot water with the judge .
( Corrects percentage in fourth paragraph to .03 percent , not 0.3 , as sent earlier )
WASHINGTON , July 25 ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators took over two banks on Friday and sold them to Mutual of Omaha Bank , the sixth and seventh bank failures this year as financial institutions struggle with a housing bust and credit crunch .
Two weeks after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp seized IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it closed First National Bank of Nevada and First Heritage Bank NA of California .
First National , characterized as undercapitalized , had total assets of $ 3.4 billion and $ 3 billion in deposits .
First Heritage , described as critically undercapitalized , had assets of $ 254 million and $ 233 million in deposits , regulators said .
The FDIC said the cost of the transactions to its insurance fund is estimated to be $ 862 million , adding that the two failed banks represent just .03 percent of $ 13.4 trillion in total industry assets at about 8,500 FDIC - insured institutions .
The FDIC said the 28 offices of the two banks will reopen on Monday as Mutual of Omaha Bank .
Over the weekend , customers can access their money by writing checks , using automatic teller machines or debit cards .
Mutual of Omaha Bank currently has more than $ 750 million in assets and operates 14 retail branches in Nebraska and Colorado with commercial lending offices in Dallas and Des Moines , Iowa , the FDIC said .
It is a subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha , a 99 - year - old insurance and financial services company with more than $ 19 billion in total assets .
Top banking regulators have warned of additional insolvencies this year and next , but for now do not expect failures the size of IndyMac , which had $ 32 billion in assets and $ 19 billion in total deposits at the end of March .
IndyMac , the third largest U.S. bank failure , was regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision and is expected to deplete the FDIC ’s insurance fund by between $ 4 billion and $ 8 billion .
IndyMac is being run by the FDIC while the agency looks to sell its assets .
The FDIC oversees an industry - funded reserve of about $ 53 billion used to insure up to $ 100,000 per deposit and $ 250,000 per individual retirement account at insured banks .
The agency also has a running tally of problem banks that its examiners closely monitor .
At the end of the first quarter , 90 institutions were on the list that is expected to be updated next month .
First Heritage of Newport Beach , California , had three branches with customers comprised mostly of corporations , while First National of Reno , Nevada , had 25 branches .
Both were owned by First National Bank Holding Co of Scottsdale , Arizona .
In addition to assuming all the deposits , Mutual of Omaha Bank will purchase about $ 200 million of assets and pay the FDIC a 4.41 premium to assume the deposits .
None of the entities are publicly traded .

Rice flew to Baghdad for discussions , hoping to iron out remaining differences in a U.S. - Iraq security deal that envisions the withdrawal of American troops .
BAGHDAD  The Bush administration and Iraqi government are close to completing a security agreement that Iraqi officials said tentatively calls for U.S. combat troops to be withdrawn from Baghdad and other cities by next summer .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who made an unannounced visit Thursday to Baghdad to push the deal forward , said an agreement was near although some details need to be worked out .
The current draft calls for U.S. troops to pull out of Iraqi cities and villages and withdraw to their bases by June 30 , said Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh and Ali Adeeb , a close aide to Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
The draft calls for all U.S. combat troops to be out of Iraq by 2011 , they said .
Negotiations have dragged on for months on the security deal , which includes several other contentious issues such as whether U.S. troops would besubject to prosecution in Iraqi courts .
President Bush , al - Maliki and the Iraqi parliament must sign off on the 23 - page draft , meaning key points are subject to change .
An agreement on the legal basis for U.S. forces in Iraq is necessary because the current U.N. mandate expires at the end of this year .
Rice did not discuss specific pullout dates during her one - day trip to Baghdad , though she told reporters that both governments agreed that " aspirational timetables … are well worth having . "
" There are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate , " Rice said .
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said the sides were " very , very close to closing " the deal .
Al - Dabbagh suggested , though , that some discussion remains .
He said Iraqi officials told Rice the " U.S. needs to be more flexible ( and ) needs to respect Iraqi sovereignty . "
There are 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq .
About half of them are in combat brigades , though it 's unclear how many troops would remain in a supporting role once combat troops leave .
Iraq initially wanted all combat troops out by the end of 2009 , but agreed to push the date to 2011 after the U.S. agreed to protect Iraqi funds in U.S. banks from being seized by creditors , Adeeb said .
Spokesman al - Dabbagh said that any withdrawal date in the agreement could be changed if security worsened .
He said the date only refers to American combat troops .
Support and training forces would remain at Iraq 's request , he said .
" It is in the Iraqi interests that the withdrawal of American troops not undermine the successes we 've had , " al - Dabbagh said .
" At the end , the situation on the ground will be taken into consideration and both sides will jointly decide whether or not to make amendments . "
He said Iraq wants U.S. troops to only have immunity on American bases and during military operations that the Iraqi government has signed off on .
The Americans have accepted this , but reject Iraqi demands that violations be handled in Iraqi courts of law , al - Dabbagh said .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he would not comment on ongoing negotiations .
The U.S. Embassy in Iraq also declined to comment .
The draft includes such details as how U.S. personnel will come and go from the country , which radio frequencies will be reserved for U.S. communications , and how Iraq can monitor weapons and materials brought into Iraq by the U.S. , Adeeb said .
Supporters of Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , whose Mahdi Army has battled U.S. forces off and on since 2004 , insist on a binding timeline for all U.S. troops to withdraw .
Salah al - Ubeidi , an al - Sadr spokesman , said the agreement " does not serve the interests of Iraq . "

Enlarge By Ted S. Warren , AP Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke steps out on a balcony after his speech last year at the Jackson Lake Lodge at Grand Teton National Park , Wyo.
WASHINGTON 
The difference a year can make .
In August 2007 , as financial markets began to crumble under the weight of bad mortgage loans , Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Federal Reserve 's annual gathering at Jackson Hole , Wyo. , that it was n't the central bank 's responsibility — " nor would it be appropriate " — to protect lenders and investors from poor decisions .
Bernanke may amend those remarks Friday morning when he addresses the same annual conference on the subject of financial stability .
Since Bernanke 's 2007 address , the Fed has negotiated the last - minute sale of investment bank Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase , including a $ 30 billion loan .
It has created special lending programs , providing hundreds of billions of dollars to reeling lenders and investment banks , and offered to act as a lending backstop to troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The unprecedented actions have redefined the Fed 's relationship with financial markets , but they have n't quelled the market turmoil .
They have , however , raised broad concerns about adequacy of financial regulation and the efficacy of Fed actions .
" We are providing ( banks ) lots of cash to carry them through while they have these bad loans on their books , but yet they are not required to change their business models , " says Peter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland .
Morici says the bankers gathered in Jackson Hole for what he calls an " elegant picnic " should be taking a tougher line on regulation .
Some say events forced Bernanke to change his thinking .
" It was difficult to judge initially just how problematic things would become , " says Kim Rupert , managing director at Action Economics .
" Nobody dreamed back a year ago Bear Stearns would have fallen and Fannie and Freddie would be under threat right now . "
Rupert says the heightened involvement by the Fed has raised some new issues .
The market , she says , " is a little bit concerned now that maybe the Fed is going to overstay its welcome , and almost become Japan - like in not allowing the natural course of some of these problems to take effect .
The natural course is for more banks to fail . "
Even Bernanke has acknowledged that the Fed actions , while necessary , could erode market discipline by insulating some institutions and investors from reckless decisions .
Fittingly , the theme of this year 's Jackson Hole conference , sponsored by the Kansas City Fed , is " Maintaining Stability in a Changing Financial System . "
The three - day meeting , which begins today , includes sessions examining the role of central banks in financial crises , the link between asset prices and credit conditions and implications of recent developments for regulation and oversight .
The conference is particularly topical given growing momentum for a broad overhaul of complex federal regulatory framework .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson earlier this year laid out a plan that would make the Fed a sort of super - regulator for ensuring market stability .
In Congress , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , has kicked off hearings on a possible regulatory overhaul .
Some economists warn that sweeping changes in the midst of the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression carry their own set of risks .
" History suggests that tackling an ambitious agenda for reform in the midst of a financial crisis is an invitation to bad regulation , " Robert Hahn and Peter Passell wrote in a paper for the Milken Institute .

And then on Thursday , Fast Eddie Obama had his finest hour .
Barack Obama has worked on political reform more than any other issue .
He aspires to be to political reform what Bono is to fighting disease in Africa .
He ’s spent much of his career talking about how much he believes in public financing .
In January 2007 , he told Larry King that the public - financing system works .
In February 2007 , he challenged Republicans to limit their spending and vowed to do so along with them if he were the nominee .
In February 2008 , he said he would aggressively pursue spending limits .
He answered a Midwest Democracy Network questionnaire by reminding everyone that he has been a longtime advocate of the public - financing system .
But Thursday , at the first breath of political inconvenience , Fast Eddie Obama threw public financing under the truck .
In so doing , he probably dealt a death - blow to the cause of campaign - finance reform .
And the only thing that changed between Thursday and when he lauded the system is that Obama ’s got more money now .
And Fast Eddie Obama did n’t just sell out the primary cause of his life .
He did it with style .
He did it with a video so risibly insincere that somewhere down in the shadow world , Lee Atwater is gaping and applauding .
Obama blamed the ( so far marginal ) Republican 527s .
He claimed that private donations are really public financing .
He made a cut - throat political calculation seem like Mother Teresa ’s final steps to sainthood .
The media and the activists wo n’t care ( they were only interested in campaign - finance reform only when the Republicans had more money ) .
Meanwhile , Obama ’s money is forever .
He ’s got an army of small donors and a phalanx of big money bundlers , including , according to The Washington Post , Kenneth Griffin of the Citadel Investment Group ; Kirk Wager , a Florida trial lawyer ; James Crown , a director of General Dynamics ; and Neil Bluhm , a hotel , office and casino developer .
I have to admit , I ’m ambivalent watching all this .
On the one hand , Obama did sell out the primary cause of his professional life , all for a tiny political advantage .
If he ’ll sell that out , what wo n’t he sell out ?
On the other hand , global affairs ai n’t beanbag .
If we ’re going to have a president who is going to go toe to toe with the likes of Vladimir Putin , maybe it is better that he should have a ruthlessly opportunist Fast Eddie Obama lurking inside .
All I know for sure is that this guy is no liberal goo - goo .
Republicans keep calling him naïve .
But naïve is the last word I ’d use to describe Barack Obama .
He ’s the most effectively political creature we ’ve seen in decades .
Even Bill Clinton was n’t smart enough to succeed in politics by pretending to renounce politics .
AST 309- TIME
What is the day of the week , given any date ?
This is really a nice trick .
You can easily calculate the day of the week , given any date in history , and with a little practice you can even do it in your head .
The method is based on one developed by John Horton Conway , and is described in Winning Ways , a book that he wrote with Berlekamp and Guy .
It is described in Volume 2 .
Part 1 - Within a Given Year
The secret of the method is to have a way of knowing the day of the week for one day in each month of the year .
Conway 's method uses the fact that the following dates always fall on the same day of the week in any given year .
They are easy to memorize , and once one has this down pat , some simple calculations allow you to do this for any year .
These are the dates that always fall on the same day of the week .
In 2015 , this special day of the week , which Conway calls " Doomsday , " was a Saturday .
4/4 , 6/6 , 8/8 , 10/10 and 12/12 always fall on the same day of the week ( Doomsday ) in any year .
If you memorize the phrase " I went to my nine - to - five job at the seven - eleven , " you can also remember easily that 9/5 , 7/11 , 5/9 and 11/7 also fall on Doomsday .
Also , 3/0 ( the zeroth day of March , i.e. , the last day of February ) falls on Doomsday .
January and February are complicated by the existence of Leap Years .
In ordinary years , 2/0 ( the last day of January ) also falls on Doomsday , as does 1/3 ; in Leap Years , 2/1 and 1/4 fall on Doomsday .
Alternatively , you can use the Doomsday for the previous year to handle January and February , without worrying about leap years .
Simply note that 1/2 and 2/6 fall on the Doomsday for the previous year .
In 2015 , which is a not leap year , therefore , the following dates fall on Doomsday ( Saturday ) : 1/3 , 2/0 ( 1/31 ) , 3/0 ( 2/28 ) , 4/4 , 5/9 , 6/6 , 7/11 , 8/8 , 9/5 , 10/10 , 11/7 and 12/12 .
When was Valentine 's day ?
Since this is a not leap year , 2/0 , 2/7 and 2/14 are Saturdays .
So , Valentine 's day ( 2/14 ) also fell on a Saturday .
On what date did Labor Day fall in 2015 ?
Labor Day is the first Monday in September .
If 9/5 was a Saturday , then 9/7 was a Monday , and this must have been Labor Day .
Practice :
On what date did Thanksgiving fall in 2015 ?
Thanksgiving is the fourth Thursday of November .
You figure it out , then check with a calendar to see if you were right .
Part 2 - What is Doomsday for any year of the 21st century ?
The next and hardest part of the trick ( because it requires a small amount of calculation ) is to determine Doomsday for the year in question .
Here 's how to do it .
( This is a new method , devised by Mike Walters , that is easier than the method that John Conway originally published ) :
If the year is 20xx , is xx even ?
If if is , set A=xx ; if it is odd , set A=xx +11 .
Set B=A /2 ( A is always even so you can do this exactly ) .
If B is even set C=B ; if it is odd , set C=B+11 ( this is the same thing you did in the first step ) .
C will be an even number .
Divide C by 7 and compute the remainder .
Call this remainder R .
Count R days backwards starting from Tuesday ( which is the special Doomsday that applies to this century ) .
This gives you the Doomsday for the year 20 xx .
From this point on , just use Part 1 .
Example : What was Doomsday in 2015 ?
Well , xx=15 , which is odd , so A=15+11=26 .
B=A/2=13 . B is odd so C=B+11=24 .
If we divide C=24 by 7 , we get 21 with remainder R=3 .
Count 3 days backwards from Tuesday to get Saturday .
Doomsday in 2015 was a Saturday ( a fact we used in Part 1 above ) .
Example : The World Trade Center and Pentagon suffered terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 .
xx=1 , which is odd , so A=12 .
B=A/2=6 , which is even , so C=6 .
The remainder when dividing 6 by 7 is 6 , so counting 6 days backwards from Tuesday ( or equivalently , counting 1 day forwards ) tells us that doomsday in 2001 was a Wednesday .
Therefore , 9/5 was a Wednesday , 9/12 was a Wednesday , and 9/11 was a Tuesday .
In the 20th century , use the same rule , except count backwards from Wednesday instead of Tuesday .
Wednesday is the special doomsday day for the 20th century .
Example :
On what day of the week did D - Day , June 6 , 1944 , fall ?
Well , 44 is even so A=44 , B= 22 and since B is even , C= 22 .
The remainder when dividing C by 7 is 1 so R=1 .
In the 20th century count 1 day backwards from Wednesday so Doomsday for 1944 is a Tuesday .
Since 6/6 ( June 6 ) is June 's magic day , we now know that June 6 , 1944 was a Tuesday .
Practice :
On what day of the week was Pearl Harbor bombed ?
It was December 7 , 1941 .
Hint :
This is also a 20th century date .
Practice :
On what day of the week were you born ?
Calculate it using the Doomsday rule and check it on a calendar or ( if you already know it ) with your memory .
Part 3 - Other Centuries ( Gregorian Calendar )
The Gregorian calendar , which is our civil calendar , was introduced in 1582 ( 1752 in English - speaking countries , and not until 1919 in Russia ) .
So one has to know whether the Gregorian or the old Julian calendar is being used .
The rule in this section applies only to the Gregorian Calendar .
The only thing that changes in other centuries is that instead of using Tuesday for the century doomsday as in Part 2 ( for the 21st century ) , we use another day that depends on the century .
This century day cycles over 4 centuries , so that it is the same in 16xx , 20xx , 24xx etc .
Specifically ,
In years 15xx , 19xx , 23xx , etc. , use Wednesday
In years 16xx , 20xx , 24xx , etc. , use Tuesday
In years 17xx , 21xx , 25xx , etc. , use Sunday
In years 18xx , 22xx , 26xx , etc. , use Friday
Example :
On what day of the week did July 4 , 1776 fall ?
First , calculate doomsday : xx=76 , which is even , so A=xx and B=A / 2=38 , which is also even .
So C=38 , and C/7=35 Remainder 3 and R=3 .
The century doomsday for 17xx is Sunday , so counting backwards 3 days we find that doomsday for 1776 was a Thursday .
Now July 11 is 7/11 , which is a Thursday , so July 4 , which is 1 week earlier , is also a Thursday .
The Declaration of Independence was signed on a Thursday .
Practice : The Civil War of the United States opened with the firing on Fort Sumter , which took place on April 12 , 1861 .
What day of the week was that ?
Part 4 - Julian Calendar
Finally , the same principles can be used if the date is on the old Julian Calendar , which was introduced by Julius Caesar some 2000 + years ago .
The only difference is that the different leap year rule of the Julian calendar means that the rule given in Part 3 has to be modified .
In years ccxx on the Julian calendar , we get the century Doomsday by subtracting cc from Sunday ( i.e. , counting back one day for each century ) .
Example :
In 1582 we find the Julian Doomsday as follows : xx= 82 which is even , so A=82 and B=41 .
B is odd , so C=B +11=52 .
C/7=7 Remainder 3 so R=3 .
cc=15 which is 2 weeks and 1 day , so we count 1 day backwards from Sunday to find that the ( Julian ) century doomsday for 15xx is Saturday , and since R=3 count another 3 days backwards from Saturday to find that the ( Julian ) doomsday for 15xx is Wednesday .
The last day of the old Julian calendar was October 4 , 1582 .
Since 10/10/1582 ( Julian ) was a Wednesday , 10/3/1582 was also a Wednesday , and the next day , October 4 , 1582 , was a Thursday .
The next day , October 15 , 1582 ( Gregorian ) , was the first day of the new Gregorian calendar .
Take the number R=3 that we just calculated and count 3 days backwards from Wednesday ( the Gregorian century doomsday for the 15xx dates ) to get Gregorian Doomsday :
That gives us a Sunday .
Now 10/10/1582 ( Gregorian ) would have been a Sunday if there were such a date ... So 10/15/1582 ( Gregorian ) , five days later , was a Friday , which is 1 day later than Thursday , 10/4/1582 ( Julian ) .
Note that this is the day after Thursday .
This is important .
So far as we know , the weekly cycle of the days of the week has not been broken for thousands of years .
We have found that Thursday , October 4 , 1582 ( Julian ) was followed by Friday , October 15 , 1582 ( Gregorian ) .
People complained that 10 days were missing from their lives !
Practice : September 2 , 1752 ( Julian ) was followed in the English - speaking world by September 14 , 1752 ( Gregorian ) .
On what day of the week did each fall ?
( Do the calculations separately and verify that the weekly cycle was not broken when the calendars changed . )
Note : I wrote above , " if there were such a date as 10/10/1582 . "
Actually , we can calculate backwards from the actual date of introduction of the Gregorian calendar using the Gregorian rules if we wish , and we designate such dates as being on the Gregorian Proleptic Calendar .
" Proleptic " just means " before this calendar was officially introduced , but using the same calculation rules " .

The doomsday calculation for a given year used John Conway 's original method , and not the method described here .
However , they give identical results .
Away from the headlines , there ’s a really important discussion going on about how to think about the economics of climate change .
The key player is Marty Weitzman , who has made a simple point ( albeit using very , very difficult math ) that ’s nicely summarized at Env-Econ :
Climate change is fundamentally a problem about uncertainty .
We are conducting an experiment with our planet by doubling CO2 levels in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels .
Concentrations have not been this high in hundreds of thousands of years .
By and large , we do n’t know much about the implications .
Tackling this uncertainty is crucial .
Extreme outcomes — fat tails — matter and should be at the heart of much of research .
You can see how important this point is by looking at the latest from Bjorn Lomborg ,
who says that climate change will reduce world GDP by less than 0.5 % , so it ’s not worth spending a lot on mitigation .
Weitzman ’s point is , first , that we do n’t actually know that : a small loss may be the most likely outcome given what we know now , but there ’s some chance that things will be much worse .
( Marty surveys the existing climate models , and suggests that they give about a 1 % probability to truly catastrophic change , say a 20 - degree centigrade rise in average temperature . )
And here ’s the thing : on any sort of expected - welfare calculation , the small probability of catastrophe dominates the expected loss .
Suppose that there ’s a 99 % chance that Lomborg is right , but a 1 % chance that catastrophic climate change will reduce world GDP by 90 % .
You might be tempted to disregard that small chance — but if you ’re even moderately risk averse ( say , relative risk aversion of 2 — econowonks know what I mean ) , you quickly find that the expected loss of welfare is n’t 0.5 % of GDP , it ’s 10 % or more of GDP .
The question is , can we mobilize people to make modest sacrifices to protect against low - probability catastrophes in the distant future ?
Seemingly , people in the space community have a tendency to push the boundaries of thought about all the possibilities that await us in the universe .
Case in point : Geoffrey Landis .
Landis is a scientist at NASA ’s Glenn Research Center who writes science fiction in his spare time .
Last week Landis shared with us his ideas for using a solar powered airplane to study Venus .
This week , Landis goes a step farther ( actually , several steps farther ) with his ideas about colonizing Venus .
Yes , Venus , our hot , greenhouse - effect - gone - mad neighboring planet with a crushing surface pressure that has doomed the few spacecraft that have attempted to reach the planet ’s mysterious landscape .
Landis knows Venus ’ surface itself is pretty much out of the question for human habitation .
But up about 50 kilometers above the surface , Landis says the atmosphere of Venus is the most Earth - like environment , other than Earth itself , in the solar system .
What Landis proposes is creating floating cities on Venus where people could live and work , as well as study the planet below .
“ There ’s been a lot of people who have been proposing space colonies , such as colonies that are in free space , separate from any planet , ” said Landis .
“ And I said , well , if you ’re thinking that far into the future why do n’t we think of some more groundbreaking , or perhaps we should say atmosphere - breaking possibilities . ”
50 km above the surface , Venus has air pressure of approximately 1 bar and temperatures in the 0°C to 50 °C range , a quite comfortable environment for humans .
Humans would n’t require pressurized suits when outside , but it would n’t quite be a shirtsleeves environment .
We ’d need air to breathe and protection from the sulfuric acid in the atmosphere .
In looking at Venus , the fact that struck Landis the most is that Earth ’s atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen would actually float in Venus ’ atmosphere of carbon dioxide .
“ Because the atmosphere of Venus is CO2 , the gases that we live in all the time , nitrogen and oxygen , would be a lifting gas , ” he said .
“ On Earth , we know to get something to lift , you need something lighter than air .
Well , on Venus , guess what ?
Our air is lighter than air , or at least lighter than the Venus atmosphere . ”
So , create a bubble , fill it with Earth - like atmosphere , and it would float on Venus .
“ If you could just take the room you ’re sitting in and replace the walls with something thinner , the room would float on Venus , ” said Landis .
The biggest challenge would be using a substance resistant to sulfuric acid to form the outer layer of the bubble ; ceramics or metal sulfates could possibly serve in this role , but of course , you ’d want to be able to see outside , as well .
“ Just think of the great pictures you could get , ” said Landis .
Asked if he has ever thought about terraforming Venus , Landis said , “ Oh , yes , of course !
That ’s one of the reasons I started thinking about the floating cities on Venus .
The more you look at Venus , the more you say , ‘oh my goodness , terraforming would be a really hard project . ' ”
Back in about 1962 when Carl Sagan first talked about the concept of terraforming Venus , it was n’t known what a challenge Venus would be .
“ They did n’t quite know how difficult Venus is , they did n’t know how thick the atmosphere was on Venus and how hot it was , ” said Landis .
“ They knew it had a greenhouse effect , but they did n’t know how bad .
But the more we look at the problems , the more we say , goodness , terraforming is a very difficult proposition . ”
But Landis thinks Venus already has a very nice environment .
“ What I like to say , the problem with Venus is if you define sea level as the place in the atmosphere where it ’s the same as Earth , the place of “ sea level ” on Venus is just too far above the ground . ”
While Landis ’ plans for a solar powered airplane are a true possibility for an upcoming mission to Venus , his ideas about colonizing that planet are a little more speculative .
“ This is really just a thought exercise , ” said Landis , “ an exercise in imagination rather than something we ’re likely to do in the near term .
I do n’t expect people will be building cities on Venus , at least probably not in this century . ”
Anyone having visions of Bespin and Lando Calrissian from “ The Empire Strikes Back ” ?
Maybe that should be “ Landis ” Calrissian .

Compare and contrast : And : Which do you think is easier to read ?
Are classes and modules easier to read and understand when they have lots and lots of specific methods like #any ?
or are they easier to read and understand with a small number of axiomatic methods that can be composed and combined like #fold and #unfold ?
When you design a module or class , do you write lots of convenience methods in advance ?
Or do you refactor code by writing convenience methods when you find yourself repeating the same code ?
If you do refactor code to eliminate duplication , is there an amount of duplication that is too small to matter , like " !! " ?
Or is there an underlying principle of documenting intent that you wish to make explicit ?
Is : Misleading because it does n’t actually use the element it detects ?
Or is it a reasonable idiom to test for an element ’s existence without using a specific method like #any or #nil ?
Are applications easier to read and understand when they make use of lots and lots of specific methods like #any or are they easier to read and understand when they compose and combine a smaller number of axiomatic methods so that you are n’t constantly looking things up ?
Do you think applications should have large or small vocabularies ?
This example can be easily translated to the language du jour , the underlying principle applies to programming in general
The snippets , though , seem tailor - made for attack ads against Obama , who at first responded to media coverage of Wright ’s inflammatory remarks by asserting , “ The statements that Rev . Wright made that are the cause of this controversy were not statements I personally heard him preach while I sat in the pews of Trinity or heard him utter in private conversation . ”
But in the audio book , Obama recreates the very first sermon he heard Wright deliver — “ The Audacity of Hope , ” a phrase Obama has since used frequently , including as the title of his second book — which includes several remarks similar to those that sparked the controversy .
Obama describes the sermon as “ a meditation on a fallen world .
… Rev. Wright spoke of Sharpsville and Hiroshima , the callousness of policy makers in the White House and in the State House . ”
Other potentially troublesome clips feature Obama swearing and quoting others using racial slurs .
Obama campaign spokesman Nick Shapiro denied that the senator ’s audio book passages could hurt his candidacy .
“ It will be no surprise if the right wing once again resorts to the politics of distraction , because they know that the majority of Americans trust Barack Obama to end the war in Iraq , provide affordable access to universal health care and find real solutions to lowering gas prices , the issues that matter most to them , ” he said .
Obama himself seemed to grasp the potential political implications of his words when he voiced the book .
In the preface to the audio version , which is based on the 2004 re-release of the book , he seems resigned to his words being used against him .
“ I cannot honestly say that the voice in this book is not mine — that I would tell the story much differently today than I did 10 years ago , ” he says , “ even if certain passages have proven to be inconvenient politically , the grist for political commentary and opposition research . ”
“ My copy of his book is dog-eared and covered with yellow marker , ” said Floyd Brown , a longtime conservative activist whom Obama recently cited by name as a prototypical political mudslinger .
Brown added that the audio should be even more effective in bashing Obama .
“ I expect to use his words a lot in the ads that I do , ” Brown said .
“ And I would highly encourage other independent efforts — or the [ McCain ] campaign itself — to do the same thing . ”
“ Most people will only start focusing on this race after Labor Day .
Most Americans do n’t give a rip yet , ” said Brown , who is perhaps best known as a creator of the independent expenditure Willie Horton ad that helped elect George H.W. Bush in 1988 .
“ Most have n’t looked at the issues .
They do n’t know Barack Obama .
It ’s all about delivering messages to those people during that moment in time when they ’re listening . ”
Brown was coy about what specific audio quotes from the book would be used but allowed , “ What we ’re doing now is test - marketing messages . ”
Some Republicans , though , remain skeptical .
One consultant with experience in the Bush - Cheney 2004 reelection campaign warned that it “ would be dramatically stupid ” to use the audio in attack ads .
“ This country has elected two straight presidents who have tacitly or overtly admitted drug use .
I do n’t think it ’s going to work . ”

Like the Iraq war and the " war on terror " , the so - called " drug war " is a government contrived " war " based on lies that generates massive profits for a few while causing massive suffering for many .
The drug war is futile by design ( and thus never - ending ) because it doesn�t " fight " drugs �quite the contrary �it strongly encourages production and distribution of prohibited drugs by guaranteeing extremely high profits .
But the most insidious and evil aspect of the drug war is it manufactures its own enemies by criminalizing the most basic of human rights �the right of sovereignty over your own body .
The drug war could not exist without first inventing a bogus crime .
Our government wastes billions of tax dollars each year harassing and jailing millions of decent , productive Americans for a government - invented " crime " .
The use of drugs ( even dangerous drugs like alcohol and nicotine ) simply doesn�t meet any reasonable definition of " crime " .
Real crime requires action that harms another .
Real crime requires both a victim and a perpetrator .
For example , robbery harms another and has both a victim and a perpetrator .
Only a corrupt , depraved government could invent a crime you commit against yourself .
If you use certain drugs , our government claims you �re both a criminal and a victim at the same time .
Since the perpetrator can't be separated from the victim , the victim is further punished for the " crime " .
This pathetic perversion of justice is vigorously championed by our government for selfish political reasons .
More than 50 government agencies share billions of your tax dollars each year " fighting " a government - created crime .
Of the millions of illegal drug users , the vast majority use marijuana .
If marijuana were legal like alcohol , these government agencies would suddenly lose billions of dollars because millions of former " criminals " would suddenly be granted sovereignty over their own bodies .
The vast army amassed to fight the drug war would need to be dissolved at great cost .
That �s why our government strongly opposes even honest debate about marijuana legalization because this massive money - making scam would soon end .
Ingesting nicotine , alcohol , fatty foods , or certain drugs may be unwise .
But why is it a crime ?
If a drug user or a non -drug user harms another they should be treated equally .
But the bogus " crime " of drug use does n't require harming anyone .
Nor does it require a victim and a perpetrator .
It only requires a government - invented , bogus criminal / victim , a drug user .
By using lies and deception our government convinces gullible Americans that simply putting something into your own body is a serious crime .
But evidence clearly shows that nearly all the harm associated with drug use is caused by creating the bogus crime , not from the actual drug use .
There are millions of drug users , but relatively few are harmed by their drug use .
These few should be patients , not criminals .
But it�s not just the millions arrested for drug use who suffer from this gross injustice .
We gullible Americans have allowed our government to invent a bogus crime that causes massive misery worldwide while costing the taxpayers billions .
Consider the following list of easily avoidable human tragedies that are the direct result of a government - invented , bogus crime : A tax - free , unregulated , multi-billion - dollar drug industry necessarily run by violent criminals ; a giant law enforcement bureaucracy wasting billions in a futile attempt to curtail this drug industry , which , in fact , guarantees its extreme profitability ; a deteriorating public education system robbed of billions to support this law enforcement bureaucracy ; courts and prisons overflowing with non-violent " criminals " while murderers , rapists and real criminals go free ; tens of thousands of children enduring the suffering and stigma of having one or both parents in jail for a bogus " crime " ; the gradual erosion of our Constitution as more and more civil liberties are sacrificed to fight a crime " made in USA . " ; rampant corruption of foreign governments ( like Mexico and Columbia ) , so driven by US drug profits that life and human rights are secondary ; thousands of adults and children infected and dying from HIV because distributing clean needles is a " crime " ; violent street gangs with little incentive for education or legitimate jobs reaping huge drug profits made possible by a bogus crime ; a growing death toll from police breaking down doors to catch people using substances less dangerous than tobacco , alcohol or fatty foods ; a growing cynicism and disrespect for all laws and authority fueled by the knowledge our government can arbitrarily invent a bogus crime �
This sordid list goes on and on .
We 're appalled when Islamic regimes invent bogus crimes against reading certain books , or listening to certain music .
Using certain drugs is our government 's version of the same thing .
But the worldwide consequences of US drug prohibition are far more serious and severe .
All of these " crimes " lack the moral basis of real crime .
All are clear cases of a repressive government dictating the private personal behavior of its citizens .
If real crime is knowingly causing harm to others , then the real crime here is not drug use , but making drug use a " crime " .
And the real criminals are not drug users , but ordinary people like us , who sit back and condone a ruthless scam that has been exported and exploited around the world leaving massive human suffering in its wake .

It 's impossible to reason people out of something they have never been reasoned into .
-- Jonathan Swift --
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
An explosion at a fireworks plant killed 15 people and wounded six others in northern China , state media reported Sunday .
The deadly explosion occurred Saturday at a plant in Sijiazi Township in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region , the Xinhua news agency said .
On Sunday , rescue workers found two bodies buried in the rubble , bringing the total to 15 , Xinhua said .
The blast may have been set off after workers at the plant did not follow regulations while weighing and mixing ingredients to make fireworks , Xinhua reported .
Runaway girl , 16 , reveals plans to marry her RE teacher , 50 ... after he divorces his third wife
A religious education teacher who caused outrage by moving in with a 16 - year - old former pupil has announced that the couple plan to marry .
Father - of - two Clive Richards , 50 , who has already been married three times , says he expects to wed Jessica Anderson next autumn , after she turns 18 .
Deputy head girl Jessica moved into Richards 's home after being taught by him at her mixed comprehensive school .
Jess Anderson , 16 , and her former teacher Clive Richards , 50 , have revealed they will marry next year once she turns 18
Her parents were devastated by the relationship .
The latest news has left them so distraught that they are planning to move away from the area .
Richards and Jessica live in a rented cottage in the village of Goldsithney , near Penzance , Cornwall , and have announced they will marry in September 2009 .
He said : ' Despite common predictions , we are still together and very happy .
We have taken this at our own pace and it has been very hard .
' But we have had some great and unexpected support from people .
In 15 months ' time we plan to get married .
There have been rumours Jess is pregnant but that is not true .
But we are getting married .'
Former deputy head girl Jess says she ' is deeply in love ' with Richards
Jessica said : ' I am frustrated that everyone thinks I 've been brainwashed .
I am an individual with my own mind and this is what I want . '
Since the relationship was revealed by the Daily Mail almost six months ago , Jessica has also told how she fell ' deeply in love ' with grey - haired Richards and denied allegations that she was groomed .
She said : ' Myself and Clive share numerous enjoyments through music , films and books .
Sadly a lot of pain has been caused , but I hope we can be loving families again .
We 're are very happy .
I just wish would people would respect that .'
She told her family about the relationship in an email which read : ' I will not be coming home .
Clive and I are to settle down together and just get on with our life . '
Jessica has been living with Richards and his 14 - year - old son Ben in the same village as her mother Frances Hichens , 38 , her stepfather Phil Hichens , 50 , and her 13 - year - old brother .
Her father , Steven Anderson , also lives nearby .
Mrs Hichens , a hospital ward clerk , and her husband , a property developer , have put their £ 550,000 four - bedroom home up for sale .
She said : ' We are still at a loss to understand how this happened .
She is such a sweet girl .
The whole family is still very upset about it .
We still cry about it all the time .
' We have had very little contact with Jess and what there has been has been fairly hostile . '
Jess 's mother Frances Hichens , stepfather Phil and father Steven Anderson ( right ) have all spoken out about their daughter 's relationship
She added : ' I have no idea of their plans for the future .
As far as I know , neither of them do anything for money at the moment .
' We are moving away from here to somewhere where I do n't feel I have a beacon on my head every time I leave the house . '
Richards had been living in the cottage with his wife Julia and their two sons until three days before Jessica moved in earlier this year .
It is not known whether Richards has begun divorce proceedings .
He left his post at Mounts Bay School , Penzance , in April 2007 and always insisted the relationship began after Jessica turned 16 and after he had left the school .
After leaving , he began preliminary training to become a vicar at a local parish .
But this ended after some churchgoers became concerned about his behaviour .
He and Jessica are believed to be living on income support and child benefits .
McCain Pledges to Balance Budget in First Term
GOP Candidate Promises to Cut Taxes , Slow Government Spending
After yet another campaign staff shake - up , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , will try to repackage his economic plans by promising to balance the federal budget in four years .
The bold declaration -- which McCain will make during a Denver town hall meeting as part of a weeklong tour of swing states -- is part of his efforts to be perceived as the candidate who can manage the economy ; the economy has become voters ' overwhelmingly top priority , and it offers a way for McCain to dramatically differentiate himself from President Bush .
McCain Refocuses on Economy
McCain's Jobs for America tour is also intended to shake the image that McCain lacks knowledge about the economy , a view the presumptive Republican presidential candidate has fed with his own comments .
The latest ABC News poll indicates Americans trust Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , to handle the economy better than McCain , 52 percent to 36 percent .
McCain and Steve Schmidt , the new official managing the day - to - day operations of McCain 's campaign , know that has got to change .
At a town hall meeting in Denver , McCain vows to balance the federal budget by 2013 , which would be the end of his first term as president .
The federal deficit is currently projected by the Congressional Budget Office to hit $ 443 billion by 2013 , assuming the Bush tax cuts are extended .
McCain will argue that his ambitious goal of balancing the budget can be attained through five main points : economic growth spurred by the elements of his economic plan , eliminating congressional budget add - ons called earmarks , offering private Social Security accounts for younger Americans , withdrawing troops from the Middle East and freezing or slowing discretionary spending .
McCain has vowed before to balance the budget by 2013 , and then backed off that .
Appearing on " This Week With George Stephanopoulos " last April , McCain was asked if he was sticking to his 2013 balanced budget deadline .
Instead of sticking to the promise , McCain said " that would be the goal . "
" We will have made a long progress toward it , " McCain said , being less emphatic about the deadline .
" Now , if economic conditions continue to deteriorate , it 's going to be harder , but we 're going to be on a path to a balanced budget . "
The Obama campaign , which will also concentrate on the economy this week starting with an event Monday in Charlotte , N.C. , was silent this morning on McCain 's proposal .
But Jason Furman , Obama 's economic policy director , told Politico that McCain 's promise to balance the budget in four years was " preposterous . "
Small Business , Lower Corporate Taxes
McCain 's economic formula places the emphasis on making it easier for small businesses to expand .
It also includes lower corporate taxes , opening more markets to American products and what he calls the Lexington Project -- jobs focused on new energy technologies .
The McCain campaign produced a letter today signed by 300 economists endorsing his plan .
But Stuart Rothenberg , who runs the Rothenberg Political Report , told " Good Morning America " Monday that the McCain plan remains a tough sell .
" He has fallen into more of a typical generic Republican message , and that 's not a good place to be with a bad economy and an unpopular president , " Rothenberg said .
Obama has attacked McCain 's economic proposals .
In Zanesville , Ohio , Obama recently ripped into the proposals by claiming " John McCain wants to provide $ 300 billion in more tax breaks to corporations and wealthy CEOs . "
The Obama camp has also put together a Web video of McCain downplaying his own economic expertise , with quotes like " I can't come down and give you a specific solution because I do n't claim to be smart enough , " and " I am not an expert on Wall Street .
I am not an expert on some of this stuff .
I do n't have that kind of expertise . "

In the W5 star - forming region , the oldest stars ( blue dots ) reside at the centers of two hollow cavities ( other blue dots are background and foreground stars ) .
Younger stars ( pink dots ) line the rims of the cavities , and some can be seen dots at the tips of the elephant - trunk - like pillars .
The very youngest stars are forming in the white knotty areas , with heated dust ( red ) pervading the region 's cavities .
A glitzynew family portrait of a star - forming region supports a theory that theuniverse 's most massive stars carve out these wispy wombs and thereby enablestellar embryos to take shape .
Theinfrared photograph , which will be detailed in the Dec. 1 issue of The AstrophysicalJournal , bolsters a long - held theory of star formation .
Stars areborn within clouds of gas and dust that dot most galaxies .
Scientists thinkthat turbulence from the wind of other stars within these clouds gives rise toknots of material with enough mass that the gas and dust begins to collapseunder their own weight .
As the cloud collapses , the material heats up and forms anembryonic star , or " protostar , " at its center .
The protostar develops intoa full - fledged star powered by thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen and other lightelements in its core .
One theorydescribes a process whereby massive stars , weighing from 15 to about 60 timesthe mass of the sun , can trigger the formation of such clumps of material and , in turn , stellarnewborns .
The theorygoes these stars are so hefty some of their material slides off in the form ofwinds .
The scorching - hot stars also blaze with intense radiation .
Over time , both the wind and radiation blast away surrounding cloud material , carving outexpanding cavities .
As thewinds and radiation make more elbow room , gas and dust get pushed against therim of the cavity .
Astronomers have long suspected that this compressionignites successive generations of stars along a cavity 's expanding rim .
This resultcame into sparkling view with new images by NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope of astar - forming region called W5 , which appears to span an area of the sky equalto four full moons and is located about 6,500 light - years away in theconstellation Cassiopeia .
A light - year is the distance light will travelin a year , or about 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion kilometers ) .
The imageshowed a family of stars that got progressively younger with distance from acavity center .
So the elderly , most massive stars sat in the centers of W5 ' stwo hollow cavities and the younger stars lined the cavities ' rims and tips of theregion 's elephant - trunk - like pillars .
Thisladder - like separation of ages provides some of the best evidence yet , theresearchers say , that massive stars give rise to younger generations .
" Triggeredstar formation continues to be very hard to prove , " said lead researcherXavier Koenig of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
" But our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explainthe multiple generations of stars seen in the W5 region . "
The teamplans to follow up the study with more detailed measurements of the stars ' agesto see if there is a distinct age difference between the stars just inside andoutside the cavity rim .
Maybe the deeper truth of this story became muddled and embellished , as such stories do , over the years , by people with no intent to mislead .
You can see why .
Our memories are fallible ( as McCain 's has been on his prison years before ) .
And it 's hard to convey how awful " long - time standing " can be as a torture technique and so the mercy involved in the original incident was less anecdote - worthy .
And maybe the notion of another human being simply humane was not compelling enough for a narrative as grand and world - heroic as " Faith Of My Fathers , " with the emphasis on faith .
But it remains a fact that the original telling had no explicitly Christian content - and no cross in the dirt .
It 's about someone being human .
Moreover , it 's not as if McCain felt constrained in 1973 to say only bad things about the " gooks " who kept watch .
In 1973 , he singled out the guard whose humanity he remembered .
And surely , surely , a Christian gesture in a Communist torture camp would have imprinted itself indelibly on McCain 's consciousness .
He was capable of using Christian imagery .
In 1974 , he told a story at a Prayer Breakfast hosted by Reagan of a cell in Hanoi where the beginning of the Creed had been etched in the stone wall .
So it 's just baffling that an overwhelming moment of Christian witness would be absent from his first telling of the story - and never surface for another twenty - five years .
Then this : I 've also been unable to locate the actual alleged passage in the Gulag Archipelago that is referred to in Luke Veronis ' " The Sign Of The Cross . "
( If anyone does , please let me know . )
But a reader notes that the story of Solzhenitsen and the cross in the dirt was popularized by evangelical leader and former Watergate crook , Chuck Colson .
The anecdote appears in Colson 's 1983 book , " Loving God . "
Here 's the relevant passage :
Like other prisoners , Solzhenitsen worked in the fields , his days a pattern of backbreaking labor and slow starvation .
One day the hopelessness became too much to bear .
Solzhenitsen felt no purpose in fighting on , his life would make no ultimate difference .
Laying his shovel down , he walked slowly to a crude work - site bench .
He knew at any moment a guard would order him up and , when he failed tro respond , bludgeon him to death , probably with his own shovel .
He 'd seen it happen many times .
As he sat waiting , head down , he felt a presence .
Slowly he lifted his eyes .
Next to him sat an old man with a wrinkled , utterly expressionless face .
Hunched over , the man drew a stick through the sand and Solzhenitsen 's feet , deliberately tracing out the sign of the cross .
As Solzhenitsen started at that rough outline , his entire perspective shifted .
He knew he was merely one man against the all - powerful Soviet empire .
Yet in that moment , he also knew that the hope of all mankind was represented by that simple cross - and through its power , anything was possible .
Solzhenitsen slowly got up , picked up his shovel , and went back to work - not know that his writings on truth and freedom would one day enflame the whole world .
This passage became popularized inn the 1970s by , among others , Jesse Helms , as the notes in " Loving God " explain :
" The story about Alexander Solzhenitsen and the old man who made the sign of the cross was first told by Solzhenitsyn to a group of Christian leaders and later recounted by Billy Graham in his New Year 's telecast , 1977 .
It has been retold subsequently , most publicly by Senator Jesse Helms ( R- NC ) . "
Now here 's the 1999 Mark Salter version of the McCain story :
After one difficult interrogation , I was left in the interrogation room for the night , tied in ropes .
A gun guard , whom I had noticed before but had never spoken to , was working the night shift , 10:00 p.m. to 4 a.m .
A short time after the interrogators had left me to ponder my bad attitude for the evening , this guard entered the room and silently , without looking at or smiling at me , loosened the ropes , and then he left me alone .
A few minutes before his shift ended , he returned and tightened up the ropes ...
One Christmas , a few months after the gun guard had inexplicably come to my assistance during my long night in the interrogation room , I was standing in the dirt courtyard when I saw him approach me .
He walked up and stood silently next to me .
Again , he did n't smile or look at me .
He just stared at the ground in front of us .
After a few moments had passed he rather nonchalantly used his sandaled foot to draw a cross in the dirt .
We both stood wordlessly looking at the cross until , after a minute or two , he rubbed it out and walked away .
I saw my good Samaritan often after the Christmas when we venerated the cross together .
But he never said a word to me nor gave the slightest signal that he acknowledged my humanity .
One detail has changed : McCain 's first version has the guard making the sign with his feet , while the latest ad shows the sign being made with Solzhenitsen 's stick .
So the ad itself is closer in imagery to the Colson account than to Salter's .
But the trope is exactly the same : the silent communication , the total stranger , the desolation , and the cross .
And , of course , this has profound Christian symbolic reference .
Every Christian will immediately associate the drawing in the dirt with a stick with Jesus and the woman caught in adultery : another moment of unexpected mercy .
In last weekend ’s edition of CounterPunch , Alexander Cockburn updates the ongoing persecution of Sami Al - Arian by federal prosecutors .
Al - Arian was a Florida university professor of computer science who was ensnared by the Bush Regime ’s need to produce “ terrorists ” in order to keep Americans fearful and , thereby , amenable to the Bush Regime ’s assault on US civil liberties .
The charges against Al - Arian were rejected by a jury , but the Bush Regime could not accept the obvious defeat .
If Al - Arian was not a terrorist , then other of the Bush Regime ’s fabricated cases might fall apart , too .
In open view , the US Department of Justice ( sic ) proceeded to trash every known ethical rule of prosecution .
I do n’t need to repeat the facts , as they are covered by Cockburn ’s articles and in The Tyranny of Good Intentions .
Instead , I want to point out another meaning of the Al - Arian case .
The Justice ( sic ) Department itself knows that it is persecuting a totally innocent person for reasons of a political agenda -- the need to convince gullible Americans of an ongoing terrorist threat .
The existence of this threat is used to justify the Bush Regime ’s adoption of police state measures , such as spying on Americans without warrants , arresting them without charges , and refusing to let go of them when they are cleared by juries .
Sami Al - Arian is a fabricated terrorist created by federal prosecutors and judges in behalf of an undeclared agenda .
The Al - Arian case proves that terrorists are in short supply and that the Bush Regime has had to create them out of total innocents .
The “ war on terror ” is a hoax used to justify war crimes and the overthrow of America ’s civil liberties .
The anthrax scare is one more example of the Bush Regime ’s use of disinformation to advance an undeclared political agenda .
As Glenn Greenwald reminded us last week in Salon , the Bush Regime used Brian Ross at ABC News to spread the lie far and wide that US government tests proved that the anthrax mailed to various Americans , including prominent US Senators , was made in Iraq by Saddam Hussein .
This lie was essential for scaring Congress into passing the Bush Regime ’s Gestapo laws , such as the PATRIOT Act , and for overcoming opposition to invading Iraq .
When it leaked out that the anthrax actually came from a US government lab , the Bush Regime tried to frame a US scientist , Steven J. Hatfill , but failed .
On June 28th , the Los Angeles Times reported that Hatfill , “ The former Army scientist who was the prime suspect in the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings agreed Friday to take $ 5.82 million from the government to settle his claim that the Justice Department and the FBI invaded his privacy and ruined his career . ”
Indeed , U.S. District Court Judge Reggie B. Walton allowed Hatfill ’s attorneys two years to review all news reports and FBI evidence .
Judge Walton stated : “ there is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that Dr. Hatfill had anything to do with this . ”
The anthrax matter was again news last week when another US government scientist , Bruce E. Ivins , “ committed suicide . ”
Instantly , the deceased Ivins was fingered as the culprit .
Overnight a man , liked and respected by his colleagues , who had worked on American biological warfare weapons for years , became a deranged homicidal maniac who decided to murder Americans at random in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 by sending them letters containing anthrax .
I do n’t believe a word of it .
But assume that it is true .
Blaming the anthrax letters on Ivins does not resolve the issue of why the Bush Regime lied to Brian Ross and used ABC to put the blame on Saddam Hussein in order to invade an innocent country .
Would n’t a government that would lie about something this serious lie about other serious matters ?
The Bush Regime stands against the truth .
That is why it pretends to have the power to prevent executive branch officials wanted for questioning by Congress from appearing before the people ’s representatives .
Nothing could make clearer the contempt that the Bush Regime has for the American people and their elected representatives than its arrogant claim that it is unanswerable to them .
Obviously , neither the President nor the Vice President respect their oaths of office .
If they will betray such a serious oath , wo n’t they lie about everything ?
According to the discredited 9/11 Commission Report , a few Muslims hatched a multi- year plot that went undetected by the vast security agencies of the United States and its allies , and within one hour on one morning at four different locations defeated airport security , NORAD , the US Air Force , Vice President Cheney , Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld , the Pentagon ’s defenses and crashed three hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center towers and the heart of the US military .
Muslims were able to achieve this fantastic feat operating out of caves in Afghanistan .
We now know for a fact that the “ terrorist anthrax attack ” had nothing whatsoever to do with Muslim terrorists .
Even the US Government now blames white American citizens , employees of the federal government , for the anthrax letters that , at the time , were blamed on the “ Osama bin Laden al Qaeda plot against America . ”
We now know for a fact that this was intentional disinformation planted by the Bush Regime on a gullible and incompetent ABC News reporter , who is a disgrace to journalism .
No one denies this .
We also know for a fact that ABC News will not say who planted on ABC the lies that committed the United States to the dishonor of an illegal invasion , war crimes , and executive branch attack on the US Constitution .
How can anyone anywhere in the world rely on ABC News when it serves as a disinformation agency for a criminal regime ?
The anthrax letters made the “ terrorist attack ” seem wider and more general .
This increased the sense of peril and Americans ’ fear and anger , thereby opening wider the door for the Bush Regime ’s attack on Iraq and US civil liberty .

What happens when you turn off the pollution ?
Well the Beijing Olympics are giving scientists a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to observe how the atmosphere responds when a heavily populated region seriously curbs everyday industrial emissions .
Scripps Institution of Oceanography is flying unmanned aerial vehicle to measure smog and its effects on weather during China ’s ‘ Great Shutdown . ’
The flights start at Cheju Island in South Korea , 725 miles southeast of Beijing , and directly in the path of Chinese pollution plumes .
Data from the flights , combined with satellite and ground observations , are tracking dust , soot and other aerosols leaking out of China in atmospheric brown clouds .
Chinese officials have reduced industrial activity by as much as 30 percent and mandated cuts in automobile use by half , to safeguard the health of competing athletes .
Too bad most of Beijing ’s air quality does n’t have much of anything to do with its own emissions but comes from its own heavily - polluted provinces to the south .
Too bad China does n’t make the Great Shutdown permanent .
Too bad the whole world does n’t follow .
Too bad the athletes ’ health is more important than everyone else ’s .

Google Investing Over $ 10 Million in Geothermal Energy
August 19th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Geothermal energy has finally hit the big time .
Google.org , the philanthropic arm of Google , announced today that it is investing $ 10.25 million in an energy technology called Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) .
The funding will also go towards geothermal resource mapping , information tools , and a geothermal energy policy agenda .
And it looks like Google made a wise investment choice .
According to an MIT report on EGS , only 2 % of the heat beneath the continental US between 3 and 10 kilometers ( depths we can reach with current technology ) is more than 2,500 the annual energy use of the United States .
While traditional geothermal energy relies on finding natural pockets of hot water and steam , EGS fractures the hot rock , circulates water in its system , and uses the steam created from the process to create electricity in a turbine .
The investments will go towards three institutions : AltaRock Energy , Potter Drilling , and the Southern Methodist University Geothermal Lab .
Google ’s funding may just be the push we need to really get geothermal off the ground , once again proving that government funding and initiatives can’t do everything .
Substantial change can only come when private investors and corporations decide to help out — whatever their motives may be .

Robert Mugabe 's party is demanding a recount of some votes President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai are to attend an emergency summit of regional leaders to discuss Zimbabwe 's recent election .
Saturday 's talks in Zambia were called amid the failure of Zimbabwe 's election commission to publish results of the presidential election held 12 days ago .
The opposition has refused to take part in any second round run-off vote .
Mr Tsvangirai is in Botswana , where a minister quoted him as saying he had left a tense Zimbabwe to ask for help .
We are concerned that an illegitimate government is now in place in Zimbabwe
Tendai Biti
Movement for Democratic Change
Harare diary : Seeking good omens
At a news conference in Johannesburg , South Africa , on Thursday , the Movement for Democratic Change said the delay of results amounted to " a constitutional coup d'etat " .
MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti said : " We won the presidential election hands down , without the need for a run-off , so we will not participate in a run-off . "
The MDC originally reported that Mr Tsvangirai had won 50.3 % of the vote .
Asked whether this was a big enough margin to declare victory , Mr Biti said the party had since obtained broader results suggesting it had done even better .
' No crisis ' Mr Biti accused ruling Zanu - PF - backed militias of unleashing a campaign of violence across the country to intimidate rural voters ahead of a possible run-off .
It coincided with a similar charge made by Amnesty International , which accused Zimbabwean police and soldiers of " organised post- election violence aimed at opposition supporters " .
Mr Biti said Mr Mugabe was a " caretaker president " , adding : " So we are therefore concerned that an illegitimate government is now in place in Zimbabwe . "
Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa , who chairs the 14 - nation Sadc grouping , has called the weekend 's emergency meeting .
ELECTION RESULTS SO FAR Presidential results :
None so far Winner needs more than 50 % to avoid run-off Senate results : Zanu -PF : 30 MDC : 24 MDC breakaway : 6 Zimbabwe 's Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said they were happy to brief Sadc , but added : " There is no crisis in Zimbabwe that warrants a special meeting on Zimbabwe . "
Mr Tsvangirai wants other southern African leaders to put pressure on the Zimbabwean government to announce the results of the 29 March presidential election .
US President George W Bush on Thursday said Zimbabwe 's authorities had to release the results " as soon as possible " , the White House said .
A spokesman for Mr Bush said he made the call in a telephone conversation with Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete .
Independent and ruling party projections say Mr Tsvangirai did not win the 50 % vote share needed to win outright .
Legal challenge South Africa dismissed any suggestion it would ask Mr Mugabe to step down .
Its deputy foreign minister said in Pretoria : " We are not a government who can ask other presidents to step down . "
The MDC says there is no need for a presidential run-off Meanwhile , Zimbabwe 's state - run Herald newspaper reports the ruling Zanu - PF has increased the number of constituency results it is contesting from 16 to 21 .
In the House of Assembly , Zanu - PF has lost its majority for the first time since independence , with 97 seats against the MDC 's 99 in the 210 - seat chamber .
A smaller MDC faction has 10 seats .
The MDC is still hoping legal action in the High Court will lead to the immediate release of the presidential results .
A ruling is due on Monday .

If you have ever had a pet , you have no doubt heard of pet insurance .
In general , it can help you to care for your dog or cat – possibly another type of pet as well – in the event that veterinary care that ’s necessary is too expensive .
In other words , pet insurance is similar to health insurance that covers you and your loved ones .
However , when is pet insurance necessary ?
To answer that question , it ’s important to know how the insurance works and what it entails .
How do Pet Insurance Plans Work ?
Just like with insurance that covers people , there are policies for pet insurance that include co-payments , deductibles and premiums .
With pet insurance , you typically have to pay your vet bills in full and then later wait to be reimbursed .
However , one particular pet insurance company offers a service that allows you to bypass that because it disburses payments to the vet on the same day of service .
When it comes to cost of pet insurance , that largely depends on the type of breed of your pet .
Generally speaking , purebred dogs and cats tend to cost more because they are more prone to hereditary conditions .
Another factor that comes into play in determining the cost is your pet ’s age ; the older your pet , the more you will pay because there ’s more likelihood that your pet will require more veterinary care .
In addition , most pet insurance policies do n’t cover preexisting conditions , which means you have to pay more when seeing a vet for that condition .
The same can be said for conditions that are common for a certain breed .
However , one thing worthy of note is that some pet insurance policies are changing for the better and covering preexisting and breed - specific conditions .
This is something to consider when you choose a provider .
What is Covered by Pet Insurance ?
Pet insurance covers a wide range of issues , such as illness and accidents .
Some insurance providers also offer routine wellness care like annual health exams , vaccinations and more .
The majority of pet insurance policies are for illnesses and accidents for both dogs and cats .
Very few pet owners acquire a policy to cover wellness or only accidents .
Emergency Situations and Pet Insurance
If you are the type of person who says you would pay any amount to save your pet in a life threatening situation , pet insurance is definitely worth it .
Unfortunately , too many pet owners do n’t truly go out of their way to save their dog or cat in such a situation because they do n’t want to spend too much money .
In many cases , the pet is sadly euthanized and the owner gets a replacement pet .
For that type of pet owner , the insurance would definitely be a waste of money .
However , if you acknowledge that your pet is a beloved member of your family , pet insurance can literally help to save your four - legged family member ’s life .
For example , if your dog or cat has suffered a serious injury that requires extensive surgery with a lengthy hospital stay , it will probably carry hefty bills .
In many instances , such a situation would require your regular vet to refer your pet to a veterinary hospital for treatment .
Pet insurance would cover a good portion of the costs .
Overall , it is important to consider all the details when it comes to pet insurance .
You should also explore a few options so that you know which one is best for you and your pet .
I often see ( read , here , whatever ) people commenting ( typically complaining , moaning ) about some other peoples latest business / venture and it drives me crazy .
Instead of focusing energy on what other people are doing you ’ll be so much more productive focusing on your own stuff .
Everybody is on a different business path and at a different stage ( if you ’re on the same path as the masses you probably want to differentiate ) .
Comparing your journey to somebody else is often counter productive .
What you do when you ’re at page 316 is very different to what you did when you were at page 1 .
I ’m not saying do n’t follow other folk ( hey you ’re reading this ) , but focus on the stuff that benefits you , the stuff you do n’t like or agree with just ignore it , do n’t waste your energy spending time on it .
Mind your own business .
How to Love God Without Being a Jerk
Did a lot of writing this weekend , and came up with the latest rough draft of the first chapter / introduction of .
It may not be perfect , but at least now I think I 've figured out who I 'm addressing .
Thanks to Cara for the suggestions , and let me know what you - all think , either through comments or personal emails .
Also , I 'm planning to post a lot of excerpts , so if anyone knows how to do a blogger cut ( you know , where a blue thingy reads " Click on this for more " so the post does n't take up such massive yardage ) , I 'd appreciate it .
I can do it in LiveJournal , but not , apparently , in Blogger .
Yet .******** This is the hardest chapter I have to write , because if the plan of this book is going to work , it will be the first real , actual chance in years to bridge the gap between evangelical Christians , mainstream Christians , and other religions .
( Or , to put it in evangelical terms , to bridge the gap between committed Christians , liberal or nominal Christians , and non-Christians . )
This means that evangelical Christians have to be part of the conversation from the outset .
And yet , unlike many authors on this topic , I know from experience what it ’s like to be an evangelical , and I know that they ’re very easy to turn off .
To prove this , let me tell a story .
In 1988 I was taking an undergraduate class in The Renaissance and The Reformation with the world - renowned scholar Heiko Oberman .
He was a mind - blowing teacher , not only because of his intense erudition ( rumor had it that he spoke seven languages , slept only five hours a night , and used the spare time to write ever more groundbreaking research articles ) , but because he actually cared about teaching .
He took the time to give us mere undergraduates honest - to - god oral exams , and every Friday , after doing long , intense lectures on Monday and Wednesday , he devoted part of the class to answering questions that had been placed in a sort of Suggestion Box he kept on the desk .
One odd thing about the course was that it had been cross-listed in both History and Religious Studies , and the class itself seemed to be split right down the middle : half of the students were logical , flinty - minded history majors , and half were devout , conservative Christians like me .
The differences tended to come out in the questions we asked on Friday , half of which were things like , “ How did the Peace of Augsburg impact the development of free expressions of Anabaptism ? ” and the other half of which were more like , “ How come Martin Luther struggled to understand the concept of Grace , when the whole thing is clearly laid out in the book of Romans ? ”
Heiko divided his attention between both camps and in general things proceeded in a more or less academic vein .
But one day he held up a slip of paper and announced , “ This question is a little unusual , but I ’ve gotten a few of these and decided I ’d better address it .
The question is , ‘ What do you think about abortion ?
’” At this announcement , the guy next to me — an obvious history major — leaned over to me , looking puzzled and a little scornful , and whispered , “ What the fuck does that have to do with anything ?
” I knew , but I simply shrugged and kept silent .
This question had clearly come from one of my people .
It would have taken too long to explain to the guy on my right , but actually , I ’d been expecting a question like this for weeks .
In fact , I had been tempted to write the same question myself , except I was too anxious about intellectual respectability to follow through .
Fortunately , one of my fellow religious studies majors had been less fastidious .
The problem was this : Heiko was telling us troubling things .
On the very first day of class , he had said , “ Before I discuss the Reformation , I want to get out of the way several misconceptions that people often have about church history . ”
One of these myths was “ The blood of martyrs is the seed of the church ” — i.e. , the idea that the church is unstoppable , and Christians who die only cement the church ’s determination to spread .
Heiko dismissed this as ridiculous .
After all , he pointed out , the first Christian missionaries who came to Japan were completely slaughtered , and Japan heard nothing more from Christianity for several centuries .
The moment I heard this , it made sense ( no Christians in Japan ?
Of course !
That ’s why they have Buddhism instead ! ) , but it was at odds with everything I ’d felt about my own religion .
I realized then , in that very simple example , that Christians rarely hear stories about where and how Christianity has failed .
We know about terrible acts and terrible ideas ( the Inquisition , the Crusades , the Salem witch trials , etc. ) , but those are the fault , not of Christianity , but of flawed people .
( To evangelicals , the perpetrators are n’t even “ real ” Christians , so such incidents barely even count as Christian history . )
The idea that Christianity itself , in its purest form and deployed by well - meaning people , seeking only the good of others , might sometimes lose most of the battles and all of the war — this was a new thought that I had to make room for .
I survived this and following classes , but every week , and at every turn , I was aware that Heiko was offering us a view of Christian history that was essentially practical and unsentimental , a warts - and - all view that was far less triumphal than the “ Jesus Rules ! ” history we ’d gotten in Sunday school ( or , for that matter , from the Bible ) .
He talked like a Christian — rumor had it he was an ordained Reformed Church minister , and he seemed to be theologically accurate when he talked about things like grace and atonement — but he did n’t talk like a fellow evangelical .
So was he reliable ?
Was Christianity susceptible to failure or not ?
We wanted facts and he was giving us ambiguity .
And what had clearly happened on this particular Friday was that one of my fellow religious studies majors had had enough .
“ That ’s it ! , ” he or she had said , “ I ’m going to find out once and for all whether this guy is just a really brainy true Christian , or just another godless academic who wants to undermine our faith .
” The abortion question was the shortcut — a shibboleth , really .
If Oberman said he was against abortion , then he must be morally sound and , ergo , factually trustworthy , and it was worth doing extra work to actually learn and internalize all he was teaching .
If he said the wishy - washy liberal thing , then he would be consigned to the outer darkness of the Secularists To Be Shunned .
Oberman clearly did n’t understand this , or he would have addressed it in his response .
Instead he waltzed right into the trap , answered the question on its face , and did n’t even survive his first sentence .
“ This is a complicated issue that requires … ” he began , and he went on for several more minutes , but it did n’t matter .
Whichever Christian had written that question had gotten their answer at the word “ complicated . ”
And we lost at least one whole student for the rest of the semester , in spirit at least .
Tragically , this is what evangelical Christians do far too often .
And while it ’s easy for mainstream culture to scoff at a behavior that looks intellectually irresponsible , I ’d like to point out that from an evangelical perspecive it ’s a perfectly logical way to behave : since the world is divided into the saved and the damned , it ’s important to approach books with a critical eye , being careful to divine the spirit of a work , to know whether its author is a believer or not .
After all , lies are everywhere , Satan is cunning , and ambiguity is dangerous .
So for the evangelical , the weirdness of using a blunt instrument like an off - topic abortion question is worth it if it at least results in an up - or - down vote of moral clarity .
How can you walk forward if you do n’t even know where you stand ?
This is what concerns me .
If you ’re an evangelical Christian , I hope you can sense two things already : 1 . ) I ’m not a conventional evangelical Christian myself , and 2 . )
I have not misrepresented you or your faith in any unreasonable way .
Please remember this , because this book is about you , and I ’m going to say things that are going to make you uncomfortable .
I need you to keep reading , and in the process I promise to treat you more decently than most other authors on the topic .
I was one of you , I speak the language , and I think I can empathize .
And sure , I cuss now and then , but at least when I talk about religion I ’m not an arrogant prick who thinks he ’s so much smarter than everyone else .
That ’s worth staying for a few pages , do n’t you think ?
Of course , you ’ll want to know who I am and what my bona fides are , but first , I want to address the rest of the audience , who may be wondering why this book matters , what I consider evangelical , and why evangelical Christianity is so important to address .

The actress and her actor husband Ben Affleck are reportedly expecting their second child around Thanksgiving .
Jen 's former Alias co-star Victor Garber let slip the news at the end of last week .

Affleck and Garner are said to be house hunting now that their family is expanding .
They were photographed yesterday at a construction site in Brentwood .
It is unclear whether the property is being built for them or if it is a spec home that they are interested in purchasing .
Young Violet looks like the happiest kid on the planet .
She will be three years old on December 1 , 2008 .

Sources : U.S. Senate Historical Office ; U.S. House of Representatives Office of the Clerk ; Associated Press GOP senator from Alaska to be arraigned Thursday WASHINGTON  Ted Stevens , the U.S. Senate 's longest - serving Republican and one of its most influential members , was slated to be arraigned in federal court Thursday — two days after his indictment on seven counts of failing to disclose more than $ 250,000 in gifts .
Stevens , 84 , returned to work Wednesday at the Capitol complex , taking part in a meeting of the Homeland Security Committee as it drafted a bill focused on government contractors .
After the meeting , Stevens refused to answer questions from reporters .
As far as any restrictions on his life and work are concerned , a federal judge will decide where and if Stevens can travel , with whom he needs to check in and what sorts of rules he will hvbe to follow as he continues his work on Capitol Hill and his re-election campaign .

The legal bombshell comes barely three months before Election Day — jeopardizing his campaign as well as damaging his party 's changes of recapturing the Senate .
Stevens , who has long steered federal funds to his home state of Alaska , was forced to give up his positions as top Republican on two other Senate panels — including one he once chaired that controls defense spending .
On Tuesday , he became the first senator to be indicted in 15 years .
Stevens says he will fight the charges , but he did not address his political future .
" It saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me , " Stevens said in a statement .
" I have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required of a U.S. senator . "
Senate Democrats hold a 51 - 49 voting majority , and the indictment could put a safe Republican seat into play .
" I do n't think he 's going to survive this " politically , says Gerald McBeath , a political scientist at the University of Alaska - Fairbanks .

The indictment charged Stevens with failing to report gifts from VECO , an Alaska oilfield contractor , on Senate disclosure forms filed for 1999 through 2006 .
The gifts were largely for renovations on Stevens ' home .
At the time , VECO asked Stevens for favors , including help with its projects in Pakistan and Russia , the indictment says .
The grand jury did not charge Stevens with accepting bribes in exchange for helping VECO , which has been at the center of an ongoing public corruption probe in Alaska that has led to seven convictions .
" Bribery requires proof of a specific agreement of a quid pro quo of this for that , " says Matthew Friedrich , acting assistant attorney general .
" This indictment does not allege such an agreement . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Three U.S. soldiers killed four handcuffed and blindfolded Iraqi prisoners with pistol shots on the bank of a Baghdad canal last year , the New York Times reported on Wednesday .
Sergeant First Class Joseph P. Mayo , the platoon sergeant , and Sergeant Michael P. Leahy Jr. , Company D’s senior medic and an acting squad leader , made sworn statements in January to Army investigators in Schweinfurt , Germany probing the incident , the newspaper reported on its website .
The men each described killing one of the Iraqi detainees , as directed by First Sergeant John E. Hatley , according to the statements .
Hatley shot two other detainees with a pistol in the back of the head , Mayo and Leahy told investigators , according to the NYT .
U.S. soldiers cannot harm enemy combatants once they are disarmed and in custody , the NYT said .
A spokesman for the U.S. Army in Europe declined to comment , saying he could not speculate on any future legal action .
David Court , the lawyer in Germany named by the NYT as representing Hatley , was not immediately reachable .
According to Leahy ’s statement , cited by the NYT , Army officials directed Hatley ’s convoy to release the men because there was insufficient evidence to detain them .
“ First Sergeant Hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them , ” as retribution for the deaths of two soldiers from the unit , Leahy said in his statement .
“ So the patrol went to the canal , and First Sergeant , Sgt. First Class Mayo and I took the detainees out of the back of the Bradley ( fighting vehicle ) , lined them up and shot them , ” he added , according to The Times .
“ Then we pushed the bodies into the canal and left . ”
After the men were killed , Hatley told Leahy and Mayo to remove the Iraqis ’ bloody blindfolds and plastic handcuffs , according to the newspaper .
The three soldiers then shoved the bodies into the canal and drove back to their combat outpost , the paper said .
No charges have been filed against Hatley , Mayo or Leahy -- all from Company D , First Battalion , Second Infantry , 172nd Infantry Brigade .
However , four other soldiers have been charged with conspiracy to commit premeditated murder relating to an incident that occurred last year in Baghdad , the U.S. Army in Europe said in a statement last month .
A hearing in that case opened on Tuesday and is still going on in the southern German town of Vilseck , the U.S. Army spokesman said on Wednesday .
Scholars question Palin credentials
John McCain was aiming to make history with his pick of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , and historians say he succeeded .
Presidential scholars say she appears to be the least experienced , least credentialed person to join a major - party ticket in the modern era .

So unconventional was McCain ’s choice that it left students of the presidency literally “ stunned , ” in the words of Joel Goldstein , a St. Louis University law professor and scholar of the vice presidency .
“ Being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining who ’s of presidential caliber , ” said Goldstein .
“ I think she is the most inexperienced person on a major - party ticket in modern history , ” said presidential historian Matthew Dallek .
That includes Spiro T. Agnew , Richard Nixon ’s first vice president , who was governor of a medium - sized state , Maryland , for two years , and before that , executive of suburban Baltimore County , the expansive jurisdiction that borders and exceeds in population the city of Baltimore .
It also includes George H.W. Bush ’s vice president , Indiana Sen .
Dan Quayle , who had served in the House and Senate for 12 years before taking office .
And it also includes New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro , who served three terms in the House before Walter Mondale chose her in 1984 as the first female candidate on a major - party ticket .
“ It would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half , but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life , ” Dallek said of Palin .
“ The fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes Obama look like an elder statesman . ”
And Alaska is a much smaller state than Illinois , the political base of Barack Obama , whom Republicans have repeatedly criticized for being inexperienced , having served nearly four years in the U.S. Senate after eight in the Illinois state Senate .
“ Not to belittle Alaska , but it ’s different than the basket of issues you deal with in big , dynamic states , ” Dallek said .
Palin has no experience in national office .
Before becoming governor in December 2006 , she served as a council member and mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , which had a population of slightly more than 5,000 during her time in office .
Brad Blakeman , who ran the 1988 Republican convention for GOP nominee George H.W. Bush , turned the experience question on its head , suggesting that accomplishments in office mean more than time accrued .
“ Here ’s a governor who may have served two years , but her accomplishments are worth eight , ” said Blakeman , citing Palin 's work as governor on ethics reform and an Alaska oil pipeline .
“ She ’s got as much experience for being vice president as Barack does to be president . ”
But other students of presidential history said that in choosing Palin as his running mate , McCain has reached back to a time when few actually seriously contended that the vice president should be demonstrably prepared to assume the presidency from Day One .
If elected vice president , Palin would appear to have the least amount of experience in federal office or as a governor since John W. Kern , Democrat William Jennings Bryan ’s 1908 running mate , who had served for four years in the Indiana state Senate and then four more as city solicitor of Indianapolis .
The Democratic ticket lost to Republican standard - bearer William Howard Taft and running mate James S. Sherman by an Electoral College spread of 321-162 .
More conventionally in modern times , running mates could boast decades of experience in Washington , from ballot box winners like Dick Cheney , Al Gore , the elder Bush and Mondale to also - rans such as Jack Kemp , Lloyd Bentsen and Joseph I. Lieberman .
These super - credentialed candidates were sometimes chosen , like Joe Biden , to shore up the résumés of candidates with little or no time in Washington , such as Jimmy Carter ( Mondale ) , Bill Clinton ( Gore ) and Michael Dukakis ( Bentsen ) .
Palin , on the other hand , is a total “ wild card , ” said Stanford historian David Kennedy .
“ If she had been around for two terms as governor — or been a senator — it would have been an incredible choice , ” said historian Doris Kearns Goodwin .
“ Who else could he have found who appealed to the conservative base … and as someone who was a reformer ? ”
That ’s not to say Palin will be a dud on the campaign trail .
But out - of - the - box picks in recent years have not usually worked out too well for the top of the ticket .
Consider independent candidate Ross Perot ’s 1992 running mate , former Navy Adm.
James Stockdale , who famously asked at the vice presidential debate with Gore and Quayle , “ Who am I ?
Why am I here ? ”
“ He took the wind out of Perot ’s sails , and Perot could have done even better ” than the 19 percent he garnered , Dallek said .
A bad running mate pick can even put a successful presidential ticket in question .
The 1988 Bush - Quayle victory over Dukakis and Bentsen came in spite of Quayle ’s frequent campaign trail gaffes and questions about his military service in the Vietnam era and other controversies .
Bush handlers largely relegated Quayle to small - town audiences that would attract little media attention .
“ Quayle — it threw off the momentum for some weeks , ” said Goodwin .
“ One has to hope for McCain ’s sake that [ Palin ] has been fully vetted . ”
“ The first thing that hits me , ” said Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution , " is that it suggests that John McCain is a gambler .
This is a high - roller decision . ”
“ The next thing you have to ask yourself : Is it worrisome to have a gambler in the Oval Office ?
That ’s an important question , " he said , “ perhaps more important than anything else today . ”
UPDATE : After reading this article , the McCain campaign issued the following statement : " The authors quote four scholars attacking Gov. Palin 's fitness for the office of vice president .
Among them , David Kennedy is a maxed - out Obama donor , Joel Goldstein is also an Obama donor , and Doris Kearns Goodwin has donated exclusively to Democrats this cycle .
Finally , Matthew Dallek is a former speech writer for Dick Gephardt .
This is not a story about scholars questioning Gov. Palin 's credentials so much as partisan Democrats who would find a reason to disqualify or discount any nominee put forward by Sen. McCain . "
In response to the statement , David Kennedy wrote to Politico that he has contributed the maximum to Obama , but believes that does not compromise his objectivity as a historian .
Goodwin said she has contributed to no political candidates in the 2008 election cycle and has not done so for more than a decade , if not longer .
Goldstein said he has given $ 250 to Obama but rejected suggestions he can not be objective .
Dallek is a former Gephardt speechwriter - but noted that he also is the author of a well - received book about Ronald Reagan 's first election as California governor .
