GM Preps for the Debut of the Plug - in Car by Wooing Electric Companies
July 23rd , 2008 by Courtney Carlisle Bolton
In order to usher in the Chevy Volt , due out in 2010 , General Motors is partnering with 30 utility companies across 40 states to ensure that the infrastructure to support the new model will exist .
This is great news for the Toyota RAV4 drivers who have been driving electric cars for the last decade .
Of course , this new brand of plug - in cars , will still rely on fuel in addition to electricity unlike their predecessors .
The hope , of course , is that gasoline use will only be on an “ as - needed ” basis , helping cut dependence on the pump .
GM will roll out the Chevrolet Volt and Saturn Vue as plug - in hybrids while competitors , including Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. , are working on versions of plug - in vehicles but have not yet released timing and specs .
LIke all changes in technology for the automobile , the plug - in ’s success will depend on cooperation from other industries , including the utility companies and battery manufacturers since they will need a supply source .
Austin Energy , a city - owned utility that serves the Texas capital , has decided to offer a $ 1,000 incentive to people who buy plug - in cars according to a Wall Street Journal article .
GM is hoping that other companies will follow suit and offer incentives , to help boost sales for the struggling car manufacturer .

previous post and in my lectures I define true cyber warfare as the use of network attacks to disable communication and other infrastructure preparatory to sending tanks across the border .
I used to joke that cyber warfare did not exist because there would have to be neighboring states engaged in war that were also networked and I did not see any tanks rolling across the Canadian border with the US .
Ha .
In a
So , the Estonian and Ukrainian attacks of last year , and the continuous Chinese attacks do not constitute cyber warfare .
However the threat presented by these attacks was grave enough to be classified as Cyber Defcon 4 .
But on Friday Russia did indeed send tanks across the border into neighboring South Ossetia in conjunction with cyber attacks that have disable much of Georgia ’s ability to present their side of what is going on .
The cyber attacks are attributed to the Russian Business Network ( RBN ) which has strong ties to the Russian Mafia , and thus the Russian government .
RBN is responsible for much of the world ’s cyber woes .
one blogger tracking the attacks against Georgia .
Thanks to the comments below for links to the RBNexploit blog .
My own traceroute confirms that the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs web site has DNS entries for a US hosting provider .
But the website , www.mfa.gov.ge , is still not responding .
Anyone with more info please contact me !
There is apparently only
published definition of DefCon 5 :
Here is my previously
Cyber DefCon
5 . Nation to nation attacks that are malicious with intent to destroy communication infrastructure and disable business processes including financial markets .
Since Friday , Georgia has been in Cyber DefCon 5 .
UPDATE : Georgia 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website is now hosted on Estonian assets .
I love Estonia .

Mega Man 9 may save video games .
Yeah , OK , so that 's a load of purple hyperbole coming from someone who has n't even played the game yet .
Like everyone else , all I have to go on is a handful of screenshots and the impressions of a complete stranger who may well be lying about its quality simply to toy with our feelings .
( The Internet 's cruel like that . )
But the significance of the next Mega Man game has nothing whatsoever to do with how well IntiCreates manages to pull off a classic - styled 8 - bit action game -- sure , it 'll be easier to make a case for MM9's importance if playing it does n't make you pine for the sweet embrace of death , but what really matters about MM9 is simply that it exists .
Someone on a forum somewhere remarked that you could practically gauge a given gamer 's age based simply on their reaction to the news that MM9 is being built , effectively , on NES technology , a marked step backward from the series ' last outing .
Mega Man 8 ? did n't exactly push any technological boundaries , mind you , but it did at least represent some of the most elaborate 2D gaming art that had been seen in 1997 .
Now , more than a decade later , it 's actually jumping backward two hardware generations , while the industry itself has advanced by equal increments .
Two steps forward , two steps back -- what hath Paula Abdul wrought ?
So yes , winnowing forum - goers age by their positive and negative responses to the game works on a certain superficial level , to be sure .
Gamers who grew up with the NES Mega Man games are generally pumped ; those who came to the franchise with the X series or later are baffled .
But anyone who looks more deeply into the decision to go old school should also find plenty to be excited about .
There 's more going on here than the obvious nostalgia - button - pressing on the surface ; behind this seeming madness is meaning .
Meaning and purpose .
It 's a simple purpose , too : Nothing more ambitious than the desire to make a good Mega Man game .
This is evidently much trickier than one might think , because a lot of Mega Man games have been released over the years , and quite a few of them have been , frankly , no damn good .
The vast majority have been merely meh .
But nearly everyone can agree that the best games in the series were the originals , the NES games that launched the Mega Man empire , such as it is .
Of course , some will argue otherwise -- every game in the series has its fans , even the crappy games .
Yes , someone out there is convinced that Rockman & Forte ? for WonderSwan is an overlooked work of genius .
Filter out the crazies and the statistical anomalies , though , and you 'll find tremendous affection for the classic NES games .
Which is n't to say that all the NES titles were masterpieces , which is where much of the collective ambivalence about MM9 comes from .
Let 's be honest :
The drop - off in quality after Mega Man 3 was steep and painful .
While the latter NES games had their moments , the simple fact is that by the time the 8 - bit titles were retired the series had long since become a rote exercise in pulling in some easy cash every autumn .
There 's certainly no guarantee that MM9 wo n't simply be another Mega Man 5 : A soulless , hacked - together mess of a game recycling old ideas and offering nothing new -- well , nothing new of any particular value , anyway .
( For some reason , spelling out " MEGA MAN V " through hidden bonus items never really caught on .
Funny , that . )
I mean , hey , even the basic premise of MM9 is similar to MM5 -- that devious Dr. Wily has gone and framed one of Mega Man 's close personal friends in sight of the world .
Gosh , can Mega Man save the day ?
I sure hope so !
But I do n't think MM9 will be another MM5 .
If Capcom were more concerned with taking the safe , easy route , IntiCreates would be churning out Mega Man ZX : Rapture or some such nonsense , another two - hero game , each playable character capable using the same basic Guardian / Biometal powers as in the past six IntiCreates games , along with the same recycled sprites for each .
That 's not where they 're going with this .
Instead , they 're taking an unconventional approach , eschewing the obvious direction of another easy cookie - cutter sequel for the world 's most popular system in favor of a deliberately regressive return to the good old days , with far more creativity in the handful of screens on display than we 've seen in the past five years of Mega Man combined .
It looks like goofy , nonsensical , cartoonish fun -- precisely what the original Mega Man lineup should be .
But maybe I 'm wrong .
Maybe the retro look is a cynical attempt to ride the Famicom nostalgia that seems to have a permanent grip on Japan , a low - budget attempt to latch onto the coattails of retro-styled games like Yuusha No Kuse Ni Namaikida , with the added benefit of authentic retro heritage .
And no doubt that 's some part of the inspiration behind MM9's look -- old people still love their old games .
But while series creator Keiji Inafune is a canny man , he 's also an honest one ; he freely admits that the old Mega Man games are his favorites , which is an executive 's tactful way of saying " those are the best , and the people who have followed in my footsteps mostly suck . "
I 've even asked a few avowed MM9 haters ( including a certain opinionated co-worker ) what their favorite Mega Man game is , and the answer is universal : Mega Man 2 .
This is n't a coincidence ; MM2 was a truly brilliant game , tough but wonderfully balanced despite its innate openness .
Every power - up in the game had a purpose , every boss required different strategies , every enemy was memorable .
Despite its modest technology , it was packed with personality ; despite its simplicity , it 's almost infinitely replayable .
MM9 is an attempt to bottle the lightning that made that classic so exquisitely perfect .
A fundamental rethinking of what makes a good game is at play here .
The classic Mega Man series worked because of the specific play mechanics made possible by their technology .
When the games went 16 - bit , something intangible yet essential was lost -- the pace slowed , the " improved " animations interfered with the playability , the oversized sprites felt cramped on the screen and overly loose in the heat of action .
The exceptional , precise feel that had defined Mega Man was compromised by the need to upgrade to Super NES standards .
The advanced tech perfectly complemented Mega Man X ?'s more measured and sophisticated action , but when Mega Man 7 ?
tried to follow in its footsteps the results were disastrous .
MM8 made things even worse by overcompensating , dumping ill - fitting gimmick stages into the mix .
The inescapable truth is that Mega Man , at least the incarnation represented by a plucky little Astro Boy knock - off fighting googly - eyed robo-critters , works best as an 8 - bit game .
Stripped of over - animation and the needless details of superior technology , MM9 can go back to being what Mega Man should be about :
Blowing up robots , taking their powers , and enjoying the hell out of it because it controls better than just about any other action series you can think of .
I 'm even almost kind of looking forward to the inevitable disappearing block gauntlets , maybe .
Besides , it 's not like Capcom is taking some bold , heretofore unimagined step forward ( or backward , as the case may be ) .
Mega Man 9 may be the most dramatic technological regression ever seen in a major game franchise , but it 's hardly the first .
Remember how the Internet crapped its collective britches last year when Square Enix revealed Dragon Quest IX , a follow - up to one of the best - looking PS2 games ever -- as a DS game running on hardware barely more impressive than the original PlayStation ?
Remember how Contra 4 was the first chapter of that series in more than a decade to feel like it belonged to Contra from start to finish , a feat it accomplished by ditching all the awful 3D and aiming directly at its 16 - bit predecessors ?
Remember how the only Sonic games worth a damn these days are the portable Sonic Rush ?
titles rather than the head - slappingly terrible 3D console games ?
Remember how the PS2 - based console Castlevanias feel like like an afterthought while the portable , PS1 - quality 2D platformers are clearly where the team 's most sincere efforts are being invested ?
Mega Man 9 is simply the ultimate realization of something a lot of developers have been playing at for quite a while .
Look , here 's the thing : Gaming is an artform .
Not Art - with - a - capital - A , mind you ; that 's an argument for another time .
I mean simply that gaming is a medium that lends itself to both creative personal expression and corporate - crafted emulations of creativity alike , just like books and music and movies and paintings .
And as with any artform , an essential component of successful expression is knowing which tools to use and when to use them .
Games have come a long way in four decades , and the palette of tools available to creators are vast .
For most of the medium 's existence , though , mainstream designers have only chosen to go with the most sophisticated tools , always pushing the limits ... or at least riding in the slipstream of giants , as budgets dictate .
Progress is all well and good , but the simple fact is that certain kinds of games work best if they hold well back from the cutting edge .
The PlayStation era brought with it some genuinely excellent innovations and some welcome reinventions of classic franchises .
But the attrition rate for long - running series was downright heartbreaking ; sure , no one was sad to see Bubsy die , but Contra deserved better .
But what about the nebulous in - between games like Mega Man Legends ? and Chrono Cross ? -- brilliant creations in their own right , but pretty lousy as sequels to fan favorites ?
With the announcement of Mega Man 9 and a Chrono Trigger ?
remake within a week of one another , the answer seems to be : Let 's go back to the drawing board .
Let 's do what 's best for gamers , regardless of the technology involved .
Let 's make the best games possible .
To invoke the A - word again , look at the evolution of art through the millennia ; we started with crude clay figurines that vaguely resembled a fat chick , eventually figured out two - point perspective and how to represent light and dimensionality , and eventually got to Chuck Close .
Once painting reached photorealism , what was left ?
Style . Expression .
Personality .
Fanboys can bang on about Hideo Kojima , but MM9 has the potential to be true postmodernism , in the artistic sense .
It could well be the work of a creator who has taken a look at what the modern medium has to offer , then deliberately reached back into history to find his solution , combining the mechanisms of the past with the sophisticated thinking made possible by decades of advances .
Mega Man 9 is cause to believe that everything that 's gone wrong with these old franchises can be made right again .
As the recent spate of retro-tinged sequels like Dawn of Sorrow ? and the upcoming Wario Land Shake
It ( a true sequel to Wario Land IV ? , with the added benefit of high - resolution Production IG visuals and some thoughtful motion controls ) demonstrate , there 's still plenty of life left in those hoary old franchises -- plenty of new ideas to be eked from genre tropes that we all assumed were tapped out when the 16 - bit era slouched to a halt .
But bleeding - edge visuals and game elements may not be the best way to realize those inspirations .
Really , what can you do to improve Mega Man with bloom lighting and shader mapping ?
Is 2D Mario platforming really any better with real - time light sourcing and self - shadowing ?
Classic franchises earned their stripes in the days when great graphics were still pretty laughably simple ; they became classics because they offered satisfying gameplay beneath whatever passed for visual polish in 1988 .
So why not let those games live in their proper environment ?
Just as Halo is demonstrably silly as a 2D platformer , Mega Man ( at least , the old - school variety of Mega Man ) sucks in 3D .
Gamers have known it for years ; the fact that developers are realizing it ( and , more importantly , that publishers are letting them act on it ) suggests that there 's hope for this medium yet .
Gaming 's long - term saving grace may be that the point at which top - of - the - line games became too pricey for all but the best - funded studios to create is the same point at which alternate distribution technologies emerged .
Mega Man 9 has taken a decade to become a reality because there was no place for it until now .
We 're fifteen years past the point at which MM9 as it exists today could have been a full retail release .
But an affordable downloadable title ?
Well , that 's something else .
And herein lies the true strength of the current generation of consoles :
Not that they offer the power to render ultra-realistic cubes of glistening , gelatinous meat , but rather that they provide an avenue by which to offer the full spectrum of game experiences .
Not that this is any real secret ; the whole idea behind WiiWare and XBLA and PSN was that it would offer an alternative venue for developers to release less - than - top - of - the - line software .
The exciting thing , though , is that major publishers are finally starting to get it .
Square Enix can release an oddball simulation game gussied up to look like an action RPG , but does it really count when they cheat and use assets from a big - budget game from a system nearly as powerful as Wii ?
MM9 , on the other hand , is something completely different .
It 's a recognition that certain game concepts are still viable , that those concepts work best within a specific context , and that it 's still possible to make use of the appropriate framework .
There 's certainly no guarantee that gamers will embrace MM9's regressive design , of course .
Maybe it'll flop hard !
The important thing is that Capcom 's taking the chance , and in doing so sending out a clear statement to the gamers and designers alike :
The best available technology is n't always the right technology .

Imagine if suddenly you could walk into your local Walgreens , plunk down a couple of twenties , and walk out with a gram of pink Peruvian flake .
That , or something very much like it , happened last year when two brands of absinthe , the French Lucid and the Swiss Kübler , were approved for sale in the U. S.
Were talking real , honest - to - Satan absinthe , not some lame - ass substitute .
Now , the great green elixir of darkness -- basically high - proof neutral spirits flavored with wormwood , anise , and pungent herbs -- has been illegal in the U. S. since 1912 , and that hasnt changed .
So what gives ?
Its a matter of chemistry .
The government never banned absinthe itself but rather thujone , the wormwood - derived compound that supposedly gives the stuff its mind - bending edge .
However , modern chemical analysis shows that thujone survives distilling in quantities so small they are actually legal .
This is something of a double - edged sword :
That same analysis also shows that the old brands that spawned absinthes dark legend didnt have all that much thujone , either -- all along it was just really strong , herb - flavored booze .
Plus , half the excitement of absinthe was the fact that it was contraband .
Now anyone can get it .
Well , okay .
Glamour is a big part of why we drink what we drink .
But so is taste , and a good absinthe has that in spades -- provided you handle it right .
Its designed , you see , as a sort of cocktail concentrate : hence the strong herbal notes and the high proof ( traditionally , between 120 and 140 ) .
So you dont want to drink this stuff in shots .
But mixed with a lot of cold water and a little sugar , it makes for a refreshing drink with a complex , herbal fragrance ( think mountain meadow ) .
One or two and theres no way youll cut your ear off .
But these things go down easy , and if you overdo it , all bets are off .
The Five Best Absinthes
1. Versinthe ( $ 55 )
The only one of these in which the anise dominates , and at 90 , the lowest in proof , this is nevertheless a good training - wheels absinthe .
2. Mansinthe ( $ 65 ) Marilyn Manson not only has impeccable taste in women , hes a fine judge of absinthe , too -- as this , made in Switzerland to his taste , demonstrates .
3. St. George Absinthe Verte ( $ 75 ) A nontraditional blend of herbs makes this , the only domestic absinthe on our list , something of an acquired taste .
Worth checking out , anyway .
4 . Top pick : Vieux Pontarlier ( $ 65 ) An absolutely classic French absinthe .
As good as it gets .
5. Pernod Absinthe , shown at top ( $ 65 ) Pernod was the leading brand of absinthe before the ban .
Now its back , and its clean , balanced , and tasty .

FIGHTER jets , infantry troops , destroyers and submarines will converge on Wales next month for one of the largest military exercises of all time .
The two - week exercise – codenamed Joint Warrior – is designed to recreate a scenario in which Britain and other sovereign nations go to war against a “ state - sponsored terrorist movement ” – using a vast array of lethal modern weapons .
Taking place between October 6 and October 16 , it will provide coordinated training for all three UK Armed Services , plus forces from EIGHT allied nations .
The whole of Wales has been designated as a flying area for the exercise , while so - called “ managed danger area ” ranges at Castlemartin and Manorbier in Pembrokeshire and Pembrey near Llanelli will be used for ground strafing , bombing and missile practice using live ammunition .
An area of the West Wales coast has also been earmarked as a maritime “ warfighting ” area for Joint Warrior .
The exercise is aimed at giving pilots , ships ’ crews and ground troops vital training before they deploy to war zones like Iraq or Afghanistan .
According to the RAF , Joint Warrior will be particularly useful for Forward Air Controllers ( troops directing airborne missile strikes ) , the role made famous by Prince Harry who became known by his call sign Widow Six Seven while directing fire against the Taliban .
Six companies of infantry , 29 surface and four sub - surface maritime units and 60 aircraft – flying at a rate of about 80 to 100 sorties a day – will be involved in the exercise .
An MoD spokesman said : “ The two weeks will develop through a period of tension into simulated warfighting / open hostilities . ”
The exercise aims to provide opportunities for all warfighting disciplines including :
n Close Air Support ( CAS ) – executed by fast jet aircraft and Forward Air Controllers , often using live weapons ;
nConvoy Support , Time Sensitive Targeting ( TST ) and urban close air support scenarios – “ in order to replicate current Middle - East operational missions ” ;
n Large Force Element ( LFE ) missions – which will target fixed and mobile targets including inflatable Scud Decoys and Electronic Warfare ( EW ) emitters simulating surface - to - air threats ;
nAnti-Submarine Warfare ( ASW ) , Anti-Surface Warfare ( AsuW ) and also , Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ( ISR ) missions – all carried out by Maritime Patrol Aircraft ;
n Joint fires – involving live weapons on ranges in Welsh Wales ;
n Submarine training – boats will complete sub-vs - sub and sub-vs - ship exercises .
The MoD spokesman said : “ The exercise will accommodate a squadron of Tornado GR4s from 12 Sqn , RAF Lossiemouth and a squadron of Gripen aircraft from 171 Sqn , Swedish Air Force plus asso-ciated support personnel drawn from support units throughout the RAF .
“ This is a particularly important exercise for the Tornado GR4 deployment as this will also act as a full mission rehearsal for their forthcoming deployment to Afghanistan . ”
But Squadron Leader Peter Sinclair of the RAF in Wales moved to allay fears about the impact on people – and the environment .
He said : “ Some of the exercise areas overlap environmentally - sensitive conservation zones , which contain a wide variety of marine wildlife , sea bird breeding grounds and protected fauna and flora .
“ Furthermore , the farming , fishing and tourist industries are important economic activities , which benefit from the natural beauty and relative isolation of some of the exercise areas .
Against this background , the MoD recognises the impact of military activity and takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously .
“ During the planning of the exercise , Environmental Impact Assessments are conducted for all potentially damaging activities , such as the use of active sonar and live weapons .
Furthermore , close working relationships with landowners and key national stakeholders , combined with engagement with local communities , ensure that appropriate environmental mitigation procedures are put in place and then adhered to .
“ It should be noted that the MoD has decreed that environmental considerations are always to take priority over the achievement of training objectives .
This direction remains a primary consideration throughout exercise planning and execution . ”
The director of the exercise , Capt Paddy McAlpine OBE said : “ Joint Warrior will offer high - quality joint tactical training with maximum tactical interaction , tailored to meet the participants ’ requirements across the whole of the UK whilst creating as little impact on the environment as possible .
“ I am sure that the high - fidelity joint tactical training environment provided by JTEPS within Joint Warrior will ensure that UK and allied participants are rigorously prepared for operational tasks in theatres world - wide . ”
It was pretty comical watching Sean Hannity attack his own team player Dick Morris becuase Dick would n't follow Hannity 's talking points after the debate .
Even Morris gets honest once in a while .
Download wmv
Dick your initial thought ?
I thought Obama won the first , I thought McCain won the second .
And overall since we had n't had a terrorist attack last week , but had the economy failing apart .
The economy is more important that I have to say unfortunately I think Obama won this debate .
Is Morris hoping for a terrorist attack < snark >
I disagree , I do n't know what debate you were watching Dick and I 'm going to be honest here because what was so amazing to me was everything that Sen Obama was saying , it almost seemed like it was book knowledge and that be it about the economy , be it about ... it was somebody regurgitating lines and you 've been in presidential campaigns before Dick , they were fed to him and memorized by him , but where was the real life experiences ...
Sean , I 'm voting for McCain .
I agree with that , but Obama showed himself to be more concerned with You did n't answer my question .
Well I told you , I 'm voting for McCain , but what I 'm saying what happened in the debate , not in reality is that Obama came across as really knowing and caring about the problems of the average person .
I also thought McCain blew it by not focusing on why he suspended his campaign , why he was n't going to go to the debate
Hannity suddenly thinks memorizing lines is a bad thing ?
What will he say about Sarah Palin ?
Oh , never mind .
Once Sean says he was getting honest it kind of ruined it for me .
Morris prefaces his remarks by saying that he 's voting for McCain over and over again , but then gives the debate to Obama .
Hannity did n't like that all too much and tried to force Morris to agree with his idiotic point that Obama sure has a lot of " book knowledge . "
Like I said yesterday , if you missed the market moves of the last few days or last few months , NOW is not the time to play catch up .
You know that the market is the main topic of conversation when Bill Maher takes time off from ripping the Bush Administration on Iraq to discuss the financial markets .
A financial nuclear bomb has been detonated on Wall Street and a whole generation of investors will now have to deal with ‘ NEW RULES ’ being implemented .
What was the financial shenanigans of a few thousand banking executives ( uncovered by the shortsellers now hated by our leaders ) is now an illegal discipline for the forseeable future .
I will have to adapt just like everyone else , but my initial feeling is ‘ FUCK IT ’ , the market just put me out of business for a while .
Our leaders have spent the last few months printing money , and catering to the thieves in the financial industry , while punishing the group of investors whose job it is to shed early light on areas of financial crimes .
It ’s sickening , but I am not getting into that conversation or mess .
It ’s good for traffic , but bad for my bottom line and YOURS .
The best strategy to come out of this mess will be Global Macro Funds , funds with deep pools making concentrated bets in sectors and countries .
They will be funds focused on a longer term horizon with bigger pools of capital .
They embrace the volatility because of their connections , patience and deep knowledge of their sectors .
The displaced talent from the industry will gravitate to these funds first .
It is their best opportunity to be paid for their experience .
I am digging through some of the worst performing funds of the last few years in the Global Macro sector and with the help of some of my friends in the industry plan to find a few and make some investments .
At the other end will be the nimble , the creative and the opportunistic .
Those willing to change the industry through hard work and the profiting from niche markets afforded to them in the new financial landscape .
This is where I will focus my energies and am already writing a few business plans .
I now my strengths and weaknesses .
I am not a ‘ Shark ’ , but a ‘ Pilot Fish ’ and very in tune with the limits , and opportunities that affords me .
Thousands of great traders were thrown out into the wild the last few months .
They are disoriented , pissed , nervous , but for the most part , they will end up on their feet and contribute back into the financial system in new ways – small hedge funds , start - up economy and other leadership roles .
Some will write books and some will leave the financial world for good .
The financial media world on the other hand will continue to talk about ‘ BOTTOMS ’ – Was this one ?
If not when ?
I am licking my chops because this bottom talk and regulation talk and babble will go on for 6 - 12 months .
It ’s noise and it will drag you in if not careful .
In the meantime , I will be working towards one end of what I know is going to be a hugely profitable niche and start cranking .
If you do n’t believe me , read my pal Rogers blog as he is back cranking out posts on the same subject , except he has 10 times the experience as me .
Lucky you .
Here are TWO beauties on the subject .
Have a great weekend and let ’s get to work and turn Lehman ’s into LehmanADE ! ( I heard that beauty on StockTwits )
The acronym FDIC stands for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
It is better understood as the Federal Deception Illusion Corporation .
Its goal since its founding in 1934 has been to create public deception regarding the looming insolvency of individual banks .
In the name of protecting depositors , it protects bankers .
It has done its job very well .
But now it is in trouble .
Therefore , so are bankers .
There is serious speculation in the mainstream press that the FDIC will run out of funds to repay depositors in failed banks .
It may have to borrow money from the U.S. Treasury to keep from going under .
This has happened before .
In the 1990 — 91 recession , the FDIC had to borrow from the Treasury in order to maintain its program .
It borrowed about $ 15 billion .
The FDIC repaid the Treasury the next year .
By law , the FDIC has the right to borrow up to $ 30 billion from the Treasury .
The FDIC has posted this law on its site .
The FDIC has about $ 45 billion in reserve now .
This reserve is held in the form of Treasury debt certificates .
It had $ 50 billion prior to the bankruptcy of IndyMac in July .
It expects to lose $ 8.9 on IndyMac .
Its original estimate was $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion .
Eight other banks have gone under this year .
IndyMac was the largest .
It is worth noting that IndyMac was not on the FDIC ’s list of troubled banks .
A Reuters story reports on the assessment of the FDIC ’s chairman , Dr. Sheila Bair .
“ I would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into ( short - term ) lines of credit with the Treasury for working capital , not to cover our losses . ”
Another factor in the FDIC ’s looming problems is this : the number of banks on its problem bank list has increased by 30 % to 117 in just one quarter .
We should keep this in perspective .
In the Savings & Loan crisis of the 1980 ’s , about 1,500 banks were on the list .
Today , there are about 8,500 banks insured by the FDIC .
So , things are not in panic mode yet .
Regulators are hoping that the worst is behind us .
The problem is , things keep getting worse .
The residential real estate market continues downward with no end in sight .
Commercial real estate is now beginning to follow .
Local banks are more deeply invested in commercial real estate than residential .
The FDIC does not publish the list of problem banks .
Why not ?
Because the FDIC does not want to create bank runs .
A brief mention of IndyMac ’s problem by Senator Schumer of New York triggered the run that busted the bank .
BANK RUNS TODAY
The bank run today is not the bank run of the Great Depression .
In the Great Depression , people withdrew currency from suspected banks .
They hoarded some of this money .
This caused a reversal of the fractional reserve process .
It caused deflation .
But , ultimately , people spend currency .
Times were tough in the Great Depression .
People had no reserves other than currency .
So , they spent it .
When a store takes in currency , it deposits it is a local bank at the end of the day .
The possibility of this kind of currency - based bank run is minimal today .
We live in a world of digital money .
Most payments are made by credit card or check .
People in advanced economies do not use currency very often .
They pay with digits .
What busted IndyMac was demand by its depositors to transfer their funds to another bank .
They came down to get cashier ’s checks .
This was all it took .
The bank could no longer make loans .
It had to call in loans .
It could not call in mortgage loans .
It was borrowed short and lent long .
This was a replay of the S&L crisis two decades ago .
The FDIC insures individual banks .
If one goes under , the FDIC must cover the losses to depositors of $ 100,000 or less .
If the FDIC ever fails to do this , other banks will experience runs .
Everyone at the end of the line in front of a busted bank will experience 100 % losses .
This will lead to more runs .
Fear will spread .
So what ?
A few hundred American banks out of 8,500 go under .
Other than depositors , who cares ?
Under today ’s circumstances , the money supply will not shrink .
The money supply is based on how much debt the Federal Reserve System has in its reserves : the monetary base .
The fact that depositor A in busted Bank A has lost his money does not shrink the money supply .
Another depositor , who was paid by borrower B ( e.g. , a mortgage borrower ) at Bank A , still has his deposit in Bank B .
The banking system does not lose money .
But doubts spread about the economy .
People start moving their portfolios toward near - cash assets .
They start selling stocks so that they can buy Treasury bills or T - bonds .
This has been going on all year .
The 90 - day T - bill rate is under 2 % .
It fell before the Federal Reserve announced its reduction in the federal funds overnight market .
The FED has trailed T - bill rate all year .
The FED gets credit for lowering rates , but this has been an illusion in 2008 .
The FED has been playing catch - up with the T - bill rate .
It announces what T - bills have already achieved : lower rates .
Doubts about individual banks create widespread doubts about the current economy ’s ability to continue the boom .
This is the problem facing policy - makers in Washington .
Doubts about the economy will lead to increased saving .
Is this bad ?
Not for an Austrian School economist .
For all other economists , it is terrible .
THE KEYNESIAN DECEPTION
In Keynesian economics , increased saving is bad because it supposedly cuts consumer spending .
It does not cut consumer spending , so this analysis is nonsense .
But this nonsense is the heart , mind , and soul of Keynesianism .
Increased thrift cuts consumer spending marginally — very marginally — on retail consumer goods that have been favored by non-savers , but it does not cut consumer spending as a whole , or “ in the aggregate , ” as Keynesians love to discuss .
When you save money , you still spend it .
You spend it by depositing it in a bank , or buying a money - market fund , or investing in a mutual fund .
But you do not go to the bank , pull out currency , and hoard it .
Even if you do , not many people do .
Saving changes the fortunes of companies that have produced goods and services for consumers who were not savers .
The companies lose sales .
But other companies that serve those consumers who work in the thrift industry do well .
Saved money does not go to heaven .
The money supply stays the same unless the central bank inflates .
It is merely reallocated .
Some producers lose .
Other producers gain .
So what ?
This is free market competition .
Losers are allowed to fail .
Keynesian economists see this process of failure as a disaster .
They hate the free market because the free market lets people decide what to do with their money .
They want State bureaucrats to direct the economy at the margin .
When consumer fears about the economy lead them to switch their spending patterns , this affects profit and loss in those firms that lose favor with consumers .
But it simultaneously increases cash flow for sectors that are now favored .
Keynesians are always looking at those sectors that are taking a hit from newly fearful consumers .
They do n’t look at the increasing revenues in those markets that are geared to thrift .
The anti-thrift bias of Keynesians leads them to call for more government spending .
But where does the government get money to spend ?
There are only three sources : ( 1 ) taxes ; ( 2 ) borrowing from the non-banking public ; ( 3 ) borrowing from the Federal Reserve ( counterfeiting ) .
Every non-counterfeit dollar that the government spends has been extracted from the private sector .
There are no free lunches .
The only tooth fairy is the central bank .
It exchanges counterfeit money for IOUs .
Keynesians trust government , especially the national government .
They think that money spent by the national government will be more productive than money spent by savers and investors who invest in capital formation .
This is why Keynesians refer to government spending as “ investing . ”
In college textbooks on economics , government spending to overcome recessions is never discussed as spending that is necessarily offset by a reduction of spending by taxpayers and T - bill investors .
This offsetting phenomenon is never in non-Keynesian textbooks , either .
Why not ?
Because textbooks are written for departmental committees .
The publishers know that if a textbook mentions this offset process — that which should be obvious — the Keynesians in the department will veto the adoption of the textbook .
This has been going on for six decades .
The textbooks describe the anti-recession policy of the government as injecting new purchasing power into the economy , but without ever mentioning the process of either pulling purchasing power away from taxpayers and buyers of government debt or the counterfeiting operation of the central bank .
There are two deceptions in every college - level economics textbook : ( 1 ) the deception of “ money from heaven ” ( taxes and government debt ) ; ( 2 ) the deception of counterfeit money from the central bank and fractional reserve banking .
Break ranks on these two deceptions , and your textbook will not be assigned .
Your manuscript will be rejected by every mainstream textbook publisher .
Self - interested professors catch on fast .
SELF -DECEPTION IN HIGH PLACES
The FDIC has been around since 1934 .
Its number - one task is to keep depositors from finding out which banks are at risk .
When it is successful , the threat of withdrawals keeps poorly run banks safe .
There are periods , such as today , when the deception begins to be called into question by the capital markets .
The share prices of poorly run banks begin to fall .
The FDIC ’s job is to conceal what is happening .
It refuses to reveal the names of suspect banks .
The other banks go along with this , because they do not want to be hit by waves of doubt .
Customers may buy T - bills rather than bank CD’s .
Bankers are never sure which bank will be hit by runs and which will benefit .
For the sake of continuity , they support the FDIC .
They do n’t want to rock the boat .
Reality is now intruding .
Bank profits are falling rapidly , according to an August 26 report on Bloomberg .
“ FDIC - insured lenders reported net income of $ 4.96 billion , down 87 percent from $ 36.8 billion in the same quarter a year ago . ”
Second - quarter earnings fell from $ 19.3 billion in the previous quarter , driven by higher provisions for loan losses , the FDIC said .
It was the second - lowest net income reported since the fourth quarter of 1991 .
. . .
“ The results were pretty dismal , and we do n’t see a return to the high earnings levels of previous years any time soon , ” Bair said .
Funds set aside by banks to cover loan losses more than quadrupled to $ 50.2 billion from $ 11.4 billion in the year - earlier quarter .
Banks on the problem list have assets of $ 80 billion .
In the first quarter , this was $ 26 billion .
The total value of the deposits at risk keeps rising .
How did this happen ?
Why did n’t the FDIC sound an alarm ?
Because the FDIC was itself deceived .
In an August 27 story in The New York Times , we learn that in 2006 , after the housing bubble had peaked , the FDIC bought a data base from the private sector that monitored the banking industry ’s loan performance .
Lo and behold , the industry had lent hundreds of billions of dollars to mortgage borrowers who were bound to default .
The “ Times ” quotes Dr. Bair .
“ By the fall and winter 2006 , we were looking at this market pretty hard , ” she said .
There were very low down payments , loans that never verified the borrower ’s income , poor disclosure and huge payment shocks .
“ It was pretty eye - popping , some of the stuff we were seeing .
We could n’t believe it . ”
This is sometimes referred to as the shock of recognition .
The FDIC should have been monitoring this after 2000 .
But it did not have a data base to do this .
The Times says that she began warning Treasury , but Treasury Secretary Henry ( Goldman Sachs ) Paulson resisted .
He said the subprime mortgage problem had been contained .
The deceivers have all been caught flat - footed .
“ WE’VE ONLY JUST BEGUN ”
That was a great song by the Carpenters .
It was originally a bank commercial theme for Crocker National Bank in California , long since merged into oblivion .
Today , the phrase still applies well to the banking industry across the boards .
The mortgage crisis is nowhere near over .
The recession is nowhere near over .
Commercial real estate has barely begun to decline .
Local banks are heavily invested here .
An August 22 story in The New York Times reported that this may be the next stage in the downturn of the economy .
The mainstream media are just beginning to catch on .
The Comptroller of the Currency , John Dugan , sounded the alarm in April .
He delivered a speech in which he said this :
Right now , too many community bankers are having too hard a time coming to grips with the problems that have emerged in their commercial real estate portfolios .
These bankers are reluctant to charge off obviously troubled loans or even to flag problems to their examiners .
While this resistance to recognizing problems at the beginning of an economic downturn may be human nature , it ’s not healthy , because denial is not a strategy .
It wo n’t serve anyone ’s interest in the long run .
In fact , it only assures that problems get worse and harder to resolve .
He said that denial is not a strategy .
Of course it is a strategy .
It has governed the FDIC ever since 1934 .
It is basic to all government agencies .
But , in the private sector , it gets exposed by falling stock prices for deceivers .
It takes time , because investors want to believe good news , but eventually reality intrudes .
CONCLUSION
The FDIC will keep its doors open .
The banking industry wants it .
Congress wants it .
Depositors want it .
Owners of shaky banks want it .
If you have more than $ 100,000 in an account , divide it up among several banks .
You can get an account that does this here .

Home experiment time !
Go run some hot water , either in a sink or tub , and stick your hand under it .
Some of you might be mad at me — the water was hot and you have no idea why I asked you to scald yourself .
( We 'll work through this . )
Some of you , though , are going to be a little confused .
You know the water was hot , but when you put your hand under it , it felt ice cold .
All together now , in your best Jerry Seinfeld voice : " What 's the deal with that ? " 
Feeling Spots
Our hands have a mess of sensory receptors that all receive different sensations .
These receptors send signals to the brain to help us make sense of what we 're touching .
We 've got some receptors that receive sensations of cold ( cold spots ) and others that receive warmth ( warm spots ) .
Neither of these temperature receptors pull double - duty .
If you touch a cold spot with something hot , it 's still going to do what it 's supposed to do : send a cold signal .
If you touch a warm spot with something cold , it 's still going to tell the brain that you 're touching something warm .
Mixed Signals
Neurologists call instances when these spots send the " wrong "  signal in response to a stimulus paradoxical cold and paradoxical warmth .
If you want to try another experiment ( and you still trust me after the hot water thing ) , grab a pen and lightly poke the point around between your knuckles .
In some spots it will feel cold , in some it will feel warm .
Of course , when you run your hand under hot water , the water touches both warm and cold spots .
In cases like this , where the stimulus is strong enough , the receptors get confused and sometimes the wrong signal gets sent to the brain , even though both temperature receptors are being stimulated .
Sometimes it only takes a second for things to correct themselves ; sometimes it takes a few minutes .
How did the hot water experiment turn out for you ?

BBC News , New York
American air passengers are being told to brace themselves for a summer of delays , lost bags , cancelled flights , and rising travel costs as a sense of crisis takes hold in the US airline industry .
Several airlines have been forced to carry out safety checks
There is a stunning optical effect it is worth trying to catch when flying into New York .
It is on the approach to La Guardia airport and you should be on the left side of the plane , preferably right up against the window .
It must be dark outside .
The plane will swing round over Staten Island and the Statue of Liberty , way down below , will raise her torch up to you .
You will straighten up to glide along the eastern side of Manhattan .
And one by one , as the plane makes its final approach , the streets of New York 's grid pattern - perpendicular to the plane - flicker into view .
One street is white with car headlights , the next red with brake lights .
White into red .
White into red .
There is the occasional mixture of both on the two - way routes .
The streets fade in and out as if on a dimmer switch .
They get busier , the lights gradually brighter , as each one passes .
And then a brilliant white light hits your eyes and you pass Times Square .
It is quite a meditative moment , which is just as well since most of the times I have flown into La Guardia , or any of New York 's three airports for that matter , it has marked the end of a stressful journey .
Quality review Flying into the States is not exactly a calming experience .
Yes , yes , what about Heathrow ?
Well , you have a point .
But I have never been so consistently unsure as to whether or not I would actually make it on time as I have been flying around the States .
The number of complaints went up 60 % last year
I thought I was just unlucky until the annual Airline Quality Review came out a few weeks back .
More than a quarter of flights are late and the number of bags lost , damaged , or stolen is rising .
There is overbooking and lots of passengers are simply being bumped off .
The number of complaints went up 60 % last year .
String of excuses Chicago seems like a good place to start the anecdotes .
At the start of this year 's presidential primary campaign I spent 11 hours waiting for a connecting flight to Des Moines out of Chicago O'Hare airport .
In April 2008 American Airlines cancelled thousands of flights
First we were told we were waiting for an aircraft .
Then we were told we were waiting for a crew .
Then for another crew as the first one , by then , was over shift .
After a day of " we expect the crew to arrive momentarily " , I finally asked for a straight answer .
The woman at the gate looked at me sympathetically .
" It 's not going , " she said .
" No crew ? " I asked .
" Bad weather , " she replied .
" If it was no crew you would have to compensate me , would n't you ? "
" Yes , " she said .
" Next , please . "
Strange acceptance
There are a few rules you should follow when flying domestic in the States ...
Do not travel to or through Chicago
Factor in lots of time for delays
Know your airport restaurants - you will be spending a lot of time in them Oh , and pack a lunch for the flight .
Even when flying coast to coast often all you get is a snack bag of pretzels and a soft drink , or $ 5 ( £ 2.55 ) a beer .
Ok , I suppose I am moaning a little , but it really is that bad .
And along with the delays the cost of travel is rising as aviation fuel gets more expensive .
The airlines are struggling as business travellers scale back thanks to the bumpy economic conditions .
Then there is the safety issue .
Whistleblowers recently accused the Federal Aviation Authority of turning a blind eye to safety violations .
That led a number of airlines to temporarily ground so many planes that the country 's airports were in chaos .
Americans though seem to take it all in their stride .
On one flight I remember a huge delay .
When we finally got on the ageing 737 , the pilot welcomed us on board .
The power promptly failed , the lights went out , and we were all told to pick up our bags and get off .
No - one really seemed to complain , but I huffed and puffed .
The man next to me just sat there calmly .
" Ca n't do anything about it .
It 's just what happens , " he said .
Like much of America these days , the airline industry feels tired , worn down , and old .
That is surprising in a country that often likes to think of itself as the best .
Arguably , it once was , but the airline industry - like the health system , like schools , roads - you name it , feels like it is just creaking along and leaving its passengers ever more frustrated .
I had hoped my problems might end as we left behind the unpredictable winter weather .
Then came another report predicting a bad summer .
As one congressman put it , if anyone thinks flight delays are going to be sorted out " they are smoking the funny weed " .

Recently Daniel Phillips announced that he is developing a new file system , Tux3 .
It plans to be a modern file system on level with ZFS and the currently also still in development Btrfs .
While there are many file systems like ext3 , Xfs , Jfs and others are available for Linux it currently lacks a modern , new age file system : especially features like versions and writable snapshots are hardly available .
On the other hand , other Unixes do have such file systems : OpenSolaris and some BSDs have ZFS , and DragonFly BSD has HAMMER .
To fill this gap the Oracle ’s Chris Manson started the development of Btrfs a year ago .
Now Daniel Phillips also announced that he is developing a new file system , Tux3 .
The general aims are indeed close to the general aims of the other mentioned file systems .
Also , Daniel is not new to file system development .
Years ago he announced Tux2 as an improvement to ext2 but without journaling .
However , that file system never started off due to patent reasons .
The question is of course which file system will make the run : Tux3 is still at the beginning , while Btrfs could see a first beta in the next months .
But there are still rumors that ZFS might be released under the GPL , and Hammer could also be implemented for Linux .
Either way , exciting times for file systems on Linux are ahead
SHANGHAI 
The devastation from an earthquake that struck southwestern China on Saturday is much worse than initially feared , state - run news media reported on Sunday , saying that the quake had damaged 258,000 homes and killed at least 32 people .
The earthquake , which was centered in Sichuan Province and had a magnitude of 6.1 , damaged highways , reservoirs , bridges and hundreds of schools , and it forced the evacuation of more than 40,000 people in Sichuan and neighboring Yunnan Province , reported Xinhua , the state news agency .
More than 230 people were reported injured .
Sichuan was devastated on May 12 by China ’s worst natural disaster in over 30 years , a 7.9 - magnitude earthquake that killed nearly 70,000 people and left millions homeless , so thoroughly damaging the region that recovery efforts were expected to take years , if not decades .
Since the quake hit at 4:30 p.m. Saturday , the region has suffered hundreds of aftershocks .
The strongest was Sunday afternoon , when one with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 , was reported in Sichuan , but it was unclear whether there was any new damage , Chinese officials said .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Arsenic , a naturally occurring poison and carcinogen found in ground water , is strongly linked to adult - onset diabetes , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .

Arsenic , a naturally occurring poison and carcinogen found in ground water , is strongly linked to adult - onset diabetes , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / File
Odorless , tasteless , colorless and easily soluble in water or wine , arsenic has long been a feared poison .
A heavy dose is detectable in a corpse , but researchers say small amounts of arsenic may sicken people gradually .
Dr. Ana Navas - Acien and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore found a “ relatively strong ” association between commonly found levels of arsenic in urine and type 2 diabetes in a study of American adults .
“ It seems there is may be no safe level of arsenic , ” Navas - Acien said in a telephone interview .
“ Worldwide it ’s a huge problem , ” she said .
“ As water becomes a scarce resource , we need additional sources . ”
Arsenic raises the risk for cancers of the bladder , lung , kidney , skin and , possibly , the prostate , Navas - Acien said .
The 20 percent of nearly 800 study participants who had the most arsenic in their bodies , a tolerable 16.5 micrograms per liter of urine , had 3.6 times the risk of developing late - onset diabetes than those in the bottom 20 percent , who had 3 micrograms per liter .
Levels of arsenic were 26 percent higher in people with late - onset , or type 2 , diabetes than those without the disease , the study found .
The U.S. government sets a limit for drinking water at 10 micrograms of arsenic per liter , which is exceeded in the water consumed by 13 million Americans who mostly live in rural areas that rely on wells to bring up ground water , the researchers wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Arsenic contaminates drinking water for millions of people in Bangladesh , parts of Central Europe , Chile , Argentina and the western United States , where ground water is the source of drinking water and the land has higher concentrations of arsenic .
The U.S. Geological Survey has published maps on its Web site showing levels of arsenic contamination of ground water across the United States .
Overall , 7.8 percent of Americans are believed to have diabetes , although some do not know it .
At least 90 percent of cases are the type 2 variety , in which the body loses its ability to use insulin properly .
Navas - Acien said arsenic may play a significant role in diabetes incidence , but it is difficult to say how much .
Arsenic can accumulate in the body , and can ruin the body ’s ability to use insulin and perform the vital task of converting blood sugar into energy .
Normally , insulin fits into cells via molecular doorways called receptors , which in turn signal the cell to move glucose inside , but arsenic enters the cell and somehow blocks the activity .
Seafood is another source of arsenic , but the organic form found in shellfish and some fish has a carbon molecule attached and poses no risk to health , she said .
It is difficult to discern the difference between the harmful and benign forms of arsenic , though recent laboratory tests allow researchers to detect trace amounts that may pose risks to health , Navas - Acien said .
I cannot see why women who ignore the wisdom of the ages , and make themselves more likely to be victims by drinking too much , should get the same size cheque as women who are raped despite acting responsibly .
Of course she is culpable , just as she would be culpable if she crashed a car and injured someone while drunk , or stepped out into the traffic while drunk and was run over .
Getting drunk is not something that happens to you .
It is something you do .
[ B]eing drunk – which makes you miss danger signals , make bad judgments , lose consciousness in unsafe places and then lose your memory , too – [ is not ] comparable with ' dressing provocatively ' as the feminist thought police would like to pretend .
If women want to dress provocatively , then they should be free to do so , and I say thanks a lot to those who do .
Our society is based on self - restraint .
We can be provoked and still behave ourselves .
We do not need to compel women to dress like bats , as many Muslim countries do , so as to curb the unchained passions of hot - blooded menfolk .
Hitchens goes on to say that rape is " the inevitable result of the collapse of sexual morality , " which is just classic .
Evidently , he 's unaware that rape pre-dates the Pill , or whatever equivalent boogeyman he'd cite as the linchpin of moral decline .
Not only does rape pre-date the Pill , the sexual revolution , miniskirts , Madonna , and " hysterical ultra- feminist propaganda " ( as Hitchens loves to refer to the idea that rapists are solely responsible for rape ) , it also pre-dates marriage — and whatever other accoutrements of Hitchens ' " sexual morality " he fancies protect women against rape .
The rape of women is as old as penises .
The truth is , Hitchens and men like him are n't lamenting a time when rape did n't exist ; they 're lamenting a time when women did n't have the legal means or cultural precedent to challenge being raped .
They 're lamenting a time when a word like " rape " did n't even exist , when every decent person knew that gents occasionally had their way with ladies and that was just the way of the world ; it was n't a crime , for heaven 's sake !
Back in the good old days , if a lady said no , you just took her — and it was merely proof she was n't a lady of virtue to begin with , but a filthy slattern who had n't deserved better in the first place .
See ?
Filthy slatterns .
Hitchens goes on to explain he finds absurd the concept that an intoxicated woman is n't responsible for being raped :
At this point , as you can see , Hitchens has totally lost the plot .
Indeed , " getting drunk " is not something that happens to you — but getting raped is .
Comparing getting behind the wheel of a car and getting held down and forcibly penetrated without consent is patently ludicrous , not to mention about as divorced from the actual experience of being raped as I can imagine .
Essentially , Hitchens ' argument is that women should be responsible for their choices , without ever acknowledging that rape is n't a fucking choice .
And the only way his tortured argument to hold women responsible for their rape if they 've been drinking ( but not , for example , for " dressing provocatively " ) is by arguing that being intoxicated puts a woman at greater risk of being raped , which is n't even true .
But what if it were ?
Women aged 18 - 22 in the US who attend university are more likely to be raped than women who do n't .
Would Hitchens argue that female university students are therefore " partially culpable " in their own rapes ?
I mean , getting an education is presumably " acting responsibly , " but it 's also engaging in high - risk ( for rape ) behavior .
What a conundrum !
Who to blame … ?
But Hitchens does n't have time for such hysterical ultra- feminist propaganda and zany thought experiments proposed by feminazi rape victims .
He 's got to explain why " the feminist thought police " are full of shit with their whole " You may be a victim - blaming rape apologist if … " routine .
Is n't he charming ?
He likes to see some skin , so let 's not start blaming women for that , or else women might deny him his free porn by shrouding themselves in burqas , like they do in Muslim countries , where , of course , there is no rape .
( It 's positively adorable how he disdains extremist Muslim men and yet shares so much in common with them , by the way . )
What I wonder , however , is this :
If men can be provoked and still behave themselves , then why is it that women who drink are acting irresponsibly and must take some personal responsibility if they are raped ?
If men can be provoked and still behave themselves , then so what if a woman drinks and passes out naked in the middle of Trafalgar Square ?
If our society 's based on self - restraint , then why not expect men to restrain themselves from raping , no matter the circumstance ?
It 's continually amazing to me how many men are eminently willing to suggest , in the same breath , that men can " behave themselves " yet all have potential rapists lurking within , given the right set of circumstances .
Like a woman who 's had a drink .
Irresistible , apparently .
But do n't worry , lads — if you rape her , it 's partly her fault .

Ethiopia has appealed for $ 325 m ( £ 167 m ) in food and other humanitarian aid after drought and crop failure more than doubled the number of people needing emergency assistance to 4.6 million .
Poor rains have affected much of southern and south - eastern Ethiopia since last year , significantly cutting harvests .
The shortage of local cereals has sent prices soaring , while the cost of imported food has also risen sharply due to the global food crisis and increased fuel prices .
Aid agencies said hundreds of thousands of the country 's poorest families can no longer afford to buy enough food to sustain them .
According to the UN , which issued the appeal to donors yesterday together with Ethiopia 's disaster prevention and preparedness agency , 75,000 children are already suffering from acute malnutrition and illness .
" The urgency of this launch cannot be overstated , " said John Holmes , the UN 's emergency relief coordinator .
" Humanitarian agencies are already on the ground helping the government of Ethiopia respond to the emergency , but limited resources are hampering the efforts of both the government and its humanitarian partners to help those in need . "
The food insecurity is the worst since 2003 , when 13.2 million people required emergency assistance , and it took the government and aid agencies largely by surprise .
In April it was estimated that $ 68 m would cover the country 's humanitarian requirements .
But the failure of the three - month short rains that ended in May saw the need increase dramatically .
The worst - affected areas are Oromia , the Southern Nations , Nationalities and People 's region , and the Somali region , where the government has restricted aid access due to a rebel insurgency .
A lack of water and pasture has already caused livestock deaths in all three areas .
Amid concern of a worsening situation spreading to several northern regions , the UN children 's agency , Unicef , warned last month that up to 6 million children were at risk of malnutrition .
Ethiopia hates its worldwide association with food crises , but recurring droughts and a fast - growing population of nearly 80 million has made it difficult to achieve self - sufficiency .
Around 8 million people rely on a long - term food safety net programme .
The government 's current cereal stocks are enough to cover June , but represent only a quarter of what is needed until the next harvest in around September .
Simon Mechale , the director general of Ethiopia 's disaster prevention agency , said it was working closely with aid agencies to assist the affected people .
" We are confident that , given time and adequate responses , we will jointly be able to avert a deterioration of the situation , " he said .
Earlier this week , the UK pledged £ 10 m in humanitarian aid to Ethiopia , on top of £ 5 m last month .
GRAND RAPIDS , Michigan ( CNN ) -- Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin took questions with her running mate Wednesday night , offering at one point to play " stump the candidate " with a mostly friendly Michigan crowd .
Gov. Sarah Palin greets supporters at a town - hall meeting in Michigan Wednesday night .
Asked for " specific skills " she could cite to rebut critics who question her grasp of international affairs , she replied , " I am prepared . "
" I have that confidence .
I have that readiness , " Palin said .
" And if you want specifics with specific policies or countries , you can go ahead and ask me .
You can play ' stump the candidate ' if you want to .
But we are ready to serve . "
GOP presidential nominee John McCain stepped in , pointing out that as governor of a state that is oil and gas plentiful , Palin was familiar with energy .
She knows it to be " one of our great national security challenges , " he said .
He also cited her nearly two years as commander of Alaska 's National Guard .
" I believe she is absolutely , totally qualified to address every challenge as the next vice president of the United States , " McCain said .
The Alaska governor has largely avoided national news outlets since McCain named her his running mate August 29 .
Mostly unknown outside her home state , she has sat for interviews with ABC , People magazine and Fox News and had not taken questions at a campaign appearance before Wednesday .
" I think because I 'm a Washington outsider , that opponents are going to be looking for a whole lot of things that they can criticize , and they can kind of beat the candidate here who chose me as his partner , to try to tear down the ticket , " she said Wednesday night .
Palin also took questions about her family and women 's rights during the hourlong forum .
Asked at one point how she would respond to people who say she can't be both a mother of five and vice president , she said , " Well , let 's prove them wrong . "
Speaking after the federal government announced plans to rescue ailing insurance giant AIG and after Wall Street took its second nosedive in a week , McCain and Palin both called for reforming the financial markets " in Wall Street and Washington , " as McCain put it .
" We 're going to reform how Wall Street does business and put an end to the greed that has driven our markets into chaos , " McCain said .
" We 'll put an end to multimillion - dollar payouts to CEOs who have broken the public trust .
We 'll put an end to running Wall Street like a casino .
We 'll make businesses work for the benefit of their shareholders and employees , and we 'll make sure your savings -- IRA , 401( k ) and pension accounts -- are protected . "
After a week of being on the defensive , the economic crisis has given Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama an opportunity to go on offense .
Most Americans see Obama as better equipped to handle the economy , polls show .
Earlier Wednesday , Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden blasted McCain on the subject .
Biden drew parallels between McCain 's statements about the economy and the GOP candidate 's health care plan , saying McCain favors deregulation that would n't allow states to protect residents from insurance companies .
" So John , you got back on the same horse , you continue to push a plan that 's designed to deregulate the health insurance industry , " said Biden , asking people in the crowd to raise their hands if they trust insurance companies to take care of their needs .
" I got one person [ who ] raised their hand .

The senator from Delaware told supporters they have a choice between those who allow corporations and the wealthy to go " unfettered " and those who want " common sense rules " to protect transparency .
Biden said McCain is more " out of touch " on the current financial turmoil than any other issue .
Watch how the economy is dominating the campaign trail »
The McCain campaign was quick to respond to what it called " Biden 's economic distortions . "
" If Barack Obama 's running mate wants to criticize distortions and misrepresentation , he should aim his accusations at Obama 's tax talk versus his tax record , " said Ben Porritt , a McCain - Palin spokesman .
" Ohio voters prefer John McCain 's maverick record of reforming government and fighting for change . "
Biden on Tuesday said an Obama - Biden administration would " increase regulatory oversight of the very people John [ McCain ] has refused to regulate . "
Until recently , McCain consistently described himself as an opponent of most government regulation .
In 1995 , he proposed an across - the - board moratorium on all federal regulations , but that measure failed in Congress .
In a March interview with The Wall Street Journal , he said , " I 'm always for less regulation .
But I am aware of the view that there is a need for government oversight . "
" As far as a need for additional regulations are concerned , I think that depends on the legislative agenda and what the Congress does to some degree , but I am fundamentally a deregulator , " he said .
On Tuesday morning , McCain said the U.S. economy is " fundamentally sound . "
McCain later in the day sought to clarify the remark , saying that it was the American worker who was " fundamentally sound . "
Obama continued to criticize the remark Wednesday at an event in Elko , Nevada , " His campaign must have realized that probably was n't a smart thing to say on the day of a financial meltdown , so they sent him back out a few hours later to clean up his remarks . "
In an interview with Fox 's Sean Hannity , Palin said Wednesday that Obama launched an " unfair attack on the verbiage that Sen. McCain chose . "
" He means our workforce .
He means the ingenuity of the American people .
Of course that is strong , " she said .
Obama and McCain went on the airwaves Wednesday with new economic messages .
Watch what the candidates say about the economic crisis »
The two candidates have been pushing their economic plans all week as voters deal with the failures of major investment banks on Wall Street and fears of a recession .
" This is n't just a string of bad luck .
The truth is that while you 've been living up to your responsibilities , Washington has not .
That 's why we need change .
Real change , " Obama says in the ad , which begins airing Wednesday nationally and in battleground states .
In McCain 's new ad , he praises American workers as " the best in the world " and says , " Your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street . "
" My opponent 's only solutions are talk and taxes .
I 'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington .
I 've taken on tougher guys than this before , " McCain says .
Also on Wednesday , for the first time in 10 days , Obama regained the lead in CNN 's poll of polls .
The latest poll of polls shows Obama with an edge over McCain by 1 percentage point , 46 percent to 45 percent .
The poll of polls consists of four surveys : IPSOS - McClatchy ( September 11 - 15 ) , Gallup ( September 14 - 16 ) , Diageo / Hotline ( September 14 - 16 ) and American Research Group ( September 13 - 15 ) .

C versus C++

Introduction
Someone asked :
hey can anybody tell me what do i choose for programing either GNU c or JAVA for implementing some networkprograms using some linux systemcalls
Being a C++ evangelist ( for what I believe are very good reasons ) , I suggested that the person started his project in C++ instead of Java or C .
Now , the language wars will never end , and everyone who enjoys programming have their own favourite language .
I do not believe that I will ever manage to convince the unwashed masses that C++ is a superior language - yet , when someone cries out for advice , as was the case , I will of course give my best recommendations - and since I firmly believe that C++ is a superior general purpose programming language , I am going to recommend it .
That was the start of " Beowulf Language War 2004 " . Q1 I guess ;)
Why C++ is a superior general purpose programming language
A little history
The C++ programming language was initially created by Bjarne Stroustrup , as a " better C " .
C++ was an attempt to extend and ( to some extent ) change the C programming language to overcome some of the common and big problems with the language .
C++ was first standardized in 1998 , and as such , is a much younger language than C .
So , what 's the deal with C ++?
For the vast majority of problems out there , I state that C++ provides no significant downsides and a number of significant improvements .
Bold ?
Some people seem to think so , but it 's really the case .
Let 's start out by clearing up a few very common C++ misunderstandings :
C++ is slower than C Wrong !
Many C programs are valid C++ programs as well - and such a C program should run at identical speed when translated with either the C and with the C++ compiler .
Wrong !
Many C programs are valid C++ programs as well - and such a C program should run at identical speed when translated with either the C and with the C++ compiler .
C++ specific features give overhead Wrong !
The so - called overhead introduced by certain C++ specific features ( such as virtual function calls or exceptions ) , is comparable to the overhead you yourself would introduce should you choose to go thru the pain it would be to implement a similar feature in C .
Wrong !
The so - called overhead introduced by certain C++ specific features ( such as virtual function calls or exceptions ) , is comparable to the overhead you yourself would introduce should you choose to go thru the pain it would be to implement a similar feature in C. C++ is object oriented Wrong !
The C++ language contains some language extentions over C , that make object oriented programming and generic programming more convenient .
C++ does not force object oriented design anywhere - it merely allows for it if the programmer deems OO feasible .
C allows for object oriented programming as well , C++ only makes it simpler and less error prone .
Stronger typing
The type system in C++ is stronger than in C .
This prevents many common programming errors - coupled with the next very important feature , the stronger type system even manages not to be an inconvenience .

Parameterized types
The template keyword allows the programmer to write generic ( type- agnostic ) implementations of algorithms .
Where in C , one could write a generic list implementation with an element like : struct element_t { struct element_t * next , * prev ; void * element ; } ; C++ allows one to write something like : template < typename T > struct element_t { element_t < T> * next , * prev ; T element ; } ; Not only does the C++ implementation prevent common programming errors ( like putting an element of the wrong type on the list ) , it also allows better optimization by the compiler !
For example , a generic sort implementation is available in both C and C++ - the C routine is defined as : void qsort ( void * base , size_t nmemb , size_t size , int ( * compar ) ( const void * , const void *) ) ; whereas the C++ routine is defined as template void sort ( RandomAccessIterator first , RandomAccessIterator last ) ;
The difference being , that for example sorting an array of integers , would , in the C case , require a function call for every single compare , whereas the C++ implementation would allow the compiler to inline the integer comparison calls , as the actual sort routine is instantiated at compile time , automatically by the compiler , with the correct types inserted in the template arguments .

A bigger standard library C++ allows the full use of the C standard library .
This is very important of course , as the C standard library is an invaluable resource when writing real world programs .
However , C++ includes the Standard Template Library .
The STL contains a number of useful templates , like the sort routine above .
It includes useful common data structures such as lists , maps , sets , etc .
Like the sort routine , the other STL routines and data structures are " tailored " to the specific needs the programmer has - all the programmer has to do is fill in the types .
Of course , the STL is no silver bullet - but it does provide a great help very often , when solving general problems .
How often have you implemented a list in C ?
How often would an RB - tree have been a better solution , if only you had had the time to do it ?
With the STL you do not need to make such compromises - use the tree if it's a better fit , it 's as easy as using the list .
There are no good C++ compilers
It 's been like this for a long time .
But you must remember , that the language was standardized in 1998 - it is a complex language , more complex than C .
It has taken a long time for compilers to catch up to the standard .
But as of this writing , there are good compilers available for the most widely used platforms out there ; GCC in versions 3.X are generally very good , and it runs on GNU / Linux and most UNIX platforms .
Intel has a good compiler for Win32 - it is also pretty good , but unfortunately it still relies on the MS STL which is sub-par .

People do n't know good C++
This is not an often heard complaint , but it 's something that I see a lot .
C++ is a big and complex language - but it also used to be a language that was hyped a lot , especially back in the " OOP solves hunger , cures AIDS and cancer " days .
The result seems to be that a lot of really poor C++ code , basically bad C with a few class statements here and there , is out there and is being used as learning material .
This means , a lot of people who believe they know C++ actually write really crap code .
That 's too bad , and it's a problem , but I think it 's unfair to blame C++ for this .
Note , that I am not arguing that everything is rewritten in C ++.
There are many large projects out there which are written in C - I do not believe that it is a good idea to just " convert " them to C++. C++ allows for cleaner solutions than C does , for a great many problems .
Doing a minimal conversion of a solution which is " as clean as it gets " in C , to C++ , would convert " good C " code into " poor C++ " .
That is not a change to the better !
I have converted code from C to C ++.
But such a conversion has always ended up being a complete rewrite .
From scratch .
A redesign as such may not be necessary - after all , C++ does not force any new design principles down your throat , and if the original C code was well designed , there may not be a need to redo that .
However , for new projects starting out today , I fail to see why anyone ( who knows C++ or is willing to learn it ) would use C rather than C++.
Unless , of course , that one of the two problems stated earlier are important .
The Challenge
The problem : Write a program that reads text from standard - input , and returns ( prints ) the total number of distinct words found in the text .
In short , I presented a C++ solution to the problem , and challenged someone to do it in C .
I even wrote :
I still guarantee you two things :
1 ) Your code will be longer 2 ) Your program will be slower
Initial solutions
The small C++ solution
std::set
std::string
stdin
#include < set > # include < string > # include < iostream > int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { //
Declare and Initialize some variables std:: string word ; std:: set<std::string > wordcount ; //
Read words and insert in rb-tree while ( std:: cin >> word ) wordcount.insert( word ) ; //
Print the result std::cout << " Words : " << wordcount.size ( ) << std::endl ; return 0 ; }
The faster C solution
Note , the actual code presented here is not the exact suggestion sent to the list - I changed the printing of the result at the bottom of the code , so that the program prints out the number of distinct words - the original code was made to print out an unsorted list of word frequencies .
This change only touches a few of the very last lines in the code , it touches nothing in the central parts of the program at all .
Unlike my initial solution , this program uses a hash to store the distinct words .
A hash can be faster than an RB - tree - a well dimensioned hash can exhibit O ( 1 ) complexity for insertions where an RB - tree exhibits O ( log ( n ) ) complexity .
The change of algorithm is unfortunate for a language - performance comparison point of view - as the C implementation will exhibit different run-time performance than the C++ implementation , for reasons that are not related to the choice of language at all .
However , I 'm not going to bitch about it , I 'm going to evaluate the suggestion and still prove my point ; that C++ is a better language for solving general purpose programming problems .
Let 's have a look at the C code shall we ;

And here I argue that this is where C++'s strength becomes evident .
STL is _standard_ ( hence its name ) .
Thus , for a C++ programmer , Jakob 's code is comprehensible in one 15 second long glimpse and this programmer can immediately use ( trust ? ) the code .
With the equivalent C code from the posted link , I personally have the problem that I need at least 15 minutes to read and understand it , and even then , I can't be sure I identified all gotchas and thus I can use it without major crashes and problems .
I argue that the biggest problem with C up until glib and gsl ( thus very recently ) was exactly the lack of high level routines collected in a ubiquous library .
Showdown , so far
C and C++ code was compiled with GCC 3.3.2 , using the following switches :
- O3 - Wall - g - march=pentium2
- O3 -march=pentium2
Run -time performance Solution Lines of code Run-time C++ RB - tree 15 235 sec. C Hash 85 36 sec .
Wow !
Quite a difference !
At 567 % the code - size , the C implementation gets the work done in 15 % of the time of the C++ solution .
Quite a difference , in run-time as well as implementation - time .
But this benchmark is no good for the purpose of the " C versus C++ " argument - it's two completely different approaces that yield completely different results , for reasons that have nothing to do with the languages used .
Identical algorithms , different languages
Shorter ( so that it is easier audited / comprehended )
Generic ( so that it can be reused )
Faster
Prettier
brew coffee
With the time that I spent on this , I was not able to achieve all of those goals .
It was a tradeoff between code length / clarity and speed , basically .
As it turned out , making the code more generic did not affect run-time performance , and did not significantly affect code size .
The main thing that affected code size , was , that I made the code reliable and reusable - I changed the C implementation which used global variables and # define s ( thus making the implementation unusable if for example someone wanted to use two different hashes in a program ) , into a generic template class .
A short table summarizing the changes :
C versus C++ , hash implementation Quality C implementation C++ implementation Generality Hash parameters are defines , everything - global Hash parameters specified as template parameters , nothing - global Usability
No memory cleanup - customized allocation routines make addition of cleanup slightly complicated Full cleanup in hash destructor
One of the nifty features of the C++ implementation is , that the hash parameters are specified at hash instantiation , as template parameters .
So , a program needing two different hashes with different size parameters , would simply declare them as :
my_hash_t <> one ; //
Uses default parameters my_hash_t < 11,3 > two ; // NHASH=11 , MULT=3 in this instantiation

Now , what you may not realize if you 're an old - school C programmer is , that you can actually stick the entire hash implementation - everything in the above listing except for the main routine - in a header file .
Yep , that 's right - C++ will handle this , the linker will not barf .
You can then include this header file in every project you do , where you may need a hash implementation .
You define the properties of the has when you instantiate the hash - in your own code .
The header file just provides the template implementation .
C'mon , that 's clever !
Showdown ; identical algorithm , C versus C++
Speed - the C++ implementation must run as fast or faster than the C implementation
Generality - the C++ implementation must be easily reusable in other projects ( unlike the C implementation )
Usability - the C++ implementation must manage its memory properly ( unlike the C implementation )
Code length - The C++ implementation is 36 lines longer than the C implementation - I accepted this , as the new code can in fact be used as a component in other projects ( unlike the C implementation )
Run -time performance Solution Lines of code Run-time C++ Hash 121 34.697 sec. C Hash 85 35.929 sec .
Conclusion so far
I believe that I have demonstrated how C++ constructs ( the template ) allows for generic re-usable and flexible implementations without run-time performance overhead , and ( the constructor / destructor ) allows for automatic initialization and cleanup of data structures - making it simpler for the user of generic data structures , such as the hash presented , to write real - world programs that are reliable and do not leak memory .
I also believe that I have proven , that C++ does not force any particular type of design down anyone 's throat .
For example , the node_t in my code is almost identical to the struct node in the original C code - there simply was no need to change it , and therefore it was left basically the way that it was .
Further solutions
The reasons for the beating turned out to be pretty interesting .
Fixed C++ solution
char *
std::string
std :: string a = " abc " ; // easy initialization from C strings const char * b = a.c_str ( ) ; // easy to get a C string out again std:: string b = " foo " + a ; // operations on strings are easy too ! size_t b_len = b.size ( ) ; // O( 1 ) behavior for some operations bool a_eq_b = a == b ; // string comparison , done right
std::string
I discovered that for string comparisons ( which is the number - one CPU consuming operation in both the C hash implementation and the C++ RB - tree implementation ) in my STL use the memcmp routine , whereas the C implementation directly calls the strcmp routine .
Now , for some odd reason , the strcmp routine on my system is heavily optimized for the Pentium II processor , while the memcmp routine used when I specify Pentium II optimizations is optimized for the i486 processor .
This was one cause for the slowdown - my RB - tree implementation simply could not compare strings as fast as the C implementation , even though it ought to be faster at comparing since it already has O ( 1 ) access to the string lengths .
But this was not the whole explanation .
It turns out , that using std:: cin >> buf is just horribly inefficient .
I did not dig further into this to discover why - I guess that all in all , maintaining the length of the string explicitly as the STL std :: string does , is just not a win in this scenario .
Further , I guess that std :: cin is just not horribly well optimized , in the STL that I use .
I guess this is understandable - the STL is big , and I / O may just not have been the number one priority for the STL people - understandable , I guess , since the standard C library offers fine routines for doing I/O , and especially when high - performance I/O is a concern , one will use the " raw " read and write system calls anyway .
So , I cooked up a very simple implementation that still uses std:: string ( because it gives us safe memory management and fully automatic cleanup ) , but takes the C approach to reading in data from the text file .
The code is presented below :
#include < set > # include < string > # include < iostream > # include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { // Declare and Initialize some variables char buf [ 16384 ] ; std::set<std::string > wordcount ; //
Read words and insert in rb - tree while ( scanf ( " %s " , buf ) != EOF ) wordcount.insert( buf ) ; //
Print the result std::cout << " Words : " << wordcount.size ( ) << std::endl ; return 0 ; }

Faster C++ solution
It really serves no purpose .
Except perhaps to boost my ego by presenting something that is faster than the " programming pearl " presented earlier ;)
The following solution uses something that is almost - but - not - quite a digital trie .
In my tests , it uses about four times as much memory as the hash implementations did .
It sacrifices memory footprint for performance .
#include < unistd.h > # include < vector > # include < cctype > # include < stdint.h> # include < iostream > const size_t pagesize = 4096 ; struct knot_t { knot_t ( ) : exists ( false ) , childcount ( 0 ) , children ( 0 ) { } knot_t* child ( unsigned c ) { //
Look for a matching child if ( children ) { unsigned i = childcount / 2 ; unsigned leftpos = 0 ; unsigned rightpos = childcount ; while ( children [ i ] . letter != uint8_t( c ) ) { if ( uint8_t ( c ) < children [ i].letter ) { rightpos = i ; i = ( leftpos + i ) / 2 ; } else { leftpos = i+1 ; i = ( rightpos + i ) / 2 ; } if ( rightpos == leftpos ) goto nomatch ; } return children + i ; } nomatch : // Create matching child - insert in order knot_t * nary = new knot_t [ childcount + 1 ] ; knot_t * destp = nary ; knot_t * sourcep = children ; knot_t * endsource = children + childcount ; while ( sourcep != endsource && sourcep -> letter < c ) * destp ++ = * sourcep ++ ; knot_t * outp = destp ++ ; while ( sourcep != endsource ) * destp++ = * sourcep ++ ; delete [ ] children ; children = nary ; outp -> letter = c ; childcount ++ ; return outp ; } unsigned distinctcount ( ) const { unsigned total = exists ?
1 : 0 ; for ( unsigned i = 0 ; i != childcount ; ++i ) total += children[i].distinctcount ( ) ; return total ; } bool exists ; private : uint8 _t letter ; unsigned short childcount ; knot_t * children ; } ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { knot_t base ; char buffer [ pagesize ] ; knot_t * curnot = 0 ; while ( ssize_t r = read ( 0 , buffer , pagesize ) ) { if ( r <= 0 ) break ; for ( unsigned bufpos = 0 ; bufpos != unsigned ( r ) ; ++ bufpos ) { uint8 _t c = buffer [ bufpos ] ; if ( isspace ( c ) ) { if ( ! curnot ) continue ; curnot -> exists = true ; curnot = 0 ; continue ; } if ( ! curnot ) { curnot = base.child( c ) ; continue ; } curnot = curnot -> child ( c ) ; } } if ( curnot ) curnot -> exists = true ; std::cout << " Distinct : " << base.distinctcount ( ) << std::endl ; return 0 ; }
Run -time performance Solution Lines of code Run-time C++ RB - tree ( I ) 15 235 sec. C++ Hash 121 34.697 sec. C Hash 85 35.929 sec. C++ RB - tree ( II ) 15 63.970 sec. C++ Ego - booster 93 18.108 sec .
Of course , the ego - booster could also be implemented in C. Probably with negligible run-time penalty ( as per the previous tests ) .
This code really uses virtually none of the niceties that C++ provides , in mainly serves to prove that C++ can be used for real performance critical code , where old - timers would cry " C " if asked .
Well , I 'm not asking , I was too busy coding ;)
The above code spends about half of the run-time waiting for a register stall , because I store the letter as a uint8_t instead of an unsigned .
It would be simple to change , but it would cost about 30 % extra on the memory footprint .
Ah , tradeoffs ...

HarperCollins occupies floors 1 through 22 of a giant steel - and - glass box on 53rd Street .
But up on 26 , the receptionist for a tiny offshoot of the company sits alone , gatekeeper to a few drab rows of empty cubicles .
A glass container on a table holds a mysterious pile of bright - yellow lightbulbs .
“ Welcome to our temporary home , ” says 51 - year - old publisher Bob Miller , ushering me into a colleague ’s more inviting office .
Inside , he and his staffers prepare to impart a cheery message :
They ’re going to fix publishing !
But first , a horror story .
Debbie Stier , Miller ’s No. 2 at HarperStudio ( as this little imprint is called ) , has been collecting videos for their blog .
“ You want to see what happens to books after they go to book heaven ? ” she asks .
On the screen of her MacBook , a giant steel shredder disgorges a ragged mess of paper and cardboard onto a conveyor belt .
This is the fate of up to 25 percent of the product churned out by New York ’s publishing machine .
Everyone ’s eyes widen , as though watching some viral YouTube gross - out .
“ It ’s like Wall - E , ” says marketing director Sarah Burningham .
“ It ’s depressing , ” Miller adds .
They had sent in a Flip camera with a warehouse worker .
“ You can see our books go through there , ” says Stier .
“ The Crichton , the Ann Patchett . ”
Miller recently left Hyperion , which he founded seventeen years ago , to start his own imprint at the urging of HarperCollins ’s then - CEO , Jane Friedman .
She was replaced in June , but HarperStudio lives on .
For all its ambitions , it ’s a modest outfit : Miller and three women , two of them in their twenties , hope to publish two books a month starting next May , having convinced 25 authors to forgo big advances in return for half of their books ’ eventual profit .
The books they ’ll be doing are n’t particularly outré — Emeril Lagasse on grilling , 50 Cent is collaborating with The 48 Laws of Power author Robert Greene — but they ’re hoping that their process will be revolutionary .
Over the past few weeks , Stier has turned her own Flip camera on friends and colleagues , asking them to hold up those yellow lightbulbs and share their “ bright ideas ” on publishing .
She plays us a few of the clips , including one of a publicist who delivers Stier ’s intended punch line , tentatively : “ Have fewer authors and sell more books ? ”
But the suggestion that gets the biggest laugh in the office is from Stier ’s 12 - year - old son , who says , “ So maybe you have to turn all the books into movies so nobody has to waste their time . ”
“ It is a very trying time .
I ’m kind of down about it myself . ”
— JONATHAN GALASSI , PRESIDENT OF FARRAR , STRAUS AND GIROUX
The demise of publishing has been predicted since the days of Gutenberg .
But for most of the past century — through wars and depressions — the business of books has jogged along at a steady pace .
It ’s one of the main ( some would say only ) advantages of working in a “ mature ” industry : no unsustainable highs , no devastating lows .
A stoic calm , peppered with a bit of gallows humor , prevailed in the industry .
Survey New York ’s oldest culture industry this season , however , and you wo n’t find many stoics .
What you will find are prophets of doom , Cassandras in blazers and black dresses arguing at elegant lunches over What Is to Be Done .
Even best - selling publishers and agents fresh from seven - figure deals worry about what ’s coming next .
Two , five years from now — who knows ?
Life moves fast in the waning era of print ; publishing does n’t .
So what ’s causing this , exactly — this inchoate dread that ’s suddenly turned “ choate , ” as one insider puts it ?
The anxiety would be endurable if it was just a function of the late - Bush economy : Sales at the five big publishers were up 0.5 percent in the first half of this year , bookstore sales tanked in June , and a full - year decline is expected .
But pretty much every aspect of the business seems to be in turmoil .
There ’s the floundering of the few remaining semi-independent midsize publishers ; the ouster of two powerful CEOs — one who inspired editors and one who at least let them be ; the desperate race to evolve into e-book producers ; the dire state of Borders , the only real competitor to Barnes & Noble ; the feeling that outrageous money is being wasted on mediocre books ; and Amazon .com , which many publishers look upon as a power - hungry monster bent on cornering the whole business .
One by one , these would be difficult problems to solve .
But as a series of interrelated challenges , they constitute a full - blown crisis — a climate change as unpredictable as it is inevitable .
And like global warming , it elicits reactions ranging from denial to Darwinian survivalism to determined stabs at warding off disaster — attempts not to recapture some long - lost era but to harness new , untapped sources of power .
That is , if it ’s not too late .

“ Flat is not an acceptable position .
We are always expected to grow . ” — CAROLYN REIDY , CEO OF SIMON & SCHUSTER
In its heyday , publishing was a vast array of mom-and - pop shops , in which the pops tended to be independently wealthy .
Their competitive advantage was not efficiency or low costs but taste .
Maxwell Perkins at Scribner ; Bennett Cerf at Random House ; Roger Straus and Robert Giroux at Farrar , Straus and Giroux ; Barney Rosset at Grove ; and Alfred A. Knopf epitomized the gentleman editor as gallerist , snatching up unknown geniuses .
One British publisher advised an American at the time : “ Take lots and lots of gambles , but small ones . ”
So they did .
They took poor writers drinking , put them up in their homes , and defended them in court .
They made handshake deals , spent their personal wealth in lean years , and built backlists out of modernist classics .
Discovering Faulkner was like buying Picassos in 1910 .
In the early sixties , Knopf sold out to Cerf , who sold Random House to RCA , and the era of consolidation began .
Formerly independent publishers shriveled into mere imprints of massive corporations .
Knopf became part of Random House ; so did Doubleday and Bantam and Ballantine and dozens of still smaller shops now distinguished mostly by their names , like corporatized Broadway theaters bearing the monikers of long - gone cigar - chomping producers .
By the nineties , five big conglomerates were divvying up the spoils and their lucrative backlists .
Many of the smaller companies that had been struggling , like FSG , Ecco , and Crown , were flush with corporate resources .
But in exchange , they gave up final say in how they ’d publish their books — or even what books they ’d publish .
And suddenly an industry accustomed to 5 percent margins was being run by media moguls aiming for double digits .
The corporations began by doing what they knew how to do : acquire , expand , diversify , spend .
Sign up all kinds of writers , pay some of them a ton , market the hell out of them , see what sticks .
It was the nineties , after all .
A few books sold spectacularly , but more failed , and in the last ten years , the bill has come due .
So today , the order comes down from beleaguered CEOs : More blockbuster books , fast .
Which leads to cutthroat auctions and ballooning advances .
You ca n’t win big if you do n’t bet big .
“ The system works just fine for commercial fiction .
But for literary fiction , I think we had a nice run of it in the commercial world . ”
Lately , the whole , hoary concept of paying writers advances against royalties has come under question .
Following their down payments to authors , publishers do n’t have to pay a cent in royalties , which are usually 15 percent of the hardcover price , 7.5 for paperbacks , until that signing bonus is earned back .
The system is supposed to be mutually beneficial ; the publishers guarantee writers a certain income , and then both parties share in the proceeds beyond that level .
But it only works for publishers if they ’re conservative in their expectations .
As auctions over hot books have grown more frequent , prudence has gone out the window — paying a $ 1 million advance to a 26 - year - old first - time novelist becomes a public - relations gambit as much as an investment in that writer ’s future .
That money has to come from somewhere , so publishers have cracked down on their non-star writers .
The advances you do n’t hear about have been dropping precipitously .
For every Pretty Young Debut Novelist who snags that seven - figure prize , ten solid literary novelists have seen advances slashed for their third books .
Of course , back in the boom nineties , the corporations themselves were pumping up the expectations of midlist writers .
Consider Dale Peck .
His first novel , Martin and John , came out in 1993 to excellent reviews , and by his third book , in 1998 , he was , by his own account , wildly overpaid .
Books , he says , “ were like Internet stocks , getting enormous advances without demonstrating any moneymaking whatsoever . ”
Having rarely sold more than 10,000 copies , he took up with superagent Andrew Wylie , developed a reputation for being a “ diva , ” and pretty soon could n’t sell a book to save his life .
Until he started specializing in genre fiction — first children ’s books , then horror .
Last year , Peck sold Body Surfing , a thriller about demons exiting people through sexual release .
He ’s now splitting $ 3 million with Heroes writer Tim Kring to produce a trilogy of conspiracy thrillers .
Peck sees an increasingly hostile environment for the kind of books he used to write .
“ When you get $ 100,000 for a novel , ” he says , “ you want $ 150,000 and then $ 200,000 , so when they pay you $ 25,000 for the next one , and my rent is $ 2,500 a month , what do you do ?
The system works just fine for commercial fiction .
But for literary fiction , I think we had a nice run of it in the commercial world . ”
The good fiction that does manage to snag a stratospheric advance is mostly either a follow - up to or a knockoff of a freak hit .
The astonishing success of Charles Frazier ’s Cold Mountain led to a bidding war for his second book , which Grove / Atlantic editor Morgan Entrekin lost with great regret to Ann Godoff at Random House ’s eponymous imprint ( known as Little Random ) .
Lucky him .
The price tag , more than $ 8 million , might well have sunk Grove , one of the few biggish independent houses left , because Frazier ’s follow - up , Thirteen Moons , sold less than 500,000 copies , according to BookScan .
Ann Godoff was fired not long after the deal was made .
“ It is possible they broke Little Random ’s neck , ” says one agent .
“ Frazier ’s wife will not have the luxury to buy another racehorse . ”

But overspending is n’t going away , even with a rotten economy .
Last month , Harvard economist Anita Elberse wrote a piece debunking the hypothesis of Chris Anderson ’s anti-blockbuster blockbuster , The Long Tail ( which Bob Miller acquired at Hyperion for a mere $ 550,000 ) .
Elberse led off with a tidbit from a study of Hachette ’s Grand Central Publishing .
Of 61 books on its 2006 list , each title averaged a profit of almost $ 100,000 .
But without the top seller , which earned $ 5 million , that average drops to $ 18,000 .
“ A blockbuster strategy still makes the most sense , ” she concludes .
It ’s inherently risky , though .
You have to wonder about the prospects for one new book that Elberse had her students case - study — Dewey : The Small - Town Library Cat Who Touched the World .
Grand Central , inspired by the best seller Marley & Me , is betting on the new mini - genre of cat - related nonfiction .
Grand Central initially offered $ 300,000 , then went up to $ 1.25 million .
Gobs more will be spent on marketing .
You ’ll likely be hearing about Dewey when it comes out this month , and if half a million of you still feel that you ca n’t get enough heartwarming pet stories , it just might earn back its advance .
So publishing ends up looking like a mini-Hollywood , but even more dependent on sleeper hits and semi-reliable franchises .
Dan Brown ’s The Da Vinci Code buoyed Random House tremendously in the past five years , but with Brown ’s sequel delayed , sales were down 5.6 percent last year .
When Simon & Schuster announced that sales were off almost 10 percent in the first half of ’ 08 , it cited the 2007 success of The Secret as the reason for the relative shortfall .
Other companies did better — but on the strength of surprise hits .
Sales grew 11 percent both at Penguin and at Hachette ’s U.S. division , largely on the backs of two authors — Oprah - touted self - helper Eckhart Tolle at Penguin and Stephenie Meyer at Little , Brown .
Morgan Entrekin remembers meeting Larry Kirshbaum , then - CEO of Time Warner Books , right after two of Kirshbaum ’s books had been anointed by Oprah in 1999 .
“ It ’s like winning the lottery twice , ” says Entrekin , “ but Larry did n’t seem that happy .
He said , ‘ Now my bosses are going to expect me to do better next year . ’ ’’ Kirshbaum eventually left to become an agent .
“ If someone like Jane Friedman ca n’t survive the industry , who can ? ” — AN EDITOR AT A HARPERCOLLINS RIVAL
The ideal publishing CEO can “ read vertically and horizontally , ” in the words of ex-Penguin CEO Peter Mayer .
But even those who clearly can do both , like Jane Friedman , seem powerless to keep their bosses happy .
Friedman had an odd retirement party .
It was thrown not by her former employer , HarperCollins , but by her rival and close friend , Doubleday publisher Steve Rubin .
The turnout for mid-August was impressive : Power agents Amanda “ Binky ” Urban and Mort Janklow and legendary editors Sonny Mehta , Gary Fisketjon , and Dan Halpern all converged on Rubin ’s elegant roof deck off Central Park West .
They surprised the guest of honor by wearing disturbing Jane Friedman masks .
Friedman herself gave a defiant speech insisting that it was n’t a retirement party at all .
“ Books mean civilization , ” she said , perched on iron steps that resembled a barricade from Les Misérables .
Later she proclaimed , “ I am not done , and I am not done by a long shot ! ”
Friedman was an emblem not of publishing ’s genteel old days but rather its postmillennial media - and tech - savvy era .
She came up through publicity at Random House , and over a decade as CEO , she turned HarperCollins from a floundering beast into the business ’s tightest , shiniest ship .
She also attended personally to writers .
She had such a good relationship with Michael Crichton that he followed her from Random House to HarperCollins .
Yet a few days after being the belle of the industry ’s annual confab , BookExpo , held in L.A. last spring , she went into Rupert Murdoch ’s office and was told that her own protégé , Harper No. 2 Brian Murray , was replacing her .
As one editor puts it , “ She went over there thinking they were going to discuss [ her ] contract , and instead she got a two - by - four across the face . ”
Friedman was never known as a gentle soul , but her brutal “ resignation ” spooked the industry .
What exactly had she done to deserve this ?
HarperCollins ’s recent numbers were down but had recovered reasonably by June .
With both parties refusing to comment , theories abounded , the most plausible of which is that Murdoch thought she had become more noise and trouble than she was worth , running a part of his conglomerate that , relatively speaking , is n’t worth all that much to him .
There was her messy dismissal of Judith Regan following the O. J. debacle — a tabloid event that dovetailed too well with Friedman ’s reputed love of publicity .
Murdoch , people at the company say , did n’t like seeing Friedman ’s name all over the papers .
Murray looks to be a less conspicuous character .
He promises to continue Friedman ’s innovations , and to accelerate a worldwide expansion of the business .
“ We have a green light from News Corp. to invest in our business , ” he says .
Friedman , meanwhile , is said to be mulling an Amazon consulting gig .
The new face at the top of Random House , who replaced Peter Olson as CEO the week before Friedman left , is 40 and has never worked in book publishing before .
Markus Dohle , a veteran of Bertelsmann ’s printing business , cuts quite a different figure from , say , dapper , laconic Knopf editor Sonny Mehta , a man who ’s survived many a CEO and is said to have shrugged comically when he found out — via the New York Times — that Olson was out .
“ It ’s like Dohle ’s 27 years old :
He sort of bounces on the balls of his feet the way college athletes do , ” says one longtime industry observer .
Dohle has spent the last three months on a listening tour , and his subjects nervously await the results .
So far , many prefer his demeanor to that of Olson , a man whose voracious reading failed to make up for his coldness ( an in - house joke was that he was a Swede pretending to be a German ) .
But managerially , Olson had one saving grace .
“ He left people alone , ” says the industry observer .
“ But [ Dohle ] does n’t come out of a tradition of editors as geniuses who need to be left alone in a room to smell manuscripts and decide on them . ”
Random House had a weak 2007 , and publishing sources say Olson did n’t do enough to eliminate its endemic inefficiencies .
Imprints are still allowed to bid against each other for books , thus driving up prices , and every one of them has a major problem or two .
Little Random has been without an official editor - in - chief since Daniel Menaker left last year .
Doubleday , post–Da Vinci Code , is overextended .
And two of Random ’s down - market imprints , Crown and Bantam , are said to have dragged down past earnings ; Bantam Dell head Irwyn Applebaum is a frequent object of anticipatory Schadenfreude .
“ When business is slow , tongues are fast , ” responds Random House spokesman Stuart Applebaum , Irwyn ’s brother , declining a request to speak to Dohle and calling the speculation “ fantasy - league Random House . ”
He says there is “ zero change ” at the imprints , and that Bantam “ consistently delivers some of the company ’s biggest - selling hardcovers and paperbacks . ”
“ What I ’ve heard from editors is , ‘ My judgment does n’t count any longer . ’
They did n’t flock to publishing because they want to publish Danielle Steel . ”
Dohle has been popping into editorial marketing meetings , something Olson almost never did .
At the end of July , Mehta brought Dohle as a surprise guest to a Knopf meeting .
Looking over a sales spreadsheet , he muttered to Mehta , “ This is n’t how the other imprints do it . ”
Editors who were called in during the meeting had n’t all been told Dohle would be there .
One such editor , herself a former executive , said of a book with disappointing sales , “ It ’s dead in the water .
Do n’t worry about it . ”
Another person in attendance says , “ You could see Dohle ’s eyebrows going , ‘ Oh boy , that was candid . ’ ” What was his take on the proceedings ?
Where would these little observations lead , and how would they affect the people in this room ?
No one yet knows .
“ I think agents often like for there to be problems , because they can be the stalwart support behind a writer . ”
— GARY FISKETJON , KNOPF EDITOR
The blockbuster era makes retaining marquee writers an increasingly complex proposition .
Back when Grove ’s Barney Rosset was boozing around Paris with Samuel Beckett , agents were adjuncts , the ones who handled the details ( in fact , Rosset became Beckett ’s agent too ) .
The editor , both best friend and midwife to genius , had it made .
The pay was awful , but what company !
And all in the service of art .
“ We publish authors , not books , ” FSG ’s people like to say — and for decades , through best sellers and duds , great writers and prestigious publishers were inseparable .
Some still are : Philip Roth , thus far , has stuck by Houghton Mifflin even after its painful merger with Harcourt .
John Updike , at Knopf , does n’t even have an agent .
But early this year , two of publishing ’s tightest bonds were broken .
Richard Ford left Knopf ’s star editor , Gary Fisketjon , for Dan Halpern at Ecco ( Binky Urban , the agent who handled Frazier ’s deal , did this one , too ) .
And , after 42 years at FSG , Tom Wolfe left for Little , Brown .
Fisketjon , renowned for his close friendships and even closer edits ( Raymond Carver , Cormac McCarthy , et al. ) , was more than Ford ’s editor — he and the novelist “ would kill furry animals in the woods together , ” as one colleague puts it .
But doing business together had become tricky .
Ford ’s literary reputation and popularity had fallen out of alignment ; his last book , The Lay of the Land , sold less than 100,000 copies , per BookScan .
Slow - and - steady Knopf did n’t seem fazed , but the author himself was .
He thought house enthusiasm had waned , and “ he never felt the money was commensurate with the work that was produced , ” says the colleague .
It could n’t have been easy when the Lauren Weisbergers of the world were getting better deals than he was .
“ He ’s 64 , looking for that one last score in the literary world . ”
Knopf offered Ford roughly $ 750,000 per book , at which point Mehta capped the money , according to the source ; Ecco offered $ 3 million for three books .
Others say that Ford had simply grown unhappy with Fisketjon ’s editing .
Cormac McCarthy left Fisketjon , too , but he stayed with Knopf and had Mehta edit him .
When Ford decided to leave , says the source , he left Fisketjon a phone message explaining his move .
It was never returned .
He sent a follow - up e-mail , which Fisketjon answered with a surly note .
Only Ford and Fisketjon know what exact words were exchanged ( and both refuse to comment on their relationship after the move ) , but Ford later told someone that “ Gary has to learn he ’s no longer in high school . ”
This was business , after all .
Tom Wolfe kept FSG afloat in its last decade of independence with The Bonfire of the Vanities , but Jonathan Galassi shrugs off making him a lowball offer earlier this year .
Little , Brown paid about $ 7 million for his next novel , a Miami race parable , after Galassi reportedly balked at an early request for $ 5 million .
“ We went through a court dance , ” says Galassi .
“ Everyone acted their part , and the result could have been predicted from the beginning . ”
Wolfe says his divorce was cordial , noting that 42 years is a lot of loyalty — which , by the way , is a two - way street .
“ Making a living as a writer is much more like Protestantism than Catholicism .
In the Catholic Church you built up your bank account through some good works , even if you ’ve had terrible sins . ”
A close friend of Wolfe ’s says it was n’t about Galassi , it was about Roger Straus , the charismatic old - line chairman of FSG who died in 2004 .
After Bonfire , Random House had offered Wolfe millions to leave Straus , but he ’d refused .
With his old friend gone , Wolfe relied on his most trusted surviving confidante : his agent , Lynn Nesbit .
Writers looking for a boost from a new publisher would do well to remember the cautionary tale of one Salman Rushdie , exhibit A in the case of Editor v. Agent .
Sonny Mehta was his editor ; they shared virtually identical tastes and backgrounds , and each had helped the other ’s career .
Enter Rushdie ’s agent , Andrew Wylie , in the late nineties , pitching what would become Rushdie ’s 1999 novel , The Ground Beneath Her Feet .
“ Wylie held Sonny up , ” says a publisher at another house .
“ Sonny said no and [ Wylie ] said , ‘ Well , cheers , we ’re leaving . ’
Despite low sales of Rushdie ’s previous novel , Holt paid $ 2 million for the new one ( plus some paperback rights ) .
It promptly tanked .
Rushdie eventually returned — not to Knopf but to Little Random .
His career has never been the same .
Many agents contend that , with younger editors being laid off or jumping around to start new imprints , the job of nurturing an author has been left to them .
“ You hear every day of an editor changing houses , ” says longtime agent Mort Janklow .
“ J. R. Moehringer [ best - selling author of The Tender Bar ] , I sold him to Hyperion . ”
Two of Moehringer ’s editors left the house .
“ Then Bob Miller decides to leave .
This is a young man who writes a book about abandonment !
Who does he turn to ?
The departed publisher ?!
I take care of him . ”
Meanwhile , morale among many editorial staffers is dipping to all - time lows .
Forget literary taste ; everything is cost - benefit analysis .
“ What I ’ve heard from editors is , ‘ My judgment does n’t count any longer , ’ ” says Kent Carroll , who left his company , Carroll & Graf , after it was sold to a mini-conglomerate , and who now runs the boutique Europa Editions .
“ There used to be a reason to get into publishing , ” says Carroll .
“ Whether they know it or not , they all want to be Maxwell Perkins .
It ’s a kind of secondary immortality .
They did n’t flock to publishing because they want to publish Danielle Steel . ”
“ Some people say there ’s not enough marketing done for a book , and I think that ’s total bullshit .
You do the marketing that works , and not much is working right now . ”
— PETER MILLER , DIRECTOR OF PUBLICITY , BLOOMSBURY
One key advantage of corporate publishing was supposed to be its marketing muscle :
You may not publish exactly the books you ’d like to , but the ones you publish will get the attention they deserve .
Yet in recent years , more accurate internal sales numbers have confirmed what publishers long suspected : Traditional marketing is useless .
“ Media does n’t matter , reviews do n’t matter , blurbs do n’t matter , ” says one powerful agent .
Nobody knows where the readers are , or how to connect with them .
Fifteen years ago , Philip Roth guessed there were at most 120,000 serious American readers — those who read every night — and that the number was dropping by half every decade .
Others vehemently disagree .
But who really knows ?
Focused consumer research is almost nonexistent in publishing .
What readers want — and whether it ’s better to cater to their desires or try harder to shape them — remains a hotly contested issue .
You do n’t have to look further than the pages of The New York Times Book Review or the shelves of Borders to see that the market for fiction is shrinking .
Even formerly reliable schlock like TV - celebrity memoirs does n’t do so well anymore .
And “ the next thing , ” as Publishers Weekly editor Sara Nelson notes drily , “ is not bloggers writing books . ”
Marketing a book these days is like playing a slot machine ; hitting one 7 wo n’t get you a dime .
“ There has to be this constellation of events , ” says Daniel Menaker , whose departure was tied in the press to the low sales of Benjamin Kunkel ’s much - ballyhooed debut novel , Indecision .
“ Not only a Times Book Review front cover but Don Imus talking about it and Ellen Pompeo actually reading the book on - camera .
And Barack Obama has just bought it . ”
It ’s plausible that publishing would already be in the red if it were n’t for Oprah .
And “ she is reportedly going off the air in a few years , ” says former Simon & Schuster CEO Jack Romanos .
“ The most effective marketing tool they have for a book is n’t going to be there .
If I were still there , I would be figuring out , now , different and better ways to market in anticipation of that being taken away . ”
This would mean far more than just the few book “ trailers ” you see online .
“ They ’re all the rage right now , ” says Bloomsbury ’s Peter Miller , “ but I would love to see an example of one video that really did generate a lot of sales .
There ’s a sense of desperation . ”
“ We just do n’t know what our business looks like without Borders .
And that ’s terrifying .
There ’s just no way of getting around it . ”
— SIMON LIPSKAR , AGENT
If you think marketing is impossible , talk to the people in sales .
Their job — forcing books into a shrinking handful of outlets — involves all the supplication of publicity without all the fun and free booze of book parties .
And it has the added bonus of bleeding their companies dry .
Borders Group , which controls 10 to 12 percent of the bookselling market , is on death watch , putting publishers in an even less enviable negotiating position with bookstores .
The remaindering and shredding of books — a cost borne largely by the publisher — is a relic of a consignment model developed during the Depression that makes no modern sense .
Publishers also pay for placement in big bookstores , which they call “ co-op , ” under a complicated arrangement meant to cover up the fact that it ’s payola ( or , as some call it , extortion ) .
Those 300 copies of , say , American Wife stacked precariously at the entrance ?
Bought and paid for by the publisher .
“ You feel raped having to pay for placement in a store you ’re selling to , ” says an agent .
“ You ca n’t turn a camel into an alligator .
I ’d rather we have several soft years when investors get out and people who care about the values in the business reinvest . ”
But at least with two major chains , you can play one against the other .
Even in its weakened state , Borders can still boost a book into best - seller contention .
If something is selling well at Borders , a publisher can pressure an increasingly stingy Barnes & Noble to reorder .
If Barnes & Noble absorbed Borders ’ business , it would control 30 percent of the market — versus 10 percent for all the independents combined , with big - box retailers and Amazon controlling most of the rest .
( At its nineties peak , the indie - only American Booksellers Association had 4,700 member stores ; today it has 1,700 . )
This matters because the following response from Barnes & Noble CEO Steve Riggio is only technically true : “ We buy every title published — our business is a long - tail business — less than 5 percent is from bestsellers . ”
Editors insist that plenty of books get skipped .
Richard Nash , head of indie publisher Soft Skull Press , estimates that one in twenty are passed over , though ten to fifteen copies are shipped into their warehouses in case there ’s a special order .
Many more are getting smaller initial orders than ever .
That ’s a very long , very skinny tail .
Barnes & Noble , briefly interested in Borders , has since recanted .
Recently William Ackerman , a major Borders shareholder , suggested they should sell to Amazon instead .
That probably wo n’t happen , but his reasoning is clear .
Barnes & Noble is old news .
Amazon is the future .
“ The fear of Google [ BookSearch ] is ridiculous paranoia .
The fear of Amazon is enlightened self - interest . ”

Attendance at this year ’s BookExpo was way down , but you would n’t have known it if you were among the 700 - odd people at a presentation by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos .
Lean , wiry , shaven - headed , and big-eared , Bezos talked up the Kindle , the new e-reader that may or may not account for 1 percent of the book market .
No one knows .
But while bookstore sales were to drop 7.1 percent that month , Amazon was on its way to 31 percent sales growth ( albeit for all media products ) for the second quarter .
The audience greeted Bezos warily :
His sleek , West Coast style made Jane Friedman look like Vladimir Nabokov .
In a Q&A session billed as “ Upfront and Unscripted , ” none other than Chris “ Long Tail ” Anderson quizzed Bezos on his plans .
He could n’t get many straight answers ( though Bezos was delighted to discuss the suborbital space vehicle he ’s working on ) .
How many books would Bezos like to have available on the Kindle ?
“ Well , I probably wo n’t be happy unless we have 20 million , but I ’m hard to make happy , ” he said , and then let loose a honking laugh .
Publishers have been burned by e-book hype before .
A few years back , analysts were predicting we ’d all be reading novels on our Palm Pilots .
Barnes & Noble even began selling e-books .
Though it does n’t quite look the part , Bezos ’s chunky retro Kindle is the closest so far to being the iPod of books .
In mid-August , a Citigroup analyst doubled his estimate for this year ’s sales of the readers — to almost 400,000 .
Why were n’t publishers elated ?
What ’s wrong with a company that returns only 10 percent of the books it buys and might eventually eliminate the cost of print production ?
Well , it does n’t help that Amazon , which has been on an intense buying spree ( print - on - demanders BookSurge ; book networking site Shelfari ) , lists publishers as its competitors in SEC filings .
Editors and retailers alike fear that it ’s bent on building a vertical publishing business — from acquisition to your doorstep — with not a single middleman in sight .
No HarperCollins , no Borders , no printing press .
Amazon has begun to do end runs around bookstores with small presses .
Two new bios from Lyons Press , about Michelle Obama and Cindy McCain , are going straight - to - Kindle long before publication .
Amazon , in short , plays hardball .
When Hachette Livre UK could n’t come to terms over Amazon ’s U.K. payments , Amazon removed the BUY NEW button from its listings for the company ’s key books .
Hachette ’s CEO responded with an open letter , saying , “ Amazon seems each year to go from one publisher to another making increasing demands in order to achieve richer terms at our expense and sometimes at yours . ”
The ultimate fear is that the Kindle could be a Trojan horse .
Right now , Amazon is making little or nothing on Kindle books .
Lay down your $ 359 and you can get most books for $ 9.99 .
Publishers list that same Kindle version for about $ 17.99 , though , and — as with all retailers — charge Amazon roughly half that price for it .
Which means that Amazon keeps only a dollar on each book , while the publishers make $ 9 .
But Amazon may be offering a sweet deal now in order to undercut publishers later .
If their low , low prices succeed in making e-books the dominant medium , they can pay publishers whatever they want .
“ The concern is they want to corner the market , ” explains one books executive , and then force publishers to accept a genuine 50 percent discount .
“ If they took over as little as 10 to 20 percent of the market , ” says an agent , “ publishers simply would not be able to exist . ”
“ We ’re an industry more willing to watch the boat sink than rock it a wee bit . ” — ONE FRUSTRATED PUBLISHER
While many in publishing wait in their bunkers , HarperStudio and a few others forge ahead .
Back in February , Bob Miller and Jane Friedman met at the bar of the Omni Berkshire hotel for one of their freewheeling chats .
“ How would you do it differently if you could start all over again , ” she asked him .
He said he ’d try to reduce advances and returns , put out only a few books , and focus on cheap Internet marketing .
“ Why do n’t you do that ? ” she asked , and within a week they had a deal .
Miller has worked out separate contracts , co-op and all , with booksellers and authors — capping advances at $ 100,000 and reducing returns .
Their list now includes not just 50 Cent but Michael Eisner , his former boss at Hyperion ; John Lithgow ( a memoir ) ; and Isabella Rossellini adapting her short - film series on bug sex .
All these authors will contribute to their own pre-publication marketing .
Miller does n’t wait for agent submissions , instead accosting writers at conferences , telling them how much more a writer can make under 50 - 50 profit - sharing .
He ’s even throwing in something literary , 22 previously unpublished stories by Mark Twain , who , Miller points out , ran a profit - sharing publisher that made a killing on Ulysses S. Grant ’s memoirs .
“ If he were alive , this is exactly the deal he ’d want , ” Miller says brightly .
Other industry folk , while supportive , note that precious few writers — except those with trust funds — would forgo advances , and that it generally works best for those who have a pre-existing fan base that will gobble up their books .
As for Miller ’s other key ingredients , profit - sharing is not a new concept , and online marketing is catching on everywhere .
If there ’s anything Miller shares with the departed Friedman , it ’s a knack for making restructuring look like revolution .
But in a business as illogical as publishing , maybe it is .
One indie publisher has been pitching an imprint around town that would go beyond what Miller ’s doing — expanding into print - on - demand , online subscriptions , maybe even a “ salon ” for loyal readers .
He envisions a transitional period of print - on - demand , then an era in which most books will be produced electronically for next to nothing , while high - priced , creatively designed hardcovers become “ the limited - edition vinyl of the future . ”
“ I think they know it ’s right , ” the publisher says of the executives he ’s wooing , “ but they do n’t want to disrupt the internal equilibrium .
I ’m like the guy all the girls want to be friends with but wo n’t hop into bed with . ”
Nearly all of these new ideas already exist in some form or another at independents like Dave Eggers ’s brainchild , McSweeney’s .
But can they survive inside a corporate , blockbuster - bound culture ?
“ You ca n’t turn a camel into an alligator , ” says longtime agent and former Grove editor Ira Silverberg .
“ I ’d rather we have several soft years when investors get out and people who care about the values in the business reinvest . ”
But going back in time is n’t an option .
A hundred Bennett Cerfs would n’t save the current publishing model — not without a hundred Bob Millers puzzling out the way forward , unhampered by fear or complacency .
The kind of targeted , curated lists editors would love to publish will work even better in an electronic , niche - driven world , if only the innovators can get them there .
Those owners who are genuinely interested in the industry ’s long - term survival would do well to hire scrappy entrepreneurs at every level , people who think like underdogs .
It ’ll be rough going in the meantime ; some publishers will transform , some will muddle through , some will die .
And there will , no doubt , be a lot of editors for whom even this diminished era will look like the last great golden age , when some writers were paid in the millions , some of their books produced in the millions , and more than half of those books actually sold .
Book publishing is still a big - league business , and that ’s a hard thing to let go of .
“ There ’s something terrible , ” says an editor at a prestigious imprint , “ about admitting that you ’re not a mass medium . ”
Books Gone Bust
Lots and lots of books have n’t earned out their publishers ’ advances , but a hallowed few have attained the status of legendary flop , the kind of object lesson in the dangers of literary hyperventilation that too many presses still ignore .
Here are the most notorious of the past few years and what they ’ve cost their publishers — assuming that published accounts of their closely guarded ( embarrassing ) advances are accurate , that BookScan accounts for two - thirds of total sales , and that one book sold earns out about $ 4.50 of the advance .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In the span of just 11 days , the Bush administration and lawmakers , seeing ominous warnings in the credit markets , rushed to create legislation to prevent a potential economic meltdown .
Monday , the resulting $ 700 billion bailout package was defeated in a dramatic House vote .
The bill was designed to get financial institutions lending again by letting the U.S.
Treasury buy up their troubled assets , most of which are tied to the housing market crash .
But after much contentious debate , and the addition of several taxpayer protections , the package was rejected by the House in a vote that was 228 to 205 against .
The measure would have needed 218 votes for the House to pass .
The next steps were not immediately clear but supporters were scrambling to put it up for another vote .
" I 'm disappointed , " said House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , talking to reporters after the vote .
Noting that the Administration painted a dire picture of economic calamity if legislation did n't pass , Frank said , " I 'd like nothing better than to be proven wrong in the next few days .
I was persuaded that we have a serious crisis and we 're threatened with a shutdown of the credit system when the economy is already weakened . "
The credit markets had been seized up all day Monday , and after the vote , the Dow Jones Industrial Average started to plummet and ended the day down 778 points , the worst point drop ever .
On a percentage basis , though , the Dow drop was only about 7 % , far less than the 22 % slide on Black Monday in 1987 .
Here 's a quick breakdown of some of the bill 's key provisions :
Doling the money out :
The $ 700 billion would be disbursed in stages , with $ 250 billion made available immediately for the Treasury 's use .
Authority to use the money would expire on Dec. 31 , 2009 , unless Congress certifies a one - year extension .
Protecting taxpayers :
The ultimate cost to the taxpayer is not expected to be near the amount the Treasury invests in the program .
That 's because the government would buy assets that have underlying value .
If the Treasury pays fair market value - which investors have had a hard time determining - taxpayers stand a chance to break even or even make a profit if those assets throw off income or appreciate in value by the time the government sells them .
If it overpays for the assets , the government could be left with a net loss but would get something back on the open market for the assets when it eventually sells them .
If it ends up with a net loss , however , the bill says the president must propose legislation to recoup money from the financial industry if the rescue plan results in net losses to taxpayers five years after the plan is enacted .
In addition , Treasury would be allowed to take ownership stakes in participating companies .
Stemming foreclosures :
The bill calls for the government , as an owner of a large number of mortgage securities , to exert influence on loan servicers to modify more troubled loans .
In cases where the government buys troubled mortgage loans directly from banks , it can adjust them more easily .
Limiting executive pay : Curbs would be placed on the compensation of executives at companies that sell mortgage assets to the Treasury .
Among them , companies that participate will not be able to deduct the salary they pay to executives above $ 500,000 .
They also will not be allowed to write new contracts that allow for " golden parachutes " for their top 5 executives if they are fired or the company goes belly up .
But the executives ' current contracts , which may include golden parachutes , would still stand .
Overseeing the program :
The bill would establish two oversight boards .
The Financial Stability Oversight Board would be charged with ensuring the policies implemented protect taxpayers and are in the economic interests of the United States .
It will include the Federal Reserve chairman , the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman , the Federal Home Finance Agency director , the Housing and Urban Development secretary and the Treasury secretary .
A congressional oversight panel would be charged with reviewing the state of financial markets , the regulatory system and the Treasury 's use of its authority under the rescue plan .
Sitting on the panel would be 5 outside experts appointed by House and Senate leaders .
Insuring against losses : Treasury must establish an insurance program - with risk - based premiums paid by the industry - to guarantee companies ' troubled assets , including mortgage - backed securities , purchased before March 14 , 2008 .
The amount the Treasury would spend to cover losses minus company - paid premiums would come out of the $ 700 billion the Treasury is allowed to use for the rescue plan .
The Miles Todd Crash Video
Miles
Todd is by far the luckiest person I know .
While on our Carrizo Gorge ride on New Years Day 2004 .
Miles took quite a horrific fall .
We were on a bit of single track that bypasses one of the many training tunnels .
There are some spots of extreme exposure here and there and we stopped to evaluate one of them .
I decided not to try this one section .
The other two riders , Miles and Eric , both tried it .
Eric dabbed through the scary part and Miles did as well but lost his balance to the wrong side of the trail and went over the side .
The initial drop was about 10 feet near vertical followed by a series of rolling into and over rocks followed by more drops and air time .
All total Miles when about 150 down the cliff / ravine .
It was all over in a few very long seconds but it seemed like it went on forever .
Here is view of the cliff that Miles went over .
It is Steeper that it looks
Here is another angle of the cliff Miles is down at the bottom in this picture with his bike in the foreground .
Another shot of the same
Here are are some more shots of the Miles down in the ravine .
The Steeper Than It Looks effect applies here .
What is absolutely amazing is that Miles survived this fall .
I really thought I was watching Miles fall to his death .
Looking at the video I think , in addition to " Good Karma " being cashed in , he is lucky that he was went down the ravine shoulder over shoulder versus head over heels .
If this was a head over heels fall I can not see how he would have gotten out with serious spinal , head , neck , or collarbone .
injuries .
Not only did he manage to survive this he also climbed back out of that ravine up near where he went over .
Here is Mile 's account of that :
Any time they got close to the edge to try it ( climb down to help him ) they would dislodge rocks and send them my way .
I had to keep hollering at them to quit it .
They were also convinced that there was no way to get back straight up from where I stopped , and kept hollering at me to make my way around to a shale section .
What they did n't realize is that the dirt was at the angle of repose , and I had to step from weedy plant to tough weedy plant to prevent further slipping .
i wanted to get to the rocks as soon as I could .
What I did n't realize , though , is that the rocks were actually pretty loose , and the more I tried to pull myself up the more the would come adrift .
I really , really did n't want to fall back down , so I was super cautious for the most part .
A few moves needed to be fast , though , to get to the next foothold before the one bearing my weight gave way .
It sucked , and my SIDIs were n't especially helpful on the rock , either .
Here is Miles after he climbed out of the ravine .
Many folks asked Miles ( in the various MTB related forums ) why he was smiling after something like that .
Miles commented that the reason he is smiling in this picture is that he is just happy to be alive .
Here are a few shots the various carnage
i have a broken pinky metacarpal ( multiple fractures ) , and a severely sprained index finger on my right hand .
my left wrist is sprained , too , which explains the one - finger no -caps typing .
have random stitches here and there , and a whole lot of painful cuts and bruises .
am very grateful for my helmet an waterpack for saving my life and my spine .
the cuts on my nose and forehead were from my glasses , which broke big - time .
after i climbed 150 feet back up to the trail , i had to ride the ten miles or so back to the cars .
i'm quite nearsighted , so it made it hard to see the trail very well at all .
still , i am glad to have gotten back on the bike right away , because it kept my from stiffening like a board and also helped prevent me from going into shock .
Basically Miles is one lucky and tough dude .
Here is Mile 's tally of the injuries posted on alt .mountain - bike .
October 2005 Update - Miles was racing again a mere six weeks later .
He was not a particularly happy camper at that race as his wrist were bothering him quite a bit .
The wrista were the slowest to recover and even over a year later at the 2005 24hrs of Temecula his wrists were bothering him again .
Of course we were racing in the rigid single speed category - Come to think about my wrists were hurting in that race too ... Yep he has made a full recovery with a dozen or so interesting scars here and there .

BUJUMBURA
Francine Nijimbere relies entirely on her mother for basic things like bathing and eating .
Her husband cut off her arms up to the elbows in 2004 , for failing to give birth to a boy .
She was pregnant at the time and lost the baby due to her injuries , which included cuts on her stomach .
The man - a soldier - was arrested and later sentenced to life in prison but was recently released following a presidential pardon .
After her arms were cut off , Nijimbere left for Burundi's southern province of Makamba with her daughter , now four , where she lived with her mother .
She is now living in fear following her husband 's release and has sought refuge with ADDF , an association based in Bujumbura , dealing with the protection of women 's rights .
She spoke to IRIN on 22 February :
" In December [ 2007 ] , the president announced a pardon for all inmates suffering from incurable diseases .
I hear my husband was released on a false name ; how can a criminal like him be pardoned ?
The head of state pardoned inmates suffering from incurable diseases but my husband was not ill .
" I was married to his elder brother , who was a soldier .
He died in 2000 five months after our wedding .
However , I remained in the house as I waited for the end of the mourning period in order to return to my parents ' home .
My mother - in - law insisted I should not go to my parents since dowry had been paid .
She convinced my parents that I should marry her other son ; I was reluctant but my parents and in - laws reached an agreement .
" Right from the start , I never accepted him .
One night , he forced the door to my house and raped me .
I remained there ; where was I supposed to turn ?
" During our life together , he was just there ; he never helped me , he did not buy me any clothes , nothing .
Sometimes , I spent the nights out in the cold , other times he was good enough to let me in .
When he realised I was not getting pregnant soon enough , he threatened to marry another wife and even built a house for her .
He did not bring her home because I got pregnant then .
" When I delivered , he simply inquired about the sex of the baby .
When he heard I had given birth to a girl , he did not even bother to visit me at the hospital , and he did not pay the bill when I was discharged .
After three months , he came home from work and asked me : ' Do you consider yourself a mother after giving birth to girls ? '
He repeatedly told me I was worthless .
“ I become pregnant again , four months later .
This time he told me that if I gave birth to another girl , I would have to find somewhere to take her .
Later when he came home on leave , he was all sweet , telling me he was sorry if he had wronged me and that from then on things would be different , that he was a new man .
And I believed him .
I actually hoped he would change .
" Then one evening , I saw him sharpening a machete .
I did not know he was preparing to kill me .
After the evening meal , I went to sleep , leaving him with his mother and sister .
I was awakened by the machete blow on my arm .
" I cried and cried , I begged for pardon but he cut my second arm .
Nobody came to my rescue .
Neighbours were afraid of him because he was armed .
With cuts everywhere , I had a miscarriage .
My husband left me there bleeding , and fled .
He was later caught and imprisoned .
I was taken to hospital out of pity , no one expected me to survive .
" I stayed in a coma for six days in hospital .
When I was well enough , I went to live with my old mother .
These days I depend on her for everything .
If she is ill , I can not get anybody to feed me .
I cannot wash , I can not clothe myself .
" If neighbours take pity on me , they come and assist me .
I am more helpless than a newborn baby .
" Two weeks ago , my sister - in - law came to inform me that he has been released from prison .
I know it meant death for me , so I fled to Bujumbura .
I heard that while in prison , he had vowed he would ' finish the work ' if he ever came out .
I hear he said cutting my arms was not what he wanted in the first place .
" The only thing I want now is justice and assistance . "

Last week the first North American public bike - share program debuted in Washington D.C.
With 120 bikes at 10 self - service racks , SmartBike DC officially launched .
This week the Streetfilms team took it for a spin .
Here are some helpful facts about SmartBike DC :
To use this bike - share program you must become a member for an annual fee of $ 40 and have your membership card .
Locks & Helmets are not provided so bring your own .
Each trip has a 3 hour limit , but you can park at a station and take out another bike for no fee or penalty .

The way the program works is sign up online , get a card , it ’s $ 40 annual fee , take the card to any of the ten stations around town , a total of 120 bikes you can get , you go to the station with your card , swipe it and it indicates which bike to take .
Just go to the station with the number , pull it out and you ’re ready to ride .

Knowing what we know now , of course we would have launched it bigger .
But when we were initially thinking about this , we really were n’t sure how popular it would be .
The rising cost of gas and the ever increasing green attitude of everybody is now showing us that , yes , the city will support a broader program .

One thing I noticed on our very short trip over here is that these bikes are very nicely built .
They ’re solid .
You ’re not going to go 20 / 25 miles an hour on them , but very high level comfort while riding this .

Big Buck Bunny codenamed Peach is the second Open Source Animated Movie from the Blender Stable ..
Like its elder sibling Elephant 's Dream this movie has been created using Free and open Source software Blender ..
The Project Peach started in October 2007 and produced an amazing result know as Big Buck bunny which was released April 10 , 2008 ..
The premier of film was done at Amsterdam while the movie was available for online download from 30th May Onwards ..
Big Bunny emerged as a great animation film ..
Giving tough competition to Huge Animation makers like Dream works , Pixar and others ..
Without having backup of Multinational Companies like Intel .
Hp etc ... Blender Institute successfully released a beautiful and entertaining Movie ..
The company rendered the film using Network.com Sun Grid compute utility service , and hosts it .
Big Buck Bunny is a whole new concept which is similar to Dreamworks creation of making animal animated films .
Big Buck Bunny presents a new face of Blender , the ability to create spectacular 3d models , rendering of grass , hair , fur etc . .
The Movie starts with a beautiful soothing sound and chirping of birds ..
The earlier scenes depict the aesthetic Landscape ..
Which is followed by screening the Bunny lair and the Movie Title ..
The Movie can be divided into two parts in which different faces of Bunny has been presented ..
The calm and peaceful loving and outrageous bunny set to teach the rodents a lesson ..
As the film proceed we will notice a oversized rabbit known as Bunny or “ JC ” living in an aesthetic atmosphere surrounded with Plains , Birds , Trees and Butterflies ..
Bunny is calm and gentle by nature , who is fond of butteries and flowers ..
But the peace no longer prevailed as the plains was stunned by the arrival of 3 bullying obnoxious rodents , Frank , Rinky and Gamera . ..
These rodent amuse themselves by teasing helpless and poor creatures ..
The notorious rodents trio ends up by killing the Butterfly which was very close to Bunny ..
Soon after that they drove the Bunny out of the plains by redirecting their attacks over him ..
The intruders destructive and cruel nature outraged the Bunny and the bunny made up his mind to teach the trio a lesson ..
Keeping his gentle and loving nature aside The Bunny prepares himself for saga ..
The bunny superbly prepares the battlefield with loads of booby traps and weapon ..
He prepares himself to take the revenge of the death of his beloved Butterfly ..
The trio finally nail down to the perfectly crafted booby traps and the bunny get hold of the intruders thus successfully completing his revenge ..
After the Vengeance , Bunny again lived a happy life in the cozy paradise ..
Once again Peace prevailed on the halcyon world and Bunny lives happily with his animal friends ..
The movie has a fantastic and slapstick end :P
The Movie is a 100 % entertainer , though the plot and characterization of the movie is little clumsy in the beginning which is followed by trill and creativity later on ..
The film does have a unique satire .
There are scenes which provide you a small laughter .
The Movie did n't even bore you for a second though does n't comes with a strong Storyline like Madagascar and Over the Hedge ..
The Background Music is just too good and has been perfectly produced to suite the scenario at a particular instant .
The music support Dolby Digital surround sound for crystal clear and theatre like sound output ..
The Music is also available for Free download ..
The movie comes out a decent watch even at multiple times .. Blender and its Institute has shown tremendous improvements in every aspect whether its 3d Models or the animation ..
Big Buck Bunny features better 3d models and animation than the older Elephant 's Dream .
The detailing and animations are more fluid and expressive adding to the eye candy of the Movie ..
Big Buck Bunny now comes in a two DVD set or a Blue Ray DVD ..
Getting this DVD not only provide you a hard copy but also aids fund for future projects like upcoming Apricot game ..
The two - DVD set of the film includes the model , texture , animation and rendering files used to make the film as well as various quality renders and the PAL and NTSC versions of the finished film .
The Blue Ray version adds the more data by including Elephant 's Dream Movie in it ..
Big Buck Bunny is licensed under Creative Common Attribute 3.0 CC - By , which states that if own a hard of soft copy of the product you own the work ..
Being an Open Source Movie you can study , edit , redistribute , redesign the movie and share without disclosing the Source Code ..
The aim of the Project is not only to produce Films but to fund Blender Foundation for Future projects and establish Blender as a prominent 3d Modeling software , one of the strengths of Blender in creating life like creatures .
These adds in Big Buck Bunny , as do strong animated backgrounds and effects .
Big Buck Bunny stands upto audience expectations and further validate Blender as a professional animation creation suite .
In the End I would just say that Big Buck Bunny is a must watch movie and a great addon for PMP Owners ..
Though the storyline might not impress different audience , apart from this the movie is great in every respect .
I do n't have anything to complain as the team does n't have story expert and huge Studio Support .
The 10 minute movie wo n't take much time and will provide you excellent entertainment that rewards repeated viewing .
..
The movie is available in different resolution and formats like 480 p , 720 p and 1080 p resolutions and formats like Ogg Theora , mkv , avi and flv [ via You Tube ] , making it easy for every audience to experience the movie without resizing or converting ..

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The U.S. military is segregating violent Iraqi prisoners in wooden crates that in some cases are not much bigger than the prisoners .
The U.S. released three photos of crates used to hold detainees for up to 12 hours .
The military released photos of what it calls " segregation boxes " used in Iraq .
Three grainy black - and - white photos show the rudimentary structures of wood and mesh .
Some of the boxes are as small as 3 feet by 3 feet by 6 feet tall , according to military officials .
There was no image released of a box that size .
The average Iraqi male is 5 feet 6 inches tall , according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health .
That leaves little room for a prisoner to move once placed inside .
See how a man might fit in the crate »
The photos were made public after a blogger filed a Freedom of Information Act request in 2005 .
The military said the boxes are humane and are checked every 15 minutes .
It said detainees , who stand inside the boxes , are isolated for no more than 12 hours at a time .
" Someone in a segregation box is actually observed more than those anywhere else , " said Maj .
Neal Fisher , a spokesman for Task Force 134 , the Marine unit in charge of detainees .
" Their care and custody does not change simply because they are in segregation . "
Watch why the boxes raise human rights concerns »
A prisoner has never fallen ill or died because of being held in a segregation box , Fisher said .
Human rights advocates say little is known about how the military treats prisoners inside these boxes .
" There are concerns that they could be used in places where the detainees are enclosed in extremely hot conditions .
It is important to know whether or not detainees are provided with food , " said Jennifer Daskel of Human Rights Watch .
Detainees are given food and water while they are in the boxes , Fisher said .
The United States ' handling of detainees has been a concern since the abuses at Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib prison came to light .
Conditions have improved for the 20,000 detainees , but life is tough behind the wire .
Hundreds are still considered to be Al Qaeda loyalists .
The United States has been releasing prisoners in what Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell calls a " dramatic reduction " of the detainee population under U.S. control .
The United States has released 10,000 prisoners and hopes to release more .
In addition to thousands of Iraqis freed , 20 foreign fighters were returned to Egypt and Saudi Arabia .
" We are able to capture threats to the Iraqi government and the population , detain them , rehabilitate them and , 99 times out of 100 , release them , " Morrell said .
" We 've made remarkable progress there .
And I would just say it looks as though the glidepath is on continuing to reduce the population because of the success we 're having within these camps . "
CNN 's Adam Levine contributed to this report .

In 1865 Friedrich August Kekulé woke up from a strange dream : he imagined a snake forming a circle and biting its own tail .
Like many organic chemists of the time , Kekulé had been working feverishly to describe the true chemical structure of benzene , a problem that continually eluded understanding .
But Kekulé ’s dream of a snake swallowing its tail , so the story goes , helped him to accurately realize that benzene ’s structure formed a ring .
This insight paved the way for a new understanding of organic chemistry and earned Kekulé a title of nobility in Germany .

The first major experiment of the Maya Muon Group will bridge the disciplines of physics and archeology .
The particle detectors and related systems are designed specifically to explore ruins of a Maya pyramid in collaboration with colleagues at the UT Mesoamerican Archaeological Laboratory .
The Maya Muon Group will travel to La Milpa in northwest Belize to make discoveries about “ Structure 1 ” – a jungle - covered mound covering an unexplored Maya ruin .
A detector next to a Maya pyramid , for example , will see fewer particles coming from the direction of the structure than from other angles : a muon “ shadow . ”
And if a part of that pyramid is less dense than expected – containing an open space for , say , a royal burial – it will have less of a shadow .
Count enough muons that have passed through the pyramid over the course of several months , and they will form an image of its internal structure , just like light makes an image on film .
Then combine the images from three or four devices and a 3 - D reconstruction of the pyramid ’s guts will take shape .

Suspicion of the research team ran high – here was a group of Americans with high - tech electronics beneath one of Egypt 's most cherished monuments .
" We had flashing lights behind panels – it looked like a sci - fi thing from Star Trek , " says Lauren Yazolino , the engineer who designed the detector 's electronics .

The Fourth Plinth is in the north - west of Trafalgar Square , in central London .
Built in 1841 , it was originally intended for an equestrian statue but was empty for many years .
It is now the location for specially commissioned art works .
Three Nazi bunkers on a beach have been uncovered by violent storms off the Danish coast , providing a store of material for history buffs and military archaeologists .
The bunkers were found in practically the same condition as they were on the day the last Nazi soldiers left them , down to the tobacco in one trooper 's pipe and a half - finished bottle of schnapps .

Easily one of the most interesting things I 've read in quite a while is how a team of particle physicists from UT - Austin plan on using repurposed muon detectors to see inside Mayan archaeological ruins .
In the new issue of Archaeology , Samir S. Patel describes how " an almost featureless aluminum cylinder 5 feet in diameter " that spends its time " silently counting cosmic flotsam called muons " – " ghost particles " that ceaselessly rain down from space – will be installed in the jungles of Belize .
There , these machines will map the otherwise unexplored internal spaces of what the scientists call a " jungle - covered mound .
"
In other words , an ancient building that now appears simply to be part of the natural landscape – a constructed terrain – will be opened up to viewing for the first time since it was reclaimed by rain forest .
It 's non-invasive archaeology by way of deep space .
From the UT - Austin Maya Muon Group website : Pointing out that dense materials block more muons , Patel explains that a muon detector can actually detect rooms , spaces , and caves inside what seems to be solid : Referring to a muon detector already at work on the campus of UT - Austin , Patel writes : " The detector sees in every direction , so it also records muon shadows from the adjacent university buildings , and can even identify empty corridors .
Silently , with little tending , it takes a monumental x-ray of the world around it .
" " The resulting image , " he adds , " will be almost directly analogous to a medical CAT - scan .
" Install one of these things in New York City and see what you find : moving blurs of elevators and passing trucks amidst the strange , skeletal frameworks of skyscrapers that stand behind it all in a labyrinthine mesh .
Patel goes on to relate the surreal story of physicist Luis Alvarez , who used muons " to scan the inside of an ancient structure " – in this case , Khafre 's pyramid at Giza .
" Working with Egyptian scientists in the late 1960s , " we read , " he gained access to the Belzoni chamber , a humid vault deep under the pyramid .
" Like something out of an H.P. Lovecraft story , " Alvarez 's team set up a muon detector called a spark chamber , which included 30 tons of of iron sheeting , in the underground room .
" Foreign physicists building iron rooms beneath the pyramids !
To search for secret chambers based on the evidence of cosmic particles .
Indeed , we read : Alvarez 's iron room beneath the monolithic geometry of the pyramid – it's like a project by Lebbeus Woods , by way of Boullée – apparently took one year to perform its muon - detection work .
One day , then , the team took a long look at the data – wherein Yazolino " spotted an anomaly , a region of the pyramid that stopped fewer muons than expected , suggesting a void .
" There were still undiscovered rooms inside the structure .
Excitingly , when Roy Schwitters sets up his muon detector next to the tree - covered mounds of the Mayan city of La Milpa , he should get his results back in less than six months .
Sitting there like a strange battery , the detector 's ultra - long - term abstract photography of the jungle hillsides vaguely reminds me of the technically avant - garde photographic work of Aaron Rose Rose has pioneered all sorts of strange lenses and unexpected chemical developers as he takes long - term exposures of Manhattan .
New
York becomes less a city than a kind of impenetrable wall of built space .
Again , then , I 'm curious what it'd be like to install one of these muon detectors in Manhattan : the shivering hives of space it might detect , as delivery trucks shake the bridges and elevators move up and down inside distant high - rises .
What would someone like Aaron Rose be able to do with a muon detector ?
Are muon detectors the future of urban art photography ?
Perhaps it could even be a strange new piece of public art : a dozen muon detectors are installed in Union Square for six months .
They 're behind fences , and look sinister ; conspiratorialists leave long comments on architecture blogs suggesting that the muon detectors might not really be what they seem ...
But the resulting images , after six months of Manhattan muon detection , are turned over as a gift to the city ; they are hung in massive prints inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art , near the Egyptian wing , and Neil deGrasse Tyson delivers the keynote address .
Or perhaps a muon detector could be installed atop London 's fourth plinth
For six months , a shadowy muon detector will stand there , above the heads of passing tourists , detecting strange and labyrinthine hollows beneath government buildings where sprawling complexes from WWII spiral out of sight below ground .
Or perhaps muon detectors could even be installed along the European coast to discover things like the buried neolithic village of Skara Brae or those infamous Nazi bunkers " that lay hidden for more than 50 years " before being uncovered by the sea .
As thereported earlier this month : So what else might be down there under the soil and the sands ...?
I 'm imagining mobile teams of archaeologists sleeping in unnamed instant cities in the jungles and far deserts of the world , with storms swirling over their heads , running tests on gigantic black cylinders – muon detectors , all – that stand there like Kubrickian monoliths , recording invisible flashes of energy from space to find ancient burial sites and old buildings underground .
Perhaps all the forests and deserts of the world should be peppered with muon detectors – revealing archaeological anomalies and unexpected spaces in the ground all around us .
Architecture students could be involved : installing muon detectors outside Dubai high - rises and then competing to see who can most accurately interpret the floorplan data .
Till one day , ten years from now , an astronaut crazed with emotional loneliness , riding through space with his muon detector , begins misinterpreting all of the data .
He concludes – in a live radio transmission broadcast home to stunned mission control supervisors – that his space station– undiscovered rooms – that keep popping up somehow in the shadows ... More to the point , meanwhile , you can read a few more things about Roy Schwitters over at MSNBC – and , of course , at the UT - Austin Maya Muon Group homepage .
This explains a lot .
The Dunning - Kruger effect describes the phenomenon whereby people who do n’t know anything about something think they know more than those who do .
The peculiar part is that those who lack the expertise are often far more confident and forceful when they discuss the issue than those who are knowledgeable .
This is because those who are knowledgeable know enough to know what they do n’t know , whereas the pseudo - experts do not .
The effect ends up being that the idiots with only partial knowledge come off as forceful and confident , while those who are more educated end up hesitating and appearing less versed on the topic .
Here are some main findings :
Incompetent individuals tend to overestimate their own level of skill .
Incompetent individuals fail to recognize genuine skill in others .
Incompetent individuals fail to recognize the extremity of their inadequacy .
If they can be trained to substantially improve their own skill level , these individuals can recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill .
So the question for all of us is simple : how often have we been this guy ?
How many people do we know who are still this guy ?
And how do we avoid being this guy in the future ?
It ’s definitely an issue for someone like me since my whole thing is quickly building ( and sharing with others ) models for understanding complex topics .
It ’s also good info to have when observing two people in a debate .
Is the “ weaker ” person really less knowledgeable , or is he simply less confident because he ’s careful and humble ?

Beginning August 9th , the late George Orwell ’s diary will be published as a blog , each entry appearing 70 years to the day after the British writer first penned it .
Orwell ( 1903 - 1950 ) is best known for the classics 1984 and Animal Farm , although he was also a fiery essayist .
The online publication of his diary is a project of the Orwell Prize , a British award for political writing .
Orwell kept his diary from 1938 to 1942 .
Gearing up for August , the Orwell Prize folks hint at what the entries contain :
What impression of Orwell will emerge ?
From his domestic diaries ( which start on 9th August ) , it may be a largely unknown Orwell , whose great curiosity is focused on plants , animals , woodwork , and — above all — how many eggs his chickens have laid .
From his political diaries ( from 7th September ) , it may be the Orwell whose political observations and critical thinking have enthralled and inspired generations .
. . .
Whether writing about the Spanish Civil War or sloe gin , geraniums or Germany , Orwell ’s perceptive eye and rebellion against the ‘ gramophone mind ’ he so despised are obvious .

This week , McCain was out chillin’ with Papa Bush in Maine and slagging on Obama , who is currently on tour in Europe and the Middle East :
The Arizona senator disparaged Obama as “ someone who has no military experience whatsoever . ”
“ When you win wars , troops come home , ” McCain said .
“ He ’s been completely wrong on the issue . … I have been steadfast in my position . ”
So , uh , John …
If the troops come home when you win wars , how did your skinny ass make it home from Vietnam ?

EXCLUSIVE :
Political strategist Karl Rove , freed of his White House role , is encouraging major Republican donors to give their money to organizations that operate independently of the Republican Party and are poised to spend upwards of $ 100 million trying to elect conservatives this fall .
Mr. Rove , the architect of President Bush ’s election victories , has been telling Republican benefactors across the country that giving to official Republican Party fundraising committees will not be enough this year , according to people familiar with his pitch over the past few months .
They said Mr. Rove has regularly expressed concern that Democrat - leaning organizations such as MoveOn.org and labor unions could swamp the Republican Party ’s money machine and overwhelm the presidential campaign of Sen.
John McCain , Arizona Republican .
To counter that wave , Mr. Rove has been asking elite Republican fundraisers to pour their millions of dollars into nonparty groups like Freedom ’s Watch , which is gearing up to spend tens of millions of dollars to help elect conservatives - primarily Republicans - to Congress and the White House .
Freedom ’s Watch has purchased advertisements that help Republican candidates by emphasizing issues rather than the candidates and do so without coordinating with the Republican Party .
Independent groups such as Freedom ’s Watch on the right and MoveOn.org Political Action on the left will fuel much of the on-air and on - the - ground skirmishing this fall between Democratic and Republican candidates .
Well - heeled donors often prefer using these organizations as conduits for their contributions because they often can remain anonymous and because the groups ’ expenditures are not disclosed until after they are made , if at all .
Mr. Rove declined to comment about his discussions with Republican fundraisers .
But his spokesman , Mark Corallo , acknowledged that Mr. Rove , when asked , has encouraged people to fill the coffers of groups that in effect act as adjuncts to the Republican Party .
The message , Mr. Corallo said , was : “ Conservatives , when interested , ought to contribute generously to groups that advocate their goals . ”
Mr. Rove has pushed Freedom ’s Watch in particular , said several people who have heard him make the case .
He has told donors that he trusts the two longtime Republican operatives running the organization .
One is Executive Vice President Carl Forti , who is the former political director of the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney and the former communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
The other is Executive Vice President Tony Feather , who was political director for Mr. Bush ’s 2000 presidential campaign and is a founding partner in FLS - DCI , a consulting firm for corporations and political candidates .
Mr. Rove is not paid by Freedom ’s Watch , but nonetheless has spoken highly of its efforts when asked by Republican moneymen where they should put their contributions this fall , said people close to the former White House strategist .
The result has been an uptick in contributions to Freedom ’s Watch .
“ It has raised our profile , and his confidence in the operation has helped legitimize it in the minds of potential donors , ” a Freedom ’s Watch official said .
The group spent $ 17 million last year , according to its latest public disclosure , and has spent about $ 20 million in total , a spokesman said .
Freedom ’s Watch has begun to concern some Democrats , with its large bankroll and plan to play in multiple markets with hard - hitting attacks .
Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , chairman of the House Democrats ’ fundraising committee , accused Republicans of having “ essentially contracted out to Freedom ’s Watch ” to do their fundraising and attack ads .
“ There are these shadowy groups out there who can spend an unlimited amount of unaccountable money , ” Mr. Van Hollen said Thursday in an interview with The Washington Times .
“ That is what ‘ Freedom ’s Watch ’ is geared up to do . ”
Mr. Rove also has recommended that donors with strong pro-life positions on abortion give money to the National Right to Life Committee .
The committee declined to comment .
Republicans have been at a disadvantage on the money front through much of this election cycle .
Democratic candidates for president , the House and the Senate have outraised their Republican counterparts .
The Democratic re-election committee in the House has raised $ 109 million , $ 29 million more than the Republican committee .
In the Senate , the Democratic committee has collected $ 93 million compared with $ 59 million by its Republican counterpart .
Only at the national committee level do Republicans top Democrats .
The Republican National Committee has raised $ 457 million compared with $ 417 million by the Democratic National Committee , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama is so confident that the trend will continue and that he will bring in large amounts of money that he has declined to take public funding for his general election bid .
Mr. McCain , on the other hand , will accept and stick to the $ 84 million that the federal government is offering .
Mr. Obama ’s supporters expect that he will raise and spend much more than $ 84 million this fall .
His own funds will be supplemented by several efforts that will total hundreds of millions of dollars .
For example , the AFL - CIO has approved a political budget of $ 53 million and its affiliated unions are expected to spend an additional $ 200 million on political activities .
The National Education Association probably will spend more than $ 40 million and the Service Employees International Union has designated $ 100 million .
MoveOn.org also will spend substantial sums , conservatively estimated at more than $ 30 million .
Last week its political arm launched a $ 2.5 million fundraising effort to bankroll a drive to register 500,000 voters .
Major corporations also will spend tens of millions of dollars to counter labor unions , especially over the question of secret ballots in union certification elections .
Companies are worried that if secret ballots are eliminated , their workers will be unionized with greater ease .
Independent groups often do not advocate the election of specific candidates , but buy commercials or send out fliers that support policy positions .
The effect of the effort is often the same because candidates are named in the advertisements and are closely associated with the issues mentioned .

Man Heats 4,000 Sq. Ft Home for $ 2.50 Per Day Using Passive Solar Technology
August 28th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Why spend lots of money heating your house when nature can do it for you ?
Upstate New York resident John Kosmer has taken passive solar to a new level in his home , which only costs $ 2.50 a day to heat .
That ’s less than $ 1,000 a year of heating expenses in an area of the country that gets mauled with snow multiple times a year .
Kosmer worked with Building With Integrity and Adirondack Alternative Energy to construct his passive solar house .
Four - inch thick rigid polyurethane is installed on the exterior walls and under the roof , while pre-finished concrete siding covers the exterior of the home .
But the real key to Kosmer ’s low heating costs is his windows .
53 vinyl - framed Simonton windows are strategically placed throughout the house , letting sunlight into the white interior of the structure .
A wood stove also rises multiple stories into the atrium , where heated air is carried up into grilles in the attic ductwork .
The air is then redistributed throughout the house , which stays at a temperature of 68 degrees .
A project of this magnitude may be out of your reach if you live in a 100 year - old poorly - insulated home , but it ’s worth considering if you ’re on the hunt for a new house .

I want to help you identify and remove any obstacle that keeps you from making things that you love .
And then I want to help you figure out how to make those things even better .
That 's pretty much it .
R.I.P. , Productivity Pr0n
Friends , I 'm done with " productivity " as a personal fetish or hobby .
There are countless sites that are all too happy to vend stroke material for your joyless addiction to puns about procrastination and systems for generating more taxonomically satisfying meta - work .
But , presently , you wo n't find so much of that here .
Except inasmuch as it can help move aside barriers to finishing the projects that you claim matter to you , " productivity " is often a sprawling ghetto of well - marketed nonsense for people who really just need a ritalin and a hug .
So , for myself , random tips and lists that are n't anchored to solving a real - world problem for a smart but flawed adult with a mind are dead to me .
Pour a forty on 'em .
From now on , I 'm going to talk about how people make stuff .
Books , art , code , buildings , ballets , companies , furniture , whimsical hats , songs , or what have you .
But understand : this is n't just for fancy people and fine arts majors .
You 're already " creative "
If the work that really matters to you involves understanding a relationship between a handful of seemingly unrelated things and then figuring out the best way to portray , magnify , or resolve those relationships , then you 're already doing creative work .
Any time you make a connection between two or more axes that had n't occurred to you 10 minutes ago , yes , you 've done something creative .
Seriously .
This does not require your wearing a beret .
But , then -- and this is really important -- if you want to actually make something out of all that insight , and if you have the will and desire to polish and improve the execution of all the things you produce , then we 'll have a lot to talk about .
But , if you want a " site about GTD , " " a blog about index cards , " or a wide - mouthed sluice of recycled links to lists of geegaws that will keep you momentarily distracted from how sad you are , then you 're wasting both of our time here .
So , go .
You 're stinking up the joint .
This is now a site for people who want to finish things that they care about -- but who still occasionally need help , inspiration , and the courage to push all the bullshit off their work table .
This is about clearing that space every day , and then using it to do cool stuff that makes you proud .
So .
What , then ?
Does this mean that Inbox Zero , Time and Attention Management , or advice on reducing noise will be going away from 43 Folders ?
No. Freaking .
Way .
If I may say , that 's all great stuff , and you 're still going to need it if the mind is willing but the attention is occasionally weak ( or under attack ) .
No , if anything , you 'll be seeing more articles targeted at how to do this stuff well so you can get back into the studio faster .
You 're also going to see more material about the habits and patterns that have been demonstrated to work for makers who have had long - lived careers in the creative world .
In itself , this is the direction I 'm most fascinated with right now , and it 's likely one I 'll be returning to often in the coming months :
How do you fire your muse and learn to rely solely on working your ass off every day ?
As I 'm learning , it definitely can be done , but there 's no secret or silver bullet ; it 's just work , work , work , combined with a personal commitment to editing and improvement that produces the best results of which you 're capable as often as possible .
It 's the kind of productivity that 's about applying your time to frequent , high - quality " releases " -- not laying in a hammock while people in Bangalore update your website .
But , what about all the cool notebooks , links to lists of " GTD resources , " and ponderously detailed tutorials on how to label a file folder ?
Yeah .
From now on , maybe do n't expect a lot of that here .
Unless I feel it has a direct link to helping you do things .
Here ’s the thing A notebook is basically the creative equivalent of the NFL jersey you picked up at Macy ’s ; unless you fill it with a lot of hard work and sacrifices , you ’re just a dilettante with poor spending patterns .
An aspiring something .
A fan of the game .
An existential cosplayer .
And , that ’s not what I want to help you to be .
Even if you really love Moleskines or the Raiders , God love ‘em .
So , we 're going to talk about what goes in the notebook ; not the fact that it 's pretty and has a little bookmark .
Then I want you to leave here .
That 's the basic idea .
We 'll see what evolves .
And , there 's these other things
I 'm also working on some other stuff for the site that I hope will please more people than it annoys .
In any case , they 're each important to me .
Here 's the shape of the map .
1. Less noise in general
Less chrome , less noise , less blah - blah , and less unnecessary anything .
On a given day in the future , you may notice this as fewer ads , lower ( but higher - quality ) post volume , and an ongoing attempt to make the site fast and easy to use .
I 'm working on this .
With money and people and new relationships and so on .
More as it develops and becomes worth highlighting .
2. Walking a truer productivity walk
It 's important to me that we both try to stay focused on the real goal : which is being done with a project that you care about .
It 's not about hanging out , smoking cloves , and chatting about " Différance " late into the Paris nights .
I want you to visit here , get what you need , then get the hell back to work .
So , if you occasionally notice me smiling , and putting a firm but gentle hand between your shoulder blades as we begin a walk toward the door , it 's because that 's closer to where your work is .
It 's not here , it 's not in your inbox , and , with all due respect , it 's probably not in a list of 5,000 links .
Like I said recently , if you 've crossed the river , you should quit carrying the boat .
And while I very much hope and desire that you make 43 Folders your first stop when you need to feel inspired and confident about making decisions that support your best work , I truly do not want you to waste time here .
That would make me sad .
So , yes , please read this page : How to Use 43 Folders .
It 's a new page that provides basic guidance on finding fast answers , and ultimately , on helping you figure out why you 're here .
I imagine the how - to will evolve as the site evolves , so I would be honored if you would trust me enough to bookmark that page , then consider making it the place where you begin your visits here .
With any luck , it can also frequently be the page where your visits quickly end here .
And , although I have to imagine it will vex the nice people who are kind enough to sell ads for my site : that 's okay by me .
3 . Mostly firewalled self - promotion
While it's my site and will always be used to promote my ideas and my business in the way that I think is most appropriate , I also do n't want it to turn into a glorified billboard for me -- especially to the exclusion of the writing and ideas that make it theoretically useful .
And , especially in the articles and content well .
That space is getting more sacrosanct .
With much sadness , I 've recently watched some of my most beloved and respected friends ' blogs degrade into a depressing slurry of pimping , random affiliate linking , paid ( or pseudo - paid ) placement , idiotic traffic boosters , and wholesale ego boosting about every bakesale , state fair , or mall opening that its authors plan to chopper into .
Here , except for The Monthly Pimp , I want the content well to stay clean , focused , and worthy of your trust and my credibility .
Ads go in the ad zones , and anybody can buy one to sell pretty much anything .
But it does n't buy placement in a 43 Folders post , and it should n't buy my association or endorsement elsewhere .
Maybe for a truly paid , public endorsement deal ; but not for a banner ad buy .
That 's just weird .
Plus I do n't own a chicken suit .
This does n't mean that I wo n't link to my own work and my other sites and projects whenever I think it 's appropriate .
It also does n't mean I 'll stop linking to Amazon for products or A2 for web hosting when it 's germane to what I have to say .
But , I do already have a site that 's purely self - promotional .
And that 's where I 'd like most of that that stuff to live now .
OT : If you 're a blogger I know and love , maybe at least consider joining me in your own overdue Superfund cleanup to the extent that you 're comfortable and able .
Too much money can easily buy you a very dumb audience and an astoundingly influential cohort of ex-readers .
4 . No more fake " conversations "
I 've loved so many of the comments and forum posts on 43 Folders .
But , for an endless number of reasons that you 've probably seen for yourself across the web , the quality and care of visitor contributions everywhere has hit what I truly hope is rock bottom .
Stupid , venal , ignorant , self - linking comments from people who could n't be troubled to actually read the article .
Angry forum posts full of personal attacks , giant avatars of Manga characters , and 4 - vertical - inch signatures about which Golden Girl you are .
Nonsense tagging , meta - commenting , ass - kissing , trolling , and ... oooo !... video responses .... neato !
Please .
It 's nuts and it 's pointless and it's really cynical on the part of almost every publisher that allows that crap to go on .
" Conversation , " like " friend , " is a word that has a meaning to human beings with faces and brains .
I will not abuse it as code for the surplus page views produced by someone with an afternoon to kill .
5 . This is my site .
There are many like it , but this one is mine
43 Folders is now , once again , about what I have to say about things , and I want that to be the sole reason that the idea of a visit here either attracts or repels you .
Yes , there will still be occasional guest posts , open threads , and of course , I 'll be linking to and quoting widely from the work of others .
But I 'm taking a cue from John , Andy , Jason , and anybody else who wants to own every pixel of their site .
I 'm buying back my own stock , even if it incurs a short - term writedown .
If you have comments about what I say here , post about it on your own blog .
That 's what it 's there for , and it's a place where owning your words will have gravity and , in most cases , will be associated with the name of a real person who does n't pinch loaves on his own couch .
And , then , there 's everything else
Over the next year , I 'm going to do lots more speaking , more of my own independent video and podcast projects , and , yes , in all likelihood , I 'll finish one book and make progress toward a second .
N.B . In the case of that last thing , it 's likely to be the sole public remark I 'll have to share until I have a release date , an Amazon page , and a sample chapter for you to download .
But , that 's getting ahead of myself .
We 'll see what happens .
Do wish me luck .
So , " hi . " Again .
I want you to know that I 'm back .
I 'm here .
And I 'm thinking very much about how 43 Folders can become a focused resource for people who do work that they love and make things that matter to them -- but who just want to do it better and with less bullshit and existential overhead on every conceivable front .
And , if it 's not clear , I really want that same lack of bullshit and surplus of polish to be evident in my own work as well .
It 's the goal , anyhow .
We 'll see how I do .
As ever , it 's going to be mostly letters to myself .
But , the material is out there , and as much as my schedule for other work and the time I set aside for my family and friends will allow , I want this site to be really consistently good .
And , where it's able , I 'd love for 43 Folders to help you make your stuff even better .
So , that 's it for the throat - clearing and metatalk for now .
Thanks for hearing me out , and I hope you 'll stop by sometimes if you think 43 Folders can help you make something cool today .
Now : back to work .
Fans of Douglas Adams ' Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy are likely to react strongly to the announcement that Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer has been given the green light to write a sixth book in the series - 16 years after the release of Mostly Harmless .
According to the BBC , the project - entitled And Another Thing ... , and slated for publication in October 2009 - has the " full support " of Adams ' widow Jane Belson .
She enthused : " I am delighted that Eoin Colfer has agreed to continue the Hitchhiker series .
I love his books and could not think of a better person to transport Arthur , Zaphod and Marvin to pastures new . "
Colfer , 43 , admitted : " My first reaction was semi-outrage that anyone should be allowed to tamper with this incredible series .
But on reflection I realised that this is a wonderful opportunity to work with characters I have loved since childhood and give them something of my own voice while holding on to the spirit of Douglas Adams . "
He added : " I feel more pressure to perform now than I ever have with my own books , and that is why I am bloody determined that this will be the best thing I have ever written . "
Douglas Adams died in 2001 at the age of 49 , having sold around 16 million copies worldwide of his legendary Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy series . ®
We are called daily to engage in the fight against curiosity as we explore ever more deeply the one question that truly matters : “ Who do you say that I am ? ” Continue Reading »
There was a time when potentates travelling the world would shoot an animal – a tiger or a lion perhaps – as an expression of diplomatic friendship towards their hosts .
The modern equivalent is to trade in endangered animals .
Playing this deeply unattractive game , Gordon Brown will shortly travel to Beijing where , as part of a determined schmooze - the - Chinese offensive , he is expected to finalise a deal to bring two giant pandas to Edinburgh zoo .
The negotiations have been going on for some months .
The Scottish Royal Zoological Society offered the Chinese government £ 2 m for a 10 - year loan of the animals .
Supporting the bid , the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond wrote to the Chinese foreign minister , citing the " warm relationship " between their two countries .
He urged David Miliband to lobby for the loan , arguing that " this is primarily a commercial transaction which the Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed to underwrite " .
Prince Andrew and Princess
Anne have joined the campaign .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Now that it appears to have succeeded , the zoo authorities have said flying the two giant pandas to Scotland was " part of an international breeding and research programme " .
Salmond is right .
This is primarily a commercial transaction – and a squalid one at that .
There is nothing in the Scottish air to encourage pandas , notoriously hopeless in these matters , to mate .
The deal is simple : Britain 's political leaders and Royal Family have been working tirelessly to hire a couple of sensitive , endangered animals as prize money - making exhibits for Edinburgh Zoo .
It is doubtful whether Brown , Miliband , Salmond or Prince Andrew will think too deeply about the ethical dimension but , if they do , they should look to reports from Munster Zoo in Germany , from where photographs of a female lowland gorilla holding the body of her three - month old baby were broadcast around the world .
Here was a perfect animal photo - op .
There have been gurgling editorials and much sentimental speculation of what an animal can or cannot feel .
It is all rather obscene .
Mankind keeps wild animals in captivity for its own entertainment .
The animals suffer stress , terror , boredom and illness under deeply unnatural conditions .
The PR experts working for the zoo business give them names and nurture the illusion that they are cute yet wild versions of ourselves .
The Munster Zoo spokesman , for example , was quoted as saying " we cannot keep on taking away children from a mother " .
When , almost always as a result of this smiling barbarism , something goes wrong – a mother rejects or kills its young , for example – we come over all tearful about the cruelties of nature .
It is time to recognise that the cruelty is ours .
It is obviously true that young animals die in the wild , but no one who has visited a zoo could deny that certain species , particularly the higher primates , suffer profoundly in captivity .
Exploiting these luckless victims of human arrogance by presenting dysfunctional animal behaviour as if it were some kind of soap opera compounds the immorality .
The idea that children are educated by gawping at miserable wild animals is an insult to the intelligence .
If anything , all they learn is that it is fine to treat wild animals as a show .
The age of the zoo is over .
Sensible families will keep their children away from the two luckless giant pandas who will soon be making Edinburgh their miserable home .
This is no laughing matter ...
It is a good time to be a sneerer on the sidelines of life .
Polls may suggest that , when it comes to trustworthiness , journalists rank below estate agents and politicians but there is a certain kind who seems to buck the trend : the male , middle - aged , regular - guy scoffer .
A semi-jokey petition on the Downing Street website , expressing support for the celebrity motoring fan Jeremy Clarkson as Prime Minister , was signed by 55,000 people – enough , it appears , for the Government to film a lumberingly humourous response for YouTube .
In America , the status of Jon Stewart , the host of the satirical TV show The Daily News , is such that the New York Times has run a feature asking whether he is now the most trusted man in America .
The smirking anchorman is politically the polar opposite of Clarkson , but there are similarities between their public personas .
Both are smooth , in a studiously blokeish way , flirt with the camera , and specialise in skirting over important issues in a mugging , funny - but - serious manner .
And both present a controversial face while retaining their popularity .
A State Department spokesman has admitted that he watches Jon Stewart 's show , essentially comedy , because " it 's the only way to find out what 's really going on " .
It is now an honour for politicians to be invited to appear .
Something odd is going on when the balance of power between those who do and those who look on – while making jokes – becomes so weirdly and dangerously skewed .
Jane Austen and the London Olympics
As anxiety grows as to how Britain will best present itself at the ceremony to the London Olympics in four years , a useful tip has been offered by those in control of the country 's TV networks .
There should be wigs and bonnets , carriages and perhaps some vintage motor cars , shire horses and sheepdogs .
Rosy - cheeked children with old - fashioned haircuts , dressed in flannel shorts and aertex shirts , running about and perhaps carrying wicker picnic baskets .
At a time of present and future uncertainty , the safest place to find entertainment and fun , our broadcasters appear to believe , is in the past .
Enid Blyton has just been voted the country 's best - loved author .
Now , adding to the mood of nostalgia and general yearning for old certainties , the BBC and ITV have unveiled autumn schedules creaking with dramatisations of – altogether now – Jane Austen , Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy .

A terrorist driving a black BMW ran his car into a crowd of pedestrians at a busy intersection in central Jerusalem near the Old City on Monday evening .
Op - Ed
Why were we surprised ?
Moshe Elad Defense officials must be better prepared for unconventional terror scenarios
Why were we surprised ?
At least 17 people were confirmed wounded at Zahal Square , most in light - to - moderate condition .
Magen David Adom paramedics evacuated those wounded to the Hadassah Ein Karem and Shaare Zedek hospitals for treatment .
Most of those wounded are reportedly soldiers belonging to the Artillery Corps who were on a ' Selichot Tour ' in Jerusalem .
Selichot are Jewish penitential prayers said during the High Holidays .
The terrorist , a Palestinian from east Jerusalem , was shot dead by an IDF officer holding the rank of lieutenant who was with the soldiers .
A female civilian sustained moderate - to - serious wounds .
Wounded soldier evacuated to hospital ( Photo : Gil Yohanan )
Rescue services rushed to the scene , and police have blocked traffic in the area .
Sappers examined the terrorist 's body , fearing he may have been wearing a bomb belt .
The terrorist reportedly began his rampage on Shivtei Yisrael Street .
Security authorities say they have been able to ascertain the identity of the terrorist , it has not yet been released for publication .
" The terrorist was in a private car , he rammed straight into a group of people touring the area , " said first
responded Haim Weingreten , a ZAKA volunteer .
Police say had no alerts
Jerusalem District Commander Aharon Franco said that police officials did not have a specific warning regarding an intention to carry out an attack in Jerusalem .
" This attack could have taken place anywhere , " he said .
" The police are deployed in force in order to prevent such incidents .
Earlier this summer , Jerusalem was the scene of two similar attacks .
In the first attack , three people were murdered after an east Jerusalem terrorist went on a rampage with his bulldozer , targeting passersby in central Jerusalem .
More than 30 people sustained wounds in the attack .
Three weeks later , a terrorist who went on a similar rampage was shot to death early into his attack .
As a result , he was unable to murder anyone , but 18 people were wounded in the attack .
The terrorist who perpetrated the second rampage was also from east Jerusalem .
Free Is n't Enough
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 25 , 2008
This post by Dan Kusnetzky highlights one of the things that open source and free software projects have to contend with ( not to mention the companies that promote them ) :
Free is n't enough to carry the day .
A key challenge faced by any open source project is getting mindshare .
It ’s a truism that if decision makers do n’t know about a product , they wo n’t consider it .
If they do n’t consider it , they ’ll select other approaches .
There are too many people shouting out their own Xen messages .
Comprehension appears to be lost in all of the noise .
Qumranet and , now , Red Hat are tooting the KVM horn .
If we look at VMware or Microsoft , there is only one company , a company with deep pockets , talking about their own technology .
Better funded ( from a marketing perspective ) competitors , such as VMware and Microsoft , seem to get the headlines .
This can be directly associated with mindshare .
I , for example , get messages and calls from the folks at VMware and Microsoft on some topic or another every week .
Citrix and Virtual Iron speak with me about once every couple of months .
Red Hat , Sun and SUSE speak with me about once every couple of quarters .
Oracle speaks with me once in a blue moon .
If that level of communication is similar to that received by other analysts , journalists and consultants , the Xen message does n’t stay on the radar screen for long before it is drowned out by everything else happening in the industry .
Even though it might be nice to think that journalists ( and bloggers , and dual - duty freelancers who wear both hats interchangeably ... ) are out there doing tons of research to bring the right information to IT readers -- guess what ?
Most writers are struggling to hit deadlines , make up for incessant staff cuts as publications trim budgets , and generally ride the tide of news in their various beats .
Reporters only have so many hours in the day , which is why the PR thing is so successful .
A writer can spend cycles trolling around to find trends and things that are n't being reported on ( and the good ones do , when they can ) or they can cover the stories that are right in front of them .
There 's also the small matter of groupthink -- everybody covers the same stories , because each publication wants to be sure to cover the " important " stories .
Again , this leaves little room to be outside the box .
The upshot of this is this :
If open source projects and companies want to succeed , ultimately , they have to play the same game as the " big guys , " which means going toe - to - toe with PR and marketing .
Whether it's paid PR pros taking the lead , or contributors wearing the PR hat , someone has to speak for the FOSS projects or they 'll be ignored .
Free is n't enough .

Advertisement Somali pirates on board a hijacked ship are reported to have been involved in a shoot - out over what to do with the vessel 's cargo of tanks and weapons .
An East African maritime group , which is monitoring the situation , told the BBC that three men were shot but the extent of their injuries was unclear .
Pirates seized the Ukrainian ship last week , demanding a $ 20 m ( £ 11 m ) ransom .
They dismissed the claim of infighting as " cheap propaganda " , in a phone call to the BBC Somali Service .
" There has been no exchange of fire at all .
We 're in good shape , " spokesman Sugule Ali told the BBC .
We are asking the international community and the negotiators around that area to pull back - so they cool off
Andrew Mwangura
East African Seafarers ' Association
Life in Somalia 's pirate town " This is cheap propaganda being spread by people not aware of our situation . "
He added that the pirates were participating in dialogue , without going into detail .
" I am optimistic this can be resolved peacefully , " he said .
In a separate development , the state - owned Malaysian shipping firm , MISC Berhad , said two of its ships had been recovered after it paid a ransom to pirates .
A spokesman said paying ransoms was against company policy , but had been necessary to obtain the release of its crew .
Back pedalling
The hijacked Ukrainian ship , the Faina , is surrounded by international warships determined to stop its military cargo from falling into the wrong hands .
Somalia 's pirates face battles at sea Somalia : Special report
The US navy says its destroyers and cruisers are within 10 nautical miles ( about 18 km ) of the ship .
Andrew Mwangura of the East African Seafarers ' Association - who has been in contact with the vessel - told the BBC that two rival clans had been fighting over tactics .
He said radicals on board wanted to keep the shipment of 33 T - 72 tanks and other weapons in Somalia while the moderates wanted " to back - pedal on the ransom issue " .
Mr Mwangura said his main concern was the safety of the crew , and that the military activity in the area had unnerved the hijackers .
" We are asking the international community and the negotiators around that area to pull back - so they cool off , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
Earlier , the pirates said they would rather fight than surrender .
" I warn any military operation that , if we are attacked , we will defend ourselves until the last one of us dies , " one of the hijackers told the BBC .
One of the ship 's 21 crew is reported to have died from an illness on board .
' Concern '
The Faina is currently moored off Somalia 's coast close to the town of Hoboyo .
There have been conflicting reports of where the Faina and its cargo were destined .
Kenya has insisted that the shipment was destined for its military .
But other sources , including a US navy spokesman , said it was bound for the autonomous government of South Sudan , in possible contravention of a peace accord .
Somalia has been without a functioning central government for 17 years and has suffered continual civil strife , with rival armed clans and groups fighting for control .
The waters off its coast are considered to be some of the world 's most dangerous - pirates have hijacked nearly 30 ships this year and attacked many more .
Even ships carrying food aid are often targeted , hampering the delivery of humanitarian supplies to the estimated three million Somalis in need of assistance .
A spokesman for the UN's World Food Programme said it supplies 90 % of aid to Somalia by sea but that hijackings were increasing despite the number of naval forces patrolling the shipping lanes .

What are these ?
By Uzi Nissan - founder and president , Nissan Computer Corp .
BACKGROUND
My name is Uzi Nissan .
I was born in Jerusalem - Israel .
My father 's last name was Nissan , his father 's last name was Nissan , and so on .
Nissan is a biblical term identifying the seventh month in the Hebrew calendar .
The term Nissan also is Arabic for the month of April .

I came to the US in 1976 , and have used my surname for years to identify a number of business enterprises .
The first was " Nissan Foreign Car " in 1980 .
When I operated this business , I serviced different makes and models of foreign cars , including cars manufactured by Nissan Motor , back then known as " DATSUN " .
Contrary to the allegations by Nissan Motor , I did not choose to use my last name " Nissan " for my business in 1980 because of their name .
At that time , they and their automobiles were known as " DATSUN " and were not known as " Nissan " .

In December 1987 , I started an import / export business known as " Nissan International "
At that time , Nissan Motor was not well known as Nissan , but primarily as " DATSUN " .
As with the earlier business , I chose to use Nissan in my business name because it was my last name .

On May 14 , 1991 , " Nissan Computer Corp " was incorporated in the state of North Carolina .
I was then , and still am , the company President .
I have used Nissan as part of my trade name in connection with the sale of computer hardware , computer maintenance , networking , computer training and other consulting services related to computers .
On June 4 , 1994 , I registered the domain name " nissan.com " and created a web site to promote computer related products and services on the Internet .
In July of 1995 , I obtained a service mark registration for Nissan and my logo from the State of North Carolina .

On March 17 , 1996 , I registered the domain name " nissan.net " , and began offering Internet services , including dial - up connections and direct data connections to business .
In another example of Nissan Motor 's flexing its corporate might , age old eminent domain laws have been rewritten in Mississippi allowing the State to take land and homes from local landowners for the sole private benefit of Nissan Motor .
How the State of Mississippi was " convinced " to change these laws is unclear , but it is clear that local individuals are being deprived of their property rights so Nissan Motor can build its own plant .

UPDATES
DECEMBER - 1999 , Initial Filing .
More then five years after I registered nissan.com , legal action was instituted by Nissan Motor seeking $ 10,000,000 in damages , and to restrain me from the use of MY family name for business purposes on the Internet .
APRIL - 2002 , First Round of Summary Judgments .
The court ruled on a summary judgment motions as follows :
1. " Cyber - Squatting " claim , in Nissan Computer 's favor .
2. " Infringement on non-auto - related " claim , in Nissan Computer 's favor .
3. " Infringement on auto - related " claim , in Nissan Motor 's favor .
4. " Dilution " claim was sent to trial .
Nissan Motor 's intention to make this case as expensive as possible for me was evident from the beginning .
Undoubtedly , the notion that my company and me might be forced into bankruptcy rather than fight for my name , given the great expense , must have been a consideration .
As if the financial burden incurred by me and Nissan Computers was not enough , Nissan Motor filed a lawsuit against the Internet Center , Inc. , a corporation with three shareholders , in which I am the majority shareholder .
The Internet Center , Inc. did not and does not utilize the word " NISSAN " in any way .
SEPTEMBER - 2002 , Second Round of Summary Judgment .
The previous court rulings did not end this case .
Nissan Motor filed a second round of Summary Judgment Motions , trying ( and has been successful ) to get the Court to deprive me of the right to a jury trial .
The Court , surprisingly , changed its attitude on this issue and :
1. Changed the relevant date for " fame " from 1991 to 1994 .
2 . Found that no reasonable jury could find that Nissan was not famous by 1994 .
3. Found that Nissan Computer diluted Nissan Motor 's trademark .
4 . Found that the publication of information about this lawsuit , the comments
made by many people on this site and my efforts to bring this issue to
the public , actually tarnished Nissan Motor 's trademark .
Many legal experts view this case , not as a " law - breaking " case , but as a " law - making " case .
The Court indicated that certain aspects of this case may be creating new law as well .
Nissan Motor is now asking the Court to transfer nissan.com to them entirely .
The potential loss of a domain name in this fashion may set the wrong precedent for future cases and will open the door for any deep - pocket corporation to do the same .
This may become " the law of the land " by being solely based on " the law of the jungle " , and could affect you or someone you know .
DECEMBER - 2002 , Final Injunction .
The district court issued a final Judgment ( PDF ) allowing Nissan Computer to keep its nissan.com and nissan .
net domain names , but restricted our rights to do the following :
1. Posting Commercial content at nissan.com and nissan.net ;
2. Posting advertising or permitting advertising to be posted by third parties at
nissan.com and nissan.net ;
3 . Posting disparaging remarks or negative commentary regarding Nissan Motor

or Nissan North America .
After reviewing this and other rulings of the district court , we believed that the only practical option was to appeal .
One of the reasons for the appeal is that we and other experts considered the injunction and parts of other rulings to be a clear violation of our " First Amendment Rights " as it is to every American citizen 's constitutional rights .
OCTOBER - 2003 , Appeal Initial Motion .
Nissan Computer filed its Opening Brief ( PDF ) to the 9th circuit court of appeals , addressing the district court 's rulings on :
A. Trademark Dilution
B. Trademark Infringement
C. Final Injunction
NOTE : It 's a long brief , but will allow you to better understand the merits of this case .
JANUARY - 2004 , Appeal Reply Motion .
Nissan Motor filed a consolidated brief opposing Nissan Computer 's opening brief and a cross appeal on :
A. Trademark Infringement .
B. Final Injunction .
C. Requesting the court to force transfer Nissan.com to them .
Nissan Computer filed a Co nsolidated Brief ( PDF ) opposing NMC 's cross appeal and replying to their opposition .
AUGUST - 2004 , Appeal Ruling .
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a ruling reversing the case and remanding it back to the District Court .
In a Published Opinion ( PDF ) the Appellant Court rejected Nissan Motor 's cross appeal and reversed the District Court 's ruling against Nissan Computer on Dilution and the broad scope of the Final Injunction .
Not to our surprise , Nissan Motor filed a motion for rehearing by the 9th Circuit 's panel and a rehearing en banc ( a rehearing by all of the Court of Appeals Judges ) .
On September 2004 , the 9th Circuit issued a Ruling ( PDF ) denying Nissan Motor 's motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc .
DECEMBER - 2004 , Petition to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Nissan Motor filed a Petition for a " Writ of Certiorari " to the U.S. Supreme Court , seeking review of the Appellant Court ruling on the Infringement and First Amendment issues .
APRIL - 2005 , U.S. Supreme Court Order .
The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an Order , ( PDF ) Denying Nissan Motor 's Petition for a " Writ of Certiorari " , thus the dilution claim , which is the only remaining issue was sent back to the district court .
JANUARY - 2007 , Motion to strike Jury Demand .
Nissan Motor 's intentions to deprive us of a jury trial was evident from the beginning , they always felt that they have a better chance of prevailing in front of the judge rather than the jury .
In the 11th hour , after all their efforts to do so was unsuccessful , they pulled their last ace and dropped their $ 10,000,000 damage claim in exchange for a " bench trial " rather then a " jury Trial " .
MARCH - 2007 , Trial .
The four - day bench trial occurred between March 27 and March 30 to determine NMC 's claims on :
1. Dilution
2. Permanent Injunction re : Dilution .
3. Permanent Injunction re : Infringement .
We are now waiting for the court 's ruling on these matters .
SEPTEMBER - 2007 , Ruling .
The court has issued a Ruling ( PDF ) addressing NMC 's alleged claims in our favor :
1. Found that Nissan Computer did not Dilute NMC 's mark .
2. Denied NMC 's requests for Permanent Injunctions .
We are still waiting for the court to issue a final judgment .
JANUARY - 2008 , Motion For Attorneys ' Fees .
Nissan Motor has been unrelenting in its lawsuit against us and despite that they lost ; they subsequently filed a motion asking the court to award them millions of dollars in attorneys ' fees .
FEBRUARY - 2008 , Ruling on Attorneys ' Fees and Final Judgment .
The court has issued a Ruling ( PDF ) addressing these remaining issues :
1. Nissan Motor is NOT entitled to attorneys ' fees .
2. Nissan Computer is entitled to cost under rule 68 .
The court ordered NMC to pay $ 58,000 as cost under rule 68 , this is less then 2 % of what the cost was to defend this case .
You would think this case is over ..... but it really is n't .
MARCH - 2008 Nissan Motor 's trademark registration .
Nissan Motor is attempting to obtain a Federal Trademark Registration for computers and computer peripherals among other classes of goods and services .
We feel that Nissan Motor , in this action , is staging a future case against us in the computer and peripherals market .
We are left with no other course of action but to oppose this registration .
Public awareness of this unacceptable corporate behavior is crucial to eradicating it and we are asking you to take a stand and make a difference on this issue .
Your collective voice is more compelling than the lobbying power of corporate giants and it is a voice that can not be ignored .
Together we can make a difference and help keep our freedom intact , for us , for our children , and for our grandchildren .

Michael Savage , the incendiary radio host who last week characterized nearly every child with autism as “ a brat who has n’t been told to cut the act out , ” said in a telephone interview on Monday that he stood by his remarks and had no intention of apologizing to those advocates and parents who have called for his firing over the matter .
“ My main point remains true , ” Mr. Savage , whose radio audience ranks in size behind only those of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , said in the interview .
“ It is an overdiagnosed medical condition .
In my readings , there is no definitive medical diagnosis for autism . ”
On the July 16 installment of his program , which is broadcast every weekday , Mr. Savage suggested that “ 99 percent of the cases ” of autism were a result of lax parenting .
He told his audience : “ They do n’t have a father around to tell them , ‘ Do n’t act like a moron .
You ’ll get nowhere in life . ’ ” Among the other admonitions he felt children with autism should be hearing , he said , were : “ ‘ Straighten up .
Act like a man .
Do n’t sit there crying and screaming , idiot . ’ ”
Asked Monday if he actually believed that 99 out of every 100 cases of autism were misdiagnosed , Mr. Savage conceded that figure was “ a little high . ”
He added , “ It was hyperbole . ”
Obama vows to cut contracts by 10 percent
The presidential candidates have gotten in a bidding war over promises to trim federal fat , with both using the issue to try to portray themselves as the one to shake up Washington at a time when voters are disgusted with government .
Sen .
Barack Obama announced Monday that he would cut federal spending on contractors by “ at least 10 percent " — an effort to move in on his rival 's signature issue of budget earmarks .
Advertisement
“ Barack Obama will reform federal contracting and reduce the number of contractors , saving $ 40 billion a year , ” says his 11 - page “ Plan to Reform the Greed and Excesses of Washington . ”
The plan , which he was unveiling at midday in Green Bay , Wis. , also says Obama " will require each federal agency to defend each of its noncompetitive contracts to the Office of Management and Budget . ”
It sounds like a brochure for Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , but it ’s the headline of Obama ’s plan : “ STOP WASTEFUL SPENDING AND CURB INFLUENCE OF SPECIAL INTERESTS SO GOVERNMENT CAN TACKLE OUR GREAT CHALLENGES . ”
Other new proposals in the blueprint :
— Expose Corporate Welfare and Special Interest Tax Breaks to Public Scrutiny : Barack Obama will shine a light on corporate welfare by creating an agency charged with identifying recipients of corporate subsidies and evaluating the effectiveness of these subsidies in promoting growth and opportunity .
The agency will help identify wasteful subsidies that should be eliminated , and help prevent new corporate welfare initiatives from being passed .
Obama will ensure that any tax breaks for corporate recipients — or tax earmarks — are also publicly available by directing the Office of Management and Budget to post them on its website in an easily searchable format .
As president , Barack Obama will restore the American people ’s trust in their government by making government more open and transparent .
Obama will work to reform congressional rules to require all legislative sessions , including committee mark - ups and conference committees , to be conducted in public .
By making these practices public , the American people will be able to hold their leaders accountable for wasteful spending and lawmakers wo n’t be able to slip favors for lobbyists into bills at the last minute .
— Enforce Executive Branch Ethics : Today the Office of Governmental Ethics ( OGE ) is only an advisory agency with no enforcement authority .
Ethics decisions are made by roughly 4,000 individual ethics officers appointed by the head of each executive branch agency .
These officers rarely have any ethics training and routinely reject the advice given by OGE .
An Obama administration will give his OGE strong enforcement authority with the ability to make binding regulations , and it will work with inspectors general in all the federal agencies to enforce ethics rules , minimize waste and ensure federal officials are not using their offices for personal gain .
The OGE will also be the clearinghouse of all public records relevant to ethics in the Executive Branch and place this information on its website , including records of waivers from conflicts - of - interest that are requested and granted , personal financial statements of appointees and the career histories of senior executive branch staff who enter and leave public service .
Finally , the OGE will promulgate rules and procedures to record all oral and in - person “ lobbying contacts ” between registered lobbyists and political appointees and make those records available to the public in a searchable computerized database .
— Not Just Measure Performance , but Enforce Standards : Barack Obama will fundamentally reconfigure PART .
He will open up the insular performance measurement process to the public , Congress and outside experts .
Obama will eliminate ideological performance goals and replace them with goals Americans care about and that are based on congressional intent and feedback from the people served by government programs .
Obama will also ensure that programs are not only measured in isolation , but are assessed in the context of other programs that are serving the same population or meeting the same goals .
For instance , a veteran may be getting health care from a Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) hospital , disability benefits from a different federal office , other benefits from state programs and local food aid .
Obama ’s performance improvement effort will include cross-agency performance where service delivery requires coordination across federal agencies and multiple levels of government .
— Implement Consequences for Success and Failure :
The president needs the flexibility to enforce standards when programs continually fail .
Barack Obama will work with Congress to enable the president to take steps like sending in performance teams to reform programs ; replacing existing management ; demanding improvement action plans ; and cutting program budgets or eliminating programs entirely .
Obama will also experiment with giving government managers the ability to work with their teams to establish goals and to give bonuses when those goals are met .
These steps will be guided by performance measures and will be transparent and visible to the public and Congress .
— Move Workers from Bloated Bureaucracies to the Frontlines :
In many areas of the federal government there is too much Washington bureaucracy — too many layers of managers , and too much paperwork that does not contribute directly to improving the lives of the American people .
At the same time , there are too few workers on the front lines in local offices across the country .
We need more resources and better tools for food inspectors at the Food and Drug Administration , for nurses at VA hospitals , for air traffic controllers and baggage screeners , and for immigration border control agents .
Barack Obama will thin the ranks of Washington middle managers , freeing up resources both for deficit reduction and for increasing the number of frontline workers .
— Eliminate Wasteful Redundancy :
Too often , federal departments take on functions or services that are already being done or could be done elsewhere within the federal government more effectively .
The result is unnecessary redundancy and the inability of the government to benefit from economies of scale and integrated , streamlined operations .
Obama will conduct an immediate and periodic public inventory of administrative offices and functions and require agency leaders to work together to root out redundancy .
Where consolidation is not the right strategy to improve efficiency , Obama will improve information sharing and use of common assets to minimize wasteful duplication .
— Protect Whistleblowers :
Often the best source of information about waste , fraud , and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out .
Such acts of courage and patriotism , which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars , should be encouraged rather than stifled as they have been during the Bush administration .
We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance .
Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste , fraud , and abuse of authority in government .
Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process .
— Increase Use of Technology : Meeting 21st Century challenges will require a government that leverages 21st Century technologies and keeps up with the private sector .
Obama will appoint the nation ’s first Chief Technology Officer ( CTO ) to ensure that our government and all its agencies have the right infrastructure , policies and services for the 21st century .
The CTO will work with each of the federal agencies , to ensure that they use best - in - class technologies and share best practices .
Like he has in the campaign , Obama will employ innovative technologies , including blogs , wikis , social networking tools and other new strategies , to modernize internal , cross-agency , and public communication and information sharing .
— Sunlight on Corporate Tax Loopholes :
The tax code is riddled with corporate loopholes and preferential regulations that benefit a handful of companies at the expense of the rest of the business community as well as ordinary families .
Some large companies have managed to secure tax breaks or to hide their profits in overseas tax havens to not pay any American corporate taxes at all .
Barack Obama will require any tax bill considered by Congress to include a Corporate Tax Impact Statement that would disclose which industries or specific companies would be expected to benefit from the new tax breaks .
— Restore Management and Oversight Capacity :
The federal government ’s ability to manage contracts has not kept up with the increase in the volume and complexity of federal contracts .
Barack Obama will hire more contract managers and improve training .
He also will ensure that contract oversight remains within the federal government so that a contract ’s oversight is not outsourced to a business partner of the company doing the contract ’s work .
Such an arrangement contributed to wasteful spending in the Coast Guard ’s $ 24 billion Deepwater contract and the Department of Homeland Security ’s $ 30 billion border security contract with Boeing .
Obama will also require audits of a quarter of large contracts each year , focusing in the first year on noncompetitive and cost - plus contracts .
The audit will verify performance and cost savings , as well as whether the work was appropriate for contracting out , the competition was done fairly , and the contractor treated its workers appropriately .
In addition , cost - plus contracts have increased more than 75 percent under the Bush administration .
These contracts are vulnerable to waste because they provide no incentive to control costs .
Obama will encourage the use of fixed - cost or incentive - based contracts and when cost - plus contracts are necessary , force agencies to use mitigating procedures like incentives tied to performance goals and cost savings .
— Federal Contracts for Tax Delinquent Companies :
In numerous studies , GAO has found that tens of thousands of federal contractors have tax debts totaling billions of dollars .
Barack Obama will build upon his work in the Senate to prohibit seriously delinquent contractors from getting contracts for government work .
Former Bank of England policy maker Willem Buiter sparked the biggest debate at the Federal Reserve 's annual mountainside symposium , saying the central bank pays too much heed to the concerns of financial institutions .
'' The Fed listens to Wall Street and believes what it hears , '' Buiter said in a paper presented to the Fed 's conference in Jackson Hole , Wyoming .
'' This distortion into a partial and often highly distorted perception of reality is unhealthy and dangerous . ''
Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin said Buiter 's paper fired '' a lot of unguided missiles , '' and former Vice Chairman Alan Blinder '' respectfully disagreed ' ' with his analysis of the central bank 's crisis management .
Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer told the gathering a fire extinguisher might be needed to cool the dispute .
The Fed has provoked criticism from some officials in the US and Europe by trying to end the yearlong credit crisis through an expansion of lending .
The steepest interest - rate cuts in two decades risk stoking inflation , while the Fed has been too generous in aiding banks , said Buiter , 58 , a founding member of the Bank of England 's independent rate - setting board in 1997 .
In addition to rescuing Bear Stearns from bankruptcy , the Fed created a program to swap Treasuries for mortgage bonds , opened up lending to Wall Street firms and reduced the premium for direct loans to commercial banks .
Mishkin lashed out against Buiter 's assertion that the Fed 's rate reductions may cause higher consumer prices .
' Very Helpful '
'' I wish he had actually read some of the literature on optimal monetary policy , because it might have been very helpful in this context , '' said Mishkin , who collaborated with Bernanke on inflation research in the 1990s .
Mishkin , a leading advocate of the Fed 's effort to sustain economic growth through rapid rate reductions , said research shows that '' what you need to do is act more aggressively . ''
In reply , Buiter said the value of such a strategy ''is not at all obvious to me . ''
Fischer , drawing laughter from the audience , held up a red fire extinguisher saying , '' I asked the organizers for some technical assistance in dealing with this discussion . ''
While defending the Fed , Blinder said Buiter 's papers '' often feature an alluring mix of brilliant insight and outrageous statements . ''
The central bank 's performance , though not flawless , has been '' pretty good ' ' given the magnitude of the crisis , he said .
European Central Bank President Jean - Claude
Trichet also came to the Fed 's defense , saying '' what has been done until now has been pretty well done under very difficult circumstances . ''
' Market Correction '
After a year of instability , '' we are still in a market correction , '' Trichet said .
The Fed , unlike the ECB and Bank of England that are charged with containing inflation , has two mandates according to law : keep consumer prices in check and maximize employment .
The world 's top central - banking officials and scholars at the conference indicated the yearlong credit crisis has yet to run its course , with continued turmoil in banking and housing , Fischer said yesterday in the event 's closing remarks .
Bernanke , who did n't comment at the meeting after giving the opening speech , has argued that policy makers ' actions were necessary to safeguard the economy from the impact of the credit crisis .
Buiter said the Fed 's emergency lending programs are too generous .
The US central bank is making up to $ US200 billion of its Treasuries holdings available to primary securities dealers , and $ US150 billion of funds through auctions to commercial banks .
In addition , banks are able to borrow directly from the Fed .
'' You do n't let your borrower determine the value of the collateral offered to you , '' Buiter said .
'' That 's just crazy . ''
Too Sympathetic
Buiter also reiterated his argument that central banks can fall prey to '' regulatory capture ' ' by financial institutions , growing too sympathetic to their needs when setting rates .
Two economists echoed Buiter 's concern in another paper presented yesterday , saying the Fed 's program allowing institutions to swap Treasuries for mortgage bonds and other debt enables firms to '' window dress ' ' their balance sheets .
'' Financial institutions can hold low - quality securities for the period where no reporting is required , '' wrote Franklin Allen of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Frankfurt 's Elena Carletti .
'' Temporarily increasing the supply of Treasuries makes this kind of deception easier .
It helps remove market and regulator discipline . ''
The financial crisis is also forcing the ECB to rethink aspects of its money - market operations , which provide some flexibility compared with programs at the Fed and the Bank of England .
ECB Rules
The ECB plans to tighten collateral rules to head off the risk of abuse by some financial institutions , ECB council member Yves Mersch said in an interview yesterday .
Buiter nevertheless won some praise for openly confronting the Fed 's record at its summer retreat in Grand Teton National Park .
'' Willem 's papers do n't pull punches , they have attitude , '' Blinder said .
'' You have to give credit to a guy with the nerve to come here with black bears on the outside and the FOMC on the inside and be this critical of the Federal Reserve . ''
The FOMC refers to the central bank 's rate - setting Federal Open Market Committee .

Immigration : No Enforcement During Evac ICE seeks to reassure immigrants concerned that fleeing Gustav will mean arrest .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 31 , 2008 --
After being contacted by a number of churches in the New Orleans area about fears among the illegal immigrant community that evacuating might lead to trouble with the law , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) officials are trying to get the word out that they are not conducting any immigration enforcement during the evacuation .
According to ICE officials , churches are reporting that many in the immigrant community are reluctant to board evacuation busses , worried that they will be asked for documentation or even be arrested .
ICE spokesperson Kelly Nantel tells ABC News that " There are no immigration enforcement operations , and there are no immigration enforcement checkpoints associated with the evacuations . "
" The Department of Homeland Security 's top priorities in any emergency are life - saving and life - sustaining activities .
We want to ensure the safe and swift evacuation of all individuals in the affected region , " Nantel added .
ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security .
ICE personnel are preparing to assist with rescue and recovery efforts after the storm passes .
Just last week in Laurel , Miss. , ICE conducted the largest single worksite enforcement action in the agency 's history , detaining 595 suspected illegal immigrants at a manufacturing plant .

$ 700 billion bailout ?
You ai n't seen nothin '
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close $ 700 billion bailout ?
You ai n't seen nothin ' 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Think $ 700 billion to bail out Wall Street is expensive ?
Just wait .
The mortgage meltdown is cheap compared with the coming fiscal firestorm fanned by unfunded Social Security and Medicare costs .
Together , these programs hold unfunded obligations totaling $ 41 trillion - 60 times larger than the proposed Wall Street bailout .
And even this understates the difference , because $ 41 trillion is the current net value of the unfunded obligations over 75 years .
The actual cumulative yearly deficits these programs face over the next 75 years are several magnitudes larger than $ 41 trillion .
Imagine a taxpayer bailout even larger than what 's proposed for Wall Street .
Now imagine it recurring every year in perpetuity .
That 's our fiscal future unless we fundamentally reform these unsustainable entitlement programs .
Certainly , there are some differences between the two situations .
Unlike entitlement spending , the Wall Street bailout would actually give the government assets it could later sell to recoup much of the costs .
On the other hand , by issuing federal debt , the Wall Street bailout would add to the government 's explicit obligations - unlike Social Security and Medicare 's implicit obligations that , legally , could be cut anytime by Congress .
The entitlement problem is simple to understand .
In the 1960s , five workers paid the taxes for each retiree 's Social Security and Medicare benefits .
Today that ratio is just 3 - to - 1 . The coming retirement of 77 million Baby Boomers will drive that ratio down to 2 - to - 1 by 2030 .
That means every two children born this year and who marry in 2030 will have to support themselves , their children - and the Social Security and Medicare benefits of their very own retiree .
The cost will be staggering .
While both programs face rising costs due to demographics , the added problem of steeply rising health care costs puts Medicare in even worse shape than Social Security .
Absent reform , paying all promised retiree benefits would require either : A ) doubling all tax rates ; B ) eliminating every other federal program , including defense and education ; or C ) running massive budget deficits that would eventually collapse the economy .
And every year of delay raises the final cost of reform by trillions of dollars .
Yet delay is all we get from Congress .
Lawmakers know these program costs are completely unsustainable , but they see reform as expensive and politically risky .
And so , they kick the can down the road , putting the future stability of our entire economy at risk .
The impending retirement of 77 million Baby Boomers is not theoretical .
It ca n't be dismissed or wished away .
And when the inevitable Social Security and Medicare costs come , taxpayers will demand to know why lawmakers ignored the warnings .
They will discover that in January 2008 , Moody 's warned that the United States ' triple - A credit rating would be reduced within a decade unless Congress reformed these programs .
And Congress just shrugged .
Shortly thereafter , the Medicare trustees warned that payroll taxes and user premiums will soon cover barely half of the program 's cost , forcing a record 45 percent of its budget to be subsidized out of general tax revenues .
Even though the warning triggered a law requiring an examination of Medicare reforms , Congress again just shrugged .
Next , the Congressional Budget Office projected a 2008 federal budget deficit of $ 407 billion , driven mostly by escalating Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid costs .
The data showed that these three programs - comprising nearly half of federal spending - are set to push the deficit to nearly $ 1 trillion over the next decade , and higher thereafter .
Again , Congress just shrugged .
And when a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate offered legislation to create a commission to fix these programs before they bankrupt the nation , congressional leadership refused to allow a vote on it .
Every day that Congress wastes naming post offices and allocating pork projects is a day that the Baby Boomers move closer to retirement , and the eventual costs of an entitlement bailout increase further .
Reform will take time , but lawmakers can begin by publicly disclosing the unfunded obligations of Social Security and Medicare in the federal budget .
They can also take these programs off autopilot and place them on a long - term budget .
Today we are grappling with a very real financial crisis .
While we cannot go back in time and fix it , we can start acting now to prevent the next , clearly visible crisis .
It promises to be 60 times bigger than the Wall Street debacle .
Is Congress paying attention ?

Update : While I was writing , Dr. Krugman wrote : No deal .
Definitely worth reading !
The underlying problem is that house prices are still too high and no one knows how much further prices will fall .
The value of the troubled assets is dependent on future house prices ( note : house prices are the key factor for foreclosures and loss severity ) .
Some people do n't seem to understand house prices will continue to fall , from the NY Times : But Will It Work ? ( hat tip Yal )
“ It ’s easy to forget amid all the fancy stuff — credit derivatives , swaps — that the root cause of all this is declining house prices .
If you can reverse that , then people start coming out of their foxholes and start putting their money in places they have been too afraid to put it . ”
Alan S. Blinder , Princeton economist , and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , Sept 20 , 2008
This plan is n't intended to reverse the house price trend - and it should n't be intended for that purpose .
The Paulson plan is intended to keep the banks lending to credit worthy borrowers .
Other goals are to minimize the burden for taxpayers , and minimize moral hazard - but the primary goal is to keep the banks lending to minimize the impact of the credit crisis on the economy .
There are private investors willing to buy these troubled assets right now , but the banks do not want to sell at those prices .
Why ?
Some banks believe the assets are worth more than the current bids ( it all depends on future house prices , and different banks and investors have different projections ) .
And many banks are unwilling to accept the current bids because the banks would then be insolvent .
See Professor Krugman's : Doubts about the rescue and Uneasy feelings .
Also , even solvent banks would probably have to recapitalize ( dilute shareholders ) or reduce lending if they sold at current bid prices .
So how does the Treasury plan help ?
It is n't clear yet .
The first goal should be transparency of the troubled assets .
What do the banks own , and what are the assets really worth ?
Transparency is surprisingly difficult : each RMBS and CDOs - even within the same asset class and origination year - can have significantly different values depending on the orginator and other factors .
If the Treasury conducts a reverse dutch auction on a broad asset class , they will probably end up with certain New Century and Bear Stearns deals that are basically worthless .
To facilitate price discovery , it would probably be better to bid for individual mortgages from RMBS pools , but analyzing each mortgage would be a monumental task .
We definitely do not want the Treasury to buy RMBS and CDOs at anywhere near the value on the bank 's books .
Buying at those prices would help keep the banks lending , but it would also severely impact the taxpayers , it would be a transfer of wealth from the many to the few , and it would also encourage future excessive risk taking .
So determining price will be difficult .
And what happens if a price can be determined ?
How does this help keep the banks lending ?
As I noted when the plan was announced , buying impaired assets at a steep discount reduces regulatory capital as losses are realized , and therefore will lead to less lending unless the banks are recapitalized .
Perhaps with a clean balance sheet , the banks can attract private capital ( with significant dilution of current shareholders ) .
Or perhaps something similar to the Depression era Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) can be part of the plan to invest capital in the banks .
If an investment from the Government is required anyway , why bother buying the impaired assets ?
First , a recognition phase with complete transparency .
Have private investors bid on some assets to establish market prices ( some portion should be sold to the private investors to encourage bids ) , and then let the banks argue for their own valuations .
Based on an analysis of these valuations , have the Treasury make an RFC type investment in the bank with a convertible debenture that would count as regulatory capital .
This capital infusion would keep the banks lending ( the primary goal ) and the amount required would be far less than the amount needed to buy the troubled assets .
If a bank can pay off the debentures with interest - possibly because the assets perform as the bank expects , or perhaps by bringing in private capital - then there would be no dilution from the debentures .
Otherwise the debentures convert into preferred shares and significantly dilute the shareholders - and then the government can sell the shares on the public market .
Ideally the debtholders would take a haircut too ( before the taxpayers ) , but that is probably too complicated .
This alternative would keep the banks lending , minimize the cost to the taxpayers , and reduce moral hazard .
Just my two cents as we wait for more details ...
Best to all .
Freaky but real :
25 - year old Israel Sarrio had his arm severed in an accident , then re-attached .
Unfortunately an infection set in , and the doctors were forced to re-amputate while the stump was treated .
To keep the arm alive until the re-re- attachment , its arteries and veins were attached to his … .
Wow .
So many jokes and puns come to mind it ’s not even funny .
P.S. The procedures were successful and Israel ’s arm was returned to its rightful place .
I bet his crotch misses the company though .

Editor 's Note : Tara Wall , deputy editorial page editor and columnist for The Washington Times , serves as a political contributor to CNN .
Before joining the newspaper , she was a senior advisor for the Republican National Committee and was appointed a public affairs director in the Department of Health and Human Services by President Bush .

Wall says the candidates should n't forget that values voters are still interested in social issues like abortion .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The term evangelical voter is often bandied about as a measure of voter attitudes to generally refer to people of faith in Christian denominations .
But most often , these religious polls are only referring to white evangelicals .
Black and Hispanic evangelicals are almost never included in the analysis .
That 's ironic , because of all the racial and ethnic groups in the United States , black Americans are the most likely to report a religious affiliation , according to Pew Research .
Barack Obama , a man of faith , must know that this is among the reasons the senator has such wide appeal and an overwhelming lead in the black community .
John McCain recognizes it too , which is why he 's tried hard to address the issue , as he did during last weekend 's Saddleback Civic Forum on the Presidency .
He stated , unprompted , " When I go into places [ like Gee Bend , Alabama ] where I know they probably wo n't vote for me , I know that my job is to tell them that I 'll be president of every American . "
It may be considered pandering by some observers , yet it is his way of acknowledging that minority voters of faith matter .
But among white evangelicals , the script is flipped .
McCain leads Obama 68 percent to 24 percent , because despite Obama 's born - again credentials , white conservatives are more suspect of his liberal , pro-choice , leanings .
Keeping these factors in mind , it should come as no surprise that we are seeing a push among the presidential candidates to appeal to religious voters .
Obama cannot win with the black vote alone and McCain cannot afford to alienate any more of his conservative base .
The faithful are politically engaged .
But defining the faithful or religious is not an easy task .
Perhaps the best term to use is values voters .
It covers white , black , Hispanic and Asian Americans of varying faiths , who put a premium on values - driven policy .
Admittedly , that moniker has come to mean something wholly different than it did in elections past .
In 2000 and 2004 , for example , values voters referred to the increase in evangelical voters who were mostly considered the religious right .
Today they have come to represent those who are less affiliated with a political party and vote based on a core set of issues or values ( generally conservative ) , and range in race and age .
Now that the primaries are over there has been a shift by the presumptive nominees , from simply appealing to the party base to catering to the general population .
In their quest to appeal to values voters , the two men who - would - be president would do well to consider the implications of their vice presidential picks .
While Obama could benefit from a socially opposite vice presidential nominee ( such as pro-life Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine ) , the same cannot be said for John McCain in picking a pro-choice nominee ( i.e Tom Ridge ) .
Despite his " proud 25 - year pro-life record , " conservatives take issue with McCain 's vote to support federal funding of embryonic stem cell research , they 've been skeptical since his past comments about people of faith ( i.e. Jerry Falwell ) , and some are growing impatient with the Republican Party 's move away from a faith - based platform .
Having been slightly redeemed by the faithful after his impressive performance at the Saddleback Civic Forum on the Presidency , McCain 's pick of a pro-choice candidate would cause a revolt , the likes of which he cannot afford .
For Obama 's part , the candidate seems oblivious to the fact that the majority of Americans are opposed to abortion , and even those who consider themselves pro-choice have a hard time wrapping themselves around the Illinois senator 's extreme views and votes against a ban on partial - birth abortions and against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act .
Further , Obama lost points with his out - of - touch response to the most innocuous question on abortion posed by Pastor Rick Warren , " When does a baby have human rights , " to which Obama replied that was above his pay grade .
One other trend the Obama campaign may want to consider is that conservative Democrats are making a comeback , winning once - held Republican districts by running on moderate - to - right platforms .
One thing is certain , while today 's values voters are more moderate on fiscal issues and have expanded their top issues to include the environment , the war and economics , they remain staunchly conservative on social issues .
Or as Family Research Council President Tony Perkins put it to me : Life is still fundamental .

Or , how we can start to solve the a big problem which people have with their personal computers .
CROWDS of people in Stretford watched in awe as a formation of mysterious orange lights hovered low over their houses last night .
The intensely bright orbs , the colour of the setting sun , were spotted by dozens of residents between 10 and 11 pm .
Motorists stopped their cars and neighbours on several streets congregated outside to watch the orbs pass slowly overhead .
Some took mobile phone videos and photos of the strange lights , while others reported the sightings to Greater Manchester Police who sent two officers to investigate .
Matthew Darsley , 31 , of Haworth Drive , said : " It was the strangest thing I 've ever seen .
They looked as if they were on fire , really bright orange orbs .
We spotted eight or nine go over my house between 10 and 11 pm .
" They definitely were n't helicopters or planes or anything like that , and there was no smoke or sound .
" We were thinking , `this is it ' .
" By the end there were about eight people out in the close watching them go by .
My neighbour said she 'd seen them as she was leaving the Trafford Centre .
" These things were massive .
The first one I saw was just below the cloud line but the others were probably only about 300 ft up .
" I took some pictures and video but I could n't really seem to capture the size of them , just a bit in the middle like the filament of a light bulb . "
A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said they had had no reports of unusual activity and the Civil Aviation Authority declined to comment on the sightings .
And a Ministry of Defence spokesman said it examines unidentified flying object reports solely to `establish whether UK airspace may have been compromised by hostile or unauthorised military aircraft ' .
Mum Beverley Clarke , a careers advisor in her fifties , watched the orbs with her husband Michael and son Joe from their back garden on Abbey Close .
" It was amazing , " she said .
" I 'd just returned home and we caught sight of one through the trees .
It went over one of the houses and was still for a while before slowly fading away .
" Just as it was disappearing another one came again from the same direction .
It was n't something we imagined .
" I do n't really believe in flying saucers but they were huge bright orange spheres .
" They were lower than a plane but higher than a helicopter .
" I was saying , ` Oh my God ' , because it was so strange . "
Experts in defence intelligence staff reported in 2000 that many UFOs are in fact an atmospheric phenomenon , extremely hot gases ( plasmas ) created by charges of electricity .
And 20 homes in Manchester and a plane were struck by lightning the night before as electrical storms hit the region .
Steve Mera , of the Manchester Association of Paranormal Investigation and Training , said UFO sightings have increased by 40 per cent this year with 150 in the last three months .
" Many of the reports have been local , " he said .
" We 've had a spate in Northenden recently .
There are a lot of things we have to rule out , such as Chinese lanterns , meteor showers , exotic aircraft and meteorological phenomena .
" Still , about six per cent of sightings remain unexplained . "
A spokesperson for GMP said : " We received two reports of objects in the skies above Stretford last night .
It is believed the lights in the sky occurred naturally , possible as a result of a meteor shower . "
男性器をより大きくするのであれが、増大手術が効果的で即効性もあります。そうした方法でサイズアップをする人もありますが、できれば体に負担がかかる手術は避けたい、余計なものを入れることなく大きくしたいと考える人も少なくありません。

Build an embedded Linux distro from scratch
Before you start
Objectives
This tutorial shows you how to install Linux on a target system .
Not a prebuilt Linux distribution , but your own , built from scratch .
While the details of the procedure necessarily vary from one target to another , the same general principles apply .
The result of this tutorial ( if you have a suitable target ) is a functional Linux system you can get a shell prompt on .
About this tutorial
The tutorial begins with a discussion of cross-compilation issues , then discusses what the components of a Linux system are and how they are put together .
Both the building and the installation and configuration of the target system are covered .
The specific target discussed , a Technologic Systems TS - 7800 , imposes its own default boot and bring - up behaviors ; other systems will have other mechanics , and this tutorial does not go into great detail about every possible boot loader .
Prerequisites and system requirements
Developers who are interested in targeting embedded systems , or who just want to learn more about what Linux systems are like under the hood , will get the most out of this tutorial .
The host environment used is Ubuntu , but other systems work as well .
Users are assumed to have basic familiarity with UNIX ® or Linux system administration issues .
The tutorial assumes root access to a host system .
This tutorial assumes that your shell is a Bourne shell derivative ; if you use a C shell derivative , the prompt will probably look different , and you will need to use different commands to set environment variables .
For cross-compiling ( which is useful when targeting embedded systems ) , I used crosstool - ng version 1.1.0 , released in May of 2008 .
You may download it from the distribution site ( see Related topics ) .
Details follow on installing and configuring it .
About the target and architecture
Target
The target I chose is a Technologic Systems TS - 7800 ( see Related topics for more detail ) .
This is a small embedded ARM system , with both built - in and removable flash storage , as well as a SATA controller .
This tutorial walks you through configuring this system to boot to a login prompt , without relying on prebuilt binaries .
Architecture
I chose the ARM architecture to make it a little easier to check whether a given binary is host or target , and to make it easy to see when host pollution might be occurring .
It is also nice having a machine that consumes a total of about 5W of power and runs completely silently .
Cross-compilation
What is cross-compiling ?
Cross -compiling is using a compiler on one system to develop code to run on another .
Cross -compilation is relatively rare among casual UNIX users , as the default is to have a compiler installed on the system for use on that system .
However , cross-compilation becomes quite common ( and relevant ) when targeting embedded systems .
Even when host and target are the same architecture , it is necessary to distinguish between their compilers ; they may have different versions of libraries , or libraries built with different compiler options , so that something compiled with the host compiler could fail to run , or could behave unexpectedly , on the target .
Obtaining cross-compilation tools
It is , in theory , quite possible to build a cross - compiler yourself , but it is rarely practical .
The series of bootstrap stages needed can be difficult and time - consuming , and it is often necessary to build a very minimal compiler , which is used to partially configure and build libraries , the headers of which are then used to rebuild the compiler so it can use them , and so on .
A number of commercial sources for working cross-compilers for various architecture combinations are available , as well as several free cross-compilation toolkits .
Introducing crosstool-ng
Dan Kegel 's crosstool ( see Related topics for details ) collects a variety of expertise and a few specialized patches to automatically build toolchains for a number of systems .
Crosstool has not been updated in a while , but the new crosstool - ng project builds on this work .
For this tutorial , I used crosstool - ng version 1.1.0 , released in May of 2008 .
Download it from the distribution site ( see Related topics ) .
Installing crosstool-ng
Crosstool -ng has a configure script .
To configure it , just run the script using -- prefix to set a location .
For instance :
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/7800/ctng
Once you have configured it , build it using make and then make install .
The build process creates a ctng directory in the 7800 working directory that holds the crosstool - ng build scripts .
Add the ctng / bin subdirectory to your path :
$ PATH=$PATH :$HOME/7800/ctng/bin
Configuring crosstool-ng
Crosstool - ng uses a .config file similar to those used by the Linux kernel .
You need to create a configuration file matching your target to use crosstool - ng .
Make a working directory for a crosstool - ng build :
$ mkdir toolchain - build
$ cd toolchain - build
Now , copy in a default configuration .
It 's possible to manually configure crosstool - ng , but one of the sample configurations happens to fit the target perfectly :
$ cp ../ctng/lib/ct-ng-1.1.0/samples/arm-unknown-linux-uclibc/* .
Finally , rename the crosstool .
config file :
$ mv crosstool.config .config
This copies in a configuration file that targets an armv5te processor , the model used on the TS - 7800 .
It builds with uClibc , a libc variant intended for embedded systems .
However , the configuration file does need one modification .
Fixing the configuration path
The default target directory for a crosstool - ng build is $ HOME / x- tools / $ TARGET .
For instance , on this build , it would come out as x - tools / arm - unknown - linux - uclibc .
This is very useful if you are building for a lot of targets , but not so useful if you are building for only one .
Edit the .config file and change CT_PREFIX_DIR to $ {HOME}/7800 / toolchain .
Building the toolchain
To build the toolchain , run the ct-ng script with the build argument .
To improve performance , especially on a multi- core system , you may want to run with multiple jobs , specified as build .# .
For example , this command builds with four jobs :
$ ct-ng build .
4
This may take quite a while , depending on your host system .
When it 's done , the toolchain is installed in $ HOME / 7800 / toolchain .
The directory and its contents are marked read - only ; if you need to delete or move them , use chmod u+w
The ct-ng script takes other arguments , such as help .
Note that ct-ng is a script for the standard make utility , and as a result , the output from -- help is just the standard make help ; use ct-ng help to get the help for crosstool - ng .
If you have n't seen this trick before , it 's a neat one .
Modern UNIX systems interpret an executable file in which the first line starts with #!
as a script , specifically , a script for the program named on the rest of the line .
For instance , many shell scripts start with #!/bin/sh .
The name of the file is passed to the program .
For programs that treat their first argument as a script to run , this is sufficient .
While make does not do that automatically , you can give it a file to run with using the -f flag .
The first line of ct-ng is #!/usr / bin/make - rf .
The -r flag suppresses the built - in default construction rules of make , and the -f flag tells it that the following word ( which is the script 's file name ) is the name of a file to use instead of one named Makefile .
The result is an executable script that uses make syntax instead of shell syntax .
Using the toolchain
For starters , add the directory containing the compiler to your path :
$ PATH=~/7800/toolchain/bin:$ PATH
With that in your path , you can now compile programs :
$ arm - unknown - linux - uclibc - gcc -o hello hello.c $ file hello
hello : ELF 32 - bit LSB executable , ARM , version 1 ( SYSV ) , for
GNU / Linux 2.4.17 , dynamically linked ( uses shared libs ) , not stripped
Where are the libraries ?
The libraries used by the toolchain to link binaries are stored in arm - unknown - linux - uclibc / sys - root , under the toolchain directory .
This directory forms the basis of an eventual root file system , a topic we 'll cover under Filesystems , once the kernel is built .
Kernel setup
The kernel distribution tree provided by the vendor is already configured for cross compilation .
In the simplest case ( which this is ) , the only thing you have to do to cross compile a Linux kernel is to set the CROSS_COMPILE variable in the top - level Makefile .
This is a prefix that is prepended to the names of the various programs ( gcc , as , ld ) used during the build .
For instance , if you set CROSS_COMPILE to arm - , the compile will try to find a program named arm - gcc in your path .
For this build , then , the correct value is arm - unknown - linux - uclibc .
Or , if you do n't want to rely on path settings , you can specify the whole path , as in this example :
CROSS_COMPILE ?= $ ( HOME)/7800/toolchain/bin/arm-unknown-linux-uclibc-
Building the kernel
Downloading the source
Download Technologic 's Linux source and TS - 7800 configuration files and unzip them in a suitable location .
Kernel configuration
A complete discussion of kernel configuration is beyond the scope of this tutorial .
In this case , the ts7800 _defconfig target gave me a default usable configuration for the 7800 , with one small hiccup : the CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE setting ended up off when it should have been on .
Tweaking the kernel
It is usually best to edit the kernel using make menuconfig , which offers a semi-graphical interface to kernel configuration .
This interface is navigated using arrow keys to move the cursor , the Tab key to select options from the bottom of the screen , and the space or Enter keys to select options .
For instance , to exit without changing anything , press Tab until the < Exit > at the bottom of the screen is highlighted , then press Enter .
Running make menuconfig again reopens the editor .
Changing the default console
The TS - 7800 normally boots silently , because the default kernel configuration specifies a null console device to keep the display quiet .
To change this , use the arrow keys to navigate down to " Boot options , " and press Enter .
The third line shows the default kernel options , which select the ramdisk , the startup script , and the console .
Use the arrow keys to navigate down to this line , press Enter , and change console none to console tty S0,115200 .
Then , press Tab to move the cursor to the < Ok > at the bottom of the panel , and press Enter .
Now press
Tab to select < Exit > and press Enter , bringing you back to the main menu .
For the goal of booting as fast as possible , the console device is n't useful , and indeed , even at a high baud rate , sending kernel messages can take a noticeable fraction of the time the system takes to boot .
For debugging and playing around , though , you want the console .
Enabling the DMA engine
Navigate down to " Device drivers " and press Enter .
This list is longer than the usual display , so you will have to scroll down to the very end to reach the option for " DMA Engines . "
Navigate to that with the arrow keys , and press Enter .
There are two options at the top of this page that have square brackets indicating a boolean option .
The second , " Support for DMA engines , " was not enabled by default in the download I started with .
Navigate to it with the arrow keys , and press space to toggle its state .
Now use Tab and Enter to select < Exit > from each screen to navigate out to the top level of the program , and then < Exit > one more time to leave the program .
When asked whether you wish to save your new kernel configuration , tab to < Yes > and press Enter .
Compiling the kernel
Type make .
Yes , it really is that simple .
This builds a kernel , as well as a collection of modules .
Once again , multi - core users might want multiple jobs ; try make -j 5 .
For the purposes of this project , I 'm going to ignore kernel modules , and favor compiling - in any needed features .
The bootstrap ramdisk technique used to get needed drivers into the kernel early seems excessive , and building a root file system is already complicated enough .
This , of course , brings up the question of how to get a kernel booting , the subject of the next section .
Boot loaders
What is a boot loader ?
A boot loader ( or bootstrap loader ) is a program that loads another program .
The boot loader is a small and specialized hunk of code , specific to a target system , that has just enough complexity to find the kernel and load it without being a full - featured kernel .
Different systems use a variety of different boot loaders , from the huge and complicated BIOS programs common on desktop PCs , to very small and simple programs more common on embedded systems .
A simple boot loader
The TS - 7800 uses an unusually simple boot loader , which simply picks up the kernel from a predetermined partition of the SD card or on - board flash .
A jumper determines whether the board looks first at the on - board flash , or at the SD cards .
There are no other configuration settings .
More complicated boot loaders ( such as grub , commonly used on desktop PCs ) have options for configuring kernel options and so on at boot time .
On this system , the kernel 's default options must be compiled in , as described previously .
The decision to compile in kernel options is a typical example of a choice that makes some sense in an embedded system , but would be uncomfortably limiting on a desktop .
Kernel formats
There are a variety of formats in which kernels are stored .
The initial Linux kernel binary , named vmlinux , is rarely the file that a boot loader will work with .
On the TS - 7800 , the boot loader can use two files , either Image ( uncompressed ) or zImage ( compressed ) .
These files are created in the arch / arm / boot directory within the kernel tree .
People often describe the zImage kernel as a compressed kernel , and so expect the boot loader to need to provide decompression .
In fact , it 's rather more clever .
The zImage kernel is an uncompressed executable , which contains a particularly large static data object which is a compressed kernel image .
When the boot loader loads and runs the zImage executable , that executable then unpacks the kernel image and executes it .
This way , you get most of the benefit of compression without imposing additional effort on the boot loader .
Setting up the SD card
The SD card needs an MBR table containing DOS - style partition information .
A sample MBR table is available for download from Technologic 's site ; this is for a 512 MB card , but it is easy to edit the fourth partition to a size suiting whatever size card you want to use .
The first three partitions are 4MB each ; the first is unused on smaller cards , and the second and third hold the kernel and initial ramdisk image respectively .
For my purposes , I used the sfdisk utility , which is not always recommended but has the desirable trait of trusting me when I ask it to create a partition that does not align on a partition boundary .
Installing the initial kernel
The kernel for the TS - 7800 is dumped directly into the second partition of the SD card .
The exact path to the card depends on how you are accessing it ; typically , if you have the card on a USB card reader , it will be detected as a SCSI device .
Note that there is no file system access involved ; the raw kernel is just dumped into the partition .
The dd command copies raw data from one source to another , as in this example :
$ dd if=zImage of= / dev/sdd2 bs=16
k
93+1 records in
93+1 records out
1536688 bytes ( 1.5 MB ) copied , 0.847047 s , 1.8 MB /s
This command dumps raw data from the zImage file to the second partition of / dev/sdd , using 16 KB blocks .
A bit about block sizes
The output of this command is a little cryptic ( as are its inputs , honestly ) .
When dd runs , it copies data in " records , " which are by default 512 - byte blocks ; this command specifies a block size of 16 k ( which dd understands to mean 16 * 1024 ) .
The dd command reports the amount of data copied first in blocks ; the number after the plus sign is the number of partial blocks copied .
In this case , because 1,536,688 is not an exact multiple of the block size , the remaining bytes of the file are read ( and written ) separately as a partial block .
This information is harmless for most modern devices but crucial to diagnosing problems with some older ones .
The ability to control block sizes ( and reblock data when transferring it ) was exceptionally useful for working with tape devices and other specialized media that required writes to be of particular fixed sizes , and also helps for performance and reliability reasons with flash devices .
While the kernel device representing flash media can often take writes of arbitrary sizes , it is common for the underlying device to work only in full blocks , often of somewhat larger sizes ( 4 KB or larger ) .
To do a partial write , the flash device must extract the current contents of the full block , modify them with the input data , and flash the whole block back .
If a device uses 4KB blocks , and you write to it in 512 - byte blocks , each device block gets rewritten eight times for a single copy .
This is bad for the device 's longevity , and also bad for performance .
( A 512 - byte write of the same file was half as fast on the flash card I used . )
Booting the kernel
Booting the kernel is simple enough .
Set the jumper for an SD boot , put the card in the system , and power it up .
If you started with a blank card , this produces a predictable result :
Kernel panic - not syncing : VFS : Unable to mount root fs on unknown - block ( 1,0 )
This cryptic message indicates that the kernel has been unable to find its root filesystem .
That means it 's about time to create one .
Filesystems
Root filesystems
Normally , Linux has only a single root filesystem .
However , during boot , it is common to use a temporary root filesystem to load and configure device drivers and the like , and then obtain the real root filesystem and switch to it .
The TS - 7800 uses this temporary filesystem ( called an initial ramdisk , or initrd ) for the SD driver and for a variety of configuration options .
In fact , the ramdisk is used for many of the things ( such as determining the final root filesystem to use ) that might be handled by the boot loader on another system .
Manipulating filesystems
A general caveat applies : most filesystem operations require root privileges .
There are some exceptions and some workarounds .
The most notable is the fakeroot utility / library , which allows you to build applications with " fakeroot support . "
This allows the manipulation of a virtual root filesystem with control over ownership , permissions , and so on .
However , the permissions and related material are maintained in a separate database , and no actual privileged operations are needed .
This allows a non -root user to manipulate directory hierarchies with virtual root privileges , and ultimately create archives or filesystem images containing files that the user has n't got the privileges to create .
For this tutorial , however , I assume root privileges .
Changing root
The chroot command , while certainly part of the story , is not sufficient to change the root filesystem .
The tool for this is pivot_root , which makes one named directory the new root directory , and " moves " ( really , changes the mount point of ) the old root directory to another name .
A not - so - initial root
For the purposes of this tutorial , I 'm assuming that the default initrd image provided with the board is adequate .
Linux kernel distributions have some support for generating suitable initrd images , and the details of this one are not crucial to an understanding of building an actual distribution .
I 'll just introduce the key things needed to get the system moving , then focus on what goes on the real root filesystem .
Filesystem images
Most Linux users are familiar with files containing images of ISO CD - ROM or DVD filesystems .
Linux supports the creation and use of images of other types of filesystems .
In fact , any file can be treated as though it were a disk partition , using the -o loop option to mount .
For instance , while researching this , I made a copy of the initrd image used by the TS - 7800 :
$ dd if=/dev/sdd3 of=initrd.dist bs=16
k
$ cp initrd.dist initrd.local
With this file available , it 's possible to mount the filesystem to have a look at it .
The copy named initrd.local is the local version to edit ; the copy named initrd .
dist is a safe pristine copy in case something gets broken later .
$ mount -o loop initrd.local / mnt
What does the initrd do ?
The initrd provides a very basic initial filesystem used to bootstrap the device by finding and mounting the real root filesystem .
The default kernel configuration is hard - wired to use an initrd ( / dev/ram0 ) as root , and run the linuxrc script on startup .
There are several provided variants of this script for different root file systems .
The obvious choice is to look at the linuxrc - sdroot variant .
Preparing initrd
The linuxrc - sdroot program tries to configure the system to use an SD card as root .
Assuming a correctly configured SD card with an ext3 filesystem on the fourth fdisk partition , the script mounts that filesystem and runs / sbin / init on it .
This looks like a good strategy .
So , a couple of small changes are needed to the initrd image .
The first is to change the linuxrc symlink to point to linuxrc - sdroot .
The second is to update the script to work with the uClibc build instead of the Debian build it was configured for .
The SD driver
The SD driver for the TS - 7800 includes a proprietary module , so the tssdcard .
ko file simply has to be manually copied in , and loaded at runtime .
The file on the distribution initrd works fine with the new kernel , so no change is needed .
Switching bootstrap routines
The kernel simply runs the program called linuxrc .
By default , this is a symbolic link to the program linuxrc - fastboot , which comes up quickly to the initrd root filesystem .
Removing the link , and linking linuxrc instead to linuxrc - sdroot , causes the system to try to boot from the last partition on the SD once the drivers are loaded .
Changing the bootstrap routine
The script checks for errors , and if it finds any , mounts from the internal flash .
If it does not , it mounts the filesystem from the SD card and then tries to change to it .
The bootstrap routine actually has a small quirk that affects this build ; it tries to use its own mount utility , rather than the rootfs one , for the last cleanup work after calling pivot_root .
This works well with the provided Debian install , but fails with the minimalist uClibc install .
The solution is to change the lines following the pivot_root command at the end of the file ( after the else clause ) as follows :
pivot_root .
./ initrd
/ bin/mount -n -- move ./initrd/dev ./dev
/ bin/mount -n -- move ./initrd/sys ./sys
/ bin/mount -n -- move ./initrd/proc ./proc
exec / sbin/init < $ CONSOLE > $ CONSOLE 2>&1
This causes the script to run the new ( uClibc , statically linked ) executables that you are about to create , instead of trying to run dynamically linked executables from another system .
( If you were doing this without a tutorial , you probably would n't know this until after you 'd set everything else up and started getting cryptic error messages ) .
Unmount the disk image
Unmount the initrd disk image like so :
$ umount / mnt
Populating the root file system
What goes into a root filesystem ?
The root filesystem needs an / sbin / init that will do whatever it is we want done .
This can be a custom program rather than a conventional UNIX - style init , but it is easier to work with the system if you provide a working environment complete with console shell and everything .
Basic libraries and headers
The crosstool - ng build created a default system root providing library code and headers .
Make a copy of it :
$ cp -r toolchain / arm - unknown - linux - uclibc / sys - root rootfs
Note that no effort is being made to fix permissions right now ; for a real distribution , you 'd probably want to correct this , but it 's harmless enough for demonstration purposes .
This gets you the first basic parts of a root filesystem , containing only the libraries ( and headers ) future builds will use .
Busybox
When it comes to embedded root filesystems , busybox is probably the best starting point .
Busybox offers a reasonably complete set of core system utilities all built into a single binary , which uses the name it gets invoked with to determine what function to perform .
This , coupled with a lot of links , allows dozens of the main system programs to be bundled into small amount of space .
This is n't always necessary , but it is convenient for our purposes .
Downloading busybox
Busybox can be downloaded from its downloads page ( see Related topics ) .
The archive is just a standard tarball and can be unpacked in a build directory .
I used version 1.10.2 .
Configuring busybox
Busybox is built around similar configuration tools to those used for crosstool - ng and the Linux kernel .
To build a default configuration , run make defconfig .
This creates the default configuration .
A following make menuconfig allows you to change settings ; under " Busybox Settings , " the " Build Options " menu allows you to specify a static build .
Do that , because the default crosstool - ng build of uClibc requires it .
You might sometimes prefer a dynamically linked binary , to reduce the size of the executable , but the size problem is n't such a big deal on a system where nearly every binary is just a symbolic link .
As with the kernel , the top - level Makefile has a CROSS_COMPILE variable which holds the prefix to use on the names of compiler tools .
Set it to the same value you used before .
Building busybox
To build busybox , just run make .
Surprisingly , there was a compilation problem during the build , which required me to add < linux / types.h > to the main libbb.h header .
With that out of the way , the compile completed quite quickly .
Installing busybox
To install busybox , you need to run make install , but specify the root filesystem path :
$ make CONFIG_PREFIX=$HOME/7800 / rootfs install
This copies in the busybox binary and creates all of the necessary links .
This root filesystem now has libraries and all the common UNIX utilities .
What 's missing ?
Device nodes
You need device nodes .
There are two ways to provide device nodes for a root file system .
One is to statically create all the device nodes you plan to have , the other is to use something like udev , which provides an automatic current device node tree for the current kernel .
While udev is extremely elegant , it can also be fairly slow , and embedded systems have the luxury of being able to predict their hardware components .
Creating the needed device nodes
Many programs depend on access to device nodes , such as / dev/ console or / dev/null .
Device nodes are typically made at runtime on ARM systems , using the mdev utility , part of busybox .
In fact , this has already been done by the initrd filesystem ; one of the changes above was to move the already populated / dev mount point onto the new root filesystem .
You can manually create key device nodes , but it is usually not worth the trouble ; mdev is smarter .
Mount points
Several mount points are required .
The /sys and / proc mount points are used to move the sysfs and procfs virtual filesystems .
The / dev directory is used as a mount point for a tmpfs filesystem , populated by mdev .
These directories do not need any other contents :
$ cd $ HOME / 7800 / rootfs
$ mkdir sys proc dev
Etcetera
The /etc directory , while not strictly necessary to get to a shell prompt , is very useful to get to a useful shell prompt .
The most important part during initial booting is the init.d subdirectory , which init searches for system startup files .
Create a trivial rcS script and give it execute permissions for initial system startup :
$ mkdir rootfs/etc/init.d
Create the rootfs / etc/ init.d/rcS file with the following contents :
#!/bin/sh
echo " Hello , world ! "
Now mark it executable :
$ chmod 755 rootfs/etc/init.d/rcS
Creating a disk image
Make a large empty file
You can create a file system image by copying blocks from / dev / zero into a file , or just by copying an existing image .
Whatever size space you have available ( remembering that 12 MB are already reserved for the first three partitions ) , you can create a file of that size with dd .
This creates a nice roomy 64MB root filesystem :
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=rootfs.local bs=1M count=64
Format the file
The various mkfs utilities can be run on files , not just on disks .
To build an ext3 root filesystem ( the kind the initrd looks for ) , run mkfs.ext3 on your disk image :
$ mkfs.ext3 rootfs.local
The mkfs utility prompts you as to whether or not to proceed even though the file is not a block special device :
rootfs.tmp is not a block special device .
Proceed anyway ?
( y , n ) y
Mount the new disk image
To mount the disk image , use the -o loop option to the mount command again to mount the image somewhere .
$ mount -o loop rootfs .
local / mnt
Copy the rootfs files to the mounted disk
The pax utility is particularly good at this .
$ cd 7800 / rootfs
$ pax -r - w - p e .
/ mnt
This copies the directory tree you 've just created to / mnt , preserving symlinks and special files ( except for sockets , but you can live without the log socket ) .
Unmount the image
Once again , having finished work on the image , unmount it :
$ umount / mnt
Getting the images back on the card
Copying files back
You might wonder why the above procedure did n't just use the card as a filesystem .
The answer is that , in general , it is better not to use flash filesystems very heavily , because flash devices have much shorter life expectancies than hard drive media under heavy load .
Thus , the complicated edits and copies are done to disk images , then the disk images are copied back as a single write operation .
Copy in the initrd
Copy the initrd image in to the third partition of the SD card :
$ dd if=initrd.local of=/dev/sdd3 bs=16
k
Copy in the root filesystem
Likewise , copy the filesystem image in to the fourth partition of the SD card .
$ dd if=rootfs.local of=/dev/sdd4 bs=16
k
Wait for device access
Do not yank the SD card out of the reader right away .
Sometimes it can take a few extra seconds for the system to finish writing .
Wait until any activity lights have stabilized , then wait a few seconds longer just to be sure .
The boot process reviewed
What does init do ?
The init program manages system startup , and then keeps the system running .
For instance , when processes die , init is the program that collects their exit status values so the kernel can finish unloading them .
The exact startup procedure varies from one version of Linux to another .
In this case , it is the busybox version of init that will be booting our test system .
You may have wondered why the previous startup script uses exec / sbin / init rather than just invoking init .
The reason is that the startup script was the previous init , and had the special process ID 1 .
The init program does not become the system 's startup daemon unless its process ID is 1 ; exec causes it to take over the calling shell 's process ID , rather than acquiring a new one .
Initial startup
The init program starts by running the first system startup script , /etc/init.d/rcS .
( If there is no such file , it prints a warning message and continues without it . )
After this , it runs according to the instructions in /etc / inittab , if it exists .
In the absence of an /etc / inittab , busybox init runs a shell on the console , and deals gracefully with reboot and halt requests .
Bringing it together
With your own kernel , a slightly customized initrd , and your own root filesystem , you should now be able to boot the system to a shell prompt .
If you created the rcS file , the system should greet you on boot .
Now you have a working , if rather minimal , Linux system , built entirely from source , and assembled by hand .
What you do next is up to you .
I suggest installing some video games , but you could always configure the system for a database server or a Web server .
If you plan to do anything that will produce a lot of disk activity , consider using an external hard drive attached via USB .

It seems like just yesterday we passed the 1,000 per day mark , but that was way back in April .
From Peter Viles at the LA Times : Estimate : 1,300 foreclosures every business day in California
Banks and lenders have now foreclosed on $ 100 billion worth of California homes over the past two years , and are foreclosing at the rate of 1,300 houses every business day , according to a new report from ForeclosureRadar.com .
The report , covering foreclosure activity in California in July , notes that new mortgage defaults are declining , but foreclosures are continuing to rise sharply .
" It is clear that far fewer homeowners are finding a way out of foreclosure , " the company reports .
The pace of foreclosures in California -- 1,300 every business day -- has more than tripled from the year - ago rate of 415 per day , Foreclosure Radar estimates .
Note that the decline in defaults is related to changes at Countrywide .

As a caller noted on Alex ’s show earlier today , it appears YouTube has implemented its very own version of H.R. 1955 , entitled the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act. 1955 is in the Senate and is not law as of this writing .
For the millions of people who post on YouTube , however , it may as well be law .
Sen. Joseph Lieberman attempted to pressure YouTube into censoring videos earlier this year .
You may recall Sen. Joseph Lieberman earlier this year barking orders from on - high down at Google , the owner of YouTube , demanding the popular video site block content “ depicting assassinations , death of US soldiers , as well as weapon training and speeches that encourage violence and could be used as a tool to create homegrown terrorists , ” as Dee Chisamera writes for eFluxMedia .
At the time , YouTube called foul and said while “ we respect and understand [ Lieberman ’s ] views , YouTube encourages free speech and defends everyone ’s right to express unpopular points of view , ” according to ABC News .
Four short months later , after media attention has long since shifted elsewhere , YouTube and Google have sent the Fist Amendment to the recycle bin .
YouTube has posted “ a warning in its community guidelines meant to stop such videos from being uploaded on YouTube , ” a move that apparently pleased the neocon Lieberman , at least somewhat .
“ Sen. Lieberman hailed YouTube ’s decision to strengthen its standards , however , he also continued to urge Google , who owns YouTube , to remove all videos produced by Foreign Terrorist Organizations , not just those that violate community guidelines , ” explains Chisamera .
Even so , Lieberman insists YouTube represents “ a tool for Islamist terrorist organizations to recruit and train followers . ”
That said , it is time to put all of this into perspective .
First and foremost , the validity of al - Qaeda and other supposed terrorist videos that inevitably end up on YouTube must be challenged .
As researcher and computer security consultant Neal Krawetz demonstrated last year during a conference in Las Vegas , an IntelCenter video allegedly produced by al - Qaeda ’s video unit , As - Sahab , appears to be a cobbled together fake .
IntelCenter is directly related to U.S. intelligence , a fact admitted on Wikipedia .
IntelCenter has released a number of supposed al - Qaeda videos featuring any number of CIA and intelligence assets , including the Muslim Brotherhood and intelligence asset Ayman al - Zawahiri , the patsy “ 20th hijacker ” Fawaz al - Nashimi , the U.S. military operative Muhammad Atta ( who attended the Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery , Alabama ) , and fellow “ hijacker ” patsies Ziad Al - Jarrah and Waleed al - Shehri .
IntelCenter seems to be in competition with another CIA contractor , the SITE Institute , an organization featuring a number of characters right out of the Mossad ’s central casting .
In other words , Lieberman and Google should have banned the CIA and Mossad from posting fake videos — and a number of the videos are so obviously fake as to be a bad joke — and dispensed with the new standards .
As Jason Rutberg notes in the above video , a number of activists and patriots have had their videos removed from YouTube under its newly implemented standards .
Rutberg claims the removals — not of Islamic terrorist videos , but rather political activist videos — and YouTube ’s Lieberman influenced standards are part of an implementation of H.R. 1955 : Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , otherwise known as the Thought Crime bill because it would criminalize political thought and speech .
1955 targets American citizens , i.e. , “ homegrown terrorists , ” for “ violent radicalization , ” described as “ the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system … to advance political , religious , or social change . ”
According to the authors of 1955 , the “ Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens , ” that is to say blogs and , if we follow Lieberman ’s train of thought , YouTube and Google Video .
1955 “ is just too awesomely obscene for words .
It exceeds not only the scope of my vocabulary , but my imagination as well , ” writes Jeff Knaebel .
“ The minions and hired agents of politicians are free to murder , rape and pillage on government hire using our money , but to imagine alternatives to them and the degraded , psychopathic political ‘ leaders ’ who design and perpetrate these atrocities is legislated as a thought crime ! ”
Of course , these psychopaths understand the viral power of YouTube and that is why they are attempting to scour it of activist video .
For a couple years running now , Google and YouTube have sabotaged Alex Jones ’ videos , removing the videos entirely or altering viewing statistics .
In addition , Google has blocked Prison Planet and Infowars search information , most notably in regard to Charlie Sheen ’s 9/11 comments in 2006 .
Now it appears Alex Jones ’ videos and those of others at odds with the global elite will be removed from YouTube as the products of “ homegrown terrorists ” bent on “ violent radicalization , ” that is to say telling the truth contrary to the lies released daily by the government and the corporate media .
It will be interesting to see what happens if and when 1955 emerges from the Senate .
Section 899D of the bill establishes a Center for the Study of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism in the United States .
“ This will be an institution affiliated with the Department of Homeland Security , ” notes Knaebel .
“ It will study and determine how to detain thought criminals , ” including those posting on YouTube .

Representatives from South Florida ’s Monroe County are going to make a pitch this week for undeveloped private land in the Florida Keys to be bought with federal and state money , and then turned into a national park .
While I ’m all for more protection of beach and ocean areas in the Keys , I think this is a terrible idea for several reasons .
The group in favor of protecting the private land from development plans to ask for $ 1.2 billion from both the U.S. government and Florida State government to cover the cost of buying the property from its landowners .
About 7,372 acres of land that contains sensitive vegetation would be bought and would comprise the national park — not the entirety of the Florida Keys .
A lawyer who represents some of the landowners has already said that it ’s “ the dumbest thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
So here ’s why I think the proposal to make these areas a national park is a very bad idea :
It will anger landowners who do n’t like the aggressive attempt to buy their property , creating animosity toward a potential national park from the beginning .
Some of these landowners also might be content to help protect the land and remain as landowners .
As someone who has worked for the National Park Service as a ranger in nearby Everglades National Park , and visited the also nearby Biscayne and Dry Tortugas National Parks , the National Park Service could really use more money to help protect those areas a little more .
Stretching taxpayer dollars to pay for an additional national park in South Florida would be too much .
For instance , the Everglades really need to rebuild the Flamingo Visitor Area after it was devastated by recent hurricanes , and have made a dynamite proposal to build a solar - powered eco-lodge .
It still needs funding .
The fragmented nature of the land parcels in discussion would also make it challenging for park staff to patrol and enforce park regulations and protections given the large volume of visitor traffic to the Keys and also the large number of businesses whose practices could potentially be at odds with conservation goals .
It sets a dangerous precedent for local communities who have failed from the start to conserve their own land areas to ask the federal government for a bailout in the form of a national park .
Why ca n’t they impose the strict regulations they desire themselves ?
As I said from the beginning , it ’s great that a group of citizens living in the Florida Keys would like to provide greater environmental protection to certain areas– I just do n’t think asking for a national park is the right way to do it .
The National Park Service at this moment in the time is drastically underfunded and has a huge backlog of deferred maintenance .
Let ’s improve our current national parks before we make new ones .

Researchers at Purdue University have determined that raising the speed limit from 65 to 70 on Interstate 65 in Indiana has not increased the probability of fatalities or severe injuries .
" These findings are important because the influence of speed limits on roadway safety has been a subject of continuous debate in the state of Indiana and nationwide , " said Fred Mannering , a professor of civil engineering .
" Indiana highway - related accidents result in about 900 fatalities and 40,000 injuries annually and place an incredible social and economic burden on the state . "
The findings add new fuel to an ongoing debate , with some studies indicating that the benefits of raising the speed limit outweigh potential safety hazards while others suggest just the opposite .
" The safety of raising the speed limit has been a matter of considerable concern in Indiana since the state raised its speed limits on rural interstates and selected multilane highways on July 1 , 2005 , " Mannering said .
" Everybody expects that when you increase the speed limit , injuries and the severity of injuries are going to increase , but that has n't happened on the interstate highway system in Indiana . "
Findings are detailed in a research paper presented earlier this year at a meeting of the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies of science and engineering .
The paper , appearing in an upcoming issue of the Transportation Research Record , was written by Mannering and research assistant Nataliya V. Malyshkina .
The researchers used a series of mathematical equations in " multinomial logit models " to calculate accident probabilities based on motor vehicle accident data from 2004 and 2006 , before and after the speed limit increased .
The models showed that the increased speed limit did not affect the probability of suffering a severe injury in an accident .
Understanding the magnitude of the safety impact of increasing speed limits , or whether safety is improved or compromised , remains a contentious subject , Mannering said .
That 's because research has not been able to convincingly unravel the effects of speed limit changes from factors such as speed enforcement ; vehicle miles traveled ; vehicle occupancy ; seat belt usage ; alcohol use ; proportions of passenger cars , minivans , pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles ; and vehicle safety features , including air bags and antilock brakes .
The models used in the research calculate " estimated probabilities " based on accident data .
Of the 204,382 accidents on state highways in 2004 , 21 percent resulted in injuries and about 0.4 percent were fatal .
The same percentages were seen in the 182,922 accidents in 2006 .
Comparing only highways where the speed limit rose to 70 showed virtually no change from 2004 to 2006 .
The speed - limit increase made Indiana the 30th state to raise interstate speed limits up to 70 mph on rural interstates .
Findings by other researchers suggest even higher speed limits on interstate highways might also result in no rise in the probability of severe injuries .
" If going from 65 to 70 does n't have a significant effect on the severity of accidents , you have to ask yourself , what about 70 to 75 ? "
Mannering said .
" At what point does it begin to impact safety ? "
The change has highlighted the tradeoff between speed and safety , a debate that began more than three decades ago since passage of the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act in 1974 , which mandated a 55 mph national maximum speed limit on interstate highways in the United States , Mannering said .
State and federal speed - limit policy changes have been driven by various research findings and subsequent legislation , including the National Highway System Designation
Act of 1995 , which gave states freedom to set interstate speed limits .
Most research efforts have concluded that the 1974 - mandated 55 mph interstate speed limit saved lives , a conclusion that has been confirmed by some studies looking at recent speed limit increases on interstates .
" For example , one study found that a speed limit increase from 55 to 65 resulted in roughly a 3 percent increase in the accident rate and a 24 percent increase in the probability of a fatality once an accident occurred , " Mannering said .
" But then other studies have contended that legislation - enabled speed - limit increases have actually saved lives .
One study argued that increasing from 55 to 65 saved lives because of shifts in law enforcement resources , the ability of higher speed limit interstates to attract riskier drivers away from inherently more dangerous non-interstate highways and reducing how often drivers speed up and slow down . "
The state also increased the speed limit from 55 to 60 on non-interstate multilane roads , but findings were inconclusive regarding the impact on those roadways , Mannering said .
However , the researchers cautioned that future speed limit increases should be carefully assessed for those roads on a case - by - case basis .
The potential for accidents is higher on such roadways because of factors including stop - and - go traffic and vehicles entering the road from various businesses and residential areas .

Rep. Michael Burgess ( R - TX ) reports from the floor of the House that the Republicans have been cut out of the process and called unpatriotic for not blindly supporting the fraudulent bailout .
He says the only debate has been about what talking points to use on the American people .
The most ominous revelation is when he claims the Speaker has declared martial law .
“ I have been thrown out of more meetings in this capital in the last 24 hours than I ever thought possible , as a duly elected representative of 825,000 citizens of north Texas . ”
Said Congressman Burgess .
Burgess asks the Speaker of the House to post the bailout bill on the internet for at least 24 hours instead of passing the largest piece of legislation in US financial history in the “ dark of night . ”
The most frightening part of Rep. Burgess ’ one - minute floor speech is when he says , “ Mr. Speaker I understand we are under Martial Law as declared by the speaker last night . ”

Ventura denies reports he 's running for Senate
Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura is shooting down media reports that he 's decided to run for Senate .
National Public Radio today reported that Ventura says he 's running for the seat , quoting him as saying " I run " because of Senator Norm Coleman 's support for the Iraq war .
But Ventura tells the Associated Press he had been speaking hypothetically .
Ventura says in responding to the NPR reporter 's question about why he would run , " I gave him the reasons why I would run .
But I said ultimately , it will come down to whether I want to change my lifestyle and go to that lifestyle or not . "
ABC News followed up with a headlined , " Jesse Ventura To Run for Senate , " citing the NPR report .
Ventura says bluntly that no one knows whether he will run  not even his wife .
He says the decision wo n't be made until next Tuesday , the filing deadline .
On the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina 's devastating landfall in New Orleans , residents all along the U.S. coastline today cast a wary eye out to Tropical Storms Gustav and Hanna , both predicted to ramp up to hurricane strength and possibly strike the United States early next week .
The 2005 season — the busiest season on record — was an obvious wake - up call for emergency officials and coastal residents .
Yet three years later , fears linger that history will repeat .
Worries range from concerns that Gulf oil production will be disrupted to the fear that a colossal Category 5 storm will eventually hit the United States .
Meanwhile , forecasters are alarmed at the tendency , even after all that has occurred , of those in harm 's way to ignore evacuation warnings .
1 . New Orleans Could Get Hit Again
With the city still limping from the effects of Katrina , New Orleans residents get no rest .
City and state officials have already kicked new evacuation plans into gear with the threat from Gustav .
" They 've learned a few lessons , " said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen .
Katrina was the costliest and one of the deadliest storms in U.S. history , killing at least 1,500 people .
But while the public may focus on New Orleans , forecasters are just as worried about hurricanes hitting any coastal U.S. city .
" A landfall is a landfall , " Feltgen said .
Tampa , Fla. , which has n't had a major hurricane since the 1920s , is one of the cites forecasters worry about .
Before Hurricane Charley suddenly changed course in August 2004 , Tampa was in its crosshairs , waking up residents to the risk that hurricanes poses there , Feltgen said .
2 . Oil Drilling and Gas Production Could Be Impeded Katrina 's waves and flood waters damaged some offshore oil rigs , refineries and pipelines that supply large portions of the country with fuel , and as a result , gas prices went up .
With fuel prices already reaching record highs in the past year , many are concerned that any hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico could drive prices up even further .
Any offshore rigs that lie in the projected path of a storm are evacuated several days in advance and production is halted to prevent spills — rigs in the path of Gustav have already been cleared , said Cathy Landry , a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute .
Most of the rigs damaged during Katrina were older models and were retired after the storm , Landry said , adding that newer models are built to withstand very high winds and waves .
" The weak links are probably out of the system , " she told LiveScience .
The main causes of the Katrina - related price increases were not damaged rigs , but flooded refineries , floating pipelines pulled off their moorings , and power failures to offshore pipelines , Landry said .
Since the monster 2005 season , oil companies have worked to shore up refineries and pipelines and install back - up generators to keep fuel flowing , Landry added .
While a slight drop in fuel supply , a " blip " as Landry called it , could be expected while the rigs in the path of the storm are shut down , once the storm is gone , production should resume .
3 . Global Warming Could Be Making
Things Worse
As Earth 's oceans absorb some of the heat generated by climbing greenhouse gas levels , some scientists predict these warmer waters will fuel more , and stronger , storms .
Hurricanes feed off of the warm , moist air over tropical waters , and warmer waters can produce more intense storms , with faster winds and bigger waves .
Studies suggest that warmer waters can also increase the frequency of storms , though some scientists have argued just the opposite , with projections that global warming will change wind circulation in such a way that it stifles the development of hurricanes .
Some researchers are also predicting that the hurricane season will become longer in a warming world because ocean waters are warming up earlier in the season , which officially begins on June 1 and ends on Nov. 30 .
While most hurricanes tend to form in August and September , when water temperatures peak , earlier warming is bringing bigger storms to the early months of the season , the research suggests .
4 . A Category 5 Storm Could Make Landfall
With the threat of more intense storms produced by global warming , some scientists are concerned that this could mean more Category 5 storms , the highest ranking on the Saffir - Simpson strength scale , with potentially greater impact to coasts .
These storms have wind speeds in excess of 156 mph ( 250 kph ) and can produce storm surges of more than 18 feet ( 5.5 meters ) .
Only three Category 5 storms have ever made landfall in the United States : Hurricane Andrew , which hit Homestead , Fla. , in 1992 ; Hurricane Camille , which came ashore near the mouth of the Mississippi River in 1969 ; and the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 , which struck the Florida Keys .
( Katrina was a Category 5 while offshore in the Gulf of Mexico , but weakened just before landfall ) .
There is , however , no way to predict just how many Category 5 storms a given season will produce , when the next one will develop or whether or not it will make landfall .
5 . People Wo n't Leave
More than half of the U.S. population lives on the country 's coastline , and the vast majority have never experienced even a weak hurricane , Feltgen said .
Many populations along the Northeast coast have n't experienced a hurricane in several generations , though the area is still vulnerable to storms .
Having little exposure to hurricanes can lead to an " It wo n't happen to me " mentality that means people in vulnerable areas do n't have plans in place for what they will do when a hurricane strikes .
In a Mason - Dixon poll taken earlier this year , more than half of coastal residents responded that they did n't have a personal hurricane plan .
" And that is alarming , " Felgen said in a telephone interview yesterday .
Coastal residents should plan ahead where they will go if they decide to evacuate , how to get there and what critical things they need to take with them .
If they decide to stay , they need to have provisions they can live off of alone in their home for 3 to 7 days , Feltgen advised .
The call to evacuate can often lie with government emergency managers , who can face a tough decision because of the uncertainty in hurricane forecasts .
Michael Metzger , an MIT graduate student has developed a computer model to aide these decisions .
The model promotes evacuations done in stages to avoid congestion on evacuation routes , which was a problem in the eventual evacuation of New Orleans .
Asian - Americans have not always been the most politically active constituency , but that may change this November .
Another group to watch : Asian Americans
WASHINGTON — Asian - Americans have not always been the most politically active constituency , but that may change this November .
“ Historically , they are less focused on politics , but they are an emerging bloc , suddenly in the last few years in both state and national elections , ” said Gautam Dutta , the executive director of the Asian - American Action Fund .

Of U.S. - born adults eligible to vote , Asians were 18 percentage points behind non-Asians in voter turnout in the 2006 midterm election .
The naturalized Asian community was four percentage points behind non-Asians in voting rates that same year , according to a UCLA report released earlier this month .
But the voter turnout during California ’s primary on Feb. 5 suggested a boom in voter participation could be in the making .
More than half a million Asian Americans went to the polls in the nation ’s largest state , according to Presidentpolls2008.com .
There , Asian - Americans made a difference voting for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama by a 3 - 1 margin .
CNN , using exit poll data , credited Clinton ’s victory in California to “ an Asian American and Latino voting bloc . ”
Clinton got more support from Asian - Americans in California because she had endorsements from community leaders with strong influence among rank - and - file voters , Dutta said .
Since 2002 , there has only been a slight increase in Asian - American youths turning out to vote .
In the 2002 midterm elections , 16 percent of Asian - Americans in the 18 - 29 - year - old age group voted .
Four years later , 17 percent of them voted , according to civicyouth.org , a website that researches political involvement of American young people .
But experts are optimistic about the Asian - American turnout for this year ’s presidential election .
“ In 2008 , we ’ll probably see more Asian - Americans at the ballot box because of large numbers , ” said Paul Ong , a professor in the Public Relations and Asian - American Studies departments at UCLA .
“ I ’ve noticed my students are much more interested this year . ”
That vote could also be crucial in local , state and congressional elections .
The entire House of Representatives and one - third of the Senate must stand for reelection this year .
“ In local and state elections , ( Asian - Americans ) are very critical of who wins and loses , ” Ong said .
“ ( If they are ) concentrated in large numbers that makes a difference , and around D.C. and Virginia they are starting to emerge as a potentially important vote . ”
In 2006 , Virginia ’s Senate race was an indication that the Asian - American vote may be gaining in influence .
That year Democrat Jim Webb narrowly beat Republican incumbent George Allen ; 78 percent of voting Asian - Americans chose Webb .
“ He would n’t have won , ” Dutta said , adding he expects that Asian - Americans will flock to the ballot box in 2008 .
Ong predicted the Asian - American vote will be stronger in 2008 due to increases in population and also in the number of individuals who become citizens .
“ In a number of areas , they ’ve reached a critical level where they begin believing they can have an influence , ” he said .
“ It gives them more reason to register and to turn out to vote . ”
The Asian American political awakening could trace back to 2006 , when fierce debates over immigration raged and talks about anti-immigrant legislation got many of them thinking about politics , Ong said .
“ We ’ve been ignored for the longest time , and this time noticed a little more , ” said Kathleen To , president of 80 - 20 Political Action Committee .
“ We only make up about 5 percent of the U.S. population , nobody thought we'd be that important . ”
The candidates have reached out a little , but there has been more buzz surrounding the Latino voters because they are concentrated in swing states .
“ Asian - Americans are essentially about a decade behind where Latinos are now , ” Ong said .
“ Hopefully both parties and others will pay attention to that development . ”

WhatsApp Plus and GBWhatsApp are two of the best apps in the market , but what most people want to know is which one is the best .
They have both pros and cons , the real problem here is which one would fit your lifestyle better .
Both are alternatives for WhatsApp and each one having their own market .
They are easy to download and install in the mobile phone .
We have compiled a list of reasons which ones would fit you better .
WhatsApp Plus
It let you alter the themes and styles .
Themes are available in the app itself , there are more than 700 themes to pick from .
It gives you the right to choose the look and feel of your app .
It has a plethora of emoticons available .
If you are the type of person that likes emoticons then here is your chance to give your conversations some kind of spice in them .
For some people smileys are always good to use , and if you are one of them then this app would be a great use for you .
Not comfortable with the size and quality ?
Fortunately , you can change all of that and give it a new look .
WhatsApp
Plus lets you do all of that to your heart ’s content .
GBWhatsApp
If you want something that is closer to the original then this app would be right for you .
It has the same app features that the original have , but it has some extra , making it even better than the old WhatsApp .
You can hide your presence as it lets you hide the last time you used the program , your online status , blue stick , etc .
The app is customizable for your own preference .
It gives you the power to send multiple documents in one action .
This is great for business since it can send multiple documents and file .
Perhaps , one of the greatest is the ability to send 90 pictures simultaneously .
Of course , this is not a problem for most app , but the problem starts with how many pictures can be sent without sacrificing the quality of the pictures .
That is not all as you would be able to hide the message that you are typing , lets you develop your own themes , has a selfish flash , etc .
Conclusion
If you like the original WhatsApp , both alternatives would be good for you .
In the end , it is all up to you to decide on which one would be the best choice for you .
I have given you some information to help you with decision making , but I ca n’t decide for you .

Awatef Mahmud , a 53 - year - old mother of five who sat on a nearby stoop waiting for her bread to cool , said higher prices had led to dietary changes for her family .
“ Instead of buying one kilo of meat every week , we buy a half a kilo , ” she said .
“ People used to buy pasta to make for their kids .
But now that it ’s four and a half pounds , ” she said , referring to the currency , “ they give them bread instead . ”
Economists say that rather than seeking to become self - sufficient with food , countries in this region should grow crops for which they have a competitive advantage , like produce or flowers , which do not require much water and can be exported for top dollar .
For example , Doron Ovits , a confident 39 - year - old with sunglasses pushed over his forehead and a deep tan , runs a 150 - acre tomato and pepper empire in the Negev Desert of Israel .
His plants , grown in greenhouses with elaborate trellises and then exported to Europe , are irrigated with treated sewer water that he says is so pure he has to add minerals back .
The water is pumped through drip irrigation lines covered tightly with black plastic to prevent evaporation .
A pumping station outside each greenhouse is equipped with a computer that tracks how much water and fertilizer is used ; Mr. Ovits keeps tabs from his desktop computer .
“ With drip irrigation , you save money .
It ’s more precise , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t run it like a peasant , a farmer .
You have to run it like a businessman . ”
Israel is as obsessed with water as Mr. Ovits is .
It was there , in the 1950s , that an engineer invented modern drip irrigation , which saves water and fertilizer by feeding it , drop by drop , to a plant ’s roots .
Since then , Israel has become the world ’s leader in maximizing agricultural output per drop of water , and many believe that it serves as a viable model for other countries in the Middle East and North Africa .
Already , Tunisia has reinvigorated its agriculture sector by adopting some of the desert farming advances pioneered in Israel , and Egypt ’s new desert farms now grow mostly water - sipping plants with drip irrigation .
Wow , I 've been reading the Wiki entries on Watchmen . . .
There 's a surprising amount of information there , if people who 've never read the book are curious .
But not enough to spoil the novel , because it 's presented in a very , very dry manner .
Anyhoo , I 'm really excited and will DEFINITELY pick up the novel before the movie comes out .
After reading about Dr. Manhattan , I was surprised to read that at one time they wanted to cast Arnold friggin ' Schwarzenegger in the role .
Somehow I can't picture the governator as a brilliant quantum physicist turned all - powerful being .
Boy did the music managers at the GOP convention miss a chance last week .
They played Heart 's barely listenable number " Barracuda " to cheer Sarah Palin 's viciously effective debut , drawing predictable complaints from the band 's aging divas , who would like nothing more than to warble at a Barack Obama inaugural .
This minor controversy might not be so bad except that Republicans missed an opportunity that should have been obvious to a party with its finger on the throbbing pulse of middle America : they must win red states .
After the Alaska governor finished speaking Wednesday , a female vocalist came on stage to sing the National Anthem .
Her name is Gretchen Wilson and her most famous song is " Redneck Woman . "
Released in 2004 , the hit single anticipated much of what our second female vice presidential candidate would have to say .
The song 's point of view is that of a generic redneck woman , " no high - class broad , " who is a proud " product of my raisin ’ . "
She does n't " give a rip " that some people look down on her .
In fact , she 'll " stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip " and you 'll just have to deal with that , you awful snob .
The redneck woman refuses to buy apparel from Victoria ’s Secret when she can " buy the same damn thing on a Wal - Mart shelf half price . "
And if you think she 's " trashy " or " a little too hard core " ?
Well , then she 's not the one who 's being narrow minded .
Wilson should have belted out her signature song then and there .
It would have been the perfect compliment to the redneck war cry Palin had just issued .
The Governor denied that she cared one whit about the " good opinion " of D.C. opinion molders , and played up her common sense fiscal austerity and love of her own small town .
She gave several nods to her embattled family and dragged them — including her knocked - up 17 - year - old daughter , her fiancé , and her young baby boy with Down syndrome — on stage to wave to the fired up crowd .
It was an amazing success .
Polls shifted across the board in favor of a McCain - Palin ticket , and Democrats have so far proved that they do n't really know what to do about this .
At a rally in Michigan , Obama took the high road , calling her bio " compelling " and drawing boos from the crowd .
According to Politico , he pressed on to explain , " I mean that sincerely .
Mother , governor , moose shooter . "
Per Obama 's small joke , Palin is fast becoming a redneck folk hero .
In the same vein as Chuck Norris jokes , " little known Palin facts " are being manufactured at a pretty rapid clip , and some of them have been collected on the website PalinFacts.org .
Entries tend to come in two varieties : Palin the liberal slayer and Palin the demigod .
For example : Did you know that Sarah Palin 's suit is " made from 100 % dead liberal skin " ?
And : " It 's not over until Sarah Palin says it 's over . " ??
Once the glow fades a bit — and it will — the Palin gambit could still keep the Republicans competitive where it really counts : turnout .
Hillary Clinton 's support in the primaries was much more pronounced among rural , poorer white voters .
That did n't quite do the trick , but the makeup of the general electorate is different from that of the Democratic Party .
Dems are most concentrated in old urban centers , underrepresented elsewhere .
Palin's job is to get those located " elsewhere " to vote for someone they perceive to be one of their own .
From a puppy to a senior , your dog will experience a lot of changes , both physically and mentally , throughout their life .
Pet owners should not only be aware of these changes , but they should also know how to best care for their pups at each stage of their lives , so they get the nutrition , exercise and stimulation they need .
Tatum O'Neal Gets Off Crack Free
It looks like another celebrity is getting a slap on the hand .
was arrested on June 2nd for trying to score herself some crack and coke from a bum .
A Manhattan judge must have thought it was n't too big of a deal .
The sentence handed down was for Tatum to spend two half - day sessions in a drug treatment program and pay a whopping $ 95 fee .
If O'Neal follows the judge 's orders the case will be thrown out .
So the moral of the story is ... If you 're going to get caught buying drugs , do it in Manhattan .

Secret Service en route to Biden 's house this evening RAW STORY
Published : Friday August 22 , 2008
Print This Email This Could Biden become Obama VP ?
" The United States Secret Service has dispatched a protective detail to assume the immediate protection of Sen. Joseph Biden ( D - DE ) , " a source told ABC News ' Jake Tapper , " indicating in all likelihood that Biden has been officially notified that Sen.
Barack Obama has selected him to be his running mate . "
On CNN this evening , a source told a reporter he could not confirm Biden had been selected , but did n't dissuade her of the notion .
Network pundits talked up the Delaware senator 's foreign policy experience -- he serves as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- and mentioned repeatedly that he is a Catholic .
Two others said to be finalists for the VP slot -- Sen. Evan Bayh , ( D - IN ) , and Virginia 's Democratic Governor Tim Kaine -- " have been told they have not been selected for the vice presidential slot . "
" Biden was last seen minutes ago at his Wilmington estate where his extended brood is gathering , " ABC reported around 1030 pm ET .
A second dark horse is possible -- Rep. Chet Edwards of Texas , floated Friday afternoon by Democratic officials .
Edwards represents a district including President Bush 's Crawford ranch .
Biden ran for president in 1987 .
After being accused of plagiarizing a speech from a British Labor Party leader , and a followup revelation that he 'd plagiarized a law school paper , he dropped out of the race in Sept. 1987 , saying his bid had been sidelined by " the exaggerated shadow " of his mistakes .
RAW STORY WILL PROVIDE FULL COVERAGE OF THE VP CHOICE TOMORROW MORNING .
The Obama campaign would not comment on the ABC report .
Obama will announce officially by text message to supporters Saturday morning .

We got a tip .
Someone said they had bought the dog on 129th Street , I think it was .
We picked the dog up from somebody else , on First Avenue . ”
The men rescue pedigreed animals sold for a pittance to buy drugs , animals used for fighting and bait , and colonies of feral cats that angry neighbors have tried to shoot or poison .
They have received calls from Australia ( “ Dingoes , I guess , ” Angel said ) and reports of a serial cat killer in Pennsylvania .
They hand cases of criminal activities to the police .
“ That ’s not our specialty , ” Mr. Missari said .
“ We specialize in getting the abuser away from the dog .
We truly work with the abuser .
We go to a house ; if it ’s really cold out , we see two dogs in the back , we build them a doghouse . ”

The Audio Cable FAQby Jon M. Risch
* Do both speaker cables need to be the same length ?
This one often involves answers that the speed of the signal in the cable ( near the speed of light ) precludes any need to match lengths , and moving your speaker the space of a gnat 's arse will change the sound more , and so on .
What this simplistic answer overlooks , is that if the two speaker cables are not close to each other in DCR , and inductance , the damping will be different , and the high frequency roll - off will be different .
These kinds of things can affect the stereo image and image depth , as the two channels delicate balance has been disrupted .
I recommend against any differences in length for shorter lengths of more than a 2 to 1 ratio , and preferably the closer to the same , the better .
Long runs will be more critical , and would need a closer match still .
--------------------------------------------------
* Can I coil any excess speaker cable up on the floor ?
Not recommended due to increased inductance , and other interaction effects that may cause more than just an extra amount of high frequency roll - off .
A snaking " S " pattern will avoid the worst of any interaction problems .
--------------------------------------------------
* What is bi-wiring ?
Bi-wiring is where the crossover inside the speaker has been separated into it 's HF and LF sections , and separate pairs of connecting terminals provided to access those separate sections independently .
Normally , the LF and HF crossover sections are in parallel , connected internally to the same single pair of binding posts .
For single cable use , a set of jumpers is provided to bridge the terminal pairs , paralleling the separated crossover sections outside the cabinet instead of inside .
Then , separate speaker cables are run from the same amp output to these separated pairs of terminals at the speaker .
* What good does bi-wiring do ?
Some say that any improvement in the sound it makes is strictly due to the decreased total DCR , and this makes the speaker less prone to frequency response variations due to cable resistance .
According to this view , simply running the two cables in parallel at both ends will do the same thing .
In my opinion , this is a very simplistic and incomplete way of looking at the situation .
Once the crossovers have been electrically separated , they present different impedances ( loads ) to the power amp within their passbands and outside of their passbands .
The woofer and corresponding low frequency crossover section will present a low impedance at low frequencies and a high impedance at HF , while the tweeter section will present a low impedance at high frequencies , and high one at LF's .
With the electrical separation , differing currents will flow within the two cables that make up a bi-wire set .
For the separate cable feeding the woofer section , a lot of current will flow at LF 's but not much current at HF's , and the tweeter cable will have some current flow at HF , but very little at LF's .
A division of labor has occured with bi-wiring , whereby a single cable does not have have to carry the HF currents simultaneuously with the LF current .
Two things happen due to this :
1 . The losses in the cable due to " eye- squared - are " losses ( current squared time the resistance equals voltage drop ) are reduced for each frequency band , so that any tendency for the woofer to modulate the tweeter due to current draw is greatly reduced .
This form of IM would be in lock - step with the original signal .
2 . The magnetic fields due to the HF and LF currents have also been separated out , and any tendency for them to intermodulate and cause sonic artifacts has been greatly reduced .
This form of IM would be occuring both at the same time , and in a time delayed form due to mechanical resonances and motor / generator action .
See http://members.xoom.com/Jon_Risch/page7.htm for a more in depth discussion about the benefits of bi-wiring .
* Can I use the A and B outputs on my receiver to bi-wire ?
While this would be very convenient , it can only be done if the outputs are placed in parallel , rather than series .
Many receivers and integrated amps that have two speaker outputs will connect them in series when they are both selected at the same time , to protect the amplifier from an excessively low impedance .
Check your owners manual to see how the A and B output are wired when they are both selected .
A simple test would be to select them both with a speaker only hooked up normally to one of them , if the sound goes dead , then they are connected in series , and you will need to connect both of the bi-wire cables to one pair of output terminals .
* Should both cables be the same kind ?
This is not absolutely necessary , although it can be argued that certain sensitive speakers need the same exact cable in order to minimize any discontinuities in the midrange ( crossover region ) .
However , as long as both cables are of a high quality , this is much less of a problem than it might seem .
An extreme example would be to use heavy gauge zip cord for the woofer , and an exotic high performance cable for the highs .
Some audiophiles have used this approach to great effect , and others found the zip cord on the woofer holding them back .
It never hurts to try , and see how well a particular pairing will work for you .
* Should both cables be the same length ?
This has already been answered above , but many people seem to feel that bi-wiring is even more critical , so the warnings in the answer above about matching length for electrical reasons are perhaps even more relevant .
* Are the bi-wire cables that are all in one jacket as good as separate cables ?
Many cable manufacturer 's offer an all - in - one bi-wire cable , primarily for convenience and a tidier wiring arrangement .
If you read the explanation of how bi-wiring works , then you would realize that placing the cable 's magnetic fields in close proximity within the same cable jacket may compromise the bi-wiring advantage to some degree .
Most experienced audiophiles agree , totally physically separated bi-wire cables tend to sound better than those in a common jacket .
The degree of compromise is going to depend on the spacing between the bi-wire sections within the common jacket , and how much magnetic coupling and motor / generator resonances are going on inside the common cable jacket .
--------------------------------------------------
* How should I terminate my speaker cable ?
First , if all your amp / receiver has those spring loaded terminals , there are not a whole lot of options .
The gold plated pins that are available for such connectors are not an improvement over a good bare stripped wire connection .
If you have spring loaded terminals , save your money and forget the gold - plated pins , use the bare wire , twist it hard and tight , and insert it naked .
If the total wire thickness allows , double the wire over , and jam the doubled - up wire into the terminal opening , you want as much spring pressure on it as possible .
I do not recommend tinning such a conection , and if you have some disposable speaker cable length , about every 6 months , cut off the oxidized exposed bare wire , and start fresh .
Those of you with gold - plated heavy duty 5 - way binding posts , the choice here is clear : gold plated spades , preferably properly crimped .
If you can not make a proper crimp via a crimping tool , then a proper solder joint will be very close in quality to a good crimp .
Amazingly enough , the gold plated spades offered by RS are OK , one of the few RS parts I can recommend at all .
The very best spades are the type with compression washers built into the spade fingers , such as the WBT and the Kimber Postmaster spades .
After spade lugs , the next best connection is a gold - plated expanding / locking banana plug .
Standard non-expanding or non-locking banana plugs with a nickel plating are not very good at all , nor are the cheap gold - plated kinds at RS .
Monster and WBT make the good types of banana plugs .
--------------------------------------------------
* What RCA plugs should I use ?
For DIY interconnects , one of the best is the Cardas RCA plug .
Sonic Frontier 's
The Parts Connection offers the SF brand RCA 's at a reasonable price for teflon insulated plugs , and Apature has some that are quite reasonable also .
WBT has excellent plugs as well .
For all of the above , I recommend only the non-sliding non-spring loaded ground connection versions , as these compromise the ground connection too much .
They should have teflon insulation , and a good grade fo gold plating .
--------------------------------------------------
* Can I bundle all my audio cables together with wire ties and stuff them under the rack / shelf ?
Not a good idea .
Power cords radiate a magnetic field and an electric field that is prone to carrying the interference that rides on all AC power lines to some extent .
This RFI and EMI can get into the interconnects and into the unshielded speaker cables , and cause a low level fuzz or a less than totally silent background , even if it does not cause obvious hum .
The interconencts are considered to be shielded in most cases ( there are self - shielding types , such as the Kimbers , etc. ) , but even the most densely braided copper shield is only about 97 to 98 % coverage , and even if it is doubled up , or has a foil shield to aid it , 60 Hz and the associated garbage can leak in to some extent .
2 % leakage is equivalent to only 34 dB down , although the likely hood of a full bore signal that close to the braid is not that high .
There is also the potential for digital devices such as a CD player to radiate internal RFI and clock noises into other components via the interconnected outputs , and there is also the possiblity of the speaker cable signal getting into the line level interconnects enough to cause signal deterioration .
So it is best to separate the line level interconnect cables from the speaker cables , and both of these from the AC cords , all as much as possible .
Within these groups , separating the digital CDP interconnect from the others , and keeping a phono interconnect away from all others are also good ideas .
Finally , keeping all cables , but especially speaker cables , away from any metal , especially steel , is a good idea .
Any conductive metal will tend to short out an electric field , and distort a magnetic one , while a ferrous metal will definitely affect and distort either type of field .
A few inches to a 1 / 2 inch may be all that is needed to prevent the worst of any potential distortions .
--------------------------------------------------
* Should I raise my speaker cables up off the floor ?
There has been a lot of debate over the more subtle aspects of cable dress , and one of those issues is whether or not speaker cables need to be kept up off of a wood or carpeted floor for better sound .
Consider that most carpeting is made from relatively poor dielectrics , and has a mat underneath it made from who - knows - what that is likely to be damp or hold moisture , while wooden floors may have nails near the cable , and can also hold moisture , then it is not as much of a stretch to consider reducing these bad influences on the speaker cables electric and magnetic fields .
Even concrete can hold a significant amount of moisture , and these moist materials will tend to short out the electric field to some extent .
While not a must do kind of thing , it certainly can't hurt to get the speaker cables up off the floor , and keep them away from metal and steel .
* What should I use ?
Everything from foam cups turned upside down to beanbags to string to little wooden fences have been proposed and touted .
The main idea is to space the cables away from the floor using a dielectric that is better than the carpet or wood floor they were resting on .
The foam cups are decent candidates , but an even better solution is to use the foamed polyethylene pipe insulation available at hardware stores to keep heat loss from hot water heater pipes to a minimum .
The PE is a better dielectric than carpet , and is foamed with a high proportion of air .
You can either cut the pipe insulation in sections , and rest the speaker cable on top of the whole cylider formed by such a section , or slip the cable inside the slitted pipe insulation .
Personally , I would want to minimize the dielectric involvement of the PE pipe insulation , so I would go for the former approach .
--------------------------------------------------
* Whats the best cable in the world ?
What 's the best car in the world ?
These are very personal and subective things , and can not be answered without consideration of your own personal tastes and the system the cable will be used in .
* Whats the best cheap cable in the world ?
Similar situation as above , but compounded by the compromises and trade - offs that you find agreeable compared to someone else .
I can tell you that it is NOT zip cord , or the free OEM interconnects that come with a lot of audio components .
For those first upgrading from zip cord and the freebie interconnects , the vast array of choices is quite bewildering .
You can go homebrew , and see one of my DIY audio cable notes at http://members.xoom.com/Jon_Risch/
( or the notes of many others , such as Thorsten at TNT or others , see : http://www.tnt-audio.com/clinica/tweaks.html and also : http://www.msu.edu/user/churches/diy.htm ) to build your own high performance cables for a fraction of what many high end cables cost .
--------------------------------------------------
* I read your DIY note on cables , and want to use some old doorbell wire I have laying around instead , will it sound as good as the cables in your note ?
Dohhhh !
One of the things I did to generate the information in my DIY notes was to listen critically and under controlled conditions to many different combinations of commercial cables , varying one aspect at a time .
After literally hundreds of man hours , I was able to determine which cables , and which cable materials , gave the best sound .
If I had found door bell wire ( or insert cable of your choice here ) to sound best , I would have included it .
I even include cross-references to other cable manufacturers from the Belden wires in my notes , although I have not listened to all of these myself .
West Penn
Wire has a good reputation for the quality of their cable 's and one of the reasons that I focused on Belden is their reputation for consistency and quality .
Other brands may not have the same quality of copper or the same quality of insulators , so they may not perform as well as the Belden .
Aside from those kinds of issues , it is a forgone conclusion that tinned copper or PVC will not sound as good as bare copper or a superior dielectric ( which includes just about everything else when compared to PVC ) .
If you want to try a different wire or cable , feel free , however , if you construct a cross - connected dual coaxial speaker cable using lesser insulations with a PVC jacket , tinned copper braid and steel core center wires , do n't expect it to sound very good compared to the recommended Belden 89259 with it 's bare copper braid and center wire and foamed teflon insulaton and teflon jacket .
And please do n't then post and say that " Jon Risch 's speaker cable sucks ! " , because you really have n't constructed one of my recommended recipes .
Another example would be the CAT5 speaker cable recipe .
In it , I call out specific CAT5 cables , ones that have the proper combination of conductors , insulators , etc .
Just any old CAT5 cable will not give the same sonic results .
--------------------------------------------------
* You recommend so many different cables in your notes , which one should I use ?
I describe and write about a number of cables to allow some freedom of choice , and to allow those who may have access to one or the other of the recommeded cables to realize their DIY cable project without being forced to custom order a particular cable .
All of the recommended and listed cables will handily outperform run of the mill coaxes and twisted pairs that have inferior materials in them .
I do have my preferences , and I do call them out in my notes .
--------------------------------------------------
* I can't find the cable /s you recommend OR I live in a foreign country , and Belden is not available , OR I can get brand X way cheaper than Belden , what should I use ?
There are several possibilities here , one is to cross reference from the Belden part numbers , another is to obtain the full catalog for the brands and types that are available and match up the preffered materials and constructions , as outlined in my note .
Finally , a last option is to order it from a US stocking distributor , such as Newark .
The 100 foot spool of Belden 89259 only weighs about 5 lbs. , and most US nationwide distributor also have an overseas office , or will ship overseas .

* How can digital interconnect cables from a CD transport to an outboard DAC possibly affect the sound ?
Is n't digital audio just one 's and zero's ?
A very common misconception about digital signal
transmission with respect to audio is that if the signal does
not get corrupted to the point of losing or changing the 1's
and 0's , that nothing else can go wrong .
If the transmission
system had been designed with cost no object , and by
engineers familiar with all the known foibles and problems
of digital transmission of audio signals , then this might
be subtantially true .
No differences could rear their ugly
head .
Unfortunately , the systems we ended up with DO NOT remain
unaffected by such things as jitter , where the transistion
from a 1 to a 0 is modulated with respect to time .
There are
many ways that jitter can affect the final digtial to analog
conversion at the DAC .
Jitter on the transmitted signal can
bleed or feed through the input reciever , and affect the DAC .
How ?
Current drain on the power supplies due to the changing
signal content and the varying demands made on the power
supply to the logic chips and the DAC .
Modulate the power
supply rails , and the DAC will convert at slightly different
times .
This is due to the fact that a logical one or zero is detected by the signal swinging through a regoin from around zero volts to around 5 volts .
The digital logic chips detect the change at a specific PERCENTAGE of that total voltage swing .
HOWEVER the power supply gets modulated , it will
affect the DAC .
One version of this has been popularly
refered to as LIM or Logic Induced Modulation by the
audiophile press .
See :
" Time Distortions Within Digital Audio Equipment Due to Integrated Circuit Logic Induced Modulation Products "
AES Preprint Number : 3105 Convention : 91 1991-10
Authors : Edmund Meitner & Robert Gendron
Many of the logic chips in a digital audio system behave
very poorly with respect to dumping garbage onto the rails
and even worse , onto the ground reference point .
Even as I
post , logic manufacturers such as TI are advertising the
benefits of their latest generation of logic chips that
reduce ground bounce .
The circuitry itself generates it's
own interference , and this can be modulated by almost
anything that also affects the power supply or ground .
The amount of jitter that it takes to affect the analog
output of the signal used to be thought of as fairly high ,
somewhere on the order of 1,000 to 500 pS worth .
Now , the
engineers on the cutting edge claim that in order for jitter
to be inaudible and not affect the sound of the signal , it
may have to be as low as 10 to 20 pS .
That 's for 16 bit
digital audio .
That 's a very tiny amount of jitter , and
easily below what most all current equipment is capable of .
Computer systems never convert the 1's and 0's to time
sensitive analog data , they only need to recover the 1's
or 0's , any timing accuracy only has to preserve the bits ,
not how accurately they arrive or are delivered .
So in this
regard , computer systems ARE completely different than
digital audio systems .
Look into digital audio more thouroughly , and realize that
the implementations are not perfect or ideal , and are
sensitive to outside influences .
Just because they could
have been and should have been done better or more nearly
perfect does not mean they were !
People are not hearing
things , they are experiencing the result of products designed
to a cost point that perform the way they do in a real
world because of design limitations imposed by the consumer
market price conciousness all the mid-fi companies live and
die by .
With digital cables , there are three things that are paramount :
proper impedance , proper cable termination , and wide bandwidth .
It may be that a particular cable more nearly matches a systems
actual impedance .
The other factor , proper termination includes ,
but is not limited to , the actual electrical termination inside
the components , as well as the connector on the end of the
cable .
If the connector is NOT a perfect 75 ohm , 110 ohm , or
whatever , it will cause minor reflections in the cable , which
makes our old friend JITTER raise it 's ugly head again .
The third factor , bandwidth , is only an issue because both the
AES / EBU and the SP / DIF interface formats were designed before
Sony / Phillips knew all there was to know about digital problems ,
and they require PERFECT unlimited bandwidth cables in order for
the transimission systems to be free of jitter .
The more you limit
the bandwidth , the more jitter .
This is a known engineering
fact , and an AES paper was given about this very subject not
too long ago .
" Is the AES / EBU / SPDIF Digital Audio Interface Flawed ? "
AES Preprint Number :3360 Convention : 93 1992-10 ,
Authors : Chris Dunn & Malcolm O. J. Hawksford
The effective data rate of SP / DIF is about 3 Mhz , and the
design of the transmitters and recievers is abysmal .
Maybe
if everything else was done right , then cables , etc. would n't
matter .
So much was done wrong or cost cut till it screwed
up that they do come into the picture .

I recommend a couple of options for digital interconnect cables in my DIY Interconnect Note .

* Where can I find the official newsgroup FAQ on wires ?
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/AudioFAQ/part8/
It helps to keep in mind that this FAQ from the rec.audio newsgroups is a compilation of the opinion of a conservative few , primarily folks that until recently , would swear that audio cables could not possibly make a sonic difference .
The more recent FAQ's on wire that have been put out are a bit more open to the possibility that there is something more to audio cables other than overly simplified high school physics .
I find it interesting that the newsgroup FAQ also recommends Belden 89182 , as I do in my DIY Interconnect note , for use as a twisted pair .

Not that I ’m claiming I could have done better , if I ’d been born into that time , instead of this one …
Macroscopic decoherence , a.k.a. many - worlds , was first proposed in a 1957 paper by Hugh Everett III .
The paper was ignored .
John Wheeler told Everett to see Niels Bohr .
Bohr did n’t take him seriously .
Crushed , Everett left academic physics , invented the general use of Lagrange multipliers in optimization problems , and became a multimillionaire .
It was n’t until 1970 , when Bryce DeWitt ( who coined the term “ many - worlds ” ) wrote an article for Physics Today , that the general field was first informed of Everett ’s ideas .
Macroscopic decoherence has been gaining advocates ever since , and may now be the majority viewpoint ( or not ) .
But suppose that decoherence and macroscopic decoherence had been realized immediately following the discovery of entanglement , in the 1920s .
And suppose that no one had proposed collapse theories until 1957 .
Would decoherence now be steadily declining in popularity , while collapse theories were slowly gaining steam ?
Imagine an alternate Earth , where the very first physicist to discover entanglement and superposition said , “ Holy flaming monkeys , there ’s a zillion other Earths out there ! ”
In the years since , many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mysterious Born probabilities .
But no one has yet suggested a collapse postulate .
That possibility simply has not occurred to anyone .
One day , Huve Erett walks into the office of Biels Nohr …
“ I just do n’t understand , ” Huve Erett said , “ why no one in physics even seems interested in my hypothesis .
Are n’t the Born statistics the greatest puzzle in modern quantum theory ? ”
Biels Nohr sighed .
Ordinarily , he would n’t even bother , but something about the young man compelled him to try .
“ Huve , ” says Nohr , “ every physicist meets dozens of people per year who think they ’ve explained the Born statistics .
If you go to a party and tell someone you ’re a physicist , chances are at least one in ten they ’ve got a new explanation for the Born statistics .
It ’s one of the most famous problems in modern science , and worse , it ’s a problem that everyone thinks they can understand .
To get attention , a new Born hypothesis has to be … pretty darn good . ”
“ And this , ” Huve says , “ this is n’t good ? ”
Huve gestures to the paper he ’d brought to Biels Nohr .
It is a short paper .
The title reads , “ The Solution to the Born Problem . ”
The body of the paper reads :
When you perform a measurement on a quantum system , all parts of the wavefunction except one point vanish , with the survivor chosen non-deterministically in a way determined by the Born statistics .
“ Let me make absolutely sure , ” Nohr says carefully , “ that I understand you .
You ’re saying that we ’ve got this wavefunction — evolving according to the Wheeler - DeWitt equation — and , all of a sudden , the whole wavefunction , except for one part , just spontaneously goes to zero amplitude .
Everywhere at once .
This happens when , way up at the macroscopic level , we ‘ measure ’ something . ”
“ Right ! ” Huve says .
“ So the wavefunction knows when we ‘ measure ’ it .
What exactly is a ‘ measurement ’ ?
How does the wavefunction know we ’re here ?
What happened before humans were around to measure things ? ”
“ Um … ” Huve thinks for a moment .
Then he reaches out for the paper , scratches out “ When you perform a measurement on a quantum system , ” and writes in , “ When a quantum superposition gets too large . ”
Huve looks up brightly .
“ Fixed ! ”
“ I see , ” says Nohr .
“ And how large is ‘ too large ’ ? ”
“ At the 50 - micron level , maybe , ” Huve says , “ I hear they have n’t tested that yet . ”
Suddenly a student sticks his head into the room .
“ Hey , did you hear ?
They just verified superposition at the 50 - micron level . ”
“ Oh , ” says Huve , “ um , whichever level , then .
Whatever makes the experimental results come out right . ”
Nohr grimaces .
“ Look , young man , the truth here is n’t going to be comfortable .
Can you hear me out on this ? ”
“ Yes , ” Huve says , “ I just want to know why physicists wo n’t listen to me . ”
“ All right , ” says Nohr .
He sighs .
“ Look , if this theory of yours were actually true — if whole sections of the wavefunction just instantaneously vanished — it would be … let ’s see .
The only law in all of quantum mechanics that is non-linear , non-unitary , non-differentiable and discontinuous .
It would prevent physics from evolving locally , with each piece only looking at its immediate neighbors .
Your ‘ collapse ’ would be the only fundamental phenomenon in all of physics with a preferred basis and a preferred space of simultaneity .
Collapse would be the only phenomenon in all of physics that violates CPT symmetry , Liouville ’s Theorem , and Special Relativity .
In your original version , collapse would also have been the only phenomenon in all of physics that was inherently mental .
Have I left anything out ? ”
“ Collapse is also the only acausal phenomenon , ” Huve points out .
“ Does n’t that make the theory more wonderful and amazing ? ”
“ I think , Huve , ” says Nohr , “ that physicists may view the exceptionalism of your theory as a point not in its favor . ”
“ Oh , ” said Huve , taken aback .
“ Well , I think I can fix that non-differentiability thing by postulating a second - order term in the — ”
“ Huve , ” says Nohr , “ I do n’t think you ’re getting my point , here .
The reason physicists are n’t paying attention to you , is that your theory is n’t physics .
It ’s magic . ”
“ But the Born statistics are the greatest puzzle of modern physics , and this theory provides a mechanism for the Born statistics ! ”
Huve protests .
“ No , Huve , it does n’t , ” Nohr says wearily .
“ That ’s like saying that you ’ve ‘ provided a mechanism ’ for electromagnetism by saying that there are little angels pushing the charged particles around in accordance with Maxwell ’s equations .
Instead of saying , ‘ Here are Maxwell ’s equations , which tells the angels where to push the electrons , ’ we just say , ‘ Here are Maxwell ’s equations ’ and are left with a strictly simpler theory .
Now , we do n’t know why the Born statistics happen .
But you have n’t given the slightest reason why your ‘ collapse postulate ’ should eliminate worlds in accordance with the Born statistics , rather than something else .
You ’re not even making use of the fact that quantum evolution is unitary — ”
“ That ’s because it ’s not , ” interjects Huve .
“ — which everyone pretty much knows has got to be the key to the Born statistics , somehow .
Instead you ’re merely saying , ‘ Here are the Born statistics , which tell the collapser how to eliminate worlds , ’ and it ’s strictly simpler to just say ‘ Here are the Born statistics . ’ ”
“ But — ” says Huve .
“ Also , ” says Nohr , raising his voice , “ you ’ve given no justification for why there ’s only one surviving world left by the collapse , or why the collapse happens before any humans get superposed , which makes your theory really suspicious to a modern physicist .
This is exactly the sort of untestable hypothesis that the ‘ One Christ ’ crowd uses to argue that we should ‘ teach the controversy ’ when we tell high school students about other Earths . ”
“ I ’m not a One - Christer ! ” protests Huve .
“ Fine , ” Nohr says , “ then why do you just assume there ’s only one world left ?
And that ’s not the only problem with your theory .
Which part of the wavefunction gets eliminated , exactly ?
And in which basis ?
It ’s clear that the whole wavefunction is n’t being compressed down to a delta , or ordinary quantum computers could n’t stay in superposition when any collapse occurred anywhere — heck , ordinary molecular chemistry might start failing — ”
Huve quickly crosses out “ one point ” on his paper , writes in “ one part , ” and then says , “ Collapse does n’t compress the wavefunction down to one point .
It eliminates all the amplitude except one world , but leaves all the amplitude in that world . ”
“ Why ? ” says Nohr .
“ In principle , once you postulate ‘ collapse , ’ then ‘ collapse ’ could eliminate any part of the wavefunction , anywhere — why just one neat world left ?
Does the collapser know we ’re in here ? ”
Huve says , “ It leaves one whole world because that ’s what fits our experiments . ”
“ Huve , ” Nohr says patiently , “ the term for that is ‘ post hoc . ’
Furthermore , decoherence is a continuous process .
If you partition by whole brains with distinct neurons firing , the partitions have almost zero mutual interference within the wavefunction .
But plenty of other processes overlap a great deal .
There ’s no possible way you can point to ‘ one world ’ and eliminate everything else without making completely arbitrary choices , including an arbitrary choice of basis — ”
“ But — ” Huve says .
“ And above all , ” Nohr says , “ the reason you ca n’t tell me which part of the wavefunction vanishes , or exactly when it happens , or exactly what triggers it , is that if we did adopt this theory of yours , it would be the only informally specified , qualitative fundamental law taught in all of physics .
Soon no two physicists anywhere would agree on the exact details !
Why ?
Because it would be the only fundamental law in all of modern physics that was believed without experimental evidence to nail down exactly how it worked . ”
“ What , really ? ” says Huve .
“ I thought a lot of physics was more informal than that .
I mean , were n’t you just talking about how it ’s impossible to point to ‘ one world ’ ? ”
“ That ’s because worlds are n’t fundamental , Huve !
We have massive experimental evidence underpinning the fundamental law , the Wheeler - DeWitt equation , that we use to describe the evolution of the wavefunction .
We just apply exactly the same equation to get our description of macroscopic decoherence .
But for difficulties of calculation , the equation would , in principle , tell us exactly when macroscopic decoherence occurred .
We do n’t know where the Born statistics come from , but we have massive evidence for what the Born statistics are .
But when I ask you when , or where , collapse occurs , you do n’t know — because there ’s no experimental evidence whatsoever to pin it down .
Huve , even if this ‘ collapse postulate ’ worked the way you say it does , there ’s no possible way you could know it !
Why not a gazillion other equally magical possibilities ? ”
Huve raises his hands defensively .
“ I ’m not saying my theory should be taught in the universities as accepted truth !
I just want it experimentally tested !
Is that so wrong ? ”
“ You have n’t specified when collapse happens , so I ca n’t construct a test that falsifies your theory , ” says Nohr .
“ Now with that said , we ’re already looking experimentally for any part of the quantum laws that change at increasingly macroscopic levels .
Both on general principles , in case there ’s something in the 20th decimal point that only shows up in macroscopic systems , and also in the hopes we ’ll discover something that sheds light on the Born statistics .
We check decoherence times as a matter of course .
But we keep a broad outlook on what might be different .
Nobody ’s going to privilege your non-linear , non-unitary , non-differentiable , non-local , non-CPT - symmetric , non-relativistic , a - frikkin ’ - causal , faster - than - light , in - bloody - formal ‘ collapse ’ when it comes to looking for clues .
Not until they see absolutely unmistakable evidence .
And believe me , Huve , it ’s going to take a hell of a lot of evidence to unmistake this .
Even if we did find anomalous decoherence times , and I do n’t think we will , it would n’t force your ‘ collapse ’ as the explanation . ”
“ What ? ” says Huve .
“ Why not ? ”
“ Because there ’s got to be a billion more explanations that are more plausible than violating Special Relativity , ” says Nohr .
“ Do you realize that if this really happened , there would only be a single outcome when you measured a photon ’s polarization ?
Measuring one photon in an entangled pair would influence the other photon a light - year away .
Einstein would have a heart attack . ”
“ It does n’t really violate Special Relativity , ” says Huve .
“ The collapse occurs in exactly the right way to prevent you from ever actually detecting the faster - than - light influence . ”
“ That ’s not a point in your theory ’s favor , ” says Nohr .
“ Also , Einstein would still have a heart attack . ”
“ Oh , ” says Huve .
“ Well , we ’ll say that the relevant aspects of the particle do n’t existuntil the collapse occurs .
If something does n’t exist , influencing it does n’t violate Special Relativity — ”
“ You ’re just digging yourself deeper .
Look ,
Huve , as a general principle , theories that are actually correct do n’t generate this level of confusion .
But above all , there is n’t any evidence for it .
You have no logical way of knowing that collapse occurs , and no reason to believe it .
You made a mistake .
Just say ‘ oops ’ and get on with your life . ”
“ But they could find the evidence someday , ” says Huve .
“ I ca n’t think of what evidence could determine this particular one - world hypothesis as an explanation , but in any case , right now we have n’t found any such evidence , ” says Nohr .
“ We have n’t found anything even vaguely suggestive of it !
You ca n’t update on evidence that could theoretically arrive someday but has n’t arrived !
Right now , today , there ’s no reason to spend valuable time thinking about this rather than a billion other equally magical theories .
There ’s absolutely nothing that justifies your belief in ‘ collapse theory ’ any more than believing that someday we ’ll learn to transmit faster - than - light messages by tapping into the acausal effects of praying to the Flying Spaghetti Monster ! ”
Huve draws himself up with wounded dignity .
“ You know , if my theory is wrong — and I do admit it might be wrong — ”
“ If ? ” says Nohr .
“ Might ? ”
“ If , I say , my theory is wrong , ” Huve continues , “ then somewhere out there is another world where I am the famous physicist and you are the lone outcast ! ”
Nohr buries his head in his hands .
“ Oh , not this again .
Have n’t you heard the saying , ‘ Live in your own world ’ ?
And you of all people — ”
“ Somewhere out there is a world where the vast majority of physicists believe in collapse theory , and no one has even suggested macroscopic decoherence over the last thirty years ! ”
Nohr raises his head , and begins to laugh .
“ What ’s so funny ? ” Huve says suspiciously .
Nohr just laughs harder .
“ Oh , my !
Oh , my !
You really think , Huve , that there ’s a world out there where they ’ve known about quantum physics for thirty years , and nobody has even thought there might be more than one world ? ”
“ Yes , ” Huve says , “ that ’s exactly what I think . ”
“ Oh my !
So you ’re saying , Huve , that physicists detect superposition in microscopic systems , and work out quantitative equations that govern superposition in every single instance they can test .
And for thirty years , not one person says , ‘ Hey , I wonder if these laws happen to be universal . ’ ”
“ Why should they ? ” says Huve .
“ Physical models sometimes turn out to be wrong when you examine new regimes . ”
“ But to not even think of it ? ” Nohr says incredulously .
“ You see apples falling , work out the law of gravity for all the planets in the solar system except Jupiter , and it does n’t even occur to you to apply it to Jupiter because Jupiter is too large ?
That ’s like , like some kind of comedy routine where the guy opens a box , and it contains a spring - loaded pie , so the guy opens another box , and it contains another spring - loaded pie , and the guy just keeps doing this without even thinking of the possibility that the next box contains a pie too .
You think John von Neumann , who may have been the highest - g human in history , would n’t think of it ? ”
“ That ’s right , ” Huve says , “ He would n’t .
Ponder that . ”
“ This is the world where my good friend Ernest formulates his Schrödinger ’s Cat thought experiment , and in this world , the thought experiment goes : ‘ Hey , suppose we have a radioactive particle that enters a superposition of decaying and not decaying .
Then the particle interacts with a sensor , and the sensor goes into a superposition of going off and not going off .
The sensor interacts with an explosive , that goes into a superposition of exploding and not exploding ; which interacts with the cat , so the cat goes into a superposition of being alive and dead .
Then a human looks at the cat , ’ and at this point Schrödinger stops , and goes , ‘ gee , I just ca n’t imagine what could happen next . ’
So Schrödinger shows this to everyone else , and they ’re also like ‘ Wow , I got no idea what could happen at this point , what an amazing paradox . ’
Until finally you hear about it , and you ’re like , ‘ hey , maybe at thatpoint half of the superposition just vanishes , at random , faster than light , ’ and everyone else is like , ‘ Wow , what a great idea ! ’ ”
“ That ’s right , ” Huve says again .
“ It ’s got to have happened somewhere . ”
“ Huve , this is a world where every single physicist , and probably the whole damn human species , is too dumb to sign up for cryonics !
We ’re talking about the Earth where George W. Bush is President . ”
John McCain has caught his share of flak for not knowing his way around e-mail .
But as his running mate has been discovering over the past week , being a bit too clever with e-mail has its pitfalls as well .
As Sarah Palin seeks to beat back charges that she improperly used her position as governor to urge the firing of her estranged brother - in - law , an Alaska state trooper , internal documents suggest that her staff may have hoped to channel sensitive correspondence through unofficial personal e-mail accounts to evade potential subpoenas .
" Troopergate , " as the iron laws of American political scandal nomenclature dictated the fracas would be dubbed , began as a dispute worthy of Judge Judy : Palin 's sister was embroiled in a nasty divorce and custody dispute with State Trooper Mike Wooten , and the newly elected governor made no secret of her displeasure that the ex- in - law was not yet an ex-lawman .
The family tiff blossomed into a full - blown ethics investigation after Palin dismissed public safety commissioner Walt Monegan , who has claimed his refusal to fire Wooten led to his own termination .
Palin has indicated she wo n't cooperate with the investigation , which she regards as " tainted " by political motivations , but the McCain - Palin campaign yesterday released a batch of e-mails that her lawyers say demonstrate Monegan was fired for insubordination .
But over the past week , press attention has focused on other e-mails that Palin appears more reticent about releasing .
In response to a request filed by a conservative activist under Alaska 's Public Records Act , Palin sought to invoke executive privilege in order to withhold some 1,100 e-mails ( PDF ) , many of whose subject lines suggest little connection to sensitive policy deliberation .
Gov. Sarah Palin
Moreover , Palin 's appeal to executive privilege appears to be at odds with a strategy she discussed with aides in correspondence obtained by the Washington Post and New York Times : using unofficial e-mail accounts , like " gov.sarah@yahoo.com " and personal devices like BlackBerries to shield communications from subpoenas as official public records .
As bloggers were quick to note , this was the same tactic adopted by White House aides worried that their correspondence could be disclosed to investigators probing the allegedly political firing of US attorneys .
Even before the US attorney scandal , the present administration had exhibited a spectacular gift for losing track of digital correspondence .
Thanks to a purported upgrade implemented soon after the Clintons cleared out , the White House e-mail system was left without an effective means of archiving correspondence .
Millions of e-mails vanished at least temporarily , and thousands may well be gone for good : A leaked memo suggested , at any rate , that there is little hope of completing the recovery before a new president is sworn in .
Whether the Yahoo - loophole exploited by Palin holds up would depend on how courts interpret the relevant Alaska statues , according to Meredith Fuchs , an attorney with the National Security Archive at George Washington University .
" It is a basic tenet of legal ethics that records should not be destroyed if litigation is anticipated , " Fuchs told Ars .
" If one anticipates litigation , then the destruction of the evidence is called ' spoliation ' and in some cases is subject to court sanctions . "
That 's not to say that alternation between official and unofficial channels is some nefarious Republican invention .
One former Democratic congressional staffer with whom
Ars spoke noted that colleagues would typically switch to personal mobile phones or e-mail accounts when discussing electoral campaign activities — a form of fuzzy half - compliance with the ban on using congressional office resources for partisan campaign purposes .
( Perhaps that 's why Palin staffer Ivy Frye waited until a Saturday evening to phone up blogger Sherry Whistine .
Whistine , a conservative critic of Palin's , told Ars that Frye angrily demanded she — and perhaps others on what the blogger termed the " Poison Ivy call list " — stop attacking the governor . )
Even if all this proves technically permissible , however , it can't do much good for Palin 's straight - shooting reformer image to have traded her official account for Yahoo as a means of avoiding transparency .
As with so many political scandals , the cover - up may prove more damaging than the underlying controversy .
But if a suit launched Tuesday by five GOP state legislators that aims to end or delay the Troopergate probe until after the election succeeds , Palin stands a good chance of shrugging off the fracas .
And it seems even more unlikely that the Bush administration will face any real consequences for its record - keeping failures .
One nagging question , then , is whether these cases do n't illustrate the double - edged nature of transparency and " sunshine " rules .
Regulation of the intelligence community may make abuse of power less likely , but it makes it downright inconceivable a future generation of spymasters would pen the candid memos , openly admitting criminality , uncovered by the Church Commission in the 1970s .
Faced with strong disclosure obligations , public officials may find ways to game the rules and simply avoid leaving trails — paper or pixelated — if there 's the slightest doubt about the propriety of their communications .
That 's surely no reason to abandon the ideal of more open government , but is a reminder that the law of unintended consequences remains in effect .
In some cases , at least , eternal sunshine yields the spotless drive .

Deny it all you want , but there will be moments in life when neither a watch nor a cell phone , nor even a bank with a big digital street clock , will be handy , and you 'll want a rough estimate of what time it is .
To prepare for such rustic ( or post - apocalyptic ) moments , check out wikiHow 's guide to telling time without a clock .
The two main methods involve dividing the sky into fractions or using your fist size to measure the horizon , and , like using the sun as a compass , both require thinking a bit about Daylight Saving Time and your general location in the world .
And both give you a pretty great feeling of independence when you pull them off .

 -- A customer showed up at little Devon Bank on Chicago 's North Side , asking for a loan to open a neighborhood shop .
But there was a hitch , the would - be borrower explained : " We can't pay any interest .
Can you help ? "
At the time , seven years ago , the answer was : " Nope , " recalls David Loundy , Devon 's vice president and legal counsel .
That was then .
Since fielding that first request , Devon Bank has transformed itself into a specialist in the kind of no-interest Islamic financing the customer was seeking .
Islamic financing now accounts for more than 75 % of the bank 's mortgage portfolio , and Devon has made mortgages compliant with Islam 's sharia law in 36 U.S. states , Loundy says .
Devon Bank , responding to local customers in a neighborhood filled with Pakistani and Middle Eastern immigrants , stumbled onto something big : Islamic finance is booming worldwide , fueled by the windfall from sky - high oil prices and a return to a more strict interpretation of the holy Quran across the Islamic world .
Once Devon Bank introduced sharia - compliant mortgages and other loans , " People started coming out of the woodwork , " Loundy says .
In a report last month , credit - rating agency Moody 's Investors Service said that the global Islamic finance market has grown about 15 % in each of the past three years and is now worth about $ 700 billion worldwide .
The heavyweights of global finance have taken notice : Citigroup , HSBC , Deutsche Bank and others have affiliates devoted to Islamic finance .
Giant mortgage investor Freddie Mac began buying sharia - compliant mortgages in 2001 .
Freddie Mac today continues to buy from four banks that together originate mortgages nationwide .
In addition to Devon , Freddie Mac buys mortgages from Guidance Residential in Reston , Va. ; University Bank in Ann Arbor , Mich . ; and American Finance House Lariba in Pasadena , Calif .
Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German says the company bought more than $ 250 million in Islamic mortgages in 2007 , but volume is slipping as the housing market declines .
The mortgages are " a steady , if modest , niche , " German says .
Somewhat of a dispute
There 's some dispute about exactly where the Quran comes down on finance and interest .
Scholars at the Al - Azhar Institute in Cairo — influential in Islam 's chief Sunni denomination — declared in 2002 that the Quran did not prohibit all interest payments and charges , just those so exorbitant that they crossed the line into usury .
Conventional banking has been widespread for years in the Islamic world .
A stricter interpretation — barring all interest — has been gaining ground over the past decade and driving the growth of no-interest Islamic finance .
Islamic banks get around the prohibition on interest by treating loans more like leases or profit - sharing arrangements .
An Islamic mortgage , for instance , looks like a lease - to - own deal .
The bank , not the borrower , buys the house .
The borrower makes installment payments to the bank for a period of years , at the end of which he or she gets the title to the house .
The bank 's profit technically comes from renting the house , not lending the money .
Loundy notes that Islamic mortgages are more costly than traditional mortgages because they involve paperwork for two home sales : the first by the bank , the second by the borrower after the installment payments are finished .
In business loans , the bank essentially shares profits with the borrower , making Islamic financing more like an equity investment than a loan .
Even depositors at Islamic banks are supposed to share profits and losses with the bank , instead of receiving interest payments — an arrangement that U.S. banking regulators have so far balked at approving .
" The FDIC is not anxious to see any bank agreeing in advance to share a loss , " Devon Bank 's Loundy says .
Booming bonds
Islamic bonds — known as sukuk — are booming : Nearly $ 33 billion of Islamic bonds were issued last year , up from $ 5.5 billion in 2001 .
Islamic bonds work something like Islamic mortgages .
For instance , the German state of Saxony - Anhalt , which issued the first Islamic bond in 2004 , sold government property to bond investors and then leased it back from them .
The investors technically earned money from the rent , not interest .
Determining exactly what is and is n't a sharia - compliant transaction can get tricky .
HSBC and Citigroup each have their own sharia advisory boards , made up of well - credentialed Islamic scholars .
Devon Bank , which has assets of just $ 250 million , leans on opinions from the Sharia Supervisory Board of America .
Kuala Lumpur , capital of predominately Muslim Malaysia , has emerged as Islamic finance 's global capital , thanks partly to tax breaks that encourage Islamic banking .
But Singapore and Hong Kong are eager to catch up .
" If Hong Kong truly wants to be a major international financial center , not just in the region , but globally , then Islamic finance must be amongst our portfolio of products and services , " John Tsang , Hong Kong 's financial secretary , said last year .
" It 's here to stay , " Loundy says of Islamic finance .
" You 're talking about one - fifth of the planet 's population . "
In keeping with the Tales of the Cocktail inspired Molecular Mixology theme , I ’m going to give you a quick cocktail that employs the technique of fat - washing .
Used popularly by esteemed colleagues in New York ( see Tailor and PDT ) , fat washing is an easy way to add flavors to alcohol that would n’t have led to favorable results before this technique .
Essentially , fat washing entails infusing high fat foods in alcohol and then freezing the alcohol in order to separate the fatty solids from the liquids .
In this cocktail , I ’ve used bacon - infused bourbon , but when it comes to this technique , the sky ’s the limit ( I ’ve used popcorn - infused Cognac to good effect as well ) .
This cocktail was also submitted to that good Slovak magazine , hence the use of Becher ’s Cordial , the sponsor of that issue .
Bohemian Cocktail
1 ½ oz bacon - infused bourbon
½ oz Cordial
4 dashes cherry bitters
stir all ingredients with ice
strain into a chilled cocktail glass
Bacon-Infused Bourbon
slow - cook two pieces of bacon
place bacon ( along with fat ) in a jar with 10 oz Bourbon for at least six hours , shaking occasionally
remove bacon
place jar into a freezer overnight
strain out solid fat pieces
filter bourbon through a coffee filter
The honeyed texture of Cordial practically screamed at me to add this to my bacon - infused bourbon , and indeed it did pair nicely .
Cherry bitters were a nice foil to the sweetness of the cordial , but Angostura would work just as well .
Try experimenting with different types of bacon , the one that I used for this cocktail was cherry - wood smoked , ( hence the addition of cherry bitters ) but different types of bacon are sure to work just as nicely .
Stay tuned , as there will be one more molecular mixology inspired “ drink ” before I go off to Tales .

A little project i'm working on in Erlang needs to take a byte sequence and write it out into a String to be save as an HTTP cookie .
Then , on subsequent HTTP requests , read back in the hex string from the cookie , and convert it back into the byte sequence .
I could n't quite find a module for doing this in Erlang , so I hacked part of it , and cobbled the rest from examples I 've found over the last few days .

A distribution occupies a very specific niche in the free software ecosystem .
Among other things , we need to accept some responsibility for ALL the software defects ( “ bugs ” ) that users actually experience across the entire stack .
Most users do n’t install their apps from upstream source tarballs , they install them from the packages provided by their distribution .
So when they experience a bug , they do n’t know if it ’s a bug introduced by that distribution , or a bug in the underlying upstream code .
They do n’t know , they do n’t care , and they should n’t have to .
More often than not they will report the issue to their distribution , and the way we respond to it is important , because it represents an opportunity to make the whole ecosystem more robust .
I had a lecturer who was very opposed to the use of the term “ bugs ” .
He said that the term “ bug ” was a cute - sification for “ nasty biting insect ” , and similarly , software defects have potentially serious consequences , so we should n’t treat them lightly .
Bug work is serious work , and it ’s one of the most important forms of contribution to the digital commons that Ubuntu can make , so I ’d like to salute the extraordinary efforts of the Ubuntu Quality Assurance Team and Bug Squad .
Initiatives like five - a- day are already making a huge difference to our users .
As Henrik Omma says , effective bug reporting requires a diligent and professional approach , and I ’ve noticed a real improvement in our community .
Hopefully , we can bring the benefits of that competence to the broader free software ecosystem .
Ubuntu gets as many bugs reported against it as OpenOffice , Mozilla , Gnome , and KDE combined .
The vast majority of those bugs are issues that exist in upstream tarball releases , or in Debian .
Our primary goals should be to ensure that fixes we produce , and information we generate in the QA process , make their way upstream where they will benefit the broadest cross-section of the community .
Separately , we want to ensure that each Ubuntu release ships without major issues , regardless of where those issues originated .
We are responsible for the user experience of every line of code , even though we do n’t produce every line of code .
In the month of April 2008 , I found the following bug counts for large FLOSS projects :
Upstreams : Mozilla5,334
OpenOffice 1,076 Gnome 5,364 KDE 1,335 Total : 13,109 Distributions : Ubuntu 13,064 Debian 5,103
With hindsight , April was possibly a bad choice , because it was an Ubuntu release month so there ’s usually a small spike in the number of bugs filed .
It would be interesting to see the stats for other distributions , and projects , over a full year .
But the general picture is clear – within our family of distributions , Ubuntu carries the brunt of the load w.r.t. bug tracking , triage and patch management – not only for our users , but for a broad cross-section of the open source stack .
When I delved into the data to see how we do with pushing bugs upstream , I found a somewhat mixed picture .
In many cases , we do very well indeed .
We have a very good relationship with GNOME , for example , with a very high percentage of bugs appropriately forwarded to the relevant upstream bug tracker .
In other projects , it ’s harder to make a definitive statement .
The percentage varies based on whether the Ubuntu team members have good relationships upstream , or whether there ’s a person acting as an ambassador from Ubuntu to upstream ( this is a great way to make a difference if you care about a specific application in Ubuntu ! ) or whether upstream themselves have taken an interest .
We need to improve the tools that support these kinds of cross-project conversations .
Launchpad does currently allow us to track the status of a bug in many different bug trackers , and there are quite a few distributions and upstreams that are now either using Launchpad directly or exchanging data efficiently .
We ’ll keep working to improve the quality of exchange across the whole ecosystem , including those projects that do n’t use Launchpad themselves

Hands Tied in Washington Russia 's Strategy Paralyzes US Government
The Bush Administration has warned that ties with Russia are imperiled , but the truth is that the US can undertake little more than symbolic action against Moscow .
As much as Russia 's actions have irritated the Americans , no one is interested in an escalation .
Signs suggest that the credit crunch is picking up steam .
Worried banks are reducing business loans as noted in We ’re Saying No To Almost Everybody , and now corporate bonds yields show biggest rise since 2000 .
Bondholders are demanding the highest interest rates for Wall Street debt since 2000 , threatening the industry 's business model of acquiring assets with borrowed money .
Lehman ( LEH ) has seen borrowing costs for its five - year bonds rise to 7.7 percent , up from 5.2 percent six months ago , the biggest jump of the four largest U.S. securities firms , data compiled by Bloomberg show .
" This is almost self - induced balance - sheet destruction , " said Joseph Balestrino , a fixed - income strategist at Pittsburgh - based Federated Investors Inc. , which manages about $ 330 billion .
" This is far beyond just your basic slowdown . "
In some debt maturities , Merrill 's bond yields are higher than Lehman's .
For instance , Merrill debt that matures in April 2018 yielded 8.15 percent as of July 25 , compared with 8.01 percent on Lehman notes that mature on May 2018 .
" If you 're going to be a big user of capital , then you have to be worried about how you finance your business , " said William Cohan , a former investment banker at Lazard Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. and the author of " The Last Tycoons " about Lazard .
" A lot of these guys do n't know what to do .
They 're frozen , and they 're just hoping that in time things will get better . "
" It 's going to be harder and harder for them to borrow long - term in this environment , to pay the spreads that investors are going to want , " said David Hendler , an analyst at CreditSights Inc. , a research firm in New York .
" Can they deal with this type of funding environment ? "
Lehman 's long - term debt outstanding rose to $ 128 billion from $ 123 billion in the first half of fiscal 2008 , as the firm cut its dependence on overnight funding , company reports show .
Morgan Stanley 's long - term borrowings totaled $ 211 billion on May 31 , up from $ 191 billion at the end of November .
Today , a decade after the Russian government defaulted on bond payments , the country 's bonds are yielding less than Lehman 's -- meaning investors have more faith in Russia 's prospects than in Lehman 's future .
Russia 's 11 percent BBB + rated bond that matures in 2018 yields 5.68 percent , two percentage points less than the Lehman 2012 bond that 's rated two notches higher by S&P .
" They do have the Fed as a backstop , " said Balestrino , whose company owns bonds in Lehman , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs .
" In the meantime you probably are setting records in terms of yield spreads . "

In the past ten years , a Democratic consensus has emerged from opposing poles represented by Robert Rubin , Secretary of the Treasury under Clinton , and Robert Reich , Secretary of Labor under Clinton .
The consensus stems from a shared conclusion :
In the past generation , the American economy has been benefiting the vast majority of Americans less and less ; and the trends that are causing this can not be stopped .
There are many factors that have caused , worsened and continued to escalate this core problem :
the demise of America ’s manufacturing base ;
the increasing gap between the pay of CEOs and top corporate officials and the average worker ;
the way the tax code has begun to tax labor at a far higher rate than it taxes capital ;
the shrinking of organized labor ;
the increasing instability due to globalization .
All of these are the symptoms and all of these are the causes .
Our economic system is breaking – the middle class is being squeezed ; we are transferring a tremendous amount of our wealth to autocracies and our rivals around the world because of our dependence on oil ; budget deficits are burdening our government which now practices a nefarious for of socialism , only for the rich ; globalization is creating insecurity ; our society is becoming more stratified , with many traditionally class - conscious European countries becoming more socially mobile ; our infrastructure is eroding .
Barack Obama ’s answer to this – accepting the Democratic party consensus – is a mix of short - term and long - term measures .
To alleviate the squeeze on the middle class as certain industries leave America looking for cheaper labor , he proposes to create jobs with infrastructure improvements and to push the development of a green energy industry .
To aid small businesses and to reduce the instability created by the greater turnover in jobs in a globalized marketplace , he proposes a universal health care plan that combines a government plan open to all citizens , various incentives for businesses to offer coverage , and various incentives for individuals to get coverage on their own .
With regards to taxes , he proposes tax cuts ( graph ) to those who need it and tax increases to those who have benefited most from our society – those making over $ 250,000.00 .
To prepare the next generation for the globalized marketplace , Obama proposes various improvements to education .
Barack Obama is also the only candidate who has pledged to protect the foundation of the internet .
( John McCain has recently come off the fence to support a policy that directly undermines the architecture of the internet since it began . )
For a more in - depth and reflective look at Obamanomics , check out David Leonhardt ’s cover story this weekend in the New York Times Magazine .
Addition : What Obama and the Democrats have been struggling with is a way to frame this in a visceral way that can be easily understood .
Here ’s my proposition :
McCain and the Republicans want to give big corporations whatever they want – even if it hurts American in the long term .
( Offshore drilling ; telecom immunity ; free trade without sensible provisions regarding labor and environmental regulation ; tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy while the government needs more income ; opposing the protection of the basis of the web , net neutrality , so that internet providers can make a bigger profit . )
Obama and the Democrats want corporations to do well , but at the same time , they want to protect American society from the destabilizing forces of globalization and to protect what has made America the most prosperous nation on earth – including a stable middle class and social mobility – both of which we are in danger of losing due to reckless Republican policies .
That ’s the narrative – it ’s not class warfare .
It ’s about protecting what has made America great against the forces of globalization , overly greedy corporations , and rapid change .

Stephen Harper on Tuesday acknowledged problems in the Canadian economy but defended his Conservative government 's record as continued uncertainty south of the border caused jittery world markets for a second straight day .
" At the moment there are problems in the Canadian economy , but we are n't in a recession , " Harper told reporters during a campaign stop in Kitchener , Ont. , where he promised a tax credit of up to $ 5,000 for first - time homebuyers .
" We have a slowdown economically , but personal income growth continues .
There are jobs , but there are job losses , but more gains .
" The reality is that we are managing the economy and are living through this period of time , and we are managing it much better than any other industrialized country . "
Markets dipped in early trading Tuesday but later recovered , with the Dow Jones up by more than 140 points and the TSX rising to see only a 27 - point drop by the end of the day .
Both markets had significant losses Monday following the collapse of Wall Street titans Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch .
Those events have heightened fears the troubles could cause a wider economic slump that would affect Canada .
Protesters target Harper event
Opposition parties have lambasted the Conservatives over Canada 's beleaguered manufacturing sector , which has suffered massive job losses while the country 's economic growth has dwindled to one of the lowest rates among G8 nations .
But Harper has struck back at his opponents ' spending proposals ahead of the Oct. 14 federal election , saying they are risky and unaffordable .
" Our opponents do have a wild , grand plan , " Harper said .
" They want to massively increase spending , and one of them wants to raise taxes to cover it all .
I agree that 's a radical departure and it's also an unwise one . "
A group of demonstrators , including some Canadian Auto Workers members , used megaphones and placards in an attempt to disrupt Harper ’s announcement and protest recent manufacturing job losses in the region .
Harper downplayed the protesters ' presence , saying they were " the same protesters we get in every election . "
He then defended his government 's actions to help struggling single - industry communities , including the community development program brought in before the last budget , and the recent $ 80 - million auto innovation grant to Ford to keep plants operating in Windsor and St. Catharines .
Liberals slam ' Harpernomics '
In an interview on Tuesday , Liberal MP and former leadership candidate Bob Rae accused Harper of mismanaging consistent surpluses left over by previous Liberal governments .
" He had a $ 13 - billion surplus waiting for him when he got there , and that 's now down to just about zilch , " Rae said from Halifax , where he was joining Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion for the first time in public during the campaign to announce the party 's catastrophic drug coverage plan , aimed at the seriously ill , at Dalhousie University .
Rae 's comments come as the Liberals launched a new advertising campaign criticizing " Harpernomics , " while touting the party 's Green Shift plan , which calls for taxing carbon fuels and shifting revenues to income tax cuts .
Rae also lambasted Harper 's musings a day earlier about how he believed a recession would have occurred by now if one were coming , saying the current global markets crisis was " not a time for private economic theories . "
Politics ' not a 1 - man game , ' says Rae
Rae 's appearance comes as recent polls suggest Dion has failed to gain traction among Canadian voters amid media reports of divisions forming within the party over how the campaign has been run .
" The rumblings are beginning to turn into a roar about how the Liberals need to change the game plan , and today is evidence they are doing that , " the CBC 's Susan Bonner reported from the campaign .
But Rae insisted the party 's collective approach can only help the party get its message of change to Canadians and counter Harper 's " top - down " style of governance .
" One of the great advantages we have as a party is we actually have a team , " Rae said .
" Politics is not a one - man game … and running a government is not a one - man game .
Unfortunately , Mr. Harper seems to think it is . "
Layton targets manufacturing job losses
NDP Leader Jack Layton pledged $ 100 million for skills training and to bolster the struggling manufacturing sector .
Speaking outside a John Deere plant slated for closure in Welland , Ont. , Layton said an NDP government would expand the Canadian training and apprenticeship tax credit to provide more incentives for companies to invest in training after " decades of neglect . "
" Working Canadians are not receiving the training they need , " Layton told an assembly of workers outside the plant .
" It 's time we funded training programs properly so that people who have been thrown out of work have a fighting chance to get a decent job again . "
Layton said that while the Conservatives offer general tax cuts to companies , his plan would give them credits for investing in jobs in Canada .
" There 's no way that a company that closes plants here should be getting tax breaks from the government , " Layton said .
Meanwhile , Green party Leader Elizabeth May campaigned in the Nova Scotia communities of Trenton and New Glasgow while Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe visited Quebec , in Chibougamau and Chicoutimi .
Dedicated to Ending Circumcision
Doctors Opposing Circumcision ( D.O.C. ) is dedicated to ending routine , non-therapeutic circumcision – the genital cutting of infants .
Babies are born with perfectly designed genitalia , and no one has the right to inflict this unnecessary procedure on them as they grow – for any reason .
We endeavor to raise awareness and challenge prevailing opinion .
We provide support and guidance to parents and medical providers who wish to make honest and thoughtful decisions , regardless of tradition or cultural pressures .
D.O.C. envisions a world where children are protected from unnecessary genital reduction surgeries and are free to develop as nature intended .
And with your support , we will get there .
Did you know ?
Aside from the United States , no other country in the world routinely circumcises its baby boys for non-religious reasons .
The foreskin is perfectly normal , healthy tissue that plays an important role in sexuality .
Circumcision has no justifiable benefits and is in fact harmful – from pain and suffering , to surgical botches , to reduced maternal - child bonding .
Medical authorities throughout the world consider circumcision medically unnecessary and unethical .
Join us .
Together we can stop this practice .
We welcome parents who wish to protect their infants , and those who feel remorseful about circumcising their children .
We welcome doctors who no longer wish to perform this unnecessary and harmful surgery , healthcare professionals who wish to support parents , and men aggrieved by their circumcisions .
Join us and take a stand to stop circumcision .
Do it for the children .

I know the title of this post is n’t anything revolutionary or unknown , but hopefully this underscores the importance of reducing the amount of time your car is in idle .
According to Fueleconomy.gov , over 17 % of your car ’s gas is wasted by simply being in idle .
Â
Obviously , the more you do to reduce the amount of time you sit in idle , the better your gas mileage is going to be .
This is one of the main reasons why hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius , Honda Insight and the Ford Escape HybridÂ get such great gas mileage : when the car is n’t moving , or is moving at a relatively slow speed , the car ’s engine stops using fuel and runs primarily on battery power .
Here are some simple ways to reduce the amount of time you sit in idle and ultimately increase your gas mileage :
Avoid being in the car during rush hour .
Â
Even stagering your commute by 30 minutes can have a big impact on the amount of time you sit idling in traffic .
If you know of times when your car is going to sit in idle ( running in to a friend ’s house , going in to Blockbuster to drop off a movie , etc. ) go ahead and park the car and turn its engine off .
Instead of turning on your car and then putting on your seatbelt , adjusting your mirrors , picking out which CD you want to listen to , etc. , go ahead and do all of those things before you start the car .
In the winter , do n’t let your car sit in idle while you try to warm up the inside or scrape frost off of your windows .
Same thing goes for air conditioning during the summer .
Avoid using drive throughs .
Â
Just park the car and go inside .
With all this in mind , try your best to reduce the amount of time your car sits in idle and you should see a nice increase in your car ’s gas mileage .
And in so doing could cut oil imports by $ 40 billion
India plans to offer $ 4.6 billion ( 3.6 billion pounds ) in incentives to companies setting up advanced battery manufacturing facilities as it seeks to promote the use of electric vehicles and cut down its dependence on oil , according to a government proposal seen by Reuters .
A proposal drafted by NITI Aayog , a federal think tank chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , said India could slash its oil import bills by as much as $ 40 billion by 2030 if electric vehicles were widely adopted .

Stephen Colbert looks at the media maelstrom surrounding Barack Obama 's trip to the Middle East and how there is one particular media outlet who does n't seem to be involved .
Hmmm .... which one could it be ?
COLBERT : You see , in recent months , McCain boxed Obama into a corner by saying it was important that Obama visit Iraq .
Checkmate .
No way out of that one .
But now Obama is cheating , by visiting Iraq .
The good news is there 's so much media attention , there 's always a possibility of a huge gaffe doing irreparable damage to his campaign . [..]
Now I was not invited on this trip .
But , that 's fine .
But I am not the only one who was snubbed .

DOOCY : Why are you not on Barack Obama 's airplane heading to the Middle East right now ?
WALLACE : Well , I called the Obama campaign several weeks ago and said that I 'd like to go and my invitation has apparently been lost in the mail .
[ end video ]
COLBERT :
Well , maybe that 's what this is .
Here you go .

Oh my God , it 's Chris Wallace 's invitation to the Obama trip !
They sent it to me by accident .
This could be my ticket to cover Barack Obama 's historic trip !
All I have to do is ...oh... and then people might think I was Chris Wallace .
[ shudders ]
Just not worth the risk .
Kind of makes the whole narrative that Obama is playing to FOX News Channel viewership in the general election a lie , does n't it ?
I think that anytime we see Democrats treating FNC rightfully as the propaganda arm of the GOP -- as Netroots Nation did last week -- they deserve a little pat on their back .
Please send Obama a note of congratulations for his FOX snub here .
That 's not weak on defense , Colbert , that 's a strong offense and one all Democrats should be emulating .

COLBERT : Welcome to the Report , good to have you with us .
Well , nation , you ’ve all heard the news : Jesus has returned to Earth on a spaceship , cured cancer and won the British Open .
Did no one hear about that ?
Oh maybe because Barack Obama decided to go backpacking overseas with a couple of his friends .
You probably know his friends by their professional name , the entire media .
Yes , they ’ve all taken the next ten days to “ find themselves ” on Barack Obama ’s Elitist Summer Abroad .
You see , in recent months , McCain boxed Obama into a corner by saying it was important that Obama visit Iraq .
Checkmate .
No way out of that one .
But now Obama is cheating , by visiting Iraq .
The good news is there ’s so much media attention , there ’s always a possibility of a huge gaffe doing irreparable damage to his campaign .

Look what happened yesterday , right in front of our troops .
[ video of Obama making 3 point basketball shot ]
Oh .

COLBERT : So let the mainstream media fawn all over Obama .
Big deal .
Maybe some of us have better things to do .
More exciting candidates to cover .
McCain , McCain does have a fantastic story .
All McCain needs is a little attention from his supporters in the media .
Really dyed in the wool conservatives like me and former Bush speechwriter David Frum .

Here you have one of the oldest … the oldest man ever to run for President . [..]
When you look at the polls , you can see there ’s much less enthusiasm for his candidacy .
That ’s a pretty exciting story .

COLBERT : Exactly .
And it is time the media started trumpeting McCain ’s exciting story :
He is old and no one likes him .
Exciting .

The Border Guard has begun using a new means of contending with riots coined “ Skunk ” .
The police developed this new method for scattering violent demonstrations and tested its effectivity in the last demonstration which took place in the West Bank village of Naalin .
Use of the “ Skunk ” is by means of an especially foul - smelling liquid spraying machine .
Over the past few years , security forces have been compelled to deal with a large number of demonstrations against construction of the separation fence in the West Bank village of Bilin and lately , in Naalin .
Until now , forces used rubber bullets , tear gas and shock grenades in order to disperse crowds who burned tires and threw stones at soldiers .
The police searched for a solution in order to deal with riots and simultaneously reduce the number of injuries .
Thus , it was decided to “ enlist ” the “ Skunk ” for dispersing riots .
On Friday , during a protest that took place near Naalin , Border Guard officers used the “ skunk ” for the first time in order to scatter the violent rioters in the area .
Use of the new apparatus began upon receipt of all necessary authorizations and after operational , health - related and legal instruction were given by the body which created this technology .
Border Guard Commander Yisrael Yitzhak , who is responsible for use of the “ Skunk ” , also authorized its usage .
“ Skunk ” is operated by two manual systems and one water - spraying machine .
However , instead of spraying water the foul - smelling material is sprayed .
The Border Guard reported that after the first usage of the “ skunk ” the Palestinians fled in order to shower and change clothes .
TIME has broken the unwritten and unspoken code .
They are calling it the way they see it .
How dare they !
Oh , let 's just admit it : John McCain is a long shot .
He 's got a heroic personal story , and being white has never hurt a presidential candidate , but on paper 2008 just does n't look like his year .
And considering what 's happening off paper , it might be time to ask the question the horse - race - loving media are never supposed to ask :
Is McCain a no -shot ?
Last week , the McCain campaign 's case against Barack Obama went something like this :
He 's irresponsible when it comes to Iraq , naive when it comes to Iran , and a big - government liberal when it comes to the economy .
But now Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al - Maliki has more or less endorsed Obama 's plan to withdraw from Iraq , forcing McCain to argue that Maliki did n't really mean it , and even the Bush administration has accepted a " time horizon " for withdrawal , if not a precise " timetable . "
The Bush administration has also engaged in some diplomatic outreach with Iran , just as Obama has recommended , a severe blow to McCain 's efforts to portray Obama 's willingness to talk as appeasement .
And on the economy , a TIME / Rockefeller Foundation poll found that 82 % of the country supports more federal infrastructure spending designed to create jobs .
When big - government liberalism is all the rage , McCain 's courage in opposing water projects or the farm bill becomes less of a selling point .
But , but ... this bad news for McCain must be good for McCain , right ?
The networks always find something good about McCain in every news piece that 's good for Obama .
That 's how the game is played .
Is n't it ?
The media will try to preserve the illusion of a toss - up ; you 'll keep seeing " Obama Leads , But Voters Have Concerns " headlines .
But when Democrats are winning blood - red congressional districts in Mississippi and Louisiana , when the Republican president is down to 28 percent , when the economy is tanking and world affairs keep breaking Obama 's way , it should n't be heresy to recognize that McCain needs an improbable series of breaks .
Analysts get paid to analyze , and cable news has airtime to fill , so pundits have an incentive to make politics seem complicated .
In the end , though , it 's usually pretty simple .
Everyone seems to agree that 2008 is a change election .
Which of these guys looks like change ?
Still , the trip so far has done for the media what the media claims Republicans fear the trip will do for the voting public .
With some hems and haws , reality is setting in .
The NY Times addresses its own narrative :
For Obama , a First Step Is Not a Misstep
After meeting Iraqi leaders and American officials , Senator Barack Obama seemed to have navigated the riskiest part of an international trip .
A smooth trip is news because we have been told for the last week how important it was not to make a huge gaffe .
The idea that Obama could actually orchestrate the mechanics competently is part of the story , of course ( I note that I 've seen no lime green jello backdrops . )
But the bigger picture is the air going out of the McCain rationale for being President .
" The Surge is working ! " propagandists do n't even understand the implications of their simplistic claims .
To the voters , it means " Great !
Let 's get out " , and blows a hole in the Republican strategy of staying whether things are good or bad there ( although it does make a better rallying cry than " ethnic cleansing is working ! " or " Bribery is working - for now ! " . )
But from the perspective of the Presidential race , McCain 's " President without a purpose " campaign will continue until November .
This does n't guarantee an Obama win , but it certainly guarantees some painful and embarrassing moments for McCain - and for the press , as they gyrate their way to figuring out how this is all good for McCain , who loves to be an underdog .
Good , because he , at least , is going to love the rest of the campaign .

Once upon a time I tried to tell my mother about the problem of expert calibration , saying : “ So when an expert says they ’re 99 % confident , it only happens about 70 % of the time . ”
Then there was a pause as , suddenly , I realized I was talking to my mother , and I hastily added : “ Of course , you ’ve got to make sure to apply that skepticism evenhandedly , including to yourself , rather than just using it to argue against anything you disagree with — ”
And my mother said : “ Are you kidding ?
This is great !
I ’m going to use it all the time ! ”
Taber and Lodge ’s “ Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs ” describes the confirmation of six predictions :
1. Prior attitude effect .
Subjects who feel strongly about an issue — even when encouraged to be objective — will evaluate supportive arguments more favorably than contrary arguments .
2. Disconfirmation bias .
Subjects will spend more time and cognitive resources denigrating contrary arguments than supportive arguments .
3. Confirmation bias .
Subjects free to choose their information sources will seek out supportive rather than contrary sources .
4. Attitude polarization .
Exposing subjects to an apparently balanced set of pro and con arguments will exaggerate their initial polarization .
5. Attitude strength effect .
Subjects voicing stronger attitudes will be more prone to the above biases .
6. Sophistication effect .
Politically knowledgeable subjects , because they possess greater ammunition with which to counter - argue incongruent facts and arguments , will be more prone to the above biases .
If you ’re irrational to start with , having more knowledge can hurt you .
For a true Bayesian , information would never have negative expected utility .
But humans are n’t perfect Bayes - wielders ; if we ’re not careful , we can cut ourselves .
I ’ve seen people severely messed up by their own knowledge of biases .
They have more ammunition with which to argue against anything they do n’t like .
And that problem — too much ready ammunition — is one of the primary ways that people with high mental agility end up stupid , in Stanovich ’s “ dysrationalia ” sense of stupidity .
You can think of people who fit this description , right ?
People with high g- factor who end up being less effective because they are too sophisticated as arguers ?
Do you think you ’d be helping them — making them more effective rationalists — if you just told them about a list of classic biases ?
I recall someone who learned about the calibration / overconfidence problem .
Soon after he said : “ Well , you ca n’t trust experts ; they ’re wrong so often — as experiments have shown .
So therefore , when I predict the future , I prefer to assume that things will continue historically as they have — ” and went off into this whole complex , error - prone , highly questionable extrapolation .
Somehow , when it came to trusting his own preferred conclusions , all those biases and fallacies seemed much less salient — leapt much less readily to mind — than when he needed to counter - argue someone else .
I told the one about the problem of disconfirmation bias and sophisticated argument , and lo and behold , the next time I said something he did n’t like , he accused me of being a sophisticated arguer .
He did n’t try to point out any particular sophisticated argument , any particular flaw — just shook his head and sighed sadly over how I was apparently using my own intelligence to defeat itself .
He had acquired yet another Fully General Counterargument .
Even the notion of a “ sophisticated arguer ” can be deadly , if it leaps all too readily to mind when you encounter a seemingly intelligent person who says something you do n’t like .
I endeavor to learn from my mistakes .
The last time I gave a talk on heuristics and biases , I started out by introducing the general concept by way of the conjunction fallacy and representativeness heuristic .
And then I moved on to confirmation bias , disconfirmation bias , sophisticated argument , motivated skepticism , and other attitude effects .
I spent the next thirty minutes hammering on that theme , reintroducing it from as many different perspectives as I could .
I wanted to get my audience interested in the subject .
Well , a simple description of conjunction fallacy and representativeness would suffice for that .
But suppose they did get interested .
Then what ?
The literature on bias is mostly cognitive psychology for cognitive psychology ’s sake .
I had to give my audience their dire warnings during that one lecture , or they probably would n’t hear them at all .
Whether I do it on paper , or in speech , I now try to never mention calibration and overconfidence unless I have first talked about disconfirmation bias , motivated skepticism , sophisticated arguers , and dysrationalia in the mentally agile .
First , do no harm !

You might think cable news networks , morning gab shows , and Comedy Central ’s unique offering of satire soapboxes might be interested in the new book from Vincent Bugliosi , the Los Angeles county prosecutor who put Charles Manson behind bars , who ’s now promoting The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , which has sold a quite remarkable 130,000 copies .
You would be wrong .
Bugliosi and his publicity team ca n’t get him booked on Today or Good Morning America , let alone Countdown or The Colbert Report .
Book review publications , so far including the New York Times ( it ’s “ under consideration ” ) , wo n’t write up his manuscript .
Don Imus wo n’t even accept his advertising .
Don Imus !
( Bugliosi has , however , conducted some 100 radio interviews . )
Perhaps it has to do with the book ’s central premise : That President Bush could , and should , be held criminally accountable for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq .
And while Newsweek editor Jon Meacham says “ Bush bashing fatigue ” may be to blame , there are a few other plausible scenarios .
1 ) The media might be done with taking the Bush administration ’s talking points as fact , as Jessica Yellin inadvertently exposed , but accusing the president of murder might be taking things a step too far .
You ’re entering “ crimes against humanity ” territory , and would n’t it be easier to make those claims when he leaves office ?
( Though is n’t that why Keith Olbermann has a television show ? )
Plausibility Odds : 1:1000
2 ) Prosecution , which was released in May , was published by Vanguard Press , a division of the Perseus Books Group — which also operates PublicAffairs Books , which put out Scott McClellan ’s What Happened .
The cable news talkers went ape shit over that book , with the right -y shows calling McClellan a traitor and the left -y shows cautiously claiming him for their side .
Might the media outlets that championed McClellan have faced harsher retribution from the White House than they expected ?
And made them fearful to repeat their overzealous attacks ?

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - The U.S. 4x400 m relay team that won gold at the Sydney Games in 2000 have been stripped of their medals after Antonio Pettigrew admitted to doping , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) said on Saturday .
Alvin Harrison , Antonio Pettigrew , Calvin Harrison and Michael Johnson of the U.S. men's 4x400 meters relay team display their gold medals after their victory at the Olympic Games in Sydney on September 30 , 2000 .
Nigeria took silver and Jamaica won the bronze .

It was the sixth American medal from the Sydney Games lost to doping in the past eight months after U.S. sprinter Marion Jones was stripped of her five medals due to her doping confession last year .
Reallocation of the medals was not discussed at the IOC ’s executive board meeting in Beijing , communications director Giselle Davies told reporters .
“ It was decided that the entire U.S. relay team will be disqualified from the Sydney Games , ” Davies said .
She said the reallocation of the medals , including Jones ’s , would be decided once an ongoing investigation into the San Francisco - based Balco laboratory , responsible for providing top athletes with drugs , was complete .
“ It forms part of a wider piece of work ... on the Balco case , ” Davies said , adding that issues such as medal reallocation arising from Balco would be resolved as one big case rather than on an individual basis .
The Nigerian quartet finished second at the Sydney Games with Jamaica third and the Bahamas fourth .
Former world 400 meters champion Pettigrew , now retired , admitted in May during the trial of former coach Trevor Graham that he had used performance - enhancing drugs for about six years .
His admission has led to U.S. Olympic champion Michael Johnson to say he was returning his Sydney Games relay gold medal after he felt he had not won it legitimately .
The Sydney 2000 Games gold - winning relay team included Johnson and twins Alvin and Calvin Harrison .
JOHNSON DISAPPOINTED
Johnson had won five Olympic gold medals but told Reuters in an interview recently he now had to be known as a four - time Olympic gold medallist .
Jerome Young , who ran in the Sydney preliminary rounds , had already been stripped of his medal due to a doping offence while Angelo Taylor was also awarded a gold .
The United States Anti-Doping Agency has annulled all Pettigrew ’s competitive results since January 1997 and has said the athlete had also voluntarily surrendered his 2000 Sydney Olympics 4x400 meters relay gold medal and his 1997 and 1999 world championship relay golds .
The decision could lead to the U.S. team also losing their 4x400 meters world record of 2:54.20 set in July 1998 .
Pettigrew ran that race with Jerome Young , Tyree Washington and Johnson .
He won his individual world title in Tokyo in 1991 .
Pettigrew acknowledged using the prohibited blood booster erythropoietin ( EPO ) and human growth hormone ( HGH ) beginning on or about January 1997 through 2003 .

Last week I wrote about the Consumer Action Handbook .
This freely - available guide from the U.S. government is packed with useful information .
I was leafing through the book again this morning before I put it away , and I noticed that the good stuff starts on page one with a list of thirteen quick consumer tips .
I 've transcribed these tips below , quoting verbatim from various sections of the book ( which is in the public domain ) , as well as adding my own experiences and advice .
A deal that sounds too good to be true usually is .
Offers that often fall into this category are promises to fix your credit problems , low - interest credit cards , deals that let you skip credit card payments , business / job opportunities , risk - free investments , and free travel .
Extended warranties or service contracts are rarely worth what you pay for them .
This has been documented repeatedly from many sources , including Consumer Reports , yet people still pay for them .
They 're not always a bad deal ( I always take them out for laptop computers ) , but most of the time , you 're better off self - insuring .
Instead of paying for service contracts , put the money you would have spent into a separate savings account .
When something goes wrong , pay for the repairs out of this fund .
Here 's how one Get Rich Slowly reader does it .
Say no to credit insurance offers .
Often offered with credit cards , car loans , and home mortgages , it is almost always better to purchase regular property , life , or disability insurance .
There is no universal three - day cooling - off period .
Do n't be misled into thinking that you have an automatic three days to cancel a purchase .
Only a few types of contracts give you a right to cancel .
For example , when you buy something at a store and later change your mind , your ability to return the merchandise depends upon store policy .
If you buy an item in your home , you might have three days to cancel .
Think twice before sharing personal information .
Guard your Social Security number and credit card information .
Learn how to prevent identity theft through deterrence , detection , and defense .
( Just yesterday my doctor 's office asked for my Social Security number .
Maybe I should n't have done so . )
Beware of payday and tax refund loans .
Avoid the payday loan trap .
If you are short of cash , avoid both of these loans by asking for more time to pay a bill or seeking a traditional loan .
Even a cash advance on your credit card may cost less .
Not all plastic cards offer the same protections .
Understand how your credit and debit cards work .
When you sign up for an account , read the fine print .
Your liability for the unauthorized use of a gift card or debit card may be much higher than the $ 50 maximum on your credit card .
Real estate agents represent the seller , not the buyer .
When buying , consider hiring an agent or lawyer who represents you .
Home improvement and auto repairs are the subject of frequent complaints .
Do n't just go with the first company you speak with .
Get multiple estimates .
Ask friends and family for recommendations .
From my own experience , I 'd rather pay more for a company that I know does quality work instead of gamble on a cheap unknown .
Think twice before you rent - to - own .
Interest rates on rent - to - own purchases can be very high .
If you miss a payment , you could end up with nothing .
Consider other options such as buying second - hand at a thrift shop or through ads in your local newspaper .
Do n't buy under stress .
Research suggests senior citizens , people in crisis ( e.g. , coping with a death or debt ) , college students , small business owners , minorities , and immigrants are especially at risk of being victimized .
Avoid making big - ticket purchases during times of duress .
This point cannot be emphasized enough .
Salespeople will often attempt to create artificial stress because they know it makes you more likely to buy .
That guy who knocks on your door offering to sell you the last frozen chicken in his truck at a discount ?
He 's creating artificial pressure to get you to buy .
Be cautious of Buy Here , Pay Here lots .
If you decide to buy a car from a used car lot , be sure to read all of the papers before you sign .
Do n't sign contracts that allow the dealership to change the finance rate after you leave the lot .
Work - at - home ads usually do n't pay off .
Be especially wary of ads that promise huge annual salaries ; they often require expensive upfront fees with no guarantee .
You risk losing your money and wasting a lot of time and energy .
Some of these probably seem obvious — others less so .
It 's all good advice , though .
When I look at the list , I recognize several of these “ commandments ” that I 've violated , particularly buying under stress .
I 've finally learned to just say “ no ” to anyone who wants me to make a decision now ( especially if it's a transaction that I did not initiate ) , but it has n't always been this way .
I 'd add a few other “ commandments ” to this list .
I 've written before about seven essential skills to protect yourself from scammers , including :
Seek recommendations from people you trust .
Referrals increase the odds of finding a quality professional .
There 's rarely a need to flip blindly through the yellow pages ( or google ) to find a mortgage broker or a roofing contractor .
Ask your friends , your family , your co-workers .

Ask your friends , your family , your co-workers .
Read everything you sign .
This is vital .
Read all the policy changes that you get in the mail from banks , insurance agents , and credit card companies .
At the very least , read the documents on your major purchases , especially cars and homes .

Do n't invest in things you do not understand .
If you do n't understand the mortgage your broker offers , do n't take it .
If you do n't understand buying stocks on margin , do n't do it .
If you do n't understand that awesome new investment opportunity that your friend keeps pimping , then do n't buy into it .
Can you think of other valuable consumer skills that should be added to this list ?
What are the planetary health risks of geo-engineering intervention ?
Nothing we do is likely to sterilise the Earth , but the consequences of planetary scale intervention could hugely affect humans .
Putative geo-engineers are in a position similar to that of physicians before the 1940s .
The author - physician Lewis Thomas remarkably described in his 1983 book , The Youngest Science , the practice of medicine before the Second World War .
There were only five effective medicines available : morphine for pain , quinine for malaria , insulin for diabetes , digitalis for heart disease and aspirin for inflammation and very little was known of their mode of action .
For almost all other ailments , there was nothing available but nostrums and comforting words .
At that time , despite a well - founded science of physiology , we were still ignorant about the human body or the host–parasite relationship it had with other organisms .
Wise physicians knew that letting nature take its course without intervention would often allow natural self - regulation to make the cure .
They were not averse to claiming credit for their skill when this happened .
I think the same may be true about planetary medicine ; our ignorance of the Earth system is overwhelming and intensified by the tendency to favour model simulations over experiments , observation and measurement .
Global heating would not have happened but for the rapid expansion in numbers and wealth of humanity .
Had we heeded Malthus 's warning and kept the human population to less than one billion , we would not now be facing a torrid future .
Whether or not we go for the recommendations for cutting back fossil fuel use discussed in Bali in 2007 or use geo-engineering , the planet is likely , massively and cruelly , to cull us , in the same merciless way that we have eliminated so many species by changing their environment into one where survival is difficult .
Before we start geo-engineering we have to raise the following question : are we sufficiently talented to take on what might become the onerous permanent task of keeping the Earth in homeostasis ?
Consider what might happen if we start by using a stratospheric aerosol to ameliorate global heating ; even if it succeeds , it would not be long before we face the additional problem of ocean acidification .
This would need another medicine , and so on .
We could find ourselves enslaved in a Kafka - like world from which there is no escape .
Sir Martin Rees in his 2003 book The Final Century , envisaged a similar but more technologically based fate brought on by our unbridled creativity .
The alternative is the acceptance of a massive natural cull of humanity and a return to an Earth that freely regulates itself but in the hot state .
Garrett Hardin foresaw consequences of this kind in his seminal 1968 essay The Tragedy of the Commons .
Whatever we do is likely to lead to death on a scale that makes all previous wars , famines and disasters small .
To continue business as usual will probably kill most of us during the century .
Is there any reason to believe that fully implementing Bali , with sustainable development and the full use of renewable energy , would kill less ?
We have to consider seriously that as with nineteenth century medicine , the best option is often kind words and pain killers but otherwise do nothing and let Nature take its course .
The usual response to such bitter realism is : then there is no hope for us , and we can do nothing to avoid our plight .
This is far from true .
We can adapt to climate change and this will allow us to make the best use of the refuge areas of the world that escape the worst heat and drought .
We have to marshal our resources soon and if a safe form of geo- engineering buys us a little time then we must use it .
Parts of the world such as oceanic islands , the Arctic basin and oases
on the continents will still be habitable in a hot world .
We need to regard them as lifeboats and see that there are sufficient sources of food and energy to sustain us as a species .
Physicians have the Hippocratic Oath ; perhaps we need something similar for our practice of planetary medicine .
During the global heating of the early Eocene , there appears to have been no great extinction of species and this may have been because life had time to migrate to the cooler regions near the Arctic and Antarctic and remain there until the planet cooled again .
This may happen again and humans , animals and plants are already migrating .
Scandinavia and the oceanic parts of northern Europe such as the British Isles may be spared the worst of heat and drought that global heating brings .
This puts a special responsibility upon us to stay civilized and give refuge to the unimaginably large influx of climate refugees .
Perhaps the saddest thing is that if we fail and humans become extinct , the Earth System , Gaia , will lose as much as or more than we do .
In human civilisation , the planet has a precious resource .
We are not merely a disease ; we are , through our intelligence and communication , the planetary equivalent of a nervous system .
We should be the heart and mind of the Earth not its malady .
Perhaps the greatest value of the Gaia concept lies in its metaphor of a living Earth , which reminds us that we are part of it and that our contract with Gaia is not about human rights alone , but includes human obligations .

It has actually happened .
Lawmakers have proposed legislation that forbids restaurants and food establishments from serving food to anyone who is obese ( as defined by the State ) .
Under this bill , food establishments are to be monitored for compliance under the State Department of Health and violators will have their business permits revoked .
House Bill 282 was introduced in the 2008 Mississippi legislative session on Friday by Representative W.T. Mayhall , Jr. , a retired pharmaceutical salesman with DuPont - Merk .
Its co-authors are Bobby Shows , a businessman , and John Read , a pharmacist .
The full text reads :
HOUSE BILL NO .
282
An act to prohibit certain food establishments from serving food to any person who is obese , based on criteria prescribed by the state department of health ; to direct the department to prepare written materials that describe and explain the criteria for determining whether a person is obese and to provide those materials to the food establishments ; to direct the department to monitor the food establishments for compliance with the provisions of this act ; and for related purposes .
Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Mississippi :
SECTION 1 .
(1) The provisions of this section shall apply to any food establishment that is required to obtain a permit from the State Department of Health under Section 41 - 3 - 15 ( 4 ) ( f ) , that operates primarily in an enclosed facility and that has five ( 5 ) or more seats for customers .
(2) Any food establishment to which this section applies shall not be allowed to serve food to any person who is obese , based on criteria prescribed by the State Department of Health after consultation with the Mississippi Council on Obesity Prevention and Management established under Section 41 - 101 - 1 or its successor .
The State Department of Health shall prepare written materials that describe and explain the criteria for determining whether a person is obese , and shall provide those materials to all food establishments to which this section applies .
A food establishment shall be entitled to rely on the criteria for obesity in those written materials when determining whether or not it is allowed to serve food to any person .
(3) The State Department of Health shall monitor the food establishments to which this section applies for compliance with the provisions of this section , and may revoke the permit of any food establishment that repeatedly violates the provisions of this section .
SECTION 2 . This act shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1 , 2008 .
Should this pass , scales will appear at the door of restaurants , people with BMIs of 30 or higher wo n’t be allowed to be served .
And to comply with government regulations , restaurants will have to keep records of patrons '
BMIs .
Is this a tongue - in - cheek bill , meant to point out how absurd the war on obesity has become ?
Or do lawmakers actually believe the myths that gluttony is the cause for obesity and that it is the government ’s role to force people to eat and live how it deems best ?
I called lead author , Rep. Mayhall , and asked if this was serious legislation or tongue - in - cheek to make a point .
He kindly took a moment to answer my question while the legislature was in session .
He said that while , regrettably , he does n’t believe his bill will pass , this is serious .
He wrote it , he said , because of the “ urgency of the obesity crisis and need for government action . ”
He hopes it will “ call attention to the serious problem of obesity and what it is costing the Medicare system . ”
So , yes , this is for real and these elected officials actually believe this stuff .
The time is now for all Americans who value their freedom to eat , look , breathe and live their lives how they choose to unite !
Court : Passengers can challenge no-fly list San Francisco Ex - Stanford student sued after she was detained at SFO
Critics of the government 's secret no -fly list scored a potentially important victory Monday when a federal appeals court ruled that would - be passengers can ask a judge and jury to decide whether their inclusion on the list violates their rights .
In a 2 - 1 ruling , the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reinstated a suit by a former Stanford University student who was detained and handcuffed in 2005 as she was about to board a plane to her native Malaysia .
The ruling is apparently the first to allow a challenge to the no-fly list to proceed in a federal trial court , said the plaintiff 's lawyer , Marwa Elzankaly .
The decision would allow individuals to demand information from the government , present evidence on why they should not have been on the list , and take the case to a jury , Elzankaly said .
The ruling means that " someone who finds it 's likely that their name has been placed on a government watch list will get their day in court , " Elzankaly said .
The Transportation Security Administration , which maintains the no-fly list , had no comment on the case , said Nico Melendez , an agency spokesman in Los Angeles .
A federal judge in San Francisco had dismissed the suit , citing a law that requires all challenges to TSA orders to be filed directly in an appeals court , with no right to present evidence or convene a jury .
But the appeals court majority , led by Chief Judge Alex Kozinski , said the no-fly list , though maintained by the TSA , is actually compiled by a branch of the FBI , which can be sued in a trial court like most other federal agencies .
The TSA , part of the Homeland Security Department , has lists of hundreds of thousands of names of passengers who allegedly pose a risk of terrorism or air piracy , information the agency shares with airlines .
Those on the no-fly list are prevented from boarding .
Passengers on a separate " selectee " list undergo additional searches .
Such listings date from 1990 but have been expanded substantially since 2001 , although the government has not disclosed their full scope or criteria .
Civil liberties groups have argued that the lists are far too broad , are riddled with errors and lack meaningful safeguards .
The TSA has established an ombudsman 's office to review passengers ' claims that they were mistakenly listed .
Monday 's ruling involves Rahinah Ibrahim , a Stanford doctoral student in architecture who was stopped at a United Airlines counter in San Francisco in January 2005 when an employee spotted her name on the no-fly list , the court said .
A phone call to police was relayed to the TSA , which told officers to detain Ibrahim and stop her from flying .
She was handcuffed in front of her 14 - year - old daughter , held in custody for two hours and then released by orders of the FBI .
Ibrahim returned the next day , went through additional searches and was allowed to fly .
The mother of four , with no criminal record or connections to terrorism , has remained in Malaysia , where she completed her Stanford doctorate and teaches at a university , Elzankaly said .
Her lawsuit challenged her alleged inclusion on the no-fly list - an allegation the government has not confirmed , her lawyer said - and claimed violations of constitutional restrictions on searches and discrimination .

Announcing Dolt , a drop - in Libtool replacement which cuts build times in half
Many packages use GNU autotools ( automake and autoconf ) to build , to the point that " ./ configure && make " represents one of the most common build procedures for Free Software packages .
Libraries using autotools typically use GNU Libtool , partly because it works on almost any system and partly because autotools makes it difficult to do otherwise .
Packages which use these libraries sometimes use libtool as well .
Yet for many of these libraries and other packages , more than half of the build time goes into running the libtool shell script .
Libtool knows how to handle libraries for umpteen different systems , including many ancient systems that have terrible shared library support .
It has some extensive shell script logic to figure out how to build libraries for your system , and how to compile objects that go in those libraries .
This logic does an amazingly impressive job of coping with adverse conditions .
However , this logic all lives in an ~8500 line , ~250 kB shell script , which runs * every single time you compile a source file * .
This does not do wonders for performance .
Meanwhile , modern systems such as GNU / Linux have reasonable library mechanisms , and need relatively little of the machinery in libtool .
On these common systems , it would significantly improve build times to avoid running that libtool machinery for every compilation .
Thus , I wrote Dolt , a drop - in replacement for libtool 's compilation mode .
Dolt runs any necessary system - specific or configuration - specific logic as part of configure , writes out a simple shell script " doltcompile " [ 1 ] , and substitutes it for libtool in the automake variables LTCOMPILE and LTCXXCOMPILE .
If you use automake , autoconf , and libtool , then using Dolt just requires two steps : 1 ) add " DOLT " after the call to LT_INIT , AC_PATH_LIBTOOL , or AM_PATH_LIBTOOL in your configure.ac or configure .in script , and 2 ) append dolt .m4 to your project 's acinclude .
m4 .
For any system
Dolt does not support , it will transparently fall back to libtool .
dolt .m4 takes up less than 4 kB ; it writes out a minimal doltcompile script which never forks except to run the compiler or to mkdir the .libs directory if it does n't already exist .
I have tested it with various projects , and benchmarked [ 2 ] its performance against the same projects using only libtool .
Results : kdelibs without dolt : 8m6.115s kdelibs with dolt : 3m50.065s gtk+-2.0 without dolt : 2m31.825s gtk+-2.0 with dolt : 1m33.858s libx11 without dolt : 1m50.163s libx11 with dolt : 0m53.417s libxml2 without dolt : 0m25.722s libxml2 with dolt : 0m19.576s dbus without dolt : 0m20.062s dbus with dolt : 0m8.940s
I have attached a snapshot of dolt .m4 for convenience .
You can also obtain the current version of Dolt from Git with : git clone git://svcs.cs.pdx.edu/git/dolt or download a snapshot tarball from < http://svcs.cs.pdx.edu/gitweb?p=dolt.git;a=snapshot;h=master;sf=tgz>.
Please try Dolt with your project , and see if you get comparable performance improvements .
If you want to make Dolt replace libtool on your system , feel free to send me a patch to dolt .
m4 ; just remember the basic tenet that any logic must run at configure time , not build time .
You can figure out what compiler flags libtool uses by running " touch dummy . c && libtool -- mode=compile gcc - c dummy.c - o dummy.lo " ; that will print two compiler command lines , one for the shared object and one for the static object .
Future directions : * Support GNU / Linux on architectures other than x86 and x86 - 64 .
I think most will work with exactly the same compiler flags , but I did n't want to add any architecture I could n't test .
* Support other systems .
* Possibly try to run libtool on a dummy source file at configure time to figure out the necessary flags to use when building library objects , but that seems error - prone .
* Replace libtool -- mode=link . * Replace libtool -- mode=install . * Optionally stop installing .la files . *
Make dolt .
m4's output of doltcompile cleaner .
- Josh Triplett [ 1 ] " doltcompile " stands for " do ltcompile " ; the alternate reading " dolt compile " led to the name " dolt " . [ 2 ]
General testing methodology : * Run ./ configure && make && make clean , to make sure it builds and to get everything cached .
*
Get the " before " time : time make >/dev/null 2>&1 * Remove and re-extract the source .
*
Add dolt .m4 to acinclude .m4 and add DOLT to configure . in or configure.ac . * autoreconf - v -f - i && ./ configure && make && make clean , to make sure it still builds and to get everything cached again .
*
Get the " after " time : time make >/dev/null 2>&1

THE Australian Securities and Investments Commission has dramatically widened its crackdown on short - selling , banning the practice across the entire sharemarket for at least a month as a " circuit breaker " to restore confidence .
But the stance has stunned local investors , who warned that market turmoil was likely to follow , given the ban could effectively shut down options and derivatives trading .
The Australian position goes further than US and British regulators , which last week detailed measures to ban short - selling on financial stocks only as part of efforts to prevent wild swings on global bank shares .
Australian and other European regulators followed with their own bans on short - selling on financial stocks , helping to spur the international rally in shares , including a 3.3 % surge on Wall Street on Friday .
But last night ASIC widened its ban to include all shares , fearing that restrictions on short - selling on other exchanges would intensify risks on the Australian market .
Many wise people are now recognizing that the repeal of Glass - Steagall was one of the few saving graces of the current crisis .
Let ’s thank President Clinton ( and Phil Gramm ) for that wise bit of deregulation .
The following potted history of the law , however , is all too typical :
Glass - Steagall was one of the many necessary measures taken by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Democratic Congress to deal with the Great Depression .
Crudely speaking , in the 1920s commercial banks ( the types that took deposits , made construction loans , etc. ) recklessly plunged into the bull market , making margin loans , underwriting new issues and investment pools , and trading stocks .
When the bubble popped in 1929 , exposure to Wall Street helped drag down the commercial banks … .
The policy response was to erect a wall between investment banking and commercial banking .
Given a history like this people wonder how repealing the law could have been a good thing .
But a significant academic literature has investigated these claims and rejected them .
Eugene
White , for example , found that national banks with security affiliates were much less likely to fail than banks without affiliates .
Randall Kroszner ( now at the Fed. ) and Raghuram Rajan found that ( jstor ) securities issued by unified banks were ( ex - post ) of higher quality that those issued by investment banks .
A powerful book by George Benston went through the entire Pecora hearings which supposedly revealed the problems with unified banking and found them to be a complete sham .
My colleague , Carlos Ramirez later showed that the separation of commercial and investment banking increased the cost of external finance ( jstor ) .
Finally , my own work ( pdf ) unearthed the real reasons for the separation in a titanic battle between the Morgans and Rockefellers .
Thus , the history of banking before Glass - Steagall and now our recent experience after is consistent , generally speaking unified banking is safer and repeal was a good idea .
WASHINGTON  The United States and Poland reached a long - stalled deal on Thursday to place an American missile defense base on Polish territory , in the strongest reaction so far to Russia ’s military operation in Georgia .
Russia reacted angrily , saying that the move would worsen relations with the United States that have already been strained severely in the week since Russian troops entered separatist enclaves in Georgia , a close American ally .
At a news conference on Friday , a senior Russian defense official , Col. Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn , suggested that Poland was making itself a target by agreeing to host the anti-missile system .
Such an action “ cannot go unpunished , ” he said .
The deal reflected growing alarm in a range of countries that had been part of the Soviet sphere about a newly rich and powerful Russia ’s intentions in its former cold war sphere of power .
In fact , negotiations dragged on for 18 months  but were completed only as old memories and new fears surfaced in recent days .
Those fears were codified to some degree in what Polish and American officials characterized as unusual aspects of the final deal : that at least temporarily American soldiers would staff air defense sites in Poland oriented toward Russia , and that the United States would be obliged to defend Poland in case of an attack with greater speed than required under NATO , of which Poland is a member .
President Bush has the legal power to order the indefinite military detentions of civilians captured in the United States , the federal appeals court in Richmond , Va. , ruled on Tuesday in a fractured 5 - to - 4 decision .
But a second , overlapping 5 - to - 4 majority of the court , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , ruled that Ali al - Marri , a citizen of Qatar now in military custody in Charleston , S.C. , must be given an additional opportunity to challenge his detention in federal court there .
An earlier court proceeding , in which the government had presented only a sworn statement from a defense intelligence official , was inadequate , the second majority ruled .
The decision was a victory for the Bush administration , which had maintained that a 2001 Congressional authorization to use military force after the Sept. 11 attacks granted the president the power to detain people living in the United States .
The court effectively reversed a divided three - judge panel of its own members , which ruled last year that the government lacked the power to detain civilians legally in the United States as enemy combatants .
That panel ordered the government either to charge Mr. Marri or to release him .
The case is likely to reach the Supreme Court .
A recent statement from anti-malware and threat - detection software manufacturer PC Tools claims that Windows 2000 is a more secure operating system than Windows Vista .
The company 's claims , as covered by Infoworld , have attracted a good deal of coverage — no one wants to miss out on a good Microsoft bashing — but an examination of the company 's methodology raises serious concerns about the validity of the conclusions .
According to company CEO Simon Clausen , " recent research conducted with statistics from over 1.4 million computers within the Threat Fire community has shown that Windows Vista is more susceptible to malware than the eight year old Windows 2000 operating system , and only 37 percent more secure than Windows XP . "
This certainly sounds dire , and at first glance , the company 's numbers back its statements up .
Data reports from the company 's Threat Fire security program state that Vista allowed an average of 639 threats per 1,000 computers " through . "
Through , in this case , presumably means that the malware in question successfully installed itself and became active .
Windows 2000 , meanwhile , was successfully breached by 586 threats , Windows Server 2003 by 478 threats , and Windows XP by a massive 1,021 threats per 1,000 computers .
The immediate " conclusions " from these results are twofold .
First , Windows Vista , despite all of Microsoft 's work and claims to the contrary , is supposedly less secure than the positively ancient Windows 2000 .
Second , all of us running Windows XP are completely screwed ; PC Tools data indicates that Windows XP systems are infected , on average , with 1.02 " threats . "
What constitutes a threat , however , is n't clearly explained , and the questions only pile up from there .
We know nothing about how many threats were tested , how those threats were chosen , or whether or not the same suite of threats were applied against all of the available machines .
Clausen 's quote indicates that the company 's data was drawn from user statistics , rather than based on rigorous testing , which opens the door for a slew of confounding variables .
We 're given no information on whether or not these systems were fully patched or running updated antivirus software .
Intermittent Internet access for all surveyed systems is a given , but there 's no information on which systems were behind a firewall / router and which were n't .
The questions continue ad nauseam ; were all of the systems running in Administrator mode ?
Was Vista 's UAC enabled ?
If UAC was enabled , did a prompt from it count as a threat block ?
Was Vista SP1 or an RC version of XP SP3 installed ?
How were multiple malware infections on the same system counted ?
The first action of many trojans is to download other trojans , and a system can easily end up with 4 - 5 separate infections in a short period of time .
PC Tools did not respond to a request for comment on our questions .
Studies that control for the above variables are known as security studies precisely because they endeavor to accurately model relative OS security .
Documents that fail to take such considerations into account are better classified as PR statements .
With Vista security numbers like these , you'd be well advised to invest in a good anti-virus solution , and amazingly enough , PC Tools happens to have a unique , better - than - the - rest behavioral analysis AV product known as Threat Fire .
by Luke Wroblewski September 21 , 2008
A recent lengthy discussion in the Interaction Design Association focused on the placement of actions in Web forms that span several Web pages .
The quintessential question underlying this debate is : can an action which leads people to the previous step of a process be placed to the right of an action that leads users to the next step of a process ?
One side of the debate argues that there is a natural organization : actions that move you forward are on the right , actions that move you backward are on the left ( in places where people read from left to right ) .
The other side argues that the notion of “ primary ” actions ( those that move people forward ) outweigh this consideration and “ secondary ” actions ( which are much less used ) can be placed to the right of primary actions even if they allow people to access previous steps .
The presence of a prominent primary action in the “ line of fire ” of people filling a Web form , allows them to land on the action they need to take as they finish answering the questions a form requires .
For the sake of clarity , I illustrated this in the image below .
So who is right ?
Both sides are .
One of the reasons there may be so much debate about this topic is that too often Web designers / developers assume they are making a " wizard " and that people will need to move backwards and forwards through a series of steps .
In the vast majority of Web forms , people just want to get through the questions they need to answer and move on .
Therefore having a primary action that is " Continue " and a secondary action that is " Go Back " makes a lot of sense .
Aligning a prominent primary action with the path to completion ( directly below the last question answered ) lets people know they can and should move forward .
When moving through a linear flow , like e-commerce checkout , the reasons to go back are quite limited and can be covered effectively through final confirmation screens .
In fact , a lot of the analytics I have seen show people very rarely utilize " go back " or " previous " controls in these situations .
However , there are instances ( though arguably less of them ) where forms need to allow people to jump between a set of Web pages in order to accomplish their tasks .
In these cases , both Previous and Next could be thought of as primary actions and their placement should match the left to right motion associated with paginating a set of information .
All that said there are situations you certainly want to avoid .
I think it ’s these options that polarize the conversation about previous and next actions in Web forms .
In the image below , the first option should be avoided because people may select “ Previous ” by default assuming it is the primary action on the form since it aligns directly with their path to completion .
Providing a visual distinction between these actions but maintaining the same order ( as illustrated in the image ) helps prevent this issue .
In situations where previous and next are both primary actions , do n’t break the left to right order as shown in the two bottom - most examples .
Top - aligned labels are especially prone to challenges of previous and next action positioning because they may lack screen space to the left of the label and input field .
In these cases , maintaining a left to right ordering of previous and next actions could lead to inadvertent clicks on “ Previous ” as people complete the last question on a form .
Perhaps the best solution is to think of these actions instead as “ Continue ” and “ Go Back ” to help people make forward progress .
In each of these examples a few simple considerations point to appropriate design solutions : ensuring there is a primary action that guides people forward ; being careful not to introduce confusion by shifting the left to right order expected when moving between pages ; and knowing when previous and next are both truly primary actions so they can be presented as such .
As with many design debates , the answer lies not in a strict guideline but in understanding these considerations and acting appropriately .

[ Jake Tapper quoting McCain yesterday ]
“ Two years ago , I warned that the oversight of Fannie and Freddie was terrible , that we were facing a crisis because of it , or certainly serious problems , ” Sen . John McCain , R - Ariz. , told CBS this morning .
“ The influence that Fannie and Freddie had in the inside the Beltway , old boy network , which led to this kind of corruption is unacceptable and I warned about it a couple of years ago . ”
How does this claim of foresight square with this interview that McCain gave to the Keene ( NH ) Sentinel , discussing the subprime mortgage crisis , in December 2007 ?….
“ But so , in this whole new derivative stuff , and SIBs and all of this kind of new ways of packaging mortgages together and all that is something that frankly I do n’t know a lot about .
“ But I do rely on a lot of smart people that I have that are both in my employ and acquaintances of mine .
And most of them did not anticipate this .
Most of them , I mean I can find some that did .
But , a guy that ’s on my staff named Doug Holtz - Eakin , who was once the head of the Office of Management and Budget , said that there was nervousness out there .
There ’s nervousness .
There was nervousness that we had such a long period of prosperity without a downturn because of the history of our economy .
But I do n’t know of hardly anybody , with the exception of a handful , that said ‘ wait a minute , this thing is getting completely out of hand and is overheating . ’
“ So , I ’d like to tell you that I did anticipate it , but I have to give you straight talk , I did not . ”
From Junio C Hamano <> Subject [ ANNOUNCE ] GIT 1.6.0 Date Sun , 17 Aug 2008 14:16:33 - 0700
The latest feature release GIT 1.6.0 is available at the usual

GIT v1.6.0 Release Notes
========================
User visible changes
--------------------
With the default Makefile settings , most of the programs are now
installed outside your $ PATH , except for " git " , " gitk " and
some server side programs that need to be accessible for technical
reasons .
Invoking a git subcommand as " git- xyzzy " from the command
line has been deprecated since early 2006 ( and officially announced in
1.5.4 release notes ) ; use of them from your scripts after adding
output from " git -- exec - path " to the $ PATH is still supported in this
release , but users are again strongly encouraged to adjust their
scripts to use " git xyzzy " form , as we will stop installing
" git - xyzzy " hardlinks for built - in commands in later releases .
An earlier change to page " git status " output was overwhelmingly unpopular
and has been reverted .
Source changes needed for porting to MinGW environment are now all in the
main git.git codebase .
By default , packfiles created with this version uses delta - base - offset
encoding introduced in v1.4.4 .
Pack idx files are using version 2 that
allows larger packs and added robustness thanks to its CRC checking ,
introduced in v1.5.2 and v1.4.4.5 .
If you want to keep your repositories
backwards compatible past these versions , set repack.useDeltaBaseOffset
to false or pack .
indexVersion to 1 , respectively .
We used to prevent sample hook scripts shipped in templates / from
triggering by default by relying on the fact that we install them as
unexecutable , but on some filesystems , this approach does not work .
They are now shipped with " .sample " suffix .
If you want to activate
any of these samples as - is , rename them to drop the " .sample " suffix ,
instead of running " chmod +x " on them .
For example , you can rename
hooks / post - update .sample to hooks / post - update to enable the sample
hook that runs update - server - info , in order to make repositories
friendly to dumb protocols ( i.e. HTTP ) .
GIT_CONFIG , which was only documented as affecting " git config " , but
actually affected all git commands , now only affects " git config " .
GIT_LOCAL_CONFIG , also only documented as affecting " git config " and
not different from GIT_CONFIG in a useful way , is removed .
The " .dotest " temporary area " git am " and " git rebase " use is now moved
inside the $ GIT_DIR , to avoid mistakes of adding it to the project by
accident .
An ancient merge strategy " stupid " has been removed .
Updates since v1.5.6
--------------------
( subsystems )
* git -p4 in contrib learned " allowSubmit " configuration to control on
which branch to allow " submit " subcommand .
* git -gui learned to stage changes per-line .
( portability )
* Changes for MinGW port have been merged , thanks to Johannes Sixt and
gangs .
* Sample hook scripts shipped in templates / are now suffixed with
*.sample .
* perl 's in - place edit ( - i ) does not work well without backup files on Windows ;
some tests are rewritten to cope with this .
( documentation )
* Updated howto/update-hook -example
* Got rid of usage of " git - foo " from the tutorial and made typography
more consistent .
* Disambiguating " -- " between revs and paths is finally documented .
( performance , robustness , sanity etc. )
* index - pack used too much memory when dealing with a deep delta chain .
This has been optimized .
* reduced excessive inlining to shrink size of the " git " binary .
* verify - pack checks the object CRC when using version 2 idx files .
* When an object is corrupt in a pack , the object became unusable even
when the same object is available in a loose form ,
We now try harder to
fall back to these redundant objects when able .
In particular , " git
repack - a - f " can be used to fix such a corruption as long as necessary
objects are available .
* Performance of " git - blame - C - C " operation is vastly improved .
* git -clone does not create refs in loose form anymore ( it behaves as
if you immediately ran git - pack - refs after cloning ) .
This will help
repositories with insanely large number of refs .
* core.fsyncobjectfiles configuration can be used to ensure that the loose
objects created will be fsync'ed ( this is only useful on filesystems
that does not order data writes properly ) .
* " git commit - tree " plumbing can make Octopus with more than 16 parents .
" git commit " has been capable of this for quite some time .
( usability , bells and whistles )
* even more documentation pages are now accessible via " man " and " git help " .
* A new environment variable GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES can be used to stop
the discovery process of the toplevel of working tree ; this may be useful
when you are working in a slow network disk and are outside any working tree ,
as bash - completion and " git help " may still need to run in these places .
* By default , stash entries never expire .
Set reflogexpire in [ gc
" refs / stash " ] to a reasonable value to get traditional auto - expiration
behaviour back
* Longstanding latency issue with bash completion script has been
addressed .
This will need to be backmerged to ' maint ' later .
* pager .< cmd > configuration variable can be used to enable / disable the
default paging behaviour per command .
* " git -add - i " has a new action ' e / dit ' to allow you edit the patch hunk
manually .
* git-am records the original tip of the branch in ORIG_HEAD before it
starts applying patches .
* git-apply can handle a patch that touches the same path more than once
much better than before .
* git-apply can be told not to trust the line counts recorded in the input
patch but recount , with the new -- recount option .
* git-apply can be told to apply a patch to a path deeper than what the
patch records with -- directory option .
* git-archive can be told to omit certain paths from its output using
export - ignore attributes .
* git-archive uses the zlib default compression level when creating
zip archive .
* git-archive 's command line options -- exec and -- remote can take their
parameters as separate command line arguments , similar to other commands .
IOW , both " - - exec=path " and " - - exec path " are now supported .
* With -v option , git - branch describes the remote tracking statistics
similar to the way git - checkout reports by how many commits your branch
is ahead / behind .
* git -branch 's -- contains option used to always require a commit parameter
to limit the branches with ; it now defaults to list branches that
contains HEAD if this parameter is omitted .
* git -branch 's -- merged and -- no - merged option used to always limit the
branches relative to the HEAD , but they can now take an optional commit
argument that is used in place of HEAD .
* git -bundle can read the revision arguments from the standard input .
* git-cherry - pick can replay a root commit now .
* git -clone can clone from a remote whose URL would be rewritten by
configuration stored in $ HOME /. gitconfig now .
* " git - clone -- mirror " is a handy way to set up a bare mirror repository .
* git-cvsserver learned to respond to " cvs co - c " .
* git -diff -- check now checks leftover merge conflict markers .
* " git - diff - p " learned to grab a better hunk header lines in
BibTex , Pascal / Delphi , and Ruby files and also pays attention to
chapter and part boundary in TeX documents .
* When remote side used to have branch ' foo ' and git - fetch finds that now
it has branch ' foo / bar ' , it refuses to lose the existing remote tracking
branch and its reflog .
The error message has been improved to suggest
pruning the remote if the user wants to proceed and get the latest set
of branches from the remote , including such ' foo / bar ' .
* fast - export learned to export and import marks file ; this can be used to
interface with fast - import incrementally .
* fast - import and fast - export learned to export and import gitlinks .
* " gitk " left background process behind after being asked to dig very deep
history and the user killed the UI ; the process is killed when the UI goes
away now .
* git -rebase records the original tip of branch in ORIG_HEAD before it is
rewound .
* " git rerere " can be told to update the index with auto - reused resolution
with rerere .autoupdate configuration variable .
* git -rev-parse learned $ commit^ ! and $ commit^@ notations used in " log "
family .
These notations are available in gitk as well , because the gitk
command internally uses rev-parse to interpret its arguments .
* git -rev-list learned -- children option to show child commits it
encountered during the traversal , instead of showing parent commits .
* git -send - mail can talk not just over SSL but over TLS now .
* git-shortlog honors custom output format specified with " -- pretty=format : " .
* " git - stash save " learned -- keep - index option .
This lets you stash away the
local changes and bring the changes staged in the index to your working
tree for examination and testing .
* git -stash also learned branch subcommand to create a new branch out of
stashed changes .
* git-status gives the remote tracking statistics similar to the way
git - checkout reports by how many commits your branch is ahead / behind .
* " git - svn dcommit " is now aware of auto - props setting the subversion user
has .
* You can tell " git status - u " to even more aggressively omit checking
untracked files with -- untracked - files=no .
* Original SHA - 1 value for " update - ref - d " is optional now .
* Error codes from gitweb are made more descriptive where possible , rather
than " 403 forbidden " as we used to issue everywhere .
( internal )
* git-merge has been reimplemented in C .
Fixes since v1.5.6
------------------
All of the fixes in v1.5.6 maintenance series are included in
this release , unless otherwise noted .
* git -clone ignored its -u option ; the fix needs to be backported to
' maint ' ;
* git-mv used to lose the distinction between changes that are staged
and that are only in the working tree , by staging both in the index
after moving such a path .
* " git - rebase - i - p " rewrote the parents to wrong ones when amending
( either edit or squash ) was involved , and did not work correctly
when fast forwarding .

Binyamin " Bibi " Netanyahu was with his sons at a football match on Wednesday night when a tearful Ehud Olmert announced he would be stepping down as leader of his Kadima party after months of battling corruption allegations .
But his mind may have wandered : for whatever happens next , Netanyahu - once the enfant terrible of Israeli politics and one of its most fascinating and controversial figures - stands to gain .
As the implications sink in of Olmert 's decision - for Israel , the Palestinians and the wider Middle East - opinion polls show that the leader of the right - wing Likud opposition remains the Israeli public 's preferred choice as prime minister .
" Bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections , " predicts the journalist Haim Baram , combining " gut feeling " with decades of writing about Israel 's febrile , fragmented political life .
And given that this is a part of the world where worst - case scenarios tend to come true , the looming crisis over Iran 's nuclear ambitions could galvanise squabbling politicians to close ranks and go for a grand national unity coalition : cue Netanyahu .
No wonder his immediate response was to call for early elections - the instinct of a quick - witted politician who seizes on disarray in the enemy camp and senses that his time come .
" This government has reached an end and it does n't matter who heads Kadima .
They are all partners in this government 's total failure , " he declared on Thursday .
" If Bibi sees he can precipitate elections , he will , " says the political analyst Yossi Alpher .
" But it 's impossible to predict what 's going to happen .
There are too many variables . "
Two surveys published yesterday forecast a Likud victory over Kadima , though Netanyahu would have a tougher time if the current foreign minister and aspiring Kadima leader , Tzipi Livni , beats her rival , the hawkish Shaul Mofaz .
Ehud Barak , the Labour party leader and defence minister , is languishing with just 12 % .
Uzi Arad , a former Mossad executive who advises Netanyahu on foreign and security policy , talks too of " imponderables and uncertainties " .
But Netanyahu , he argues , " has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions - precisely what Livni lacks " .
The Likud leader is a " sober , hard - nosed realist " who has consistently opposed the current Annapolis peace talks with the Palestinians and insists on retaining Jewish settlements all over " Judea and Samaria " ( the biblical Hebrew names for the West Bank ) - a position that is simply not compatible with creating a viable Palestinian state .
Hardline views
Netanyahu's hardline views on the Palestinians have barely changed since he first entered public life in the early 1980s .
In 1996 , when he became the country 's youngest prime minister ( and the first who was born after the state was created in 1948 ) he vowed to chip away at the Oslo accords , which were agreed between Yizthak Rabin and Yasser Arafat and broke Israel 's historic taboo on dealing with the PLO .
It was Rabin 's murder by a Jewish extremist , the fatal indecision of the Labour veteran Shimon Peres and a devastating series of Hamas and Islamic Jihad suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that swept the Likud to power .
Few of those who dealt with Netanyahu the prime minister have warm memories of him .
" Who the fuck does he think he is , who 's the fucking superpower here ? " an outraged Bill Clinton asked his aides after his first meeting with the new Israeli leader .
A former diplomat remembers him as being " bumptious and over - confident " when he snubbed Robin Cook , Britain 's foreign secretary , after a high - profile visit to the site of a Jewish settlement being planned in Arab East Jerusalem .
In 1997 Netanyahu did reluctantly agree to withdraw from the West Bank city of Hebron ( though an enclave of fanatical Jewish settlers remain there , over a decade later ) , but generally he was seen " as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new Israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace , " recalled Clinton 's adviser Aaron David Miller .
For Marwan Muasher , Jordan 's ambassador to Israel , Netanyahu 's most striking quality was arrogance coupled with an alarming tendency to spout the old Likud idea that Jordan should oppose Palestinian independence .
And the premier got into deep water when Mossad agents tried and failed to assassinate the Hamas leader Khaled Meshal in Amman by injecting poison into his ear .
King Hussein threatened to storm the Israeli embassy unless Netanyahu backed down and supplied the antidote to save the Palestinan 's life .
Yet like him or loathe him , Netanyahu has always been a slick communicator .
The onetime furniture salesman performed well - in fluent American English - as Israel 's ambassador to the UN and spoke for his country during the 1991 Gulf War , when Saddam Hussein 's Scud missiles hit Israel .
He once donned a gas mask on screen - a brilliant piece of showmanship .
Muasher thought him a " savvy politician , mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it .
He tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors , often by stretching or hiding part of the truth . "
Interestingly , Netanyahu gets on well with Tony Blair , now the Quartet envoy working on Palestinian economic development .
" Netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick , tangible progress , create more jobs and generate growth , " said Arad .
" That may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations " .
But what there is to negotiate about is less than clear .
Netanyahu resigned over Ariel Sharon 's 2005 unilateral withdrawal from Gaza .
And he is sharply focused on Jerusalem 's Temple Mount - " the most explosive square kilometre on earth , " and the danger that the city " will become a Mecca for the world 's terrorists " .
Iran
Terrorism has been an obsession ever since his older brother , Yoni , was killed leading Israeli commandos to free hostages at Uganda 's Entebbe Airport in 1976 .
Netanyahu claims to have predicted the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and has been quoted as saying that 9/11 was " good for Israel " .
He sees Iran as the major problem facing Israel and the world today .
" It 's 1938 , " he told CNN last year , " and Iran is Germany " .
Hamas , and Hizbullah in Lebanon , he argues , are Iranian " proxies " .
And until the Islamic Republic is contained , there can be no progress with the Palestinians .
Haim Baram , a trenchant critic from the left , agrees that a possible Israeli attack on Iran is the big question .
" But Bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than Mofaz or Barak , " he suggests .
Netanyahu , famously described as " the senator for Israel , " has met both Barack Obama and John McCain , though his popularity in the US is on the Republican right and with Christian groups that automatically back Israel , right or wrong .
During a stint as finance minister under Sharon , he won both plaudits and brickbats for pushing through Thatcherite - style market reforms that boosted growth - and inequality .
But it is on the enduring core issues of war , peace , borders and territory that he will be judged by voters when the time comes .
" Israelis have lost faith in peace , " says Ha'aretz commentator Tom Segev .
" They do n't believe in it any more .
People will vote for Bibi because they say ' if there is no peace , we might as well have a strong leader ' . "

Four years ago Dave Shea gave us CSS Sprites , and it was good .
Since then they ’ve seen wide adoption , both for reducing HTTP request counts ( ( Nowadays many websites spend more time receiving , setting up , and tearing down requests than they do actually sending the files .
Considering that HTTP only allows two to four images to be downloaded at once , it ’s easy to have network latency dominate your load times . ) ) and for doing away with Javscript image pre-loading .
As great as CSS Sprites are , they ’re a bit more more error - prone than using traditional images .
Google uses them extensively , and I ’ve noticed a trick they use to keep everything lined up right .
Between the images in their sprites on Google Reader , they ’ve put a red line of pixels .
That way , if something is one pixel off , it will be caught immediately .
As clever as this is , it has a problem : we ’ve entered an era where one pixel at design time does n’t always mean one pixel at display time .
My favourite example of this is OS - wide resolution independence , but it ’s here today in Firefox 3 .
To the right is an example of Google Reader scaled up a couple notches using full - page zoom .
It ’s technically difficult to scale pixel - based designs seamlessly , and Firefox does a good job most of the time .
Usually those half - pixel - off problems are n’t glaring , but Google stirs in some # FF0000 and kicks up the sucking .
So what do we have , in the end ?
A useful trick that reveals a bug in Firefox , or a Google engineer who was too clever for his own good ?
During October 2007 , the popular BitTorrent tracker OiNK was shut down in a joint effort by Dutch and British law enforcement .
Today , OiNK admin Alan Ellis has been charged with conspiracy to defraud .
Charges against four OiNK uploaders will follow later today .
After extending the bail date 5 times , Cleveland police has announced the charges against OiNK administrator Alan Ellis .
Cleveland police initially stated that the charges against Alan would be announced during December 2007 , but this was soon postponed for two months due to a lack of evidence , only to be postponed another 4 times .
Interestingly , the charges against Ellis are not related to copyright offenses .
Instead , he has been charged with “ conspiracy to defraud ” , further details about the charges are not available at the moment , but are likely to be released in the coming days .
On 24th September , the case will he heard at a magistrates court .
Later today there will be more news regarding the charges ( if there are any ) against the four OiNK uploaders .
Initially , six uploaders were arrested on suspicion of “ Conspiracy to Defraud the Music Industry ” , and other copyright offenses .
However , two uploaders were released from further investigation in July .
The OiNK shutdown was an international operation , named “ Operation Ark Royal ” , and both British and Dutch police were involved .
The police acted upon information fed to them by the IFPI and the BPI , two well known anti-piracy organizations who claimed that OiNK was a money machine .
Update : Uploaders are charged .

NASSIRIYA , Iraq ( Reuters ) - About 500 Australian combat troops pulled out of their base in southern Iraq on Sunday , fulfilling an election promise by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to bring the soldiers home this year .
A British military spokesman in the southern city of Basra said the pullout from Talil base in Nassiriya was under way , but a spokesman for the governor of Dhi Qar province said it had been completed , with U.S. forces replacing the Australians .
“ The Australian battle group is pulling out , ” the British military spokesman said .
Australia , a staunch U.S. ally , was one of the first countries to commit troops to the Iraq war .
In addition to the combat troops , it also deployed aircraft and warships to the Gulf to protect Iraq ’s offshore oil platforms .
Since handing over security of Dhi Qar province to the Iraqis , the main role of the Australian battle group , numbering about 515 soldiers , has been to train and support Iraqi forces .
Rudd , who won elections last November , had promised to bring home frontline troops this year .
Polls show 80 percent of Australians oppose the war .
Australia ’s top military commander , Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , said in February that after the troops pulled out , Australia would leave behind two maritime surveillance aircraft and a warship helping patrol the oil platforms , as well as a small force of security and headquarters liaison troops .
The British military spokesman said Australian civilians training the police and advising the Iraqi government would also stay behind .

The number of tuning packages that offer over 700 hp for the new Audi RS6 Avant may be increased by another one .
After the kit extreme from MTM and ABT Sportsline , will be introduced the most powerful kit ( for now ) .
It comes from German tuner B & B and is rated at 715 hp .
With so much power on board , RS6 now accelerate from 0 to 100 km / h in just 3.6 seconds and reaches a maximum speed of 320 km / h .
B & B offers several packages of tuning , the first three developing 650 HP , 670 HP and 700 HP respectively .

Abstract
We present a framework for automatically enhancing videos of a static scene using a few photographs of the same scene .
For example , our system can transfer photographic qualities such as high resolution , high dynamic range and better lighting from the photographs to the video .
Additionally , the user can quickly modify the video by editing only a few still images of the scene .
Finally , our system allows a user to remove unwanted objects and camera shake from the video .
These capabilities are enabled by two technical contributions presented in this paper .
First , we make several improvements to a state - of - the - art multiview stereo algorithm in order to compute view - dependent depths using video , photographs , and structure - from - motion data .
Second , we present a novel image - based rendering algorithm that can re-render the input video using the appearance of the photographs while preserving certain temporal dynamics such as specularities and dynamic scene lighting .
Some of the video enhancements produced by our system .
Given a low quality video of a static scene ( top row ) and a few high quality photographs of the scene , our system can automatically produce a variety of video enhancements ( bottom row ) .
Enhancements include the transfer of photographic qualities such as high resolution , high dynamic range , and better exposure from photographs to video .
The video can also be edited in a variety of ways ( e.g. , object touchup , object removal ) by simply editing a few photographs or video frames .

“ You ’ve got industry trying to capitalize on fear , ” said Dr. Andrew Berchuck , director of gynecologic oncology at Duke University and the immediate past president of the society .
“ We ’d all love to see a screening test for ovarian cancer , ” he added , “ but OvaSure is very premature . ”
OvaSure ’s debut also raises questions about whether greater regulation is needed to assure the validity of a trove of sophisticated new diagnostic tests that are entering the market and are being used as the basis for important treatment decisions .
OvaSure did not go through review by the Food and Drug Administration because the agency generally has not regulated tests developed and performed by a single laboratory , as opposed to test kits that are sold to laboratories , hospitals and doctors .
( All OvaSure blood samples are sent to LabCorp for analysis . )
But the F.D.A. has now summoned LabCorp to discuss OvaSure , saying the data appear insufficient to back the company ’s claims about the test .
“ We believe you are offering a high - risk test that has not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health , ” the agency said in an Aug. 7 letter sent to LabCorp that was posted on the F.D.A .
Web site .
A spokesman for LabCorp , which is short for Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings , said the company looked forward to reviewing the data with the agency but would continue offering the test in the meantime .
Dr. Myla Lai-Goldman , chief medical officer of LabCorp , said that OvaSure had been validated in several studies and that additional data were expected by the end of this year .
Diagnostic tests typically are studied further after they have reached the market , she said .
Dr. Goldman said there was “ tremendous interest ” from physicians in learning more about OvaSure .
Patients and advocacy groups seem divided on OvaSure , which costs about $ 220 to $ 240 .
“ We are hearing from people that they are very excited about it , ” said Cara Tenenbaum , policy director for the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance .
But the alliance urges women to wait for more data before relying on the test .

Sherri Shepherd ' Spins ' Abortion Remarks on The View ( Video )
sat for an interview with black women 's Christian magazine Precious Times .
As is so often the case , the comedian and day time talk show co-host of The View , shared too much information and has gotten herself into trouble yet again .
Not only did Sherri flippantly acknowledge that she had gotten multiple abortions , but also lamented the fact that her boss Barbara Walters needed to get some religion .
The firestorm brewed overnight and it was the first topic on The View this morning .
Check out what Sherri had to say about the entire mess .
She even called Barbara Walters in Paris to smooth over her major gaff .
She received kid glove treatment from her usually vocal co-hosts .
Whoopi Goldberg , in particular , was very solicitous - which was amazing and very uncharacteristic .
Check out the video from this morning 's show below .
It ’s probably safe to bet that all of Microsoft ’s online operations does n’t run off a single server in the basement of Gates ’ house ( on the other hand Apple ’s MobileMe might actually be running in Jobs ’ basement ) , so how many servers do Microsoft actually have ?
Microsoft never says and no one seems to know for sure except the few numbers thrown around including a notable “ 10,000 new servers a month “ , however , a recent promotional video produced by Microsoft ’s Environmental Sustainability group may have accidentally spilled the beans .
The following screencaps are from taken from the video Q&A with Rob Bernard , Chief Environmental Strategist , at 2 min 29sec to 2 min 35sec for those of you playing at home .
Some quick stats gathered from the above clippings : 15 datacenters hosting 148,357 servers sitting on 17,406 racks consuming 72,500 KW of utility power as of the end of January 2008 ( as indicated by the bar chart ) .
If you ’re a bit of a imperial measurement person , that ’s 97,000 horsepower .
So the next time you visit Live Search , think of the horses .
On the same page there ’s also an interesting graph showing the distribution of servers per “ property ” .
Live Search is in the clear lead with approximately 75,000 ( 50 % ) of the servers pushing out those less - than - desirable search results , followed by Hotmail .
The other notable property occupying a large chunk of the servers would be “ other ” ( appropriately named ) , which one could assume be dedicated to XBOX Live services and the like .
Assuming these statistics are real and accurate , then at the growth rate of 10,000 servers a month Microsoft should be at 218,000 servers at the end of August 08 .
A mind - blowing number .
They ’re going to need more horses .

J.K. Rowling 's children 's charity to publish the Tales of Beedle the Bard 31 July 2008 ** Exclusive deal with Bloomsbury , Scholastic and Amazon will generate millions of pounds to help de-institutionalise vulnerable children **
In celebration of Harry Potter 's birthday today , the Children 's High Level Group ( CHLG ) , the English charity co-founded by J.K. Rowling and Emma Nicholson MEP to help children suffering in institutions , announces that it is to publish The Tales of Beedle the Bard .
Fans around the world have been clamouring to read the wizarding fairy tales - created , handwritten and illustrated by J.K. Rowling - since last December , when Amazon famously bid £ 1.95 million / $ 4 million for the charity copy , one of only seven in existence , at Sotheby 's in London .
The Children 's High Level Group will publish three editions of the book , all in the English language , to be printed and distributed by Bloomsbury , Scholastic and Amazon .
The Bloomsbury and Scholastic editions ( £ 6.99 / $ 12.99 ) will feature additional commentary on each fairy tale from Professor Dumbledore and an introduction by J.K. Rowling .
Amazon will produce up to a maximum of 100,000 Collector 's Edition copies ( £ 50 / $ 100 ) , which will aim to closely replicate the look and feel of the original ' Beedle ' .
All editions will go on sale on Thursday 4 December 2008 .
Tales of Beedle the Bard Collector 's Edition
pictured with the original J.K. Rowling manuscript ( smaller )
All net proceeds from the sale of the books - expected to be in the region of £ 4 million / $ 8 million - will be donated to CHLG .
The charity works to make life better for vulnerable children across Europe , where over a million children and teenagers are growing up in unacceptable conditions in large residential institutions .
In most cases they are without adequate human or emotional contact and stimulation , while many only just survive without life 's basics such as adequate shelter and food .
Emma Nicholson says : " We are so thrilled to be publishing such an exclusive and special book .
This unique project will raise vital funds for the work of CHLG , to help us change the lives of hundreds of thousands of marginalised and institutionalised children who are living in appalling conditions , and make sure that no future generation suffers in this way . "
J.K. Rowling says : " There was understandable disappointment among Harry Potter fans when only one copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard was offered to the public last December .
I am therefore delighted to announce that , thanks to the generous support of Bloomsbury , Scholastic and Amazon ( who bought the handwritten copy at auction ) - and with the blessing of the wonderful people who own the other six original books - The Tales of Beedle the Bard will now be widely available to all Harry Potter fans .
Royalties will be donated to the Children 's High Level Group , to benefit institutionalised children in desperate need of a voice .
The new edition will include the Tales themselves , translated from the original runes by Hermione Granger , and with illustrations by me , but also notes by Professor Albus Dumbledore , which appear by generous permission of the Hogwarts Headmasters ' Archive . "
Containing clues that were to prove crucial to Harry Potter 's final mission to destroy Lord Voldemort 's Horcruxes , The Tales of Beedle the Bard is the volume of five wizarding fairy tales left to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore in the seventh and final book , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows .
Only one - The Tale of the Three Brothers - is recounted in the book .
In The Tales of Beedle the Bard , the four remaining stories are revealed for the very first time .

NEAT READING FOR ALL CAR BUFFS AND SPEED FREAKS
One top fuel dragster 500 cubic inch Hemi engine makes more horsepower than the first 4 rows of stock cars at the Daytona 500 .
It takes just 15/100ths of a second for all 6,000 + horsepower of an NHRA Top Fuel dragster engine to reach the rear wheels .
Under full throttle , a dragster engine consumes 1 - 1/ 2 gallons of nitro methane per second ; a fully loaded 747 consumes jet fuel at the same rate with 25 % less energy being produced .
A stock Dodge Hemi V8 engine cannot produce enough power to drive the dragster ’s supercharger .
With 3,000 CFM of air being rammed in by the supercharger on overdrive , the fuel mixture is compressed into a near - solid form before ignition .
Cylinders run on the verge of hydraulic lock at full throttle .
At the stoichiometric ( stoichiometry : methodology and technology by which quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions are determined ) 1.7:1 air / fuel mixture of nitro methane , the flame front temperature measures 7,050 degrees F .
Nitro methane burns yellow .
The spectacular white flame seen above the stacks at night is raw burning hydrogen , dissociated from atmospheric water vapor by the searing exhaust gases .
Dual magnetos supply 44 amps to each spark plug .
This is the output of an arc welder in each cylinder .
Spark plug electrodes are totally consumed during a pass .
After halfway , the engine is dieseling from compression , plus the glow of exhaust valves at 1,400 degrees F .
The engine can only be shut down by cutting the fuel flow .
If spark momentarily fails early in the run , unburned nitro builds up in the affected cylinders and then explodes with sufficient force to blow cylinder heads off the block in pieces or split the block in half .
In order to exceed 300 mph in 4.5 seconds , dragsters must accelerate an average of over 4 G’s .
In order to reach 200 mph ( well before half - track ) , the launch acceleration approaches 8 G’s .
Dragsters reach over 300 miles per hour before you have completed reading this sentence .
Top fuel engines turn approximately 540 revolutions from light to light !
Including the burnout , the engine must only survive 900 revolutions under load .
The redline is actually quite high at 9,500 rpm .
Assuming all the equipment is paid off , the crew worked for free , and for once NOTHING BLOWS UP , each run costs an estimate $ 1,000.00 per second .
The current top fuel dragster elapsed time record is 4.428 seconds for the quarter mile ( 11/12/06 , Tony Schumacher , at Pomona , CA ) .
The top speed record is 336.15 mph as measured over the last 66 ′ of the run ( 05/25/05 Tony Schumacher , at Hebron , OH ) .
Putting all of this into perspective :
You are driving the average $ 140,000 Lingenfelter “ twin- turbo ” powered Corvette Z06 .
Over a mile up the road , a top fuel dragster is staged and ready to launch down a quarter mile strip as you pass .
You have the advantage of a flying start .
You run the ‘ Vette hard up through the gears and blast across the starting line and pass the dragster at an honest 200 mph .
The “ tree ” goes green for both of you at that moment .
The dragster launches and starts after you .
You keep your foot down hard , but you hear an incredibly brutal whine that sears your eardrums and within 3 seconds , the dragster catches and passes you .
He beats you to the finish line , a quarter mile away from where you just passed him .
Think about it , from a standing start , the dragster had spotted you 200 mph and not only caught , but nearly blasted you off the road when he passed you within a mere 1,320 foot long race course .
… and that , my friend , is ACCELERATION !
Do you believe in the Ancient Astronaut or sometimes called the Ancient Alien theory ?
For anybody unfamiliar with this theory ; it basically states that beings ( aliens ) came to Earth in the ancient past to help shape our society and brought us civilization as we know it today .
Humans that came into contact or witnessed these beings believed them to be Gods and ended up passing stories down every generation concerning the Gods from the sky .
So , do people seriously believe in this theory ?
And what and where is the best evidence ?
Ever since Eric Von Daniken ’s book Chariots of the Gods was published almost 40 years ago , there have been hundreds of thousands ( possibly millions ) of people that really believe that at some point in our past we have been visited .
Von Daniken and many other authors have continued to write about these ancient astronauts and their books are always top sellers .
Even the History Channel has a 5 part series ( possibly could go to 8 parts when finished ) about Ancient Aliens coming to Earth .
So that sums up the popularity of the theory with the public but what about the evidence ?
There are tons of things that people bring up as evidence for this theory but I am going to focus on some of the more popular ones here .
Below is a list of the best evidence so far with this theory … … …
1. ) Nazca Lines – Pictographs of living animals ( even people ) and insects , straight lines , and plants .
All of these pictographs can only be seen from flying over them .
There even appears to be a runway .
Possibly for beings in spaceships ?
2. ) Mahabharata and Ramyana – Ancient Indian Epics ( poems ) that talk about a great battle with men in flying machines and large powerful weapons .
Written over 2000 years ago .
Are they just a good story or did they witness something in the sky back then ?
3. ) Ancient buildings and the construction of them .
Questions still remain on structures such as Stonehenge , the Great Pyramid and many South and Latin American sites on how they were built .
Many of these sites have proven to be as precise or even better than what we can do today .
Seen below is PumaPunku .
Did these beings show us how to do this ?
4. ) Small gold figurines found that closely resemble modern day aircraft .
Once again were these toys or someone ’s imagination or possibly aircraft that these ancient people were witnessing ?
5. ) Legends in every religion in the world describing Gods or holy people in flying machines , miraculous technology , and beings coming from the Sky .
Was it God or aliens though ?
6. ) Cave art in Italy and Australia and others around the world that closely resembles a person with a suit on similar to what our modern astronauts wear .
Did these ancient people witness these beings from space in spacesuits ?
7. ) Pictures in Egyptian hieroglyphics with what appears to be a helicopter , a plane , a rocket and even a light bulb .
How much technology did the Egyptians actually have and where did they learn it from ?
So , there you have some of the best evidence to support the Ancient Astronaut theory .
I know this list is not complete and I could list many more things that support this theory but this does give you the general things that people look for to support it .
So , what is your decision on the theory ?
One thing is for certain and that is , no matter if the theory is true or not , it has certainly caught everyone ’s attention and will continue to be a hot topic for years to come ……..
Well with the bright green shirt it looks like they 're just doing a real time chroma - key replacement .
Still a neat effect though .
How about we just dip the witch in a vat of green paint and then we can make her wear whatever we want :)

And not forgetting Second Life , Paris Hilton , YouTube , Lindsay Lohan , World of Warcraft , The Dark Knight , Radiohead and Barack Obama .
Oh , and great big naked tits .
In 3D .
Let me explain .
Last week , I wrote a piece on 9/11 conspiracy theories which virtually broke the Guardian website as thousands of " truthers " ( painfully earnest online types who sincerely believe 9/11 was an inside job ) poured through the walls to unfurl their two pence worth .
Some outlined alternative " theories " .
Some mistakenly equated dismissing the conspiracy theories with endorsing the Bush administration .
Some simply wailed , occasionally in CAPITALS .
Others , correctly , identified me as a paid - off establishment shill acting under instructions from the CIA .
Now to sit here and painstakingly rebut everything the truthers said would take three months and several hundred pages , and would be a massive waste of the world 's time , because ultimately I 'm right and they 're wrong - well - meaning , but wrong .
What 's more , I 've woken up with an alarming fever and am sweating like a miner as I type these words .
On the cusp of hallucinating .
Consequently my brain is n't working properly ; it feels like it 's been marinaded in petrol , then wrapped in a warm towel .
So I 'm hardly at my sharpest .
Actually , sod it : you win , truthers .
I give up .
You 're 100 % correct .
Inside job , clearly .
Whatever .
Now pass the paracetamol .
Anyway , because it contained the words " 9/11 conspiracy " , the article generated loads of traffic for the Guardian site , which in turn means loads of advertising revenue .
And in this day and age , what with the credit crunch and the death of print journalism and everything , the use of attention - grabbing keywords is becoming standard practice .
" Search engine optimisation " , it 's known as , and it's the journalistic equivalent of a classified ad that starts with the word " SEX ! " in large lettering , and " Now that we 've got your attention . . . " printed below it in smaller type .
For instance , according to the latest Private Eye , journalists writing articles for the Telegraph website are being actively encouraged to include oft - searched - for phrases in their copy .
So an article about shoe sales among young women would open : " Young women - such as Britney Spears - are buying more shoes than ever . "
On the one hand , you could argue this is nothing new ; after all , for years newspapers have routinely jazzed up dull print articles with photographs of attractive female stars ( you know the sort of thing : a giant snap of Keira Knightley doing her Atonement wet - T - shirt routine to illustrate a report about the state of Britain 's fountain manufacturers ) .
But at least in those instances the actual text of the article itself survived unscathed .
There 's something uniquely demented about slotting specific words and phrases into a piece simply to con people into reading it .
Why bother writing a news article at all ?
Why not just scan in a few naked photos and have done with it ?
And if you do persevere with search - engine - optimised news reports , where do you draw the line ?
Next time a bomb goes off , are we going to read " Terror outrage : BRITNEY , ANGELINA and OBAMA all unaffected as hundreds die in SEXY agony " ?
And wait , it gets worse .
These phrases do n't just get lobbed in willy - nilly .
No .
A lot of care and attention goes into their placement .
Apparently the average reader quickly scans each page in an " F - pattern " : reading along the top first , then glancing halfway along the line below , before skimming their eye downward along the left - hand side .
If there 's nothing of interest within that golden " F " zone , he or she will quickly clear off elsewhere .
Which means your modern journalist is expected not only to shoehorn all manner of hot phraseology into their copy , but to try and position it all in precisely the right place .
That 's an alarming quantity of unnecessary shit to hold in your head while trying to write a piece about the unions .
Sorry , SEXUAL unions .
Mainly , though , it 's just plain undignified : turning the journalist into the equivalent of a reality TV wannabe who turns up to the auditions in a gaudy fluorescent thong in a desperate bid to be noticed .
And for the consumer , it 's just one more layer of distracting crud - the bane of the 21st century .
Distracting crud comes in countless forms - from the onscreen clutter of 24 - hour news stations to the winking , blinking ads on every other web page .
These days , each separate square inch of everything is simultaneously vying for your attention , and the overall effect is to leave you feeling bewildered , distanced , feverish and slightly insane .
Or maybe that 's just me , today .
Actually , it 's definitely just me .
Like I say , I 'm ill , my brain 's not working .
Which is why opening this piece with a slew of hot search terms probably was n't a brilliant wheeze .
Perhaps if I close with a selection of the LEAST searched - for terms ever , I can redress the balance .
Worth a shot .
Um . . .

Yup .
That should do it .
· This week Charlie somehow managed to get this column finished : " Despite mistyping every other word and having to break off every five minutes to lie on his bed clutching his brow , whimpering .
He will almost certainly have died by the time you read it . "
We 're very tickled today because the Mars Phoenix lander has " friended " us on Facebook , which makes us feel very special , even though Phoenix has over 2000 such close personal friends ( including the Spousal Unit and several fellow science bloggers ) .
I was a bit late to the party , but happy to finally be included in all the festivities -- no doubt with DJ Spock providing the groovy tunes .
And now I feel like I really know my new friend , after reading this two - part interview with the Neural Gourmet .
Apparently Phoenix even has a Twitter account , making this particular NASA excursion a bit of an experiment in interactive performance art .
But the subject of today 's image - heavy post is about more traditional visual art , and how so many artists have found inspiration in the concepts of science -- and maybe even vice versa .
Because why should Jessica Palmer over at Bioephemera have all the fun ?
For the all the fuss about C.P. Snow 's infamous notion of " two cultures , " art and science have a rich long history of feeding into each other , despite certain differences in what each deems most important .
For instance , a scientist mostly cares that the science is correct , and if an image is also aesthetically beautiful , well , that 's just a bonus .
Many people refer to this sort of work as " scientific visualization . "
( If your name was Leonardo da Vinci , the boundary was a bit more blurred , but even Leonardo would , I think , distinguish between some of his engineering and anatomical sketches -- exquisitely rendered though they are -- with fully realized works like the Mona Lisa . )
The undisputed queen of scientific visualization today is MIT 's Felice Frankel , whose stunning images of things like colonies of bacteria or the behavior of water molecules have graced many a cover of the leading scientific journals ( Nature , Science , Physics Today , and so forth ) .
She co-authored a book , Envisioning Science , with George Whitesides , which is well worth checking out if you 're at all interested in science imagery .
And you can read an extensive online interview with Frankel here .
Perhaps her most famous photograph is the one below , depicting a drop of ferrofluid on a glass slide atop a slip of yellow paper , under which are seven small circular magnets that affect the form of the drop .
The shape of the fluid , the color contrasts , please our visual senses on a purely aesthetic level , while the underlying scientific concept remains uncompromised .
That 's a pretty tough thing to do , which explains why the image is the most reproduced of any of Frankel 's work .
In fact , she claims to be " sick of it . "
So naturally we have to reproduce it here , with apologies to Frankel for proliferating her artistic meme . :
Frankel 's work is aesthetically pleasing , as well as scientifically accurate , but is it art ?
When she was profiled in the New York Times last summer , that question prompted quite a bit of debate .
I pondered it heavily myself : what makes a science - inspired image truly " art " ?
Perhaps there is a debate , not so much because Frankel is blurring boundaries , but because she has raised the standard for scientific visualization to an unprecedented high level , making it much harder to tell the difference .
Few others have even come close to the caliber of her work .
University of Chicago physicist Sidney Nagel is known for his stunning photographs of liquid drops eerily in suspended in time , making him a notable exception :
Nagel 's primary focus , however , is the science : he's an expert on the physics of fluids and granular materials , and his photography -- while both skillful and visually stunning -- serves the purpose of his work .
There 's absolutely nothing wrong with that ; but is it , therefore , art ?
Frankel herself says no .
" My stuff is about phenomena , " she told the New York Times .
" So I do n't call it art .
When it 's art , it 's more about the creator , not necessarily the concept in the image . "
During my own ponderings , I concluded something similar : visualization accurately renders the science , preferably in an arresting , artful manner ; an artistic work transforms it to reflect the creative impulse of the artist .
Both , however , can make you look at familiar phenomena in a strikingly new way .
Some people were kinda bothered by Frankel 's seeming dismissal of her work , but this implies a value judgment : that art is somehow more " pure " or important than visualization .
I do n't agree .
Frankel is at the top of her field ( scientific visualization ) , and we do her no disservice by recognizing what her work is ... and what it is n't .
Not that scientists can't become highly accomplished artists , mind you .
I just learned about Frank Malina , an aeronautical engineer , rocketry pioneer , and first director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , while reading M.G. Lord 's excellent book , Astroturf : The Private Life of Rocket Science .
After World War II , Malina fell victim to McCarthyism and wound up working for UNESCO in Paris .
Always a bit of a polymath , with broad cultural interests , later in life , Malina ended up drawing upon his engineering expertise to become one of the early pioneers of kinetic art -- which really flummoxed the federal agents charged with keeping tabs on his supposedly subversive activities -- simply because he was interested in expanding " the limitations of paint . "
For instance , he 'd add actual depth ( as opposed to illusory ) by placing wire mesh or string over the surface of a painting .
Then , while taking down the family Christmas tree in 1955 , he thought it would a marvelous idea ( " Zoinks ! " ) to incorporate blinking Christmas lights into the wire mesh to add a sense of movement to his art .
Per Lord :
" Soon Malina began ' painting ' with electric motors .
These drove wheels that were divided into colored sections .
Images were formed through the overlap of colors and shapes and were in constant flux .
The apex of Malina 's technical innovations may be what he termed his Lumidyne system .
It involved light projected onto and through Plexiglass screens to form fluid , soft - edged , ever - changing patterns .
Malina 's Lumidyne pieces often evoked astronomical phenomena .
Not dependent on external illumination -- electricity drove their lights and motors -- the radiant compositions suggest swirls of gas and dust around distant stars . "
Apparently , the European art world was a bit slow to appreciate Malina 's artwork ; he had equal numbers of fans and detractors , and the FBI , frankly , did n't get it at all .
( I mean , if he was n't encoding secret messages to his imaginary Commie cronies in his artwork , what could possibly be the point ? )
Here 's a slightly grainy picture of his 1956 piece , " Point Counter Point " :
Malina also founded Leonardo , a journal dedicated " to documenting work at the intersection of the arts , science and technology . "
I 'm guessing he was n't a big believer in that whole " Two Cultures " thing either .
He makes a nice addition to my growing " collection " of artists inspired by science .
And so does Lia Halloran , an LA - based artist whom I met over the weekend at a friendly gathering of scientists and artists in Pasadena ( the spirit of Malina would have smiled upon the scene ) .
She 's a big physics - fan , and it very much informs her art : she 's figured out visually arresting ways to make the abstract and / or invisible apparent to the viewer .
Her 2007 show at DCKT Contemporary gallery at Bowery and Spring Street in New York City was called The World is Bound with Secret Knots .
The exhibit featured six figure paintings exploring the interaction of unseen physical forces of nature with human figures , like this one , entitled " Centripetal - Centrifugal " :
For those in the NYC area -- or if you 're planning on attending the SciBling meetup of SEED Science Bloggers and readers -- head on down to the DCKT gallery in Soho to take in Halloran 's latest show , Dark Skate .
( Those living elsewhere can view most of her work on her Website . )
Yep , she 's an avid skateboarder , and knows darn well that this involves a heck of a lot of physics .
The new show features a series of photographs taken at night in various locations around Los Angeles where skaters ( or " sk8ers " as the kids today call them ) converge .
She used light ( how ?
I dunno , but I 'll be sure to ask ) to trace a line while Halloran skateboarded around the venues .
The result : images that clearly show the trajectory of her movements over time -- evidence of past action , but with no trace of the figure that left the pattern .
( Particle physicists can probably relate . )
Here 's one of those images , taken in nearby Griffith Park :
Long - time readers might recall my blogging about the work of Connecticut - based painter Nash Hyon in 2006 , who works primarily with encaustics ( wax - based paints ) .
I 'd seen her paintings included in an exhibit at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington , DC , and have been a fan ever since .
As often happens in this Internet age , Hyon stumbled on my blog post several months later , and invited me to visit her studio in Connecticut , where I got to see the whole encaustics process in action .
She still had my favorite painting : " Gadolinium . "
With the Spousal Unit 's permission , we bought it , and it now graces our Los Angeles bedroom .
Hyon just put up her own Web site ( and a blog ! ) , which is well worth checking out .
Because all her paintings are striking .
One series is called ATCG , drawing on biology / genetics to explore what it means to be human .
With her " Elements " series , she cherry - picks certain aspects from the scientific properties or history of an element in the periodic table and uses that as a basis for her painting .
Sometimes the connection is fairly obvious , as with " Lithium " ( # 3 ) , a soft alkali metal commonly found in mood - stabilizing drugs to treat , for example , bipolar disorder :
Sometimes the connection is less clear ( or not entirely scientific in nature ) .
For instance , thanks to Hyon , I discovered an element I did n't even know existed : " Tantalum " ( #73 ) , a rare , hard , blue - grey transition metal found in many electronic components ( or at least used in their manufacture ) .
The name derives from the Greek myth of Tantalus , whom the gods punished after death by having him stand knee - deep in water with tasty fruit above his head .
If he bent to drink the water , it drained beyond his reach .
If he reached up for the fruit , the branches moved out of his reach .
( Those Greek gods were right bastards , were n't they ? )
Hence our verb " to tantalize . "
And here 's how Hyon transformed those random bits of information :
Thanks to a few links from various Sciblings , a few months ago , I discovered the work of Glendon Mellow , a.k.a. , " The Flying Trilobite . "
He 's an artist / illustrator with a quirky sensibility ( and a style that calls to mind Dave McKean , among others ) , based in Toronto , Ontario , with his wife and a hermit crab named Shiny .
At least that 's his bloggy bio sez .
His pieces are n't just about trilobites , but the creatures are often incorporated into many of his paintings , such as this one , called " Life as a Trilobite " :
Artists are n't always so obvious with their nods to scientific inspiration , but that does n't mean it is n't there .
New York City artist Adam Cvijanovic made a splash a couple of years ago with his gigantic , room - sized multi-paneled mural , " Love Poem , 10 Minutes After the End of Gravity , " showing a section of Los Angeles in the process of breaking up and floating away .
" Love Poem , " by his own admission , is certainly not a treatise on the force of gravity , nor is it 100 % scientifically accurate .
That was never the point .
But he did successfully imagine a fanciful scenario of what might happen if , indeed , gravity suddenly disappeared ( barring all the other apocalyptic stuff that would most likely have to accompany such a disastrous event )
I 've known Cvijanovic for over a decade ( he was married to one of my closest friends until recently , and he painted a gorgeous mural for my living room when I was still based in Washington DC -- and yes , I still miss it , thanks for the painful reminder ) .
I have always been impressed with the degree of research and deep thought he puts into even the smallest element of a painting -- all artists do , to be sure , but folks like me rarely get an inside peek into that creative process , unless we know the artist personally .
For instance , when he was working on a project that mimicked medieval illuminated manuscripts , he experimented for weeks at making his own parchment for ultimate verisimilitude .
Lately , he 's been specializing in these giant installations of murals painted on Tyvek , so it works just like wallpaper : easily applied , and then removed .
He just had a show this spring at Bellwether Gallery in New York called Colossal Spectacle : one giant installation inspired by D.W. Griffith 's failed celluloid epic Intolerance , depicting the court of Babylonian king Belshazzar .
This big climactic scene is what apparently bankrupted Griffith before his film could be completed .
Cvijanovic is fascinated by this sort of hubris : spectacular display followed by a crash and inevitable decay .
He 's also keen on popular culture : I dimly recall a series of sketches he did of the James Bond ( Connery era ) movie Thunderball , just for fun : he'd pause the movie and give himself however long the DVD player gave him to sketch the outlines of the scene , and fill in the blanks from there .
Just like scientists , artists can take their inspiration from any number of unlikely sources .
I bring the pop culture thing up because we all shared an inordinate fondness for Dogs Playing Poker , a campy series of oil paintings commissioned in 1903 to advertise cigars .
Those darn dogs have become a significant cultural reference point , despite being of questionable artistic merit .
For instance , in The Thomas Crown Affair , a stolen Monet turns out to be a fake , painted over a canvas of one of the Dogs Playing Poker series .
Sure , it 's funny , and more people are likely to recognize one of those paintings than your average Monet -- but is it art ?
Probably not , or maybe we need to expand our definition still further to incorporate this particular subgroup of commercial art , which has other merits beyond the purely aesthetic .
The Spousal Unit alerted me to an hilarious series of print ads for the Toyota Prius -- not official ones , some advertising dude just created them to plump up his portfolio -- recently featured on the blog Sociological Images ( part of Contexts magazine ) .
I think they 're actually pretty brilliant , depicting folks engaged in all kinds of despicable behavior next to the car , with the tagline , " At least s/he drives a Prius . "
This one is my favorite , called " The Body Dump " :

But Democrats and Republicans are deeply split about how to respond .
The deadlock in Washington was apparent last month when the Senate failed to pass a bill to double energy assistance to low - income households because Republicans insisted on including measures to allow for more offshore drilling .

“ This could be the winter of our discontent , ” said Daniel J. Weiss , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress .
“ This is going to have a huge impact .
It will start to pinch people in September and October and could influence this fall ’s elections .
Remember , it is much easier for people to drive less than it is to heat less . ”
Consumers are not entirely powerless , of course , and have already started to react to higher energy bills .
Gasoline consumption is down by 2.4 percent in the last month , compared with the same period last year , according to the latest figures from the Department of Energy .
Oil futures , which reached a record of $ 145.29 last month , closed at $ 119.17 on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday .
Gasoline prices have also declined after reaching a nationwide peak of $ 4.11 a gallon .
Gasoline is now selling for $ 3.87 a gallon on average , according to AAA , the automobile group .
Heating oil futures settled Tuesday at $ 3.28 a gallon , down 2 percent .
Retail prices can add $ 1 a gallon or more to futures prices after marketing and distribution costs .
“ The deteriorating demand picture reinforces our belief that oil prices are approaching a tipping point , ” energy analysts at Lehman Brothers said in a report last week .
They forecast crude oil prices to average $ 90 a barrel by the beginning of next year .
With prices still high , policy makers are under pressure to act .
While Democrats want to rein in what they see as excessive speculation in commodity markets and have proposed to release some oil from the nation ’s strategic reserves , Republicans are pressing to open more areas to offshore drilling .
This deadlock has prevented the passage of any energy legislation lately , although many experts say there is little Congress can do to reduce prices in the short term .
“ It is one thing if you ca n’t drive your car , but it is quite another thing if you ca n’t stay warm on a cold winter night , ” said former Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II , the president of Citizens Energy , a nonprofit organization that provides low - cost energy assistance to poor people .
It did not take long for people to discover the strange circumstances surrounding the birth of Sarah Palin ’s youngest child , Trig , widely reported to be a Down Syndrome baby .
Ms. Palin only revealed that she was pregnant one month before his birth , when she was in her 7th month , and in the midst of a very busy schedule , with recent trips to Washington , DC and Los Angeles .
She bragged about going back to work as a Mayor the day after giving birth to her daughter , Piper , and , sure enough , in April , when Trig was born , she was back in her office in three days ( it might have been earlier , but this birth was on a Friday , so there was a weekend following ) .
That is enough to make many of us squirm , but it gets much stranger when we learn that Governor Palin ’s water broke while she was attending an energy forum in Texas on Thursday , April 17th , but that she stayed for the event , made her own 30 minute speech , and then , rather than going to a hospital , she chose to board an Alaska Airlines plane for what must have been at least a 9 hour flight , according to their current schedule , then drove another 43 miles to give birth at the Mat Su Regional Medical Center in Palmer , Alaska .
Her choice to not respond to her water breaking has led to an internet uproar at
www.BuzzFlash.com
and elsewhere , especially regarding her priorities , her decisions , her parenting , and her character . . .
But to me , they ’re missing the point .
I return to the question of why Sarah Palin was chosen by McCain , especially when he had n’t even spent any time with her ?
The reasons can't be good .
And , in truth , the reasons are n't just his .
At one time in his life , McCain may have been his own man , but that time has passed .
He is in the hands of Rove and Cheney 's people , or he would n't be where he is today .
They may not be thrilled with the candidate they got , but given the other choices of a flipflopping Mormon , an evangelist , or a lazy actor , McCain appeared to be the most electable .
So they picked up from his failing campaign , dusted him off , and assigned their people to him as consultants .
They settled , and so did he , and he is cooperating .
So , now we have a vice presidential candidate who came out of nowhere .
No , not nowhere -- Alaska .
Where Ted Stevens is old and busted - so the oil companies can't use him any more .
But Sarah Palin ?
Oh my .
Known for that odd combination of being both a Christian and a bully , and for her support of
giving up both the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and polar bears
, she fits the Bush / Cheney / McCain transition perfectly .
In this light , I ask ,
" What was she doing in Texas that was so important that she could n’t leave , and that she did n’t want to highlight by giving birth in Texas ? "
Reported to be a " forum on energy with Texas Gov. Rick Perry and executives from four other states " , it took a little digging to find that this forum was a closed - door affair hosting a select group of nine Republican governors and such notable corporate energy VIPS ( and polluters ) as Greg Boyce , chairman and CEO of the Peabody Energy Corp. ; John Hofmeister , president of Shell Oil ; Robert A. Malone , chairman and president , BP America ; Anthony Orlando , president and CEO , Covanta Energy Corp. ; and John Somerhalder II , chairman and CEO , AGL Resources .
It is important , too , to understand that the host , Governor Rick Perry , is the governor neatly trained to take Bush 's spot in the Texas Governor 's mansion .
Before that , Perry defeated Jim Hightower for Texas Agricultural Commissioner with the help of Karl Rove and his scurilous tactics .
Perry is also the father of Dick Cheney 's son- in - law , the lawyer
Phillip Perry
, who has bounced back and forth for the last several years between lobbying for Lockheed Martin and working for the White House .
His wife ,
Elizabeth Cheney
, though a mother of five herself , is a hawk for attacking Iran and has worked in the Bush Cheney State Department .
On the morning in March when Barack Obama was preparing to give his speech on race in Philadelphia to try to contain the fallout from the Jeremiah Wright imbroglio , I was having breakfast in Washington with a member of John McCain ’s inner circle .
The topic at hand was whether McCain was licking his chops at the prospect of facing Obama in the fall — whether he relished the idea of running negative against the hopemonger on questions of his patriotism and , er , otherness .
My McCainiac source noted that his boss had “ demonstrated admirable restraint and respect for Obama in the last few weeks , ” citing McCain ’s rebuke of the Tennessee GOP when it issued a press release that invoked Obama ’s middle name and featured that photo of him in Somali tribal clothing , calling it “ Muslim garb . ”
“ McCain has drawn a bright line and said that ’s unacceptable , ” my companion said .
“ It ’s a genuine reflex : He really wants the campaign to be civil . ”
The following night I was drinking with a big - time Republican operative who ’d worked during the primaries for a rival candidate .
When I floated the notion of the Good McCain , this person snorted .
“ He did n’t have a problem calling Mitt Romney a phony in New Hampshire or comparing George W. Bush to Bill Clinton in South Carolina in 2000 , ” he said .
“ McCain is a tough guy .
He ’ll do whatever he needs to do . ”
Until last week , it was an open question which of these visions of McCain bore a closer relation to reality .
But with the weeklong string of attacks uncorked by the Arizona senator and his people during Obama ’s trip abroad and in its aftermath — some brutal , some mocking , but all personal and focused on Obama ’s character — we now have an inkling of just how deep in the mud McCain and his people are willing to wallow in order to win in November : right up to their Republican eyeballs .
As countless fact - checkers and tsk - tskers have maintained , the broadsides were a blend of distortion , innuendo , and outright slander .
But that does n’t mean they ( and their inevitable successors ) wo n’t prove effective , especially against an opponent with so little experience under ruthless and relentless fire .
Before Obama hurled himself into the presidential scrum he ’d never been hit with a negative ad — a point often raised by Hillary Clinton ’s people .
And though they made sure Obama lost his negative - spot virginity , the ads they ran against him were patty - cake compared with what he faces now .
Hence the questions on which the general election may turn : Will Obama be capable of withstanding the pummeling the McCain forces have begun to unleash ?
Or , as Hillary privately predicted , will he crumple like a paper doll ?
For those not keeping score , a quick review of the McCain campaign ’s lunge for Obama ’s jugular .
First , its new slogan : “ Country first , ” with its inverse insinuation that Obama puts something else ( i.e. , his own ambition ) ahead of the nation .
Second , McCain ’s accusation that Obama “ would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign . ”
Third , the McCain ad “ Troops , ” which claims that Obama , while in Germany , “ made time to go the gym , but canceled a visit with wounded troops — seems the Pentagon would n’t allow him to bring cameras . ”
And , finally , the ad “ Celeb , ” with its intercut images of Obama in Berlin , Paris Hilton , and Britney Spears .
The strategy behind all this is n’t hard to discern : Drive up Obama ’s negatives and render him unacceptable to pivotal voting blocs .
Thus the depiction of him as too young , too feckless , and too pampered to be president .
( In almost every shot in the McCain ads , Obama is smiling flashily , whereas McCain is pictured as weathered , sober , staring hard into the distance — a clever bit of jujitsu , using Obama ’s pretty mug against him . )
Thus the portrayal of him as precious , self - infatuated , and effete : “ Only celebrities like Barack Obama go to the gym three times a day , demand ‘ MET - RX chocolate roasted - peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard - to - find organic brew — Black Forest Berry Honest Tea ’ and worry about the price of arugula , ” wrote campaign manager Rick Davis in an e-mail announcing “ Celeb . ”
And thus the emphasis on Obama ’s rock - star persona , designed to engender envy and contempt among the swath of Middle America for which hipness is no virtue but a sign of pretension .
The racial undertones of this assault are subtle but undeniable , as Obama himself suggested when he asserted last week that his opponents are trying to make voters “ scared ” of him because he “ does n’t look like the other presidents on the currency . ”
They ’re most glaring in “ Troops , ” which features footage of Obama sinking a three - pointer in Kuwait , despite the fact that the shot took place at a military base , which undermines the ad ’s argument .
But the spot ’s deeper aim is to foster an unconscious simile : Obama as a blinged - up , camera - hungry , NBA shooting guard , Allen Iverson with a Harvard Law degree .
Am I reaching ?
Consider this :
Would the ad have featured footage of Obama on a golf course draining a hole - in - one ?
“ No , it would n’t , ” laughs a GOP media savant .
“ The racial angle is the first thing I thought of when I saw that ad .
It fits into the celebrity stuff , too . ”
( For McCain , that impolitic , pro-Obama Ludacris track was manna from hip - hop heaven . )
Many of McCain ’s advisers from 2000 , such as John Weaver and Mike Murphy , express qualms about the campaign ’s newly nasty tone .
( One can only imagine the sigh of relief emanating from Mark McKinnon , the heralded adman who helped McCain win the nomination but whose aversion to taking a cleaver to Obama caused him to sit out the general . )
“ In this kind of year — a change election , with big issues at stake — that sort of campaign is not gonna be in a voice the American people can understand , ” Weaver tells me .
“ And at some point , John will need the goodwill that he spent years achieving . ”
And you think he ’s in danger of losing that ?
“ This is not a cost - free exercise , ” he says .
But Weaver , Murphy , and McKinnon are no longer guiding McCain .
Instead , the motor behind his operation now is Steve Schmidt , the shaven - headed strategist who earned his bones running Karl Rove ’s war room in 2004 , Frenchifying and de-war - heroizing John Kerry .
What Schmidt and his associates have apparently concluded is that McCain ’s weaknesses — on the election ’s most salient issues and as a candidate — are so pronounced and Obama ’s vulnerabilities so glaring that the low road is their guy ’s best , and maybe only , route to the White House .
They ’ve concluded , in other words , that even if McCain may not be able to win the election in any affirmative sense , he might still wind up behind the big desk if he and his people can strip the bark off Obama with sufficiently vicious force .
If this sounds like an admission of a certain kind of defeat , that ’s because it is .
But in the prevailing political circumstances — the hunger for change in the electorate , the abject bankruptcy of the Republican brand , McCain ’s positions on the wrong side of the public on the war and the economy , his age , and his pitiful performance skills — it may reflect a cold - eyed realism that ’s an asset in any campaign .
Moreover , at least in the short term , it actually seems to be working .
Measured against the generic Democratic ballot , Obama continues to underperform dramatically .
And since shifting to a more harshly negative posture , McCain has gained ground on Obama in Florida , Ohio , and Pennsylvania , according to recent Quinnipiac swing - state polls .
All of which , naturally , has more than a few Democrats in a state of mortal dread , although they tend not to be the types with GOT HOPE ?
bumper stickers on their Volvos .
Making them all the more queasy is what they regard as Obama ’s tepid and too - placid responses to the most scurrilous of McCain ’s j’accuses .
“ Obama says he ’s ‘ disappointed ’ in McCain when he charges him with near treason , patronizing him , as if he ’s got a twenty - point lead with a week to go , ” says one tough - minded organizer on the left .
“ It ’s shades of Swift Boat . ”
To be fair , by the end of last week Obama did n’t sound excessively serene .
He had toughened his rhetoric , and so had his campaign .
But even then , they were playing defense , fighting the battle on the turf defined by Team McCain .
Obama ’s calling out of the racial component of his opponent ’s attacks , though justified , opened the door to the McCain countercharge that it ’s he who is slapping down the race card — a claim that , however ludicrous , puts Obama in the position of denying , in effect , that he ’s a smoother , calmer , version of Jesse Jackson , Al Sharpton , and his former pastor , Wright .
What ’s more , there ’s reason to worry that the Democrat , as Jonathan Chait contended recently in the Los Angeles Times , is “ making the enormous mistake of letting the race be entirely about him , which is the only way he can lose . ”
The alternative , of course , is to get on offense , to batter McCain for his gaffes and incoherence , hammer him for his flip - flops , highlight how his maverick status is a thing of the past , and turn him into a combination of Bush and Grandpa Simpson .
God knows there are those in Chicago champing at the bit to do just that — not least , one imagines , Obama ’s chief strategist , David Axelrod , who can wield the cudgel of negative ads with as much vigor and glee as any Republican .
Yet Obama seems reluctant to go there .
Tough pol though he is , he ’s a conciliator and not a confrontationalist at heart ; he seems to believe that once undecided voters know him better , he will have them eating , along with so many others , out of the palm of his hand .
And who knows , even if Obama stays above the fray , he might still pull this thing off .
Because as unwilling as he is to get down and dirty , McCain may simply be unable to drive a consistent negative message .
“ John is uncomfortable doing this stuff , ” says Weaver .
“ And it is n’t in his skill - set .
It ’s like adopting the West Coast offense and making Dick Butkus your quarterback . ”
Butkus , it should be noted , was a linebacker — which actually makes the metaphor more apt .
Obama may hesitate to call the right plays , but he knows the difference between offense and defense , and is unlikely to wind up sprinting into his own end zone .

ALL OF THE DARING LOOKS FROM THE 2019 MTV EMA RED CARPET
HOUSTON  A grand jury on Monday refused to indict a 62 - year - old man who fatally shot two burglars last November as they fled his neighbor ’s house .
In a case that raised questions of ethnic bias , self - defense and property rights , the jury rejected charges against the man , Joe Horn , who is white .
Both victims were illegal immigrants from Colombia .
“ Joe is not some wild cowboy , ” Mr. Horn ’s lawyer , Charles T. Lambright , said at a news conference on Monday .
“ He was put in a place where he did n’t have any other choice . ”
But others reacted angrily to the decision .
“ There is not a snowflake ’s chance in hell that an African - American man could do what Joe Horn did and get away with it , ” said Quanell X , a local black activist .
“ The message that Harris County sent to the entire world is that Houston , Tex. , is God ’s city .
There is no longer a need for the criminal justice system , police , judge or jury .
You can be all of that on your own . ”
What a world !
I received an email from my sister - in - law the other day , saying we ought to boycott the Olympics because of China ’s outrageous attacks on Tibet…again .
I agree with her about the need to boycott the upcoming Olympics that are to be held in China , for no inhumane treatment of another human being should ever be tolerated anywhere by anyone .
We should always take a stand that says , “ No , you do not get to do this to me , to them , to anyone .
You do not get to harm people and benefit from it in any way . ”
I have cried a great deal in the past years over Tibet , Iraq , Abu Graib , abuse , unnecessary death .
And just in this past week , the tears welled over into this amazing epiphanic outrage over the things we do in our world , but particularly , over our American role in this inhumane treatment of others .
What struck me so profoundly , as it did others , was the Easter Week so - called “ Race Speech ” given by Senator Barack Obama .
I like Senator Obama .
I think he ’s a good man who 's caught in a hustler ’s world .
So I listened with great attention to every word he said , watching him on a screen that showed a tight shot of this good man ’s caramel - colored face , his heavily hooded eyes , his lean shoulders , flanked on the left by the American flag , his head tossing back and forth as he spoke .
I wanted to hear him , really HEAR his words , understand them .
And I did .
And I cried .
I cried for all of us and our greed and our loss and what really is our true potential .
But mostly I cried because this man who wants to be president of the United States spoke from the heart to and about ALL of us .
I cried because I wished I could say what he did , that I love our country , the way he says he does ; I cried because , these days , I can not say this .
The inhumanity to other humans of the world by the people in our country leads the way these days .
And I ca n’t seem to get back to that love of country , a place I once knew .
But there ’s more to it than that .
As Obama spoke about the truth of what our country has done and could do with regard to racial tensions , about the horrific acts of the past , the hard work and the divisiveness of the present , he also spoke of a sort of forgiveness that could lead the way into a better future .
Oh , not overtly ; that is n’t Obama ’s way , but forgiveness was there .
I saw it in his face and heard it in his words .
Toward the end of his speech , he related the story of a 9 - year - old girl whose mother had gotten cancer and had gone bankrupt over medical bills .
He told of this young girl who thought that they needed one thing above all else to sustain them , and that that was what they should spend the meager money they had on : food ... and particularly …a mustard - and - relish sandwich .
At the mention of this mustard - and - relish sandwich , I felt totally connected to the world of America that Obama spoke about .
I remembered it , and I totally broke down in tears .
My mind and heart fell back 50 years to my own childhood when , after having been locked in a bedroom for two days by my mother , after defecating out the window , too scared to leave the room for fear of the beating I 'd get , our next - door neighbor rescued me and my three siblings .
Betty removed the screen and pulled us one - by - one through that bedroom window , took us into her home , gave us baths , and fed us what was to be a first for any of us : a sandwich with real mayonnaise , lettuce , and meat ; we 'd always had nothing but peanut butter , ever .

Kyle Held came from St. Louis to help .
Kyle Held and Catherine Raymond must have driven Galveston ’s west end back and forth 100 times this past week .
They ’re from the Humane Society of Missouri in St. Louis ; just two of the dozens of animal rescue personnel who flocked to the island from Michigan , Colorado , New York , Louisiana and California .
They ’re holed up at the Galveston Police Station , which is now acting as a temporary rescue shelter .
Hundreds of dogs , cats , birds , snakes , rabbits – you name it – are brought back here for emergency treatment ( if necessary ) then are caged and loaded onto trailers bound for the Houston SPCA .
Held and Raymond arrived late Saturday night , and have been working nearly around the clock , responding to calls from owners who evacuated without their pets , concerned neighbors , passers by .
Raymond , an exam - room assistant , has been bunking in an RV .
Held has carved out a bedroom in his pickup , amid bags of pet food and other supplies .
Rescue workers have been getting hot meals from the Salvation Army , as well as a Baptist church by the airport , which is also providing hot showers .
Jim Boller , a rescue worker from Colorado , is the point man here .
He ’s coordinating a massive effort under bad conditions , and doing it quite well , from the looks of it .
Rows of cages line the halls inside the building ; each one has bowls of food and water .
But it ’s still upsetting to hear the dogs ’ nervous wailing as they ’re loaded into transport crates .
Some do n’t want to budge .
Volunteer vets from Texas are examining the animals upon arrival – current law prohibits vets without Texas licenses to treat animals here .
Up until a few days ago , when it looked like more residents might be allowed back , workers were mostly leaving food and water for the animals , with the idea they ’d soon be reunited with their owners .
That ’s not the case now .
However , even the severely hit west end was seeing its share of returning residents Saturday .
Held and Raymond responded to a series of calls today where the owners had already returned for the animals – including a family who apparently were able to rescue their two dogs , two cats , rabbit and bearded dragon .
Previous trips have n’t been so fortunate ;
Held and Raymond responded to a house the other day where the family ’s cats were well fed – because they ate the pet birds .
Rescue workers have collected more than 500 animals as of Friday night , Boller says .
The animals are photographed , and the pics are available at www.houstonspca.org, for owners to identify .
Boller says they ’ll be held in Houston for a minimum of ten days .
Fortunately , he says , none have been euthanized .
Unfortunately , they ’re seeing some that were neglected even prior to the storm .

Boats have been turned upside down and are strewn about yards , like they were a giant ’s playthings .
Driving down one subdivision , the pair passed a board with the red spray painted inscription : “ And the Lord taketh away . ”
Livestock have also been a concern .
Cattle have tended to wander onto the highway , so rescue workers have left bails of hay far back from the road , where they ’ll be safe .
Driving back from one call , Held and Raymond run into another pair of workers from the Missouri crew , who ’re hauling a trailer of hay and a gigantic water container .
They lead Held and Raymond to two horses who ’ve wandered off their land .
Fortunately , the horses have stumbled upon a shady patch of turf that happens to have a trough , so the crew fill it with water .
Further down the road are cattle in need of a drink .
These include a calf born on Thursday .

The global dominoes continue to fall : China 's Shanghai Composite Index plunged 5.2 % on Monday after an economic report showed that wholesale inflation had risen to a 12 - year high in July .
The report showed that inflation is accelerating , rising 12 % year - over - year , up from June 's tally of 8.8 % .
Monday 's 135 point loss brings Shanghai 's peak to trough loss to a staggering 59 % .
AP :
Chinese investors have become increasingly jittery over the economic outlook amid signs that the malaise afflicting the U.S. and Europe might be spreading to Asia , with corporate earnings bound to suffer .
Analysts said the start of the Beijing Olympics last week had quashed any lingering hopes for a games - related rally .
" Investors still think the market is weak , " said Qian Qimin , a strategist at Shenyin Wanguo Securities .
" They are disappointed , " he said .
Investors also worry that soaring inflation will force the government to abandon easy money fiscal and monetary policy which has done much to fuel the country 's remarkable economic expansion .
More bad news for Western multi-nationals looking to emerging markets to buoy slumping profits .

The Politico informs us that the Obama people have started punching back at Corsi ’s Obama Nation , in the form of a free 41 - page PDF file titled Unfit for Publication with this cover :
I ’ve only just begun to read this free ebook (! ) , but I can tell you that it offers a page - by - page attack on the ‘ facts ’ in Obama Nation .
It also declares that Corsi is a “ bigoted fringe author ” and one of their first reasons in the long list that he ’s nuts is that he ’s a 9/11 Truther .
( Also , the book ends with pulled quotes that prove Corsi to be a Catholic - hater and racist . )
One can only hope that this PDF gets distributed as quickly and efficiently as news of Obama Nation ’s publication has spread over the last few days .
I can tell you that the introduction to the ebook is one of the most satisfying fuck yous I ’ve ever read in politics .
I was going to put this after the break , but then I remembered all the people who accused me of advertising for Obama Nation yesterday , and so I ’m leaving it all above the fold .
Please read it .
UNFIT FOR PUBLICATION : Setting the Record Straight on the Lies in Jerome Corsis  The Obama Nation 
Once again , bigoted fringe author Jerome Corsi is trying to make money off of an election , spinning garbage as journalism and relying on the right - wing echo chamber to pump up sales .
Make no mistake :  The Obama Nation : is nothing but rehashed lies .
The allegations : rehashed lies Corsis falsehoods about Barack Obama have been discredited by numerous news organizations , which have questioned his scholarship ,  his conclusions , and his ideological bent .
This report will take you through the allegations point by point .
Despite Corsis high opinion of his own scholarly abilities he childishly touts the number of footnotes it contains , for example he gets many of even the most basic facts wrong , like the year the Obamas got married .
As you might expect from the books shoddy foundation , many of its claims are also completely false .
The Obamas never gave a million dollars to a Kenyan politician .
Obama has no secret plan to destroy the military .
Obama has regularly shared many of the facts about his family that Corsi claims he has covered up .
The author : a discredited , fringe bigot
Of course , the lies in  The Obama Nation  almost pale in comparison to the bizarre , conspiratorial views that Jerome Corsi has advocated in his broader work .
He believes that President Bush is trying to merge the United states with Mexico and Canada .
He believes that there is a literally unending supply of oil beneath the ground .
And in perhaps the gravest sign that his views cant be trusted , he alleges government cover -up of the 9/11 attacks and denies that airplanes were to blame for the towers collapse .
And it doesnt stop there .
Corsi has penned a litany of bigoted , hateful comments crossing the line so thoroughly that even the right - wing operatives behind Swift Boat Veterans for Truth disavowed him .
This is a man who smears the Catholic Church , calls the Pope senile ,  and regularly demeans public servants in vile sexual and racial terms .
In short , his record of attacks is disgusting and false , and so is this book .

If you are looking to bet on the game check out the Germany Argentina betting tips or keep an eye out for a good free bet to bet on the World Cup .
Germany are no doubt the favourite going into the World Cup Finals for a few reasons and some of them actually the wrong reasons .
The wrong reasons why Germany is the favourite is because they beat the host team , which was the favourite to win it all and they were ruthless with the final score of 7 - 1 making it the worst defeat by Brazil ever .
That images of Germany ripping apart Brazil have suddenly swayed the public opinion of Germany being a greater threat than Argentina .
One reason that people believe in Argentina is because they have Lionel Messi who is a 4 time world player of the year and everyone knows how good he is .
For that reason alone , Argentina were a favourite to win the tournament but when you take him out , Argentina still have a solid team but the power of Messi is hard to ignore .
He has too many fans and everyone believes he is the type of player that will win a game on his own .
Germany : Consistent and intimidating
In the last 4 World Cups , Germany have been in the finals twice which includes 2014 and were semin- finalists 2 other times while they won the 3rd place matches on top of it .
This team is the most consistent out of all football nations as they have scored the most goals , made the most semi-finals appearances as well to go with their 3 World Cup victories .
Germany have won a lot of games over the past 4 world cups and some of them have been by large scores over top quality teams that includes this year 4 - 0 over Portugal , 7 - 1 over Brazil and in previous tournaments 4 - 0 over Argentina and 4 - 1 over England in 2010 which features similar players to this year .
They do n't have the global superstars but I think it is safe to say that many coaches would pick this team over other teams that feature star players like Portugal , Argentina and Brazil which obviously feature Ronaldo , Messi and Neymar .
Just naming the Germany players speaks quality : Muller , Ozil , Khedira , Schurrle , Klose , Podolski , Gotze , Kroos , Mertesacker , Lahm , Boateng , Neuer .
This is an all - star lineup .
Argentina 's Disadvantage
Argentina are at a serious disadvantage in this tournament and in this finals game .
The Messi effect :
Yes we all know Lionel Messi can win a game but when a team has a star player like this that can severly influence a game , it becomes part of their game plan to suffocate that player .
The same can be said about players like Neymar and Ronaldo who had some numbers to go with their tournaments but not all games they were able to shine and were shut out effectively .
Messi is going to be the # 1 target in this game .
If he can't score then it could mean lights out for Argentina .
Where 's the coaching ?
Alejandro Sabella is the coach of Argentina but that has been a problem for the team over the last few world cups .
High quality teams and players but poor results .
At least getting to this finals says more than previous teams but the road to the finals has n't been a steady one .
Favourites to win their group , they did but it was n't very convincing .
Messi does have 4 goal sand 1 assist in the tournament but the team just has n't looked great and they do n't seem to have much of a strategy other than to not lose .
At least they do n't concede too many goals but they really need to consider themselves lucky to be this far .
If that was n't enough , the Netherlands team seriously knocked around their players with players getting hit in the head or enduring tough tackles or hits especially Mascherano .
At a discussion with a dozen Democratic governors in Chicago on Friday morning , each of the governors was identified with a small name plate but Senator Barack Obama sat behind a low rostrum to which was attached an official - looking seal no one had seen before .
It is emblazoned with a fierce - looking eagle clutching an olive branch in one claw and arrows in the other and is deliberately reminiscent of the official seal of the president of the United States .
Around the top border are the words “ Obama for America ; ” across the bottom is the campaign ’s Web address .
It also contains the logo of the Obama campaign , variously interpreted as a sunrise or a view down an open road .
Just above the eagle ’s head are the words “ Vero Possumus , ” roughly translated “ Yes we can . ”

What is stock shorting ?
Stock shorting is a method of profiting from a decline in a stock ’s price .
It is the opposite of investing long , where the investor profits from a rise in the stock ’s price .
“ Going long ” or hoping for a gain in the stock ’s price is the more familiar method of investing .
However , “ going short ” and profiting from a decline in a stock ’s price is an equally valid method of investing .
How does stock shorting work ?
Shorting a stock is a little more complicated than going long where a stock is simply bought and then sold later for either a gain or loss .
Shorting stock first involves borrowing it from an existing owner .
The short seller pays a fee to the owner to borrow his shares .
Upon borrowing it , the stock is immediately sold and the proceeds are kept in the short seller ’s brokerage account .
When the short seller wants to close out his position ( or the shares ’ owner wants them back ) , he buys equivalent stock in the marketplace and returns the shares he borrowed back to the owner .
If the stock has fallen in value , he makes a profit that is the difference between the price at which he borrowed the stock and the price at which he bought it back .
Conversely , if the stock has risen in value , he suffers a loss since he has to buy back the stock at a higher price than he borrowed it for .
Short sellers fulfill a crucial and productive role in financial markets :
Short sellers bring to light valuable information about poorly run companies .
Short sellers have a strong incentive to uncover poorly run companies .
If a short seller successfully discovers ahead of others that a company is destroying value through incompetence , bad luck or even criminal activity , he profits by shorting the stock and publicizing the information .
Short sellers are similar to good investigative journalists .
They make more money if they can “ scoop ” others with information that will drive the stock down .
It is this aspect of short selling that many company managers , regulators and others find discomforting .
Yet these same managers and regulators have no problem when an investor uncovers a successful company .
Why should they be opposed to someone who does the opposite , and uncovers the overvalued , incompetent , lazy or even fraudulently managed companies ?
Short sellers help capital go to the best companies .
By taking financial capital away from poorly run companies , short sellers free up money that can go to the best - run companies .
Short sellers are the other half of the value - creating process of financial markets whereby capital is continually re-directed to those who can put it to the most valuable use .
The existence of short sellers means that capital will more quickly flee the poorly run companies and thereby become available that much faster for the better - run companies .
The profit that a short seller makes is his reward for aggressively uncovering the poorly run companies .
Short selling is challenging .
Short selling is not for everyone for the simple reason that stocks generally tend to go up .
During the 20th century , stocks gained 9 % a year on average , although there was significant yearly variation .
Stocks do not decline in value across the board for long periods of time .
Because of this , short sellers must time their moves well , and attempt to short at the top of a stock ’s move and then close out the position when it has hit bottom .
If the short seller mis-times his moves , he will lose money .
Such precision in timing is less important for long investors because stocks generally go up .
It is a misconception that short sellers can unfairly cause stock prices to go down .
This is the most common misconception about short sellers .
However , short selling is only likely to be successful if companies truly have problems .
If a seller shorts a strong or improving company , he will lose money .
It is a misconception to think that short sellers ( or long investors ) can cause stock prices to deviate for meaningful time periods from their true values .
The only power a short or long investor has comes from being right .
When he is right , he is rewarded for helping to bring true information to the marketplace .
When he is wrong , his wealth is dissipated and his ability to invest further is diminished .
If he is wrong often enough , all of his wealth will be dissipated and his ability to influence stocks will be nullified .
Conclusion : Short selling is moral and should be permitted .
Short selling creates value by making the capital markets work more efficiently .
Short sellers help bring negative information about companies to the market .
By doing so , short sellers provide liquidity to the market and help capital to flow away from the worst companies and toward the best companies .
Without short sellers , markets would be less liquid and more violatile .
Long investors would have more difficulty selling their positions , and the lack of liquidity would make it more difficult for companies to raise funds in public offerings .
To restrict short selling not only harms the efficiency of the markets , but it violates the right of stock owners to freely dispose of their shares as they see fit .
Because their shares belong to them , it is their property , they have the right to do what they want with them , including loan out their shares to short sellers .
Conversely , short sellers have the right to borrow those shares .
A proper understanding of short selling demonstrates the valuable and productive role it plays in the financial markets .

A Hindu man is to ask the high court to overturn a ban on open - air cremations to allow the ancient religious ritual to take place in Britain .
Davender Kumar Ghai , 69 , is challenging Newcastle city council 's decision to deny him an open - air cremation when he dies .
In 2006 the local authority blocked his attempt to establish Britain 's first approved site for burning bodies in the open , ruling it would breach cremation laws .
Human rights lawyers will argue that open - air pyres fall outside the 1902 Cremation Act , which regulates what happens inside a crematorium , defined as " any building fitted with appliances for the purpose of burning human remains " .
The burning of a human body in the open air , they will say , is an offence only if it causes a public nuisance , which would be avoided because the sites would be in secluded locations .
The hearing in November is expected to last three days .
Indic religions allow open - air cremations , although these are not compulsory nor universal .
Hinduism regards the body as an external garment that the individual inhabits .
When this garment becomes worn out the individual moves on , taking a new birth and a new body .
According to the 2001 census there were 558,342 Hindus in the UK although the figure is thought to be closer to 1 million , based on immigration levels .
Andrew Singh Dogan , the legal coordinator of the multi- faith Anglo - Asian Friendship Society , said a positive outcome would primarily benefit Hindus , although people from all backgrounds could opt for an open - air cremation .
" An open - air pyre is £ 500 and a cheaper alternative to a traditional cremation , which costs at least £ 2,000 and has you in and out in half an hour .
An open - air pyre allows you to make it an all - day event , where you can eat , drink and cry and make it a family occasion .
" This ritual has been practised , virtually unchanged , in India for thousands of years .
We 've had many letters of support from individuals and organisations .
Mr Ghai is a devout Hindu who wishes to be cremated according to Hindu scripture . "
Ghai , who is the head of the friendship society , was responsible for the first human funeral pyre in Britain since 1934 , when the Home Office authorised the outdoor cremation of Sumshere Jung , a Nepalese princess and the wife of the Nepalese ambassador .
Ghai also arranged for the body of Rajpal Mehat , a 31 - year - old Indian illegal immigrant found drowned in a London canal , to be burnt on a wooden pyre at a secret location in Northumberland in 2006 .
Newcastle council deemed the ceremony illegal and a police file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service .
It ruled that an offence had been committed , but said prosecution would not be in the public interest .
Jay Lakhani , of the Hindu Academy , described open - air cremation as an " antiquated practice " .
" Modern India is growing up and in tiny villages where they do n't have facilities they have these pyres .
In Britain we are very lucky to have hygienic crematoriums .
The ceremonial aspects should evolve to reflect the changes in society . "
A spokesman from the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs refused to comment on the environmental impact of open - air cremations , saying the matter was subject to a judicial review .
Less than a month ago , the atheist student group at Lorain County Community College in Ohio made headlines when promotional posters for the group depicted a possibly gay Jesus :
Aaron Weaver , the president of the group , has now taken it one step further .
He ’s now using his First Amendments rights to draw focus on Islam :
On Thursday , which happened to be Sept. 11 , Weaver announced a contest for artistic depictions of Muhammad , and he put up a $ 100 prize for the best .
The winning picture will be posted online and around campus .
“ Activism like this needs to be done to challenge the environment we live in , ” Weaver said .
“ It ’s a pressing issue . ”
He said the contest was inspired by the editorial cartoons of Muhammad printed in a Danish newspaper in 2005 , which led to violent protests and the deaths of 139 people .
The cartoonists have since faced prosecution .
“ I think it ’s important to remind people of our rights and the reason that we have them , ” Weaver said .
“ I ’m sure there ’s going to be some outrage , but ( this contest ) will provide the perfect opportunity for discussion . ”
Here ’s what worries me :
There ’s no criteria I can find for how the “ best ” poster will be judged .
Is it the one displaying the most artistic skill ?
The most offensive ?
The one drawing the most negative reactions ?
And since we do n’t really know what Muhammad looked like , what are these drawings going to be based off of ?
Caricatures ?
Stereotypes ?
That said , we should n’t fear depicting or even mocking other faiths .
There ’s no reason religion should get a free pass from satire or criticism .
To their credit , the school is not putting a stop to this contest —
Other groups can run poster contests , so there ’s no reason the atheists cannot either .
But if this is done with the sole intention to piss off religious people , I ’m worried about the types of atheists the group will attract .
I mean , would you want to be a member of this group ?
With the multicore explosion in the making , are we going to be running hundreds of thousands of threads in a single program ?
Erlang programmers would emphatically say , yes !
C++ and Java programmers would probably say no .
Why this discrepancy ?
Thread model based on heavy - duty OS threads and mutexes has its limitations .
You can ask server writers , or Google for “ thread per connection ” to convince yourself .
Servers use thread pools exactly because of that .
Thread pools are an admission of defeat for the thread model .
Having to pool threads tells you that :
Thread creation is not fast enough
Threads ’ consumption of resources is substantial , so it makes sense to keep their numbers down
Granted , these are technical problems that might be overcome in future by improvements in operating systems .
The more fundamental problem with threads has its root in memory sharing .
It seems like sharing offers great advantage in terms of performance , but sharing requires locking .
It ’s a well known fact that locking does n’t scale ( or compose ) .
Between races and deadlocks , it ’s also extremely hard to get right .
Here ’s what Erlang does
Erlang gives up on sharing !
Threads that do n’t share memory are called processes .
We tend to think of processes as heavyweight beasts implemented by operating systems .
That ’s because one needs the operating system to strictly enforce the no-sharing policy ( the isolation of address spaces ) .
Only the OS can manage separate address spaces and the passing of data between them .
But that ’s not the only way .
The isolation might instead be enforced by the language .
Erlang is a functional language with strict copy semantics and with no pointers or references .
Erlang processes communicate by message passing .
Of course , behind the scenes , messages are passed through shared memory , thus avoiding a large performance hit of inter-process communication .
But that ’s invisible to the client .
Erlang rolls out its own threads !
Erlang interpreter provides lightweight processes ( so lightweight that there ’s a benchmark running 20 million Erlang processes ) .
And there is a bonus : Erlang code that uses lightweight processes will also work with heavyweight processes and in a distributed environment .
Why do n’t we all switch to Erlang ?
As far as I know there are two main reasons :
It ’s a weird language .
Do n’t get me wrong , I love functional programming for its mathematical beauty , terseness , and elegance .
But I had to rewire my brain to be able to write pure functional programs .
Functional paradigm is as alien to our everyday experience as quantum mechanics .
( CS grad students : you ’re not typical programmers . )
Messages have to be copied .
You ca n’t deep - copy a large data structure without some performance degradation , and not all copying can be optimized away ( it requires behind - the - scenes alias analysis ) .
This is why mainstream languages ( and I will even include Scala in this category ) do n’t abandon sharing .
Instead they rely on programmer ’s discipline or try to control aliasing .
Conclusions
Native threads are expensive .
Interpreted languages , like Erlang , can afford to implement their own lightweight threads and schedulers .
I do n’t see that happening in compiled languages .
The hope is that operating systems will improve their implementations of threads –I hear Linux ’s NPTL already is a big improvement in this area .
In the meanwhile , we have to rely on thread pools .
Shared memory concurrency model is the reason why multithreaded programming is so difficult and error - prone .
Separating address spaces simplifies programming , but at a performance cost .
I believe that some kind of compromise is possible .
A message - passing or an actor model can work with sharing , as long as aliasing is under control .
Inspiration for this post
After my last post on thin lock implementation , I was asked the question , why I used such a small number , 1024 , for the maximum number of threads .
It was actually a number I ’ve found in the D compiler runtime .
A thin lock could easily work with a much larger number of threads .
In fact I ’m going to substantially increase the number of bits for thread ID at the expense of recursion count .
But this question got me thinking about scalability of threading in general .
Fibers
Fibers ( as well as Java ’s green threads ) are not an alternative to heavyweight threads .
Fibers ca n’t run in parallel , so they have no way to use multiple processors .
They are more of a flow - of - control construct , often used interchangeably with coroutines .
Interesting reading
The remarks by Zalmay Khalilzad , America ’s UN ambassador , denouncing Russian aggression against that paragon of democratic virtue , the Republic of Georgia , are almost too funny to quote .
U.S. government hypocrisy obviously is not new , but Washington ’s inconsistency on this occasion is more spectacular than usual .
Proving yet again that history has not ended , last week Georgia launched a blitzkrieg against the autonomous territory of South Ossetia in an attempt to coerce its inhabitants back under Tbilisi ’s control .
In a response foreseen by everyone except , apparently , Georgia ’s narcissistic president , Mikheil Saakashvili , Russia responded with overwhelming military force , pushing back the Georgian troops  who had killed and destroyed freely when attacking South Ossetia  and seizing parts of Georgia .
Tbilisi essentially sued for peace , and a cease - fire has been agreed to .
This is a fight in which the U.S. has no stake .
Georgia was part of the Soviet Union for 70 years .
Not once did Washington worry about the strategic implications of Soviet control of the Caucasus .
It need not worry about Russian influence in the Caucasus today .
Admittedly , the Bush administration had dreams of dominating Russia along its borders through NATO , just as the administration hopes to continue dominating China along its borders , through alliances with Japan and South Korea , an informal compact with Taiwan , and U.S. naval superiority .
But Washington ’s imperial pretensions are not the same as America ’s genuine , let alone vital , security interests .
If the U.S. could survive , even prosper , while the Soviet Union controlled the same piece of real estate , the U.S. can survive , even prosper , while Russia influences Georgia .
The fact that President George W. Bush , would - be president John McCain , and their neocon camp followers want Washington to run the world does n’t justify forcing the American people to take the risk and waste the money attempting to do so .
Nevertheless , the U.S. government found itself , rather like Captain Renault in Casablanca , to be shocked , shocked at the notion that a major power might take military action against a small neighbor in violation of international law to advance its perceived national interests .
At a fractious United Nations session last weekend , Ambassador Khalilzad represented a shocked America desperately attempting to save the world from militarism , aggression , and war .
He complained of Russian " aggression , " especially the fact that " there has been an intensification of Russian military activity in the South Ossetian region " and that " Military operations against Georgian forces in the conflict zone have escalated dramatically . "
Further , " Russia has been attacking villages and cities elsewhere in Georgia , including threatening the Zug Didi region and air attacks against Tbilisi ’s airport .
Russian military attacks have also destroyed critical Georgian infrastructure , including seaports , airports , and other facilities . "
Khalilzad pointed to the conflict ’s dire consequences : " [ T ] he result of this escalation against a sovereign state that has not posed direct threat to Russia , has increased casualties and humanitarian suffering for the people of Georgia , including in South Ossetia and Abkhazia . "
But Moscow was " intransigent " and refused " to stop the violence " even though Georgia " offered a cease - fire and restoration of the status quo . "
Moreover , " Russia continues to resist efforts by the international community to mediate this conflict . "
Finally , there was the issue of national sovereignty .
Explained Khalilzad , " [ W ]e must condemn the Russian military assault in [ sic ] the sovereign state of Georgia , the violation of the countries [ sic ] sovereignty and territorial integrity including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the Georgian population .
Similarly , we need to condemn the destruction of Georgian infrastructure and violations of the country ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
Ambassador Khalilzad asked , " Was Russia ’s objective regime change in Georgia , the overthrow of the democratically elected government of that country ? "
After all , he contended , the bad old days of tossing out governments of other nations were over .
Khalilzad ’s remarks have been echoed by others .
For instance , the White House expressed its support for Georgia ’s " territorial integrity . "
Vice President Richard Cheney denounced " this threat to Georgia ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
President George W. Bush said that Moscow ’s tactics were " unacceptable in the 21st century . "
Administration officials pointed to the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan as Soviet precedents for Russia ’s actions .
Bill Clinton ’s old political consultant Dick Morris claimed that Russia ’s attack on Georgia was akin to Adolf Hitler ’s campaign to acquire the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia .
James Robbins of the American Foreign Policy Council also pointed to Nazi Germany ’s use of ethnic Germans as a justification for its aggression .
Khalilzad ’s remarks , so full of moral outrage and personal umbrage , are almost a perfect parody of statesmanship , representing what a hypocritical , self - important , morally blind , arrogant , even hubristic , government would say when another power follows its example .
My God !
Can you imagine !
Aggression !
Attacks on civilians !
Humanitarian suffering !
Violations of national sovereignty !
Regime change !
No one does that anymore .
Except the U.S. , of course .
Let ’s see .
How far back should we go ?
There was the CIA - supported coup against Iran ’s ( elected ) government in 1953 that brought the shah to power .
In 1963 Washington greenlighted the coup against South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem , which resulted in his execution .
Of course , in those days , there were lots of back - room plots  some of which worked , some of which did n’t  against lots of nations .
But one effort continues to this day :
For nearly a half century Washington has been attempting to overthrow Fidel Castro .
In the 1980s the Reagan administration funded and armed a guerrilla force in an attempt to oust the Nicaraguan government .
In 1983 the U.S. invaded Grenada to remove a government viewed as inimical to American interests .
Six years later the U.S. invaded Panama to arrest its head of state .
In Somalia in 1993 Washington decided to arrest local warlords  the de facto government  whom it disliked .
In 1994 the U.S. not only ousted the existing Haitian government , but put a new regime in its place .
A decade later the U.S. intervened to oust the same ( elected ) leader .
In 1999 the U.S. and NATO launched a war against Serbia to give autonomy , and ultimately independence , to the territory of Kosovo , supporting a violent secessionist movement which then ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Serbs .
The U.S. backed an unsuccessful coup in 2002 against Venezuela ’s ( elected ) President Hugo Chavez .
That same year President George W. Bush simultaneously targeted Iraq , Iran , and North Korea for regime change , terming them members of the " Axis of Evil . "
A year later he invaded Iraq and ousted Saddam Hussein .
Even now , the administration is attempting to browbeat the ( elected ) government in Baghdad to accept scores of bases and a long - term troop presence for use against other countries in the region .
Moreover , Washington has spent freely  directly , through " foreign aid , " as well as indirectly , through subsidies to nominally independent institutes and other NGOs  to replace existing regimes with pro-American governments in Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004 .
My goodness , who would have imagined a big power using its military to violate the sovereignty of other nations and cause civilian casualties , just to advance its own interests ?
How could a government consider attempting to oust a smaller country ’s ruling regime ?
It ’s just not done anymore .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov asserted that " it is not a part of our political culture or foreign policy to topple anyone or put someone on a throne . "
But it is part of America ’s political culture and foreign policy to do so .
The Russians just do n’t understand the rules .
Washington ’s hypocrisy is particularly glaring when one considers the 1999 NATO attack on Serbia .
It was , indisputably , a war of aggression against a nation that had done nothing against America or the Europeans .
There had been no threats , let alone hostile acts .
Rather , Serbia was engaged in the traditional , though brutal , business of suppressing an armed insurgency .
Ask Great Britain about the Irish .
Ask the Spanish about the Basques .
Ask Turkey about the Kurds .
Ask the Americans about the Confederacy .
However , outraged by the spectacle of some 2,000 deaths over the preceding year or two , the Western alliance acted  without the sanction of international law , let alone the approval of the United Nations  to violate Serbia ’s " sovereignty and territorial integrity , " in Khalilzad ’s words .
Not only did the U.S. ( which was responsible for most of the military action ) bomb Serbian military forces in Kosovo , but it also attacked civilian targets and destroyed civilian infrastructure in Serbia , well outside of the nominal combat zone .
The assaults cost the lives of thousands ( even NATO admits 1,500 ) of noncombatants in Kosovo and Serbia , while the Serbian authorities retaliated by driving out hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians , causing enormous " humanitarian suffering , " as Khalilzad put it .
The allies rejected any idea of a compromise , since they viewed the status quo as unacceptable .
They were not interested in outside ( meaning Russian ) mediation to end the conflict until they feared that Belgrade ’s refusal to surrender might force them to initiate a ground war .
Only then was some compromise acceptable .
Earlier this year the U.S. and the Europeans acted to formally amputate Kosovo from Serbia , seizing roughly 15 percent of that nation ’s territory , with nary a thought about the consequences for the tens of thousands of ethnic Serbs still living in Kosovo .
The Russians responded to allied support for Kosovo ’s independence by observing that the precedent had wide applications , including in the Caucasus .
Russia ’s UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin countered Khalilzad , observing , " This statement , ambassador , is completely unacceptable , particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of , including with regard to the civilian populations in Iraq and Afghanistan and Serbia . "
Washington set the example , several times over .
So the Bush administration and its neocon Greek chorus now is filled with moral outrage because Russia intervened in a hostile bordering state that is carrying out a violent campaign against secessionists who have strong ties with Russia .
Can anyone take Washington ’s supposed concerns seriously ?
Obviously , one can argue about the legitimacy of the Abkhazian and South Ossetian campaigns for self - determination , but they go back decades , if not centuries , and are far more than Russian creations .
There ’s no doubt that Moscow has cheerfully used these controversies as an opportunity to apply brutal , deadly force to humble an obnoxious opponent , but Georgia is no international innocent .
The country is an authoritarian democracy , with demagogic President Saakashvili playing the nationalist card to win political support and abusing his power to crack down on opposition media and politicians .
He sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq to win American support , not to selflessly battle the global menace of " Islamofascist " terrorism .
Moreover , his attack on South Ossetia ended up , whether planned that way or not , as an attack on civilians .
Although one should be wary of Russian claims of 1,400 South Ossetian civilians killed in the initial Georgian assault on the city of Tskhinvali , South Ossetia ’s capital  after all , the U.S. government shamelessly circulated fake atrocity stories during both the first Gulf War and the attack on Serbia  using artillery and rocket launchers against urban areas was no surgical strike .
Tens of thousands of South Ossetians have become refugees as well .
The gratitude of South Ossetians toward Moscow appears genuine  and , frankly , well - founded .
The war is still bad for the same reason that all wars are bad : they visit death and destruction upon the innocent and guilty alike , and usually set in motion unpredictable forces that often generate even more death and destruction , sometimes years down the line .
But the war may have a salutary effect if it convinces the West that it can no longer bulldoze Russia , ignoring Moscow ’s legitimate security and other interests .
Expanding NATO up to Russia ’s borders , working to accomplish regime change in former constituent parts of the Soviet Union , and treating Moscow as of no account when changing borders in the Balkans might not be the conscious policy of encirclement as seen from Russia , but it ’s easy to understand why Moscow views America ’s policies with suspicion .
In any case , these were not wise tactics to use to win Russia ’s assistance in , say , confronting Iran .
The days of America as the unipower , global colossus , and master of the universe are over .
It turns out there are consequences to actions , and the U.S.  as well as Georgia  is paying the price for having forgotten that reality .
Is the war in the Caucasus tragic ?
Certainly .
Should the U.S. encourage peaceful resolutions of the Russia - Georgia - South Ossetia conflicts ?
Surely .
Should Washington promote the fantasy that Georgia is a democratic exemplar upholding its natural right to rule South Ossetia while holding off a dangerous revanchist Russia ?
No .
And should U.S. government officials pretend that Moscow is the only aggressive , threatening , self - interested actor on the international stage ?
Not on your life .
It ’s time for Washington ’s interventionist elite to take a good , hard look in the mirror .
The slowdown in the real estate market is finally hitting New York office space :
After years of surging upward , commercial rental rates in Manhattan decreased in the second quarter , a new report shows .
Asking rent declined 2.2 % , to $ 69.29 a square foot , while Class A rents plummeted 4.4 % , to $ 90.65 , according to Studley 's second - quarter market report , released yesterday .
Meanwhile , the availability rate jumped half of a percentage point , to 8.2 %  nearly a full percentage point higher than a year ago .
At the same time , the supply of sublet space is increasing , up 34 % versus the prior quarter , to 8.3 million square feet .
This is the first time since 2005 that rents have declined and the availability rate has been so high .
" What 's happening this quarter is pretty significant , " a senior vice president at Studley , Steven Coutts , said .
" We 've really seen rental rate growth begin and continue on a steady course since the third quarter of 2003 .
This is the first we 've seen that rents have come down since then . "
In the third quarter of 2005 there was a minor dip in rents , but it was temporary , he said .
" We anticipate that availability will continue to increase , " he said .
" The question is , how quickly will it go up ? "
Industry insiders for months have predicted a decline in rents in light of increasing availability , a slowing rate of transactions , and a greater willingness on the part of landlords to offer concessions to tenants .
" We 've been expecting this , " an attorney at Loeb & Loeb , Raymond Sanseverino , said .
" The concession packages have been getting better . "
Cushman & Wakefield and other market reports have predicted that rents would decline , but Studley is the first to record an actual decrease .
While there is a delay between market statistics and broader economic trends , as it takes time for job losses to translate to changes in office space , Studley is the first brokerage firm to see a drop in rents , as it looks at availability rates rather than just vacancy rates .
Availability rates , which include all properties that are available for lease regardless of whether the current tenant has vacated the space , are a leading indicator of market conditions because it measures which properties are available for rental .
Other firms largely focus on spaces that are vacant , Mr. Coutts said .
" Availability shows up on our radar before vacancies , " he said .
" This is a forward - looking view of the market . "
The drop in rents was fueled largely by the increase in sublet supply since last quarter , Mr. Coutts said .
Sublet space nearly always rents for less money than space rented directly from the landlord , he said .
" Sublease space is really fueling the decrease in rents , " he said .
" We 're starting to see these large blocks of space come on the market as a result of firms downsizing . "
The president of GVA Williams , Mark Jaccom , cited 11 Times Square and 100 Park Ave. as prominent properties that are accepting rents on lower floors below their original target of $ 100 a square foot .
" I think everybody 's coming down 5 % to 10 % , " Mr. Jaccom said .
" It 's a recession , and people are tightening their belts . "
The steepest decline in rents occurred in the Plaza District , where Class A rents declined 5.5 % , to $ 122.22 a square foot .
Midtown
West also showed a 5.5 % decline in Class A rents , to $ 96.04 .
Mr. Coutts attributed the decreases to large properties coming on the market in those areas .
Leasing velocity totaled 6.5 million square feet , down 15.5 % from last quarter and 12.7 % below the historical average of 7.8 million square feet leased each quarter .
By JOHN CURRAN , Associated Press Writer
BURLINGTON , Vt. – Lots of political candidates make campaign promises .
But not like Charlotte Dennett’s .
Dennett , 61 , the Progressive Party ’s candidate for Vermont Attorney General , said Thursday she will prosecute President Bush for murder if she ’s elected Nov. 4 .
Dennett , an attorney and investigative journalist , says Bush must be held accountable for the deaths of thousands of people in Iraq — U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians .
She believes the Vermont attorney general would have jurisdiction to do so .
She also said she would appoint a special prosecutor and already knows who that should be : former Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi , the author of “ The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , ” a new book .
“ Someone has to step forward , ” said Dennett , flanked by Bugliosi at a news conference announcing her plan .
“ Someone has to say we can not put up with this lack of accountability any more . ”
Dennett and two others are challenging incumbent Attorney General William Sorrell , a Democrat , in the Nov. 4 election .
Bugliosi , 74 , who gained fame as the prosecutor of killer Charles Manson , said any state attorney general would have jurisdiction since Bush committed “ overt acts ” including the military ’s recruitment of soldiers in Vermont and allegedly lying about the threat posed by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in speeches that were aired in Vermont and elsewhere .
“ No man , even the president of the United States , is above the law , ” said Bugliosi .
The White House press office did n’t respond to a request for comment Thursday .
But Republican National Committee spokesman Blair Latoff denounced Dennett .
“ It ’s extremely disappointing that a candidate for state attorney general is more concerned with radical left - wing provocation than upholding the law of Vermont , ” Latoff said .
“ These incendiary suggestions may score points among the most fringe elements of American society , but ca n’t be settling for anyone looking for an attorney general . ”
Anti-Bush sentiment runs deep in Vermont .
It ’s the only state Bush has n’t visited as president , and one whose liberal tendencies make it unlikely he will .
In 2007 , the state Senate adopted a resolution calling for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Last March , the towns of Brattleboro and Marlboro voted to seek indictments against Bush and Cheney over the war , and dozens of other towns voted at town meetings to call for his impeachment .
Sorrell , who is seeking a sixth term , said he does n’t believe a Vermont attorney general would have the authority to charge Bush .
“ The reality is , in my view , that unless the crime takes place in Vermont , then I as the attorney general have no authority under Vermont law to be prosecuting the president , ” Sorrell said .

9:50 PT - DM : Good morning and welcome to Macworld 's live coverage of the WWDC '08 Keynote event .
I 'm your host Associate Editor Dan Moren , alongside Editorial Director Jason Snell .
We 'll be here for the next two hours , typing furiously in the hopes of catching everything Steve Jobs says and does .
Right now , the music 's playing and people are still getting seated .
9:51 PT - JS : Playing Bo Diddley in honor of the late , great musician .
Nice touch .
I 'm sitting here next to Dan Moren , Dan Frakes , frequent Macworld contributor Glenn Fleishman , and Daring Fireball 's own John Gruber .
9:55 PT - DM : Ooh , they 're playing " Roll over , Beethoven . "
Nice .
I too need a shot of rhythm and blues .
9:59 PT - JS : Macworld 's own Heather Kelly is here with us to take some photos of the event as it happens , so stay tuned for that as soon as things kick off .
10:01 PT - DM : Clearly , something important has just happened .
Lots of people have stood up .
I think Steve Jobs is making a running entrance , Stephen Colbert - style or something .
Unfortunately , everybody 's standing up , so we have no idea what 's going on .
10:02 PT - DM :
They 've now asked us to turn off our electronic devices .
I love that they specifically mention that you turn off your iPhones .
Because everybody here has iPhones .
If you 've got a Blackberry , go ahead and leave it on : because it 's * rubbish * .
10:05 PT - JS :
The cheers were definitely for Al Gore , a member of Apple 's board .
I believe he might have held elective office at some point as well .
I do n't know if he brought his Oscar , though .
Probably not .
Those things are heavy .
10:05 PT - DM :
They 're dimming the lights , so we 're probably about to get started .
I hope none of these people stand up or it's going to be very , very irritating .
And we 've left off with " Great Balls of Fire .
10:06 PT - DM : Steve Jobs is taking the stage , to rampant applause from the audience .
He 's wearing a pair of denim overalls ... okay , kidding .
Black turtleneck and jeans all the way .
" We 've been working really hard on some great stuff that we can't wait to share with you . "
There are a record 5200 attendees here .
" Wish we could have had more , but we sold out . "
They can't find a bigger venue than this .
147 sessions ; 85 on the Mac and 62 on the iPhone , so it 's " gonna be packed . " 169 hands - on labs , over 1000 engineers on site , and sessions on iFund and Intel .
" One of the best WWDCs ever . "
10:07 PT - DM : Let 's get started .
There 's three parts to Apple now : the first part is the Mac , the second part is the music business - the iPod and iTunes , and the third part is the iPhone ( no mention of the Apple TV ! ) .
Now I 'm gonna take this morning to talk about the iPhone first , so Scott Forstall and Phil Schiller will be coming out to talk about the iPhone .
Then after lunch , developers are going to get a peek at OS X Snow Leopard ( that 's right , it 's official ) .
10:08 PT - DM : Let 's talk about the iPhone .
We 're going to talk about iPhone 2.0 first .
It 's " a giant step forward " from where we 've been , and it 's got the SDK in it .
In the 95 days since the SDK was announced , over 250,000 have downloaded it .
Over 25,000 people have applied to the paid developer program .
Admitted 4,000 people to the program so far .
10:09 PT - DM : iPhone 2.0 software has three parts to it : enterprise support , the SDK , and some new end - user features .
" Let me start with the enterprise .
Customers have demanded Microsoft Exchange , so they 've built it in out of the box for 2.0 software : push email , push contacts , push calendar , auto - discovery of Exchange severes , global address lookup , and remote wipe security feature .
All built in to iPhone 2.0 software .
They 've added secure VPN services from Cisco and other network service demanded by the Enterprise market .
Everything that Apple was told enterprise users want , they 've built in .
10:11 PT - JS :
This is basically a recap of Apple 's previous SDK event a few months back .
Good stuff , though .
10:11 PT - DM : The Enterprise markets have participated in beta program : 35 percent of the Fortune 500 has participated in beta program .
Top five commerical banks , top five securites , 6 of 7 top airlines , 8 of 10 top pharmaceutical companies , and 8 of 10 top entertainment companies have participated .
Phenomenal participation of higher education as well .
Going to show a video of Enterprise customers .
10:12 PT - DM :
We 're getting an assortment of executives from corporations and the military .
Disney 's been testing the beta release for the past few months , apparently ( big surprise ) .
We 're seeing a few of the new features , like contact searching , Exchange support , push calendaring , etc .
Security is also a big part of the 2.0 release and enterprise features .
10:14 PT - JS : Great line from the military official , who points out that they 're one of the few groups in the world that is very mobile , deploys globally , and has people shooting at them .
10:15 PT - JS : Nice iPhone 2.0 tidbit from Dan Frakes as seen in the video : as you 're entering your password , you can see the last character that you typed , making it a lot easier to make sure you 're typing your password correctly .
10:15 PT - DM : The video gets a round of applause .
Maybe it 'll be up for an Oscar ( fingers crossed ) .
Jobs returns to stage : " That gives you an idea of what we 're doing in Enterprise . "
Scott Forstall is going to come out next to talk about the SDK .
10:16 PT - DM : Forstall : " We 're opening up same APIs and tools that we use internally to build all of the shipping apps . "
Here 's a rundown of the APIs and frameworks on the iPhone .
The iPhone shares layers with OS X on the desktop ; the same kernel is used on both .
10:18 PT - DM : Scott 's continuing to walk through the features of the SDK : a lot of this is review of things we 've already learned about the SDK in the iPhone event earlier this year .
10:19 PT - DM :
We 're going to get a quick demo of these tools .
Scott 's going to focus on constructing a user interface in Interface Builder .
He 's creating a Basic Cocoa Touch application in Xcode .
" Nearby Friends " will use built - in Address Books APIs to access contact DB on phone and the Core Location API to add a location - based service .
Filter to show just contacts within 10 miles of current location .
( Building a user interface on stage : talk about catering to your audience . )
10:21 PT - JS :
It 's important to keep in mind that while this is a media event , it 's first and foremost a developer event , so Apple is taking great pains to give some meaty developer information to the thousands of Mac and iPhone developers in the crowd .
10:21 PT - DM : Interface Builder is a pretty impressive application : all the UI can be done with pretty much drag and drop .
It 's incredibly smart and knowing how the UI should look on the iPhone .
It automatically aligns elements as necessary , and changes controls based on where they 're located and the iPhones orientation .
10:23 PT - DM :
There we go : now we 're done and with one click in Xcode it runs the full application .
" That 's how easy it is to write an application and test it in the simulator right here on your Mac . "
We 'll go one step further now : testing on the iPhone .
You only need to change one pop-up to do that : switch to build for the iPhone .
Scott 's demoing the app on the iPhone now and showing it live .
Pretty impressive how easy they seem to have made it .
Indeed , using the Core Location , it 's located only those contacts within 10 miles ( hey , Steve Jobs apparently is n't within ten miles ! ) .
10:25 PT - JS : John Gruber says that he hopes that these tools mean that we 'll see a lot of apps that support both landscape and portrait modes in the iPhone , and I agree .
Not enough iPhone apps support landscape orientation .
10:25 PT - DM :
The SDK has been out for about three months , and thousands of developers are out there using it .
Apple 's asked them what they 've thought about the SDK , and the response has been very positive .
Here 's a quote from a Disney engineer lauding the software development tools .
Tom Yager at our sister publication InfoWorld is giving props as well .
Here 's a plug from the director of mobile product development at Fox .
Finally , David Pogue of the NYT calls the iPhone the third major platform after Windows and Mac OS X .
10:26 PT - DM : Scott : " We could n't agree more .
We think we have a fantastic platform here for people to build incredible applications . "
Apple was really amazed at the quality of the applications that developers have been creating .
They 're inviting up a handful of developers to talk about what they 've been working on .
10:27 PT - DM : Sega is the first one to come up and chat .
Apple was impressed with what Sega had done in just the first couple of weeks with the SDK .
Here 's what they 've managed to accomplish after several months .
Ethan Einhorn of Sega is coming on stage to demo Super Monkey Ball on the iPhone .
10:28 PT - DM : Eight weeks after the SDK event , they came up with 110 stages of the game .
Also " all four of the classic monkeys . "
Here 's the last world in Super Monkey Ball to demo just how well the tilt control works .
I 'd say the graphics look about on par with the Nintendo DS .
Applause as the developer successfully navigates the first checkpoint .
The " tilt control works beautifully . "
Sega loves the App Store and Super Monkey Ball , and they 're looking forward to more apps .
Super Monkey Ball will be available at launch of App Store for $ 9.99 ( that 's a bit lower than some had been suggesting .
Nice ) .
10:29 PT - JS : I always thought Curious George was one of the classic monkeys .
And Mickey Dolenz .
10:30 PT - DM : Next we 're going to talk about eBay.
84 million active users , the largest online marketplace in the world .
Ken Sun from eBay takes the stage .
Here are auctions on the iPhone .
i Phone is # 1 mobile device for accessing eBay .
Five weeks ago , they decided to create this application .
Easy access to search , summary of activities , and personal avatar .
They 're going to search for a new WiiFit .
You can see the picture , all the information , and they 've integrated WebKit to see the buyer 's HTML description .
10:32 PT - DM :
It 'll show you when you 've been outbid , so you can easily see what you 're winning and losing .
Entering a bid is really easy .
One more item on watch list : $ 12.5 million home and golf course .
Scroll through the photos .
eBay app will be available for free when App Store launches .
10:33 PT - JS :
This shows that a lot of companies with fairly sophisticated web sites are still going to develop native applications for the iPhone .
As nice as the iPhone 's web browser interface is , a custom app to pull data off the net can be much better .
10:33 PT - DM :
Our next demo is from " loopt " ( I have n't heard of these guys ) .
Loopt appears to be location - based social networking .
Sam Altman from loopt will come on stage .
Loopt is about " connecting with people on the go . "
You can basically see your friends superimposed on a map .
Best version of Loopt ever made .
" The best and most powerful " mobile platform out there .
You can see what people have been up to all day , and look at photos they 've taken .
You can call , text , or comment on your friends ' status feeds .
" You never have to eat lunch alone again . "
You can use loopt with your friends on other platforms .
The app will be free on the App Store at launch ( not lunch ! ) .
10:36 PT - DM : TypePad is up next .
Michael Sippey from TypePad is going to demo their native blogging client .
Here 's TypePad on the iPhone .
You can create a text post or take a photo with your iPhone and send it to your blog .
Also , you can add a photo from your library into a post .
It appears to handle multiple blogs ( though all TypePad , presumably ) .
You can choose categories and edit the body text .
A pending items view will tell you the progress of posts in the background .
Then you can jump to view your post in Safari .
The app will be available for free at the launch of the App Store .
He gets a nice round of applause ; there are a lot of bloggers in this audience .
10:39 PT - JS : TypePad is a good example , but I suspect we will be flooded with blog - posting tools for the iPhone .
Which is good , because blogging from the iPhone is n't as easy as it could be , even with iPhone - specific interface plug-ins for blogging tools .
10:38 PT - DM : Next : the Associated Press .
They provide news to more than half of the world 's population every day .
Already , AP has one of the best web apps for the iPhone , but they 're making a native app too .
Here 's Benjamin Mosse to discuss the application .
The program is called the " Mobile News Network . "
You can add locations to get local news ; it can use Core Location to get news from wherever you are .
And it'll download the news as you 're reading it , so you can read later from wherever you are , even when you do n't have a network .
Also , you can take a look at the award - winning AP photos and watch video from their news network .
Look , it 's Stevie Wonder !
If you have a photograph or firsthand account of a breaking news story , you can submit a report to the AP .
Unsurprisingly , they love building iPhone apps .
The Mobile News Network will be a free download when the App Store launches .
10:42 PT - JS :
There have been a lot of reports about Apple encouraging developers to charge for their iPhone software .
Interesting , though , how much free stuff we 've seen today on stage .
Dear EarthTalk : I heard that children are reaching puberty at earlier ages now and that it may have to do with environmental toxins and even their TV viewing habits .
Can you enlighten ?
-- Mark Abbot , via e-mail
To say that kids are growing up faster than ever these days may be more than just cliché .
Recent studies have shown that children are reaching puberty at younger and younger ages , and researchers are starting to see links between this trend and other societal ills such as ubiquitous pollution and sedentary lifestyles .
In a 2007 report for the Breast Cancer Fund entitled “ The Falling Age of Puberty in U.S. Girls : What We Know , What We Need to Know , ” ecologist Sandra Steingraber argues that unfettered access to computers and TVs over the last 30 years has led to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle among kids in the U.S. and beyond .
Active kids produce more melatonin , a natural hormone that serves as the body ’s internal clock and calendar .
This could explain why sedentary kids are likely to go through puberty sooner :
Their bodies think their decreased melatonin production is a trigger to move into puberty .
“ [ Melatonin is ] an inhibitory signal for puberty , ” says Steingraber .
“ The more melatonin you have , the later you go into puberty . ”
Of course , sedentary lifestyles are also linked to childhood obesity , a condition that often continues — along with the many health problems that can accompany it — into adulthood .
A recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) found that , between 2001 and 2004 , 17.5 percent of children ages six to 11 were overweight — an effective doubling of obesity rates three decades ago .
A study by the non-profit Obesity Society came up with a slightly higher figure — 20 percent — with the percentages higher for Hispanic , African - American and Native American children .
Obesity is certainly one factor in the surge in so - called “ precocious ” adolescence , but chemicals are also thought to play a role .
According to Erin Barnes , writing in E – The Environmental Magazine , a study comparing the body mass index of Danish and American girls found that the former group hit puberty a full year later than the latter even though their weights were in the same range .
Another study found that wealthy girls in South Africa reach puberty a full year after their African - American counterparts .
“ Many researchers , ” writes Barnes , “ are studying the relationship between chemical pollutants like PCBs ( polychlorinated bphenyls ) and phthalates ( commonly used plasticizers ) and premature development . ”
Some researchers believe that the preponderance of synthetic chemicals in more developed societies are interfering with human endocrine development and essentially “ tricking ” kids ’ bodies into going through puberty prematurely .
Also , precocious puberty in girls has been linked to breast cancer , as well as higher rates of drug abuse , violence , unintended pregnancies , problems in school and mental health issues .
“ Shortening childhood means a shortening of the time before the brain ’s complete re-sculpting occurs , ” says Steingraber .
“ Once that happens , the brain does n’t allow for complex learning . ”
She adds that the brain can only build the connections used to learn a language , play a musical instrument or ride a bike before it gets flooded with the sex hormones that come with the onset of puberty .

Servers at Sea
[ Image : A view of the R/ P FLIP ship , which has absolutely nothing to do with Google 's offshore server plan ; it just looks cool and seems appropriate .
Image altered by Alexander Trevi ] .
This means " stacking containers filled with servers , storage systems and networking gear on barges or other platforms . "
These would be " ' crane - removable ' data center modules on ships . "
From the actual patent application :
In general , computing centers are located on a ship or ships , which are then anchored in a water body from which energy from natural motion of the water may be captured , and turned into electricity and / or pumping power for cooling pumps to carry heat away from computers in the data center .
Perhaps unsurprisingly in this era of alternative energy sources , " Google has theorized about powering these ocean data centers with energy gained just from water splashing against the side of the barges . "
[ Image : From Google 's patent application for servers at sea ; via the New York Times ] .
I have to assume , then , that we 're moving ever closer to true
Two weeks ago , meanwhile , the NYTimes also looked at the
A fleet of tankers shows up in a nearby port one day ... and suddenly your city has telephone services .
It's
The services show up .
The network takes over .
Your city will never be the same .
[ Image : The Instant City at work ; diagrams by Peter Cook / Archigram .
An original interview with Peter Cook appears in the forthcoming BLDGBLOG Book ] .
I 'm further reminded of the Apparently the idea of moving ships from the naval base on the other side of the harbour across to the Auckland waterfront to act as floating generators was considered , but there are problems with feeding the power from the ships to the city .
There 's also the problem that there 's nothing around which can generate even a fraction of the power required .
Another idea which was considered is using one of the Cook Straight ferries ( which could in theory provide around 10 MW ) as a floating generator ( the term " ferry " is a considerable understatement ) .
Currently a couple of waterfront businesses are being run with power from ships acting as floating generators , and when both repaired cables failed their testing , Mercury finally brought in a diesel - electric trans - Tasman freighter , the Union Rotorua , to act as a 12MW floating generator , and is considering bringing in another ship or installing generators on barges .
In any case , the seafaring future of civic infrastructure is something we 'll have to keep our eyes on .
Entire new untold types of urban experience could be yours the minute that strange shape on the horizon comes in to dock .
( Thanks , Nicky ! )
Google has filed a patent for what the New York Times describes as " mobile data center platforms out at sea .
" This means " stacking containers filled with servers , storage systems and networking gear on barges or other platforms . "
These would be " ' crane - removable ' data center modules on ships . "
From the actual patent application : Perhaps unsurprisingly in this era of alternative energy sources , " Google has theorized about powering these ocean data centers with energy gained just from water splashing against the side of the barges .
" I have to assume , then , that we 're moving ever closer to true deep - water city - states – only they wo n't be libertarian ocean - going homesteads , after all , they 'll be distributed networks of supercomputing villages afloat on , and drawing power from , the tides .
Two weeks ago , meanwhile , the NYTimes also looked at the privatization of civic infrastructure – but perhaps Google 's literally offshore experiment in information technology implies a coming world of privatized services at sea .
A fleet of tankers shows up in a nearby port one day ... and suddenly your city has telephone services .
It 's Archigram 's instant city all over again , but on the level of specific – and highly billable – urban amenities .
The services show up .
The network takes over .
Your city will never be the same .
I'm further reminded of the five - week - long power outage that struck Auckland , New Zealand , just slightly more than ten years ago .
Peter Gutmann describes some of the possible ship - borne solutions to that city 's loss of electricity :
In any case , the seafaring future of civic infrastructure is something we 'll have to keep our eyes on .
Entire new untold types of urban experience could be yours the minute that strange shape on the horizon comes in to dock .

When it was first reported that a Republican on a camping trip had shot and killed that well - known celebrity , Bullwinkle , the Talking Moose , the Left assumed that it was Sarah Palin out to make more Mooseburgers .
In reality , it was Dick Cheney who , while showing off his new rifle , accidentally shot and killed his long - time friend Bullwinkle .
The immediate reaction of the Left was a harsh and swift condemnation of Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin .
Then the Left launched a vendetta against Sarah Palin and her supporters .
To say that there was a lynch mob mentality would be a gross understatement of the Left ’s fury .
Only round - the - clock Secret Service protection was keeping Sarah Palin safe from harm .
Not only were they physically trying to attack Sarah , they made up all kinds of disgusting lies about Sarah and her family , while hackers feverishly tried to break into her email , bank accounts , credit cards and other personal records in an attempt to destroy her .
No amount of evidence would convince the Left that Sarah was not responsible , and would never harm a talking , intelligent being like Bullwinkle ( Sarah respects life to the point that she knowingly brought a Down Syndrome baby into this world ) .
An example of the vile Leftist slander were the stories printed in the New York Times ( see front page below ) .
Although completely based on rumor , speculation and innuendo , these stories were accepted as fact by Leftists everywhere .
Rumors began to circulate that not only does Sarah eat live Teddy Bears , but Bambi ’s mom was next on Sarah ’s hit list .
While the furor has yet to die down , leaders of the Democratic Party and their supporters have spoken out on the death of Bullwinkle .
House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi : I ’m going to “ save the planet ” from oil drilling and rapacious Republican Moosekillers .
Senator Joe Biden : Bullwinkle was “ clean and articulate . ”
A great Moose American who recently told me that “ patriotism and religious experience was all about raising taxes on the rich ” Human Americans .
If only I had known that Bullwinkle was in danger , I ’d have protected him with my expensive Beretta shotgun .
Senator Harry Reid : “ The war in Iraq is lost , the surge wo n’t work ” and rabid Republicans are trying to distract us with a genocidal war on our talking Mooses .
Senator Barack Obama : Bullwinkle died because “ white folks greed runs a world in need . ”
The “ hope ” and “ change ” that an Obama administration would bring came too late for Bullwinkle .
“ We are the ones that ” Bullwinkle was “ waiting for , ” but Bullwinkle was killed by the “ bitter ” fools who still “ cling to guns and religion . ”
Michelle Obama :
This only proves “ our souls are broken .
We need to fix our souls .
We ca n’t let people go back to their ordinary lives ” after this tragedy .
PETA : “ We call for a special prosecutor to investigate the immoral killing of an intelligent mammal who was our equal in every way .
Bullwinkle should have had the same rights as all the humans who wear fur and antlers .
Republican haters - of - life must be prosecuted , if not aborted in the womb , in order to save the diversity and health of our planet , Gaia . ”
Al Gore : “ The Republicans will try and tell you that the world is better off without Bullwinkle ’s carbon footprint .
I say that it ’s people , not our good friends the Mooses , who are responsible for global warming on spaceship Earth .
If only Bullwinkle would have contacted me through my invention , the Internet , I ’d have been able to fly him away in my big private jet and given him sanctuary in my large mansion . ”
John Edwards and Bill Clinton issued a joint statement : “ We did not have sex with those women . ”
Hillary Clinton : Bullwinkle might still be alive if I was POTUS and “ we had comprehensive health care for every American . ”
Oprah : “ This is why I wo n’t let Sarah Palin on my show .
I only interview and support for office enlightened Democratic politicians .
Barack is the one !!
Barack is the one !!… ”
Editorials in The Daily Kos , Huffington Post , The New York Times and the rest of the MSM call for the “ … immediate elimination of all WMD — weapons of Moose destruction — in the USA by whatever means necessary . ”
The fact that WMD still exist in the USA “ …. is taken as the most significant failure yet , of the worst president in our history .
What will the Europeans think of us now ?
All of our foreign and domestic policies must be based on only one fundamental principle : Appeasing the French so , from now on , they ’ll only say nice things about us . ”
The Religious world has also spoken out .
Reverend Wright : “ Blacks do n’t kill Whites or Mooses , Blacks only kill each other .
Racist Republican hunters — supported by our criminal
White government — are practicing on talking Mooses , getting ready for the day they ’ll slaughter all African Americans with guns and AIDS .
America ’s racist chickens are coming home to roost .
God damn America for killing Bullwinkle . ”
Father Phleger : “ White entitlement ” is responsible for the death of Bullwinkle .
The Pope : “ We must love and protect all of God ’s creation . ”
Hollywood will always produce a few good quotes .
Tom Cruise : “ If Bullwinkle had become a Scientologist , he ’d of had lots of women , and a much happier and more productive life , just like me . ”
Katie Holmes ( Cruise ’s current wife ) : “ If Bullwinkle had become a Scientologist , I might have married Bullwinkle instead of Tom .
Tom is a stud , which I love , but he ’s also a bigger Moose than Bullwinkle ever was . ”
Lindsay Lohan then issued this statement : “ I ’ve always wondered what it would be like to be in a relationship with a Moose like Bullwinkle . ”
Britney Spears was heard to say : “ Eeewww , even I ’m not as sick as Lind…say . ”
Madonna chimed in : “ What ’s the big deal about being in a relationship with a Moose ?
I ’ve been in every possible kind of relationship . ”
Paris Hilton : “ I ’m not interested in serious relationships anymore ; I only want to look good , have fun , be a celebrity , and spend lots of money . ”
A number of prominent foreigners and foreign organizations have also issued statements on the passing of Bullwinkle .
Iranian President Ahmadinejad :
The death of Bullwinkle is the work of the “ Zionist leadership of the Great Satan , the USA . ”
President Ahmadinejad and Hamas agree : “ The only final solution is to immediately kill all Jews everywhere , starting with the destruction of the Little Satan , Israel . ”
The rest of the Arab world ( including Bin Laden ) : “ We ’ll all keep quiet and let Iran nuke Israel in Bullwinkle ’s name . ”
Africa : “ Imperialism , racism , and Islamophobia are the root causes of Bullwinkle ’s demise .
We must have more foreign aid and world - wide hate speech laws to prevent this from ever happening again . ”
The EU and UN : “ We condemn this indiscriminate slaughter , the killing of Bullwinkle , as the direct result of barbaric US cowboy policies .
The US must change their foreign and domestic programs to conform with EU and UN standards . ”
Russia : “ Ha ! Ha !
You kill Bullwinkle and whole world condemns you .
We kill countries of Georgia and Ukraine and whole world , especially Europe , kisses our buttski . ”
Israel : “ Before we all end up like Bullwinkle , sell us the weapons that we need now to bomb and destroy Iran ’s nuclear program ! ”
China :
“ We ’re too busy building our economy and buying up your country to pay any attention to Bullwinkle . ”
Hugo Chavez : “ Capitalism destroyed Bullwinkle .
Only socialism will save you from that Devil Bush . ”
Latin America : “ We agree with Hugo Chavez .
Adopt socialist policies so you ’ll be as poor as us , but give us free trade so we can grow our economies . ”
We ’ll end with this simple , heartfelt statement from Rocky , the Flying Squirrel : “ Bullwinkle was my best friend .
Through many tough adventures we stuck together .
I ’ll miss him terribly . ”
Vote Republican in 2008
Sarah Palin For President in 2012
Update : Today is Sunday , Oct. 5 , 2008 , and I originally published this article on September 19 , 2008 .
On September 24 , Florida Democratic Congressman Alcee Hastings said : “ If Sarah Palin is n’t enough of a reason for you to get over whatever your problem is with Barack Obama , then you damn well had better pay attention .
Anybody toting guns and stripping moose do n’t care too much about what they do with Jews and blacks .
So , you just think this through ” [ my emphasis ] .
After thinking this through , I ’ve decided that what the Congressman is hinting at is Moosehunter = Genocide for Blacks and Jews .
This is the demagogic logic of the Left and the Obama campaign , even though Sarah Palin showed she cared enough about human life to bring a Down syndrome baby into this world .
Also , note the similarity of this comment to what I attributed to Reverend Wright in the article above .
Life does imitate art !
Homeowners struggling to meet their mortgage payments would be able to sell their homes to the local authority and rent them back as tenants under radical proposals being considered by the government to prevent the misery of repossession .
Emergency measures to allow families to keep a roof over their heads are being drawn up as the scale of repossessions proceedings becomes increasingly apparent .
In Newcastle upon Tyne alone , the newly nationalised Northern Rock is monopolising at least one day a week in the county court to pursue defaulting borrowers .
The latest rescue package reflects growing fears about the seriousness of the crisis , with some analysts predicting that house prices could fall by 35 per cent .
Ministers are worried about the 13 per cent of fixed - rate borrowers whose cheap deals expire this year , some of whom may by then be in negative equity and therefore unable to switch to a new fixed rate with another lender .
Caroline Flint , the Housing Minister , told The Observer yesterday : ' I am looking at what more we can do with our colleagues in local authorities - what they can do as well as actually building [ homes ] , and what support they could give to people who might be feeling under pressure on mortgages . '
Asked to confirm that she was considering rent - back schemes , enabling homeowners to become council tenants in their original houses rather than be repossessed , she said : ' We are looking at that .
I have to be certain that the choices I make do actually help to limit the damage ; and , importantly , is it a short - term fix or a long - term impact ? '
The scheme would be expensive .
Councils would need central government funds to buy the houses .
But it could save on the long - term costs of rehousing homeless families and allow councils to increase their housing stock at relatively low prices .
Flint also suggested the Bank of England could increase the size of its £ 50bn fund designed to stimulate mortgage lending , admitting she was ' disappointed ' that the cash that has been pumped in so far had not led to cheaper home loans .
' No doubt our colleagues in the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee will also be looking at the issue in terms of whether any extra has to be provided , ' she added .
She has suggested that country landowners could be freed to build cheap houses for their workers on their own land , in a return to the system of ' tied cottages ' .
' It 's recognising that sense of community and how everybody has a part to play , ' she said .
Debt advice experts warned yesterday that , despite the Chancellor 's calls for leniency from lenders , Northern Rock was now aggressively pursuing defaulting borrowers as part of its efforts to repay the £ 25 bn rescue package it received from the government .
Chris Jary , director of Action for Debt in Durham , said : ' There used to be a small group of sub - prime lenders who you knew would always go straight to court .
But recently it 's Northern Rock who have become more aggressive , taking legal action as soon as they can . '
House repossessions at Northern Rock are running at twice the rate they were before the bank was nationalised in February .
She 's good :
So there are all these liberals in the country .
Probably if you took a smart liberal who performs well on television and made her the host of a TV show , those liberals would watch that show .
Just a theory .

One of the stars of a highly controversial film is to look into lifting a long - standing ban on it in the town where she is now mayor .
Sue Jones - Davies , mayor of Aberystwyth , Dyfed , rose to fame in the 1979 hit Life of Brian , in which she played the part of Brian 's girlfriend , Judith .
In the film , Monty Python stalwart Graham Chapman is the reluctant messiah , Brian , born on Christmas Day in Roman - occupied Judea .
It caused outrage among Christians all over the world who labelled it blasphemous , and some areas , like Aberystwyth , banned the film .
Sue Jones - Davies , 59 , now a Plaid Cymru councillor and yoga teacher , said she is going to investigate the possibility of lifting the ban : " Given what 's on TV now , I think it 's amazing a ban in Aberystwyth still exists .
I think it should be lifted . "

Ms Jones - Davies added that if the ban was overturned they could possibly arrange a screening and donate the proceeds to charity .
In the Los Angeles Times today , Jonah Goldberg began the right 's extreme makeover of John McCain 's disastrous record on Iraq .
Declaring " there is one candidate who 's been consistently right about the war , and it is n't the Democrat , " Goldberg invents a fictional McCain at odds with President Bush from the outset of the war :
" Meantime , there was the supposedly dogmatic McCain challenging Bush 's approach to Iraq nearly from the get - go . "
As the history shows , not so much .
Demonstrating that experience is truly no substitute for judgment , John McCain like President Bush was wrong at almost every turn in promoting the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
From his predictions of a short war and claims U.S. troops would be greeted as liberators to his announcements of mission accomplished , his ongoing confusion over friend and foe in Iraq and so much more , McCain 's is an unbroken legacy of error .
Here , then , is a brief summary of John McCain 's consistently wrong record on Iraq :
On the Run - Up to War
" Look , we 're going to send young men and women in harm 's way and that 's always a great danger , but I cannot believe that there is an Iraqi soldier who is going to be willing to die for Saddam Hussein , particularly since he will know that our objective is to remove Saddam Hussein from power . "
( John McCain , September 15 , 2002 . )
" But the fact is , I think we could go in with much smaller numbers than we had to do in the past .
But any military man worth his salt is going to have to prepare for any contingency , but I do n't believe it 's going to be nearly the size and scope that it was in 1991 . "
( John McCain , September 15 , 2002 . )
" He 's a patriot who has the best interests of his country at heart . "
( John McCain , on Ahmed Chalabi , 2003 . )
On Saddam 's Weapons of Mass Destruction "
Proponents of containment claim that Iraq is in a " box . "
But it is a box with no lid , no bottom , and whose sides are falling out .
Within this box are definitive footprints of germ , chemical and nuclear programs . "
( John McCain , February 13 , 2003 . )
" I remain confident that we will find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . "
( John McCain , June 11 , 2003 . )
On Being Greeted as Liberators
" Absolutely .
Absolutely . "
John McCain , asked by Chris Matthews , " you believe that the people of Iraq or at least a large number of them will treat us as liberators ? " ( March 12 , 2003 . )
" Not only that , they 'll be relieved that he's not in the neighborhood because he has invaded his neighbors on several occasions . "
John McCain , asked by Chris Matthews , " And you think the Arab world will come to a grudging recognition that what we did was necessary ? " ( March 12 , 2003 . )
" There 's no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and there 's no doubt in my mind , once these people are gone , that we will be welcomed as liberators . "
( John McCain , March 24 , 2003 . )
On a Rapid Victory and Mission Accomplished
" I think the victory will be rapid , within about three weeks . "
( John McCain , January 28 , 2003 . )
" It 's clear that the end is very much in sight ... It wo n't be long .
It , it 'll be a fairly short period of time . "
( John McCain , April 9 , 2003 . )
" We won a massive victory in a few weeks , and we did so with very limited loss of American and allied lives . "
( John McCain , May 22 , 2003 . )
" I thought it was wrong at the time .
Do I blame him for that specific banner ?
I can't . "
( John McCain , on President Bush 's " Mission Accomplished " speech , May 1 , 2008 . )
" Well , then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier ? " ( John McCain , responding to assertion by Fox News ' Neil Cavuto that " many argue the conflict is n't over , " June 11 , 2003 . )
" I have said a long time that reconstruction of Iraq would be a long , long , difficult process , but the conflict -- the major conflict is over , the regime change has been accomplished , and it's very appropriate . "
( John McCain , June 11 , 2003 . )
" I'm confident we 're on the right course . " ( John McCain , March 7 , 2004 . )
" We 're either going to lose this thing or win this thing within the next several months . "
( John McCain , November 12 , 2006 . )
" My friends , the war will be over soon , the war for all intents and purposes although the insurgency will go on for years and years and years . "
( John McCain , February 25 , 2008 . )
On the Safe Streets of Baghdad
" [ There ] there " are neighborhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk through those neighborhoods , today . "
John McCain , after touring a Baghdad market wearing a bulletproof vest and guarded by " 100 American soldiers , with three Blackhawk helicopters , and two Apache gunships overhead , ( April 1 , 2007 . )
" There 's problems in America with safe neighborhoods as we well know . "
( John McCain , March 8 , 2008 . )
On President Bush and His Team
We are very fortunate that our president in these challenging days can rely on the counsel of a man who has demonstrated time and again the resolve , experience , and patriotism that will be required for success and the hard - headed clear thinking necessary to prevail in this global fight between good and evil . "
( John McCain , on Dick Cheney , July 16 , 2004 . )
" I think he strengthened our national defenses .
I think he has a good team around him . "
( John McCain , on President Bush , September 3 , 2004 . )
" I said no .
My answer is still no .
No confidence . "
( John McCain , on whether he had confidence in Bush Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , December 15 , 2004 . )
On the Non-Existent Alliance Between Al Qaeda and Iran
" But Al Qaeda is there , they are functioning , they are supported in many times , in many ways by the Iranians . "
( John McCain , February 28 , 2008 . )
" As you know , there are al Qaeda operatives that are taken back into Iran , given training as leaders , and they 're moving back into Iraq . "
( John McCain , March 17 , 2008 . )
" [ Iranian operatives are ] " taking al - Qaeda into Iran , training them and sending them back . "
( John McCain , March 18 , 2008 . )
" [ It is ] common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran , that 's well known .
And it 's unfortunate . "
( John McCain , March 18 , 2008 . )
" Al Qaeda and Shia extremists -- with support from external powers such as Iran -- are on the run but not defeated . "
McCain campaign statement , ( March 19 , 2008 . )
" To think that I would have some lack of knowledge about Sunni and Shia after my eighth visit and my deep involvement in this issue is a bit ludicrous . "
( John McCain , March 19 , 2008 . )
" Do you still view Al Qaeda in Iraq as a major threat ?
Certainly not an obscure sect of the Shiites overall … " ( John McCain , questioning General David Petraeus , April 8 , 2008 . )
On a Permanent American Military Presence in Iraq
" We cannot keep our forces indefinitely staged in the region .
Were we to attempt again to contain Saddam , we would eventually have to withdraw them .
The world is full of dangers and , more likely than not , we will need some of those brave men and women to face them down . "
( John McCain , February 13 , 2003 . )
" We have had troops in South Korea for 60 years and nobody minds . "
( John McCain , June 7 , 2007 . )
" Make it a hundred . "
John McCain , told that President Bush had said American troops could remain in Iraq for 50 years , ( January 3 , 2008 . )
" I asked McCain about his ' hundred years ' comment , and he reaffirmed the remark , excitedly declaring that U.S. troops could be in Iraq for ' a thousand years ' or ' a million years , ' as far as he was concerned . "
( David Corn , January 3 , 2008 . )
" The U.S. could have a military presence anywhere in the world for a long period of time . "
( John McCain , February 20 , 2008 . )
" By January 2013 , America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom . "
( John McCain , May 15 , 2008 . )
" I can tell you that it is succeeding .
I can look you in the eye and tell you it 's succeeding .
We have drawn down to pre-surge levels .
Basra , Mosul and now Sadr city are quiet and it's long and it's hard and it's tough and there will be setbacks . "
John McCain , on a day when Mosul was rocked by suicide bombs and U.S. troop strength remained abve pre-surge level , ( May 30 , 2008 . )
TBILISI , Aug 8 ( Reuters ) - Georgia will withdraw 1,000 soldiers from Iraq to help fight off Russian forces in Georgia 's breakaway region of South Ossetia , the head of Georgia 's Security Council , Kakha Lomaia , said on Friday .
" We have already communicated to our American friends that we are going to withdraw half our contingent of soldiers in Iraq within days because we are under Russian aggression , " Lomaia told Reuters .
" These are some of our best soldiers , " he said .

( NaturalNews ) Painkillers not only have no effect on preventing mental decline in patients with family histories of Alzheimer 's disease , they may actually accelerate it , according to a study conducted by researchers from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and published in the Some researchers have suggested that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as aspirin and ibuprofen may decrease the risk of Alzheimer 's by reducing inflammation in the brain that might be linked to the disease .
But the current research found no evidence for this claim .
"
The drugs we studied did not seem to improve cognitive function and , if anything , there was some weak evidence for a detrimental effect , " said researcher Barbara Martin .
" So we do n't at this time recommend taking NSAIDs for the purpose of preventing Alzheimer 's or cognitive decline .
" The researchers examined 2,117 people over the age of 70 who had a family history of Alzheimer 's disease but were not exhibiting any symptoms of dementia .
Participants were given either 200 milligrams of Celebrex , 220 milligrams of naproxen , or a placebo two times per day .
Naproxen is also marketed as Aleve and Naprosyn .
The researchers were forced to halt the trial early , after less than three years , when other researchers discovered that Celebrex raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
Based on tests of cognitive function given once per year , neither Celebrex nor naproxen decreased the rate of cognitive decline compared to a placebo .
On the contrary , participants taking naproxen had lower scores for overall cognitive function than those taking a placebo .
Those taking either painkiller also scored lower on one specific test of cognitive function .
John Morris , director of the Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine , warned that people should not start taking drugs just based on a rumored benefit .
" Drugs potentially have side effects and unless there 's a documented benefit , just because it 's popular , I would n't rush to do that , " he said .

The streets that wend their way to the Royal Opera House are , this rainy Wednesday evening , crowded with golf umbrellas and expensive perfume .
Tonight sees the staging of The Rake 's Progress , and the foyer of the London venue is flooded with people in evening dress , their voices ringing clear and crisp across the hall .
I stand there in my jeans and scruffy shoes , flapping my broken umbrella , and gulp .
For years now , the nation 's various opera companies have been making strenuous efforts to attract a more diverse audience - with modern interpretations , cheap tickets , outdoorshows , cinematic screenings , " simulcasts " from the New York Met , club nights , cult artists , Damon Albarn 's Monkey , a presence on Facebook and YouTube , and even ticket offers in the Sun .
It does seem to be working : Royal Opera House attendance figures are up 80,000 on last year ; 48 % of patrons are ROH newcomers ; more than 22,000 students are registered for the company 's stand - by ticket scheme ; and 385,000 people download the ROH podcast each month .
But can they make me want to come back ?
I am , surely , exactly the sort of person they are trying to tempt .
I spend much of my time listening to music and attending gigs .
I will happily spend vast sums on festivals .
Yet classical music has always seemed a cold and distant land , set far away across a sea of elitism .
I have had little desire to visit it and I have always bridled at the notion that classical is considered a higher art form than rock 'n'roll .
Sod your arias , I thought , I 'll stick with Little Richard singing : " A- wop-bop-a-loo-wop-a-wop-bam-boom ! "
Accordingly , I have attended the opera just once , over a decade ago .
It did little to encourage me .
Yet some things have intrigued me : the short bursts from the Oakland Symphony Chamber Chorus that appear in the Van Morrison song Snow in San Anselmo ; the fact that when I interviewed the great Patti Smith , she raved about Puccini's Madame Butterfly .
So tonight , sitting in the velvet seats of the Opera House , listening to the orchestra heave and huff before the curtain rises , I try to keep an open mind .
The Rake 's Progress is the cautionary tale of a man named Tom Rakewell who deserts his lady , Anne Trulove , to seek fame and fortune in London in the company of Nick Shadow , who , it transpires , is the devil .
After various episodes involving whores and bearded ladies , Rakewell ends up in Bedlam .
Although it is performed in English , there are surtitles for when the singing grows incomprehensible , and there is an extravagant set , full of oil wells and racing cars , which will hopefully prove compelling should one 's mind begin to stray .
Which it does .
Repeatedly .
The problems are various : I do n't really care for the singing , all the fah - diddly - dahing smothers the plot .
I find it extremely annoying that they keep repeating everything ; a character will reiterate precisely what he has already said in the most tedious fashion .
On top of it all , it 's rather warm .
I reach the interval feeling decidedly drowsy .
Everyone rushes to the bar and I am suddenly surrounded by umpteen well - dressed , middle - aged men shoving their way in front of me .
I can't recall the last time I encountered such rudeness .
Not even in the city 's most dog - eared rock venues do you find such uncouth behaviour .
For a small fortune , I eventually procure wine and pistachios , and stand in the corner contemplating how objectionable everyone is .
I think of my friends , somewhere across town watching a band called the Virgins and feel tearful .
My heart lifts when I discover that the second half of an opera is generally shorter than the first .
Back in my seat , feeling more buoyant , I wonder what I make of The Rake 's Progress , and conclude that , while it looks spectacular , it is actually very dreary while , musically speaking , I like it slightly less than bassline house .
As the curtain falls , I am off across town to meet my friends at a scuzzy little bar where there is cheap beer and loud rock .
The next evening I return for The Marriage of Figaro , this time with a friend .
" It 's the worst place in the world ! " I tell him .
He , however , is enthusiastic , because he wants to hear the famous " Figaro ! Figaro ! Figaro ! " passage .
I tell him he has three long , warbly hours before him and his zeal evaporates .
Figaro is Mozart 's satirical take on the aristocracy , with lots of infidelity and jumping out of windows .
Again , it looks gorgeous and the music is quite luscious .
It is undoubtedly more engaging than the Rake , but my mind still wanders .
" Why do they need to repeat everything ? " my friend whispers .
" Exactly . " I reply .
" They could get the whole thing done a lot faster if they just said it once . "
We quell the boredom by surreptitiously eating an orange .
At the interval , we head to the bar .
" Were n't you here last night ? " the barman says .
" Yes , " I sigh .
" Dear God , " says a woman .
" I do n't think I could do two nights in a row . "
So , just why do people go to opera ?
As far as I can see , it 's too long , the music , singing and drama never work together , and it is staggeringly self - indulgent , like sitting through the most noodly Carlos Santana guitar solo , only for Chris Rea to appear and go through it all again , with Mark Knopfler joining in for good measure .
I think people must attend opera in the same way they introduce roughage to their diet - because they ought to , rather than because they want to .
Later that month , I catch a train to Buxton for the opera festival , to see Dido and Aeneas by Purcell , and Samson by Handel .
Buxton is a gorgeous place and the crowd far less annoying .
I have been listening to Madame Butterfly repeatedly , to accustom myself to the style of singing .
It seems to be paying off : I enjoy Dido and Aeneas far more than I expect .
Samson , though , is a struggle .
It 's the biblical tale , but rendered more contemporary with nods to terrorism and latter - day dictators .
When the festival chorus is on stage , it 's lovely , but whenever Samson starts lamenting about everything , I just want him to stop moaning .
It does n't help that Samson 's mother , in the style of her hair and the way she dips her head when she sings , puts me in mind of Princess Diana being interviewed by Martin Bashir .
Still , as the production feels considerably more am - dram than anything at the Royal Opera House , it makes me like it more .
Next is a trip to Glyndebourne , the jewel of the opera season .
It is raining the day my friend and I visit in our evening gowns .
Fine grey mist is sweeping across the lawn where the picnickers are dressed in all their finery .
It rather puts a dampener on what is meant to be a splendid day out to the East Sussex countryside , with a bit of opera on the side .
We are here to see Love and Other Demons , an adaptation of Gabriel García Márquez 's novel .
Márquez is one of my favourite writers , so I 'm actually excited .
The daughter of a marquis is bitten by a dog , contracts rabies , is imprisoned in a convent , where an exorcist falls obsessively in love with her .
Lavishly staged , it is sung in English , Latin , Spanish and Yoruba .
I want to like this , really I do , but everything I love about Márquez 's writing - his ripeness , his deliciousness - has been stripped away .
It makes me very sad .
At the interval , we spill out into the grounds to drink champagne .
The sense of occasion here at Glyndebourne , the black tie and the gowns , the salmon sandwiches and the strolls through the luscious grounds , make it feel like a country wedding .
My feelings towards the audience here are more benign .
There is one exception : the woman who glares at us as the photographer takes my picture on the lawn .
" That 's so not Glyndebourne ! " she hisses .
I have a profound desire to spit in her hair .
It is not just incidents like this that will keep me from returning to opera .
It is the fact that I just cannot find a friend in this music .
I can see it is beautiful .
I can tell they are singing magnificently , but it stirs nothing in my belly , conjures nothing in my heart .
It carries for me none of the fire , the spine - tingling , stomach - flipping , bone - chilling lifeblood of rock 'n'roll .
Back at Glyndebourne , the rain is falling hard .
With the applause inside still ringing , we hitch up the muddy hems of our evening gowns and dash to the taxi .
" Get us out of here ! " I tell the driver as he takes us to the station .
" As fast as you can ! "
On the train home , we swig cheap rosé straight from the bottle and eat dry - roasted peanuts , letting the arias fade into the distance ...
RTE , which looks set to miss its financial targets by as much as € 25 m this year , is spending a fortune on expensive imported series which are being broadcast in the dead of night or " warehoused " to prevent them going to rival stations .
The national broadcaster , which has a revenue well in excess of €400 m , including € 200 m from the taxpayer through the licence fee , has a programme inventory packed with US series , which many stations across Europe broadcast at prime time .
Now TV3 are understood to be monitoring how RTE is using its licence fee financial muscle to outbid the smaller commercial channels , such as themselves , Channel 6 and TG4 , for a large number of blue chip programmes , which they are then showing in the early hours of the morning .
Some of the series which RTE television are broadcasting between midnight and 5 am in the morning cost as much as € 100,000 per series to buy in , industry sources claim .
And distributors have told the Sunday Independent that RTE could be spending more than € 1 m per quarter on its post - midnight schedule .
It comes at a time when RTE have told the Department of Communications that revenues could be off target by up to € 25 m , after TV and radio advertising growth slumped during the summer .
Television advertising has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn , and radio advertising is also off target -- though to a lesser extent .
At the same time , RTE1 and RTE 2 television schedules are packed with imported US , Canadian and Australian series .
They include ABC 's popular Dirty Sexy Money , shown at 12.30 am on Friday mornings on RTE , and Medium , the drama series inspired by the real - life story of research medium Allison DuBois and starring Emmy winner Patricia Arquette .
Da Vinci's Inquest , a crime drama critically acclaimed as the best television series in Canada after winning the Gemini Award for Best Dramatic Series for five of its first six seasons , is broadcast even later on RTE 1 , at 5.45 am .
Other imported RTE series being shown during the night include : Intelligence ( 2.40 am ) ; City Homicide ( 2.15 am ) ; The Dead Zone ( 2.45 am ) ; Traveller ( 3.20 am ) ; The Secret Life of Us ( 2.55 am ) ; Daybreak ( 3.05 am ) ; In Plain Sight ( 4.25 am ) and What about Brian ( 4.05 am ) .
Other shows being shown in the " dead zone " include Eli Stone , which is shown at 2.20 am , and Whistler , a Canadian television drama centring on the aftermath of the mysterious death of a local snowboard legend , which RTE broadcasts after 2am .
The licence fee is now € 160 and the national broadcaster posted net profits of € 26.4 m for 2007 -- an increase of 45 per cent on the 2006 figure of € 17.9m .
RTE was also boosted by the number of new homes , which pushed up revenue from the licence fee to € 195 m , and there were commercial earnings of € 245m .
TV 3 chief executive David McRedmond is on record as saying that legislators needed to take more action to ring - fence RTE 's licence fee income so that it was used only for public service broadcasting projects .
He also accused RTE of stockpiling US imports and making it difficult for commercial rivals like TV3 , who survive on advertising revenue alone , to buy material .
'' However , we try not to whine , and we do want to show what we can do with the resources we have , " he said in an interview .
'' We take a very real contemporary view of Ireland , and that is a clear point of difference for us .
We need to make sure we maintain that , " Mr McRedmond added .
However , it is understood that TV3 was infuriated when RTE used the launch of new programmes to show a video lampooning their independent competitor .
And there is also anger that RTE have allegedly copied programme ideas from their smaller competitor .
After six years of US - led military support and billions of pounds in aid , security in Afghanistan is " deteriorating " and President Hamid Karzai 's government controls less than a third of the country , America 's top intelligence official has admitted .
Mike McConnell testified in Washington that Karzai controls about 30 % of Afghanistan and the Taliban 10 % , and the remainder is under tribal control .
The Afghan government angrily denied the US director of national intelligence 's assessment yesterday , insisting it controlled " over 360 " of the country 's 365 districts .
" This is far from the facts and we completely deny it , " said the defence ministry .
But the gloomy comments echoed even more strongly worded recent reports by thinktanks , including one headed by the former Nato commander General James Jones , which concluded that " urgent changes " were required now to " prevent Afghanistan becoming a failed state " .
Although Nato forces have killed thousands of insurgents , including several commanders , an unrelenting drip of violence has eroded Karzai 's grip in the provinces , providing fuel to critics who deride him as " the mayor of Kabul " .
A suicide bomb at a dog fight near Kandahar last week killed more than 80 people .
Yesterday fighting erupted in neighbouring Helmand when the Taliban ambushed a police patrol .
The interior ministry said 25 militants were killed ; a Taliban spokesman said they lost one .
A day earlier , the Asian Rural Life Development Foundation aid agency said it feared that Cyd Mizell , an American employee kidnapped in Kandahar last month , had been killed in captivity .
A big injection of foreign troops has failed to bring stability .
The US has almost 50,000 soldiers in Afghanistan and - twice as many as in 2004 - while the UK has 7,700 , mostly in Helmand .
Another 2,200 US marines are due to arrive next month to combat an expected Taliban surge .
Nato commanders paint the suicide bombs and ambushes as signs of a disheartened enemy .
Yesterday , Brigadier Andrew Mackay , commander of the British contingent in southern Afghanistan , said the Taliban were " worn down " , running low on fighters , and being ostracised by local communities .
" Logistically they are also challenged .
The cumulative effect of all of this is that they are having to change their modus operandi , and that is why we are seeing more asymmetric attacks and suicide bombings in places such as Kandahar , " he said .
But analysts believe the Taliban is successfully adapting the brutal guerrilla tactics that have served Iraqi insurgents so well .
The six British soldiers killed in Helmand over the past three months were victims of roadside bombs .
The drugs trade is swelling the Taliban coffers - according to the highest estimates , 40 % of profits , or tens of millions of pounds , go to the insurgency .
Attacks have made the main road from Kandahar to Kabul too dangerous for foreigners .
Afghan truck drivers travel with armed escort .
The insecurity has penetrated the capital .
Since an assault on Kabul 's Serena Hotel last January , westerners have disappeared from the streets of Kabul .
This week Taliban commanders threatened to step up the campaign with more bombs .
The key to the Taliban 's success , McConnell said , " is the opportunity for safe haven in Pakistan " .
Meanwhile the surge in violence has placed a big strain on Nato .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has agreed to deploy a battalion outside Kabul after America has criticised European states for refusing to join the fight in the south and Canada threatened to withdraw its troops from Kandahar next year if reinforcements do not arrive .
An Oxfam report yesterday said international and national security forces , as well as warlords , criminals and the Taliban , were perceived by ordinary Afghans as posing security threats .
You may have thought that the all - seeing , future - predicting loom of life was the craziest thing about Wanted .
As it turns out , however , Mark Millar and J.G. Jones 's graphic - novel - turned - film has even more implausible scenarios to feed your fantasies .
For example , there 's the way Wesley ( James McAvoy ) can " bend " the trajectory of a bullet shot from his gun .
Sounds unlikely , but could a bullet in real life actually be shot in a way that would make it curve through the air ?
Read on to find out ( very light spoilers ) .

MYTH : Wesley Gibson ( James McAvoy ) and a few select others have a special , super - shooting ability that makes it possible for them to curve the trajectories of the bullets they shoot .
Advertisement
FACT : To change the movement of any object , external force must be involved — so says a little thing called Newton 's First Law .
After the initial impulse that propels a bullet from the barrel of a gun , a bullet 's path will essentially follow a straight line .
In long - range shooting , gravity will impose a downward acceleration on the bullet , causing the bullet to travel in a slight parabola .
Air resistance , wind , and even the Coriolis effect might also affect the trajectory of the bullet ( especially at long distances ) , but this is quite apart from Wanted 's claim that bullets are able to dodge obstacles .
Of course , there 's always the possibility that a simple bullet could be more than meets the eye .
In 1998 , two professors from California — Dr. Chih - Ming Ho of UCLA and Dr. Yu - Chong Tai of Caltech — published a landmark paper detailing their research into the possible application of micro-electro - mechanical systems ( MEMS ) to situations involving fluid flows .
What they were exploring is the behavior of tiny transducers ( sensors or actuators such as accelerometers or microflaps ) that are surrounded by a fluid flow ; these MEMS transducers could be as small as a thousandth of a millimeter , or one micrometer .
With sophisticated enough micro-devices , a bullet might be able to detect , record , and control its own trail .
Ho and Tai , however , are now focusing their research on biomedical applications , so McAvoy will have to look elsewhere .

MYTH : If you concentrate hard enough — and if you 're as badass as Wesley Gibson — you can shoot the wings off a fly .

FACT : Let 's leave aside for a moment the assumption that flies will remain perfectly still in politeness while you shoot them , and that small considerations like human error , weapon defects , and unpredictable air resistance wo n't affect the accuracy of a gunshot more than one millimeter .
According to the Internet Movie Firearms Database , the gun that James McAvoy is most likely shooting in Wanted is either a Beretta 92 with 9x19 mm Parabellum cartridges or a Heckler & Koch USP Compact pistol with .357 SIG cartridges .
( In the side image , the Beretta cartridge is at the far left , while the .357 SIG is third from left . )
For both these cartridges , the bullet diameter is 9 millimeters .
Wikipedia notes that the common adult housefly is 6 - 9 millimeters long , and any detailed pest control website will tell you that the wingspan of such a housefly ranges from 12 - 15 millimeters .
This means that the wing of a single housefly , at most , is less than 7 millimeters .
Good luck blowing the wings off and leaving the fly intact , Wesley , no matter how supernaturally accurate a shot you are .

Among the nicknames attached to Arsène Wenger when he arrived at Arsenal , with his stopwatch , studious air , and what Tony Adams called " his boffin 's glasses " , was Le Professeur .
Little did Adams , Paul Merson and company know that , 12 years on , the French academic would be engaged in one of football 's most audacious experiments , with their club as the guinea pig .
When Arsenal committed themselves to moving from Highbury early this decade Wenger decided to embark on a bold , some would say suicidally naïve , venture .
In a rare interview this week he revealed : " When we decided to build the stadium I wanted to anticipate the possibility of financial restrictions , so I concentrated on youth .
I also felt the best way to create an identity with the way we play football , to get players integrated into our culture , with our beliefs , our values , was to get them as young as possible and to develop them together .
I felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities , and with a love for the club . "
He pauses , smiles wryly , and adds , " It was an idealistic vision of the world of football . "

This credo , which has never previously been expressed so clearly , has provided Arsenal fans with both delight and frustration .
There is pride among supporters at the club 's development of young players , and joy at the football they deliver , but there is also frustration at the lack of trophies .
The investment in the Emirates was supposed to provide Arsenal with the financial muscle to compete with Chelsea and Manchester United in the transfer market .
According to the recently departed director Keith Edelman it has .
He said there was £ 70 m available to Wenger .
If there is , it sits in the bank , gathering interest .
Another transfer window is about to close and Wenger , as usual , looks like roughly breaking even .
Last week he said he could spend £ 30 m on a player if he wanted to , but he does not need to .
Results this season will demonstrate whether that is the case or not , but the reality is Wenger does not want to .
This visionary is a stubborn one .
The board would clearly give Wenger whatever he asks for , even if it stretched the finances , but the economics graduate will only ask for £ 30 m in extremis .
Nor is he about to countenance a £ 135,000 - a- week contract even if Mathieu Flamini and Alexander Hleb have departed for better paid employment elsewhere , and Emmanuel Adebayor was evidently tempted to follow .
Wenger believes his team are already good enough to win one of his two targets , the Premier League or Champions League , but feels they will not peak for five or six years .
" The challenge we face is to keep them together , " he admits .
" It is very important to meet their needs inside the club , the way we play , the way we behave , with success on the field and in financial rewards .
If you can achieve that as a club you can keep them together .
I do n't feel at our club you have to make any other sacrifice than financial , because all the other aspects are better at our club than anywhere else . "
The financial sacrifice is , however , non-negotiable .
" I believe you need a wages structure , " says Wenger , " if you want to be fair with everybody , or try to be as fair as possible .
You could make the odd exception but you need a logic in the way you pay your players and in the way you structure the whole wages bill .
Personally , I do n't think it is right to lose £ 100 m and to play football .
I feel that the skill of a manager is to do the maximum with the resources he has and try to be successful .
I do n't believe that [ £ 100 m losses ] can last a long time , it will not be accepted , not only because it will implode [ if the benefactor pulls out ] . "
" If you do not balance the books you go bankrupt and die .
I could push the club into big debt .
I go away with success and the guy who comes after me suffers for five years because he cannot buy a player any more and the club goes down .
The guy who comes after me has good players he can work with , he has a healthy financial situation , and he has a club in good shape .
That is part of management as well . "
Elite footballers , obviously , already earn more than any normal person can spend but the same applies to stars in the financial world .
In football , as in the City , the biggest pay packets are not about spending power .
" It is more a status thing than the actual money , " says Wenger .
" The player compares himself to other players he thinks are on the same level , not because of the money , more for the respect for his own quality .
That is where meeting their needs comes in .
Money is only one fraction of the needs that a player has at a club .
On that front you can sometimes accept a small disadvantage knowing that the rest is superior . "
Wenger has done this himself , rejecting offers from clubs such as Real Madrid and Barcelona because he believes his working conditions at Arsenal could not be bettered elsewhere .
Only Sir Alex Ferguson 's tenure at Old Trafford now exceeds Wenger 's at Arsenal and , like the Scot , Wenger has steeped himself in , and deliberately abided by , the culture of the club .
" I feel if you come into a club as manager you have first to work out its specific qualities , " Wenger says .
" For me Arsenal is a club which tries to respect tradition , style , honesty , fair play .
If you come in and behave like a gangster you will not last long .
The supporters will be the first ones not happy with that .
A club needs values .
If a club has no values you go nowhere . "
Wenger 's own values come from his parents , Alphonse and Louise , who ran an auberge in the Alsace village of Duttlenheim when the young Arsène was growing up .
" Everyone is an extension of their parents , " he says .
" When you are very young you do not feel that the influence of your parents or your education is decisive .
The more you grow into your maturity you realise you feel you are only comfortable with yourself if you are respecting the values you got when you were a kid .
It takes you some time to discover that .
You feel independent , but when you look back at your life you find that what guides you is the values you got when very young .
Then you accept it .
" A trait of my parents I recognise in me is the belief that you work very hard and you shut up .
If you are good someone will see it .
You try to do as well as you can and , if you are honest and you work hard , you will be all right . "
We are speaking on an afternoon when Wenger 's faith in such natural justice has taken a blow .
Together with Cesc Fabregas , Manuel Almunia and Faye White , the captain of Arsenal Ladies , Wenger has been touring the Young Persons Unit at University College Hospital , London .
It is a prime example of the facilities developed by the Teenage Cancer Trust , which has been chosen by Arsenal this year to be their club charity .
The unit , from which Arsenal 's Emirates Stadium is visible , is exclusively for teenagers and Wenger has been taken aback by the sight of so many sick youngsters .
Cheerful as many appear in front of the Arsenal party , whose visit hugely overruns such is their popularity , their baldness , the cruel imprint of chemotherapy , reveals their true condition .
" Personally , it is a shock , " says Wenger .
" When you are used to seeing teenagers together in good health , to experience them together like this is difficult to take .
You do not expect them to be sick .
" What is very impressive is the team attitude to fight against cancer .
The children are brought together , the parents are brought together .
What comes out of that unit is , ' Let 's fight it together ' . "
Wenger inevitably recognised parallels with the mood in a successful squad , the same sense that , he says , " You can be stronger together . "
Wenger places great store by team spirit ; it is one of the benefits he hopes to realise by building a club from the youth ranks .
Maintaining it , however , requires a constant vigil .
" You check that every day that the team is bonded .
You try always to make sure it is integrated .
It is never guaranteed , and it is very fragile and vulnerable .
It can be upset by exterior factors or interior factors and can disintegrate very easily .
It is the skill of the manager to always assess it and to address the situation when needed .
A team is made of a collection of individuals .
Sometimes a few individuals feel they do not need to put their energy into the team as much , and think more about themselves .
That quickly has consequences for the team . "
Once Wenger balanced his squad between what he described as " an English block and a French block " .
Now his squad features 17 nationalities but there is one dominant accent .
The French core grew to six leading players with the acquisition of Mikaël Silvestre .
Is that a risk ?
" It is natural the same culture gets together .
If you yourself met some English people in Jamaica you will speak to them , you will have dinner together .
You can not fight against that because it is a lost fight .
If you have a dinner together you will choose the same kind of food .
It is a glue , it is part of you .
What you can fight for is to keep the communication going inside the team and make sure this does not go into a clique situation . "
The decline of " the English block " has been endlessly commented upon and , when pressed , Wenger addresses the subject wearily .
Yet while it is true that high hopes are being expressed for the rising generation of Jack Wilshere and Henri Lansbury , not forgetting Theo Walcott , it is only four years ago he sang the praises of Ryan Garry , Justin Hoyte and Ryan Smith .
All have since left the club .
" They were victims of the competition .
It is not a question of nationalities .
The Premier League today is a competition among the players of the whole world ; at the top clubs it is a competition among the top players of the whole world .
Of course that is detrimental to some English players and it will be tough for Wilshere and Lansbury , but if they make it they are world stars and you do not have many world stars in any academy , not now you can only recruit locally . "
In assessing a player Wenger says he looks for " intelligence , motivational level and talent " .
The first criterion would , to many cynics , rule out most English players but Wenger insists they were not lacking in this area .
He admitted they may seem under - educated compared to foreign players , not least because the English are inordinately impressed by anyone who speaks more than one language , but adds , " Do n't worry , the big players in England are intelligent . "
Maybe we just start too late .
In his first job , as a youth coach at Strasbourg , Wenger began taking a class of five - year - olds .
The club academy began at seven .
At the time English clubs were not allowed access to children until they were 14 .
After a few years the two groups in Strasbourg were compared .
The class which began at five had developed a technical advantage , says Wenger , which could not be bridged .
" You have to pause every 20 minutes as they cannot keep a longer focus , but the big row in the Olympics , about the gymnast who they said was only 12 , teaches you at 12 you can be technically at the top level in the world . "
But I ask , speaking as a father of a five - year - old , what can I teach him at that age ?
" To kick correctly the ball .
To put him in situations where he develops his skill .
The talent of a coach is to put an exercise to a player that he has to find the solution to .
If he does not , you teach him to do it better .
If the exercise is too easy , or too difficult , he will not learn .
And he has to find it out for himself .
What makes football special is you have a billion techniques .
It is not like in tennis where you hit the ball . "
Wenger demonstrates a low forehand .
Then , with more demonstration , he adds , " In football when you come to hit the ball you have someone pushing you on the top of your left shoulder , and you still have to keep your balance and hit the ball right .
At the start your basic movements have to be right , then you adapt . "
The first time I sat down with Wenger , 11 years ago , he was still new to the capital and I wondered what he had seen of one of the world 's great cities .
He said he knew only the journey to Heathrow , to Highbury , and the training ground .
I remind him of this and he smiles , almost sheepishly .
" You know , nothing has changed , except the way to the Emirates is slightly different to Highbury .
If someone says , ' Can you show me London ? '
I say , ' Buy a good guidebook and do it on your own ' . "
Is this sad , or admirable ?
What it confirms is that Wenger is one of the great football obsessives .
There is this perception that Ferguson is the football nut , hewn in the tenements of Govan and honed on the terraces of Ibrox .
Yet , compared to Wenger , the graduate from the Continent via Japan , Ferguson is a renaissance man , keenly interested in wine , art , the piano and horse racing .
Even with this hinterland Ferguson has found it hard to leave the game and Wenger you suspect will continue until his health gives way .
Now 58 , he has said he recognises the pressures of the job could cut short his life but it is a risk he will take to pursue " the only life he has wanted " .
He says , " Ten years ago I said to my wife [ Annie ] , ' Five more years and that 's all ' , and I am still here .
So now I do not want to make those statements any more .
I hope I will be strong enough to say one day ' that 's it ' , but I am more focused on beating Fulham [ today ] than my longer future .
" I can not imagine not working .
Fishing in the morning is not so much what I like .
It is a trap , this job , you are under high pressure , with big targets , but you can not imagine not having it .
That is not enough in itself , you must enjoy it .
At the moment I enjoy it , I am healthy and successful , and I hope that lasts . "
Inevitably the family – he has a daughter , Leah , approaching her teenage years – suffer .
" It is difficult to find time to see them but there are jobs [ which are worse ] .
You have guys who leave for work on Monday and come back on Friday .
In my job I travel , but the problem is not so much the quantity of time you spend with your family , it is the quality .
That is where this job is more damaging .
You do not always give them the quality they deserve when you are at home because you are thinking of the next game . "
Do the family share his passion ?
" My wife [ a former basketball Olympian ] likes watching football , she watches all the games of Arsenal at home .
She is not a fanatic but she likes watching sports .
No , she does not have much choice . "
The enigma that is Arsène
Nick Hornby
Arsène 's shadow has cast a gloom all the way up Seven Sisters Road [ which leads to Tottenham ] for quite a while now .
I and the vast majority of Arsenal fans have an enormous amount of faith in Wenger .
Melvyn Bragg
It 's lovely to watch Arsène 's Arsenal play .
When we 're flowing we 're terrific .
I rate Wenger – he's a very polite , well - mannered man , not forceful , though but sometimes you have to be a bit of a ruthless bastard .
Ferguson did the trick , very brutally , up at Man Utd and maybe Wenger should have been a bit more brutal .
I suspect he is a rather sentimental chap .
There 's no anger in what I 'm saying , I 'm just thinking that Wenger 's over - wary in some way .
But Wenger knows what he 's doing , and I think , on the whole , that he 's bought well .

I have faith that Arsène will deliver the FA Cup and tie up the Premier League again .
That would be just fantastic .
And I 'd love to be there when they do it .

Arsène Wenger has made a fantastic input in terms of style , I 'm happy to be patient and wait a year or two for some trophies if necessary .

When I came and made Robin Hood , I got invited to Arsenal as a guest .
I did n't know what to expect , I was very moved by the singing in the crowd .
I now follow Arsenal and I am a great admirer of Arsène Wenger .
I like the stylish football Arsenal play and that is down to the manager Arsène Wenger .

I started supporting Arsenal in the 1980s when I was living in the UK , they really sucked !
However , now they are great to watch and support playing beautiful football .
That is down to Arsène Wenger – and I think Arsenal fans could n't thank him enough .
The American musician , from The Offside Arsenal fan site
Piers Morgan
Arsène Wenger is the best manager Arsenal have ever had , and one of the top three or four in top - flight British football history ( along with Shankly , Clough and Ferguson ) .
Wenger is the Heston Blumenthal of managers – a quirky , studious , highly intelligent professor - type man , who believes in creating teams that have flair , surprise , flamboyance and breathtakingly high technical quality .
At Arsenal , the banners read " Arsène KNOWS " .
And that 's because he usually does .
I 've met him many times and he is a cultured , polite , amusing and entertaining character .
A rarity in football , trust me .

My other life
There is not much time for anything outside football but I do read books .
At the moment I am reading about Mossad , the Israeli secret service , which is interesting because they speak of Henri Paul [ the Frenchman who was driving the car in which Diana , Princess of Wales , was killed ] .
I do not see movies but on television I watch sport and documentaries about politics .
I have been watching the Olympics .
The British success is amazing because you have no structure here .
In France every village has sports facilities provided for the public , here there is hardly anything .
Where do they all train ?
In Paris there are 50 competitive swimming pools , in London two , and yet you got the 2012 Olympics .
Wenger and a humbling afternoon
Roger Daltrey , whose earnest , gentle nature around the Teenage Cancer Trust unit is wildly at odds with his past as a hellraising rocker with The Who , made the point that it was appropriate for Arsenal to be involved with the charity as , more than any English club , they have put their faith in youth .
That is down to Arsène Wenger who said he was humbled by what he had seen at the TCT 's unit at University College Hospital , London , on Thursday .
Wenger had joined Daltrey to launch Arsenal 's sixth Charity of the Season initiative .
Last season it raised £ 519,541 for Treehouse , the autism education charity , twice the target .
This season Arsenal hope to raise £ 300,000 towards an education zone within a new day centre at UCH .
This will enable teenagers to continue education while fighting the illness , and to receive treatment as day patients .
The guiding principle behind TCT is a desire for teenage cancer patients to be treated among their peers , rather than on wards largely populated by , in children 's hospital , infants .
Research shows this aids recovery .
Much consideration is given to the architecture in an attempt to make units appear more welcoming to young people .
This not only cheers those on the wards , but also encourages friends to visit .
" The most significant thing when you are sick is you are isolated , " said Wenger .
" If you are sick tomorrow the first thing is you will lie in your bed thinking , ' When will I be well again ? '
They have to face that for a year , or longer .
To have support is wonderful . "
Anthony Whitehead , a 21 - year - old in remission after suffering Hodgkin 's lymphoma , endured eight months of chemotherapy and several operations .
He was in an adult ward but discovered the TCT 's social programme towards the end of his treatment and now visits wards .
He said : " I feel jealous of the guys here .
I had no one to talk to .
I felt I was doing it all alone .
Here teenagers can help each other . "
Wenger added : " I believe a club has a social responsibility .
We are very conscious of that . "

The Russian news agency Pravda reports that George W. and Laura Bush will divorce after the upcoming 2008 elections .
Mrs. Bush will reportedly be paid $ 20 million for her silence should she divorce her husband .
Condoleezza Rice has been noted to be at the center of the dispute between the President and the First Lady .
Wayne Madsen , a national security expert , wrote in 2006 that George W. Bush confessed during a session with his psychologist that he was attracted to other women .
Bush reportedly named Condoleezza Rice as an object of his fantasies .
This was not the first time that Ms. Rice has been noted as a problem between the President and his wife .
In June , 2006 , NewsHounds reported that Mrs. Bush had checked into the Mayflower Hotel , several blocks from the White House , after a confrontation with her husband over his affair with Secretary of State Rice .
But that may not be the only problem between the President and his wife .
In April , 2007 , it was reported that the First Lady checked into the Hay - Adams Hotel due to Mr. Bush ’s inability to stop drinking , a problem he has had throughout much of his life .
On top of drunkenness and infidelity , Jeff Rense stated that Mr. Bush joined his compatriot Senator McCain in publicly calling his wife a c*nt .
The president was apparently inebriated at the time .
Our sources have witnessed a clearly inebriated Bush approaching members of the press corps and making rude comments , including one particularly crude remark about First Lady Laura Bush .
In that case , Bush , nodding toward Laura , called her a “ c **t . ”
Such a class act these Republicans are .
Family Values first and foremost .
Just ask David Vitter , Robert Allen , or Larry Craig .
Mmm , mmm , mmm !
I loves me some good old Republican Family Values !
Personally , I think Laura Bush has little desire to spend the rest of her days in Paraguay .
You read it on the Internet so it must be true .

McCain aide : NYT not legit news source
Steve Schmidt , a McCain campaign senior adviser , declared on a conference call with reporters Monday that The New York Times is " not ... a journalistic organization . ”
His lengthy broadside , prompted by an article Monday documenting ties between the campaign and lobbying for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , was the latest in a series of grievances with the Gray Lady that that aides to Sen.
John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) have aired publicly .

“ Whatever The New York Times once was , it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization , ” Schmidt said .
“ It is a pro-Obama advocacy organization that every day impugns the McCain campaign , attacks Sen. McCain , attacks Gov. [ Sarah ] Palin .
It excuse Sen. Obama . …
“ Everything that is read in The New York Times that attacks this campaign should be evaluated by the American people from that perspective — that it is an organization that has made a decision to cast aside its journalistic integrity and tradition , to advocate for the defeat of one candidate — in this case , John McCain — and to advocate for the election of the other candidate , Barack Obama . ”
Bill Keller , the newspaper 's executive editor , said in a statement of response : " The New York Times is committed to covering the candidates fully , fairly and aggressively .
It 's our job to ask hard questions , fact - check their statements and their advertising , examine their programs , positions , biographies and advisors .
Candidates and their campaign operatives are not always comfortable with that level of scrutiny , but it's what our readers expect and deserve . "
Bill Burton , the Obama campaign 's national press secretary , called Schmidt 's accusation laughable , and said the Times had published more than 40 " probing stories ... over the course of the campaign about Barack Obama , his life , his religion , his childhood , his politics , his time in the state Senate , his time in the U.S. Senate , his family , his religion , his friends , his fundraising and all other manner of associations . "
Burton attached a list of 42 citations , pasted below .
On Monday , the paper published an article on page A18 tying a McCain campaign manager , Rick Davis , to lobbying group set up by troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
When CNN ’s Dana Bash asked about the article , Schmidt unloaded .
“ Let me first say : We are First Amendment absolutists on this campaign , ” Schmidt said .
“ The press , and anybody who wishes to cover this race from the blogosphere perspective or from a media perspective , … of course is constitutionally protected with regard to writing … whatever they want to write .
But let ’s be clear and be honest with each other about something fundamental to this race . ”
Schmidt said that the Obama campaign has been “ abetted ” by a compliant media that gives more scrutiny to the Republican than to the Democrat .
Then , naming the Times , he said : “ There is no level of public vetting with Sen .
Obama ’s record , his background , his past statements .
There ’s no level of outrage directed at his deceitful ads .
This is an organization that is completely , totally , 150 percent in tank for the Democratic candidate , which is their prerogative to be .
But let ’s not be dishonest and call it something other than what it is . ”

George H.W. Bush warned us about “ voodoo economics ” in 1980 , but the ideologues clamped a gag on him and put him on the Gipper ’s ticket .
For much of the time since then , the madmen of the right have carried the day .
They were freed of their remaining few restraints with the ascendance of George W. Bush in 2000 .
These were the reckless clowns who led us into the foolish multitrillion - dollar debacle in Iraq and who crafted tax policies that enormously benefited millionaires and billionaires while at the same time ran up staggering amounts of government debt .
This is the crowd that contributed mightily to the greatest disparities in wealth in the U.S. since the gilded age .
This was the crowd that cut the cords of corporate and financial regulations and in myriad other ways gleefully hacked away at the best interests of the United States .
Now we ’re looking into the abyss .
When President Bush went on television last week to drum up support for the bailout package , he looked almost dazed , like someone who ’d just climbed out of an auto wreck .

“ Our entire economy is in danger , ” he said .
He should have said that he , along with his irresponsible Republican colleagues and their running buddies in the corporate and financial sectors , put the entire economy in danger .
John McCain and his economic main man , Phil ( “ this is a mental recession ” )
Gramm , were right there running with them .
Large corporations , universities , and research labs have relied on high - performance computers ( HPC ) -- or " supercomputers " -- for years to solve complex problems in science , engineering , financial modeling , and other similar uses requiring advanced , heavy - duty computations .
The high cost of these systems and their complexity have often kept them out of the hands of smaller companies , institutions , and departments that do n't have the budget or resources to purchase and maintain them .
Cray ( " The Supercomputer Company " - - yes , that supercomputer company ) in partnership with Microsoft , hope to rectify that with today 's announcement of an " affordable " supercomputer , the Cray CX1 .
Credit : Cray Inc .
" Affordable " is a relative concept , but with a starting price of $ 25,000 , the CX1 is notably less expensive than many of the $ 100,000 and up HPC systems available ( and some of them are even from Cray ) .
The CX1 is also designed to be installed into regular work environments , similar to any office computer .
The
Cray Blog
explains :
" Because the CX1 is purpose built for offices , laboratories and other non-traditional HPC environments , it requires no dedicated computer room , special power or cooling requirements .
The CX1 runs on power from a standard wall socket ( 20amp/110/220v ) .
This ability enables even the end user to have supercomputing power in their departmental environment .
To keep the system within comfortable noise levels there is an active noise cancellation system running .
The CX1 can simply be plugged in , set up and connected to the network , running just like a typical office computer . "
Cray envisions the CX1 finding a niche in industries such as digital media , earth sciences , financial services , and life sciences .
By partnering with Microsoft , Cray is able to sell the CX1 with Microsoft 's Windows HPC Server 2008 operating system ( OS ) .
Having a Microsoft - based OS should make it easier for companies to integrate the CX1 into existing Microsoft - based infrastructures -- especially in environments where businesses use Microsoft front - and back - ends , such as those based on the .NET framework or C# programming language .
The CX1 is also available with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS .
" The Cray CX1 product incorporates up to 8 nodes and 16 Intel Xeon processors , either dual or quad core ; delivers up to 64 gigabytes of memory per node ; and provides up to 4 terabytes of internal storage .
Systems can be configured with a mix of compute , storage and visualization blades to meet customers ' individual requirements . "
CX1 brochure ( Credit : Cray Inc. )
While the CX1 might not need a special server room to house it , its cost , weight , and size indicate that it 's probably best to not leave it just sitting on the floor next to a desk as the picture on the cover of Cray 's CX1 brochure shows it ( and with a rather poor copy - and - paste job at that ) .
The CX1's chassis measures 17.5 x 12.22 x 35.5 - inches ( HxWxD ) and weighs 136.6 pounds , fully loaded .
The unit comes with a hot - pluggable , 1,600 - watt power supply .
Other features include a front - mounted , touch screen LCD control panel ; 16 RJ - 45 10/100/1000 Mbps UTP ports ; InfiniBand DDr / QDR interconnects , Nvidia Quadro graphics , and RAID 0 , 1 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 50 support or up to eight SAS / SATA 2.5 - inch hard drives .
" Scientists at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at UCLA plan to use a Cray CX1 with Microsoft HPC Server 2008 for mathematical modeling and visualization .
This will support their development of advanced computational algorithms and scientific approaches for the comprehensive and quantitative mapping of brain structure and function . "
Certainly , not every small business needs an HPC system .
But for those that could benefit from this level of computational power , the CX1 lowers the barrier of entry with a lower cost , and familiar hardware and OS -- the CX1 is the first HPC Cray has offered that uses Intel processors and a Microsoft OS .
And even though the CX1 might occupy the bottom rung of the HPC ladder , Cray states that the " CX1 system would have ranked as one of the top 500 most powerful supercomputers in the world in 2004 . "
The thought of all this computational power makes us want to ask the question , " shall we play a game ? "

A cost -cutting NHS trust was condemned yesterday for allowing one nurse to run a busy hospital ward by herself for an entire shift .
The nurse , the only fully qualified member of the nursing team on duty , was forced to do jobs usually covered by up to seven nurses .
Health chiefs said ' unforeseen staff sickness ' caused the problem on the 30 - bed mixed general ward at Bridlington Hospital in East
Yorkshire over the last Bank
Holiday weekend .
Scroll down for more ...
But union leaders claim nursing
levels at the hospital are " critically
low " and are considering reporting
the Scarborough and North East
Yorkshire Healthcare NHS
Trust to
the professional standards body .
Iain McInnes , chief executive of
the Scarborough NHS Trust , said
the staffing incident happened
during one shift on Saturday .
He said : " Patient safety was not
compromised at any time during
the course of the shift period . "
But critics claim the debt - ridden
trust has been risking patient well - being
by cutting back on staff levels
to save money .
Greg Knight , Tory MP for East
Yorkshire , said : " This is totally
unacceptable .
Bridlington is atourist area and the population
rises during the summer months
and bank holidays , so this level of
nursing cover is quite shocking . "
He said the hospital 's problems
were all cash - related and that as a
relatively modern hospital the
services offered should be
" expanded , not cut back " .
Kevin Coyne , health spokesmanfor the Unite union , said : ' The nursing
levels at Bridlington Hospital
are critically low and we are
extremely worried about the impact
on the care of those on the wards .
" We are considering reporting the
matter to the Nursing and Midwifery
Council because we believe
this is unsafe practice . "
Last year , plans were announced
to downgrade Bridlington Hospital
by closing two acute medical wards
and transferring the six - bed cardiac
monitoring unit to a hospital 20
miles away .
The shake - up has been met by
fierce local opposition and in March
a 37,000 - signature petition calling
for the services to be saved was
handed in at Downing Street .
Mr Coyne added : " We believe it is
death by a thousand cuts because
the trust is intent on closing the
wards in question .
" Clearly the wards are understaffed
at the moment and they
intend moving services to Scarborough .
We believe that is wrong . "
A spokesman for the NHS Trustsaid of the Bank Holiday incident :
" There was a site coordinator and if
required she could have very easily
transferred some nurses from other
wards across to that ward . "
Only last year the trust shelved
plans to axe 600 jobs – one third of
its workforce – when the strategic
health authority agreed to write
off the bulk of its £ 12 million debt .
Despite imposing a recruitment
freeze , last month the trust advertised
17 finance posts with a combined
annual wage bill of around
£ 450,000 , said to be necessary to
secure the organisation 's future .
Comic Relief Should Group Sex Be Public Art ?
A new sculpture in a southern German town square has tourists snapping pictures and politicians arguing about the role of public art .
The work shows Angela Merkel naked , along with other politicians , and the artist is unapologetic .
He calls the work his " group - sex relief . "
This is a guest post by Dan Zarrella , social and viral marketing scientist .
He has put together a viral content sharing report and below is an expansion and exploration of some of the data uncovered by that report .
The research I did on viral content sharing shows that frequent users of social web technologies like Twitter , blogs , and social news and networking sites tend to share online content with more people , more often than those that do not .
This means that for marketers these users can be a powerful vector for making content go viral .
While this may sound like some what of a “ duh ” statement , the concept of “ influencers ” has been much debated recently .
While there is data that individuals give more attention to content passed to them from friends as opposed to A - list bloggers , the fact still remains that there are segments of users who spread content more prolifically than the rest .
And by their very nature as savvy social media users , these viewers engage in online activity that makes them easy to target .
We know that people who read Digg , Reddit , Propeller and the like tend to have higher viral reach and sharing frequency than those who do not , so make sure your content appears on these sites .
The same applies to those who read blogs , and use Twitter .
When it comes time to seed your content , be sure to put it in the path of these extra-contagious users .
An interesting detail of this data is that while frequent users of Facebook and web forums share content with more people and more often in some aspects , generally they ’re not as virulent as the users of less - mainstream technologies ( with the exception of blog readers ) .
This may be due to the fact that users of sites like Twitter and Digg tend to be early adopters , as opposed to the less - geeky Facebook audience ; which seems to indicate that geeks share more content online than non-geeks .
When I segmented these high reach and frequency users , I found that they displayed useful preference trends .
When compared to average web users they share more content via IM as opposed to email or Facebook messaging , and they share more news and opinion than humor .
When these users share content one - to - one with their friends , they prefer blogs and social news sites to mainstream sites , but that aversion to mainstream media disapears when they share in a one - to - many fashion ( broadcast sharing like submitting to Digg , blogging and Tweeting ) .
Again as these users are important viral seeding vectors , we should listen to their preferences and give them news or opinion with short , clean links ideal for instant messaging , and lay off the “ funny ” email chain letters .
This is a small part of the large data presented in the full report I did on the results of my survey , if you want to know more , be sure to read the rest of my viral content sharing report .

TEL AVIV | Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he would resign from office after his Kadima party chooses a successor in a vote set for September , conceding that corruption investigations have eroded his mandate to govern .
The unexpected address to the nation , delivered from his residence in Jerusalem , spurred calls from opposition lawmakers for new parliamentary elections .
It also exposed the current talks with the Palestinians and Syria to criticism that Mr. Olmert has no mandate to negotiate peace agreements .
“ I ’ve decided not to compete in the Kadima primary , ” he said .
“ When there is a new chairman of Kadima , I will step down . ”
Despite the announcement , Mr. Olmert said he would continue to pursue peace talks until his last days in office .
In Washington , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with the chief Israeli and Palestinian negotiators , who said they would work as hard as it takes to reach an agreement for establishing a Palestinian state by year ’s end .
“ The issues are difficult , and they have always been difficult .
There is nothing surprising in that , but … the goal remains the same , ” Miss Rice told reporters after the meeting , which she called “ very fruitful . ”
Saeb Erekat , an aide to Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia , said , “ as Palestinians , we want to make peace with all Israelis , not with this party or that person . ”
Ori Nir , spokesman for Americans for Peace Now , a pro-Israel organization that promotes Arab - Israeli negotiations , called for “ responsibility and moderation ” in Israel ’s dealings with its neighbors during this time of political uncertainty .
“ This period calls for responsibility and moderation .
It calls for Israel ’s leaders to refrain from provocative moves in the West Bank , such as settlement expansion , and to refrain from adventurous , belligerent actions on Israel ’s other fronts - Iran , Lebanon and Syria , ” he said .
Mr. Olmert ’s decision shifts attention to Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz , the two leading candidates in the Kadima party leadership battle , and whether they ’ll be able hold together the coalition in a vote of confidence .
The decision is in the hands of about 70,000 registered members of the centrist party , set up in 2005 by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon .
Polls , which once favored Mrs. Livni , seem to be shifting toward Mr. Mofaz - a former army chief of staff who is thought to be backed by Mr. Olmert .
“ It ’s very difficult to say .
It ’s not clear what ’s going on in Kadima , ” said Hebrew University political science professor Gabriel Sheffer .
“ Some people say Mofaz has the advantage , and some people say it ’s Livni . ”
While Mrs. Livni is considered more dovish , Mr. Mofaz is known as a security hawk .
Whoever wins will have a grace period of about a month to shore up commitments from new coalition partners and form a government .
If they fail , Israeli law requires elections within 90 days .
Such a scenario would favor center - right Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu , who , according to a public opinion poll conducted by Israel ’s Channel 10 News , enjoys a wide advantage over Mrs. Livni or Mr. Mofaz , and over Defense Minister Ehud Barak , the leader of the center - left Labor Party .
That would also leave Mr. Olmert in office - albeit , as a lame duck - through the fall .
Many analysts cautioned that Israeli political parties , with the exception of the opposition Likud party , are opposed to elections in 2009 .
In office since January 2006 , Mr. Olmert in recent months became the focus of a corruption investigation that prompted a growing number of political allies to call for his resignation .
Mr. Olmert conceded to the September primary election as a concession to his critics , and until Wednesday it was unclear whether Mr. Olmert would be a candidate .
The corruption inquiries , which centered on $ 150,000 he accepted from a U.S. businessman , exposed the Israeli prime minister to accusations that his positions in negotiations were calculated to deflect criticism from the accusations .
Even Arab negotiators in Syria and the Palestinian Authority had remarked that Mr. Olmert ’s political capital had sunk so low that he was no longer a suitable partner for negotiations .
“ Every day , the burden of finishing work is enormous , ” said Tel Aviv University political science professor Gideon Doron .
“ It does n’t matter if the accusations are unfounded ; he has had to fight more and more and more .
It was like a tsunami .
He lost his base of legitimacy . ”

Home prices are in free fall .
Unemployment is rising .
Consumer confidence is plumbing depths not seen since 1980 .
When will it all end ?
The answer is , probably not until 2010 or later .
Barack Obama , take notice .
It ’s true that some prognosticators still expect a “ V - shaped ” recovery in which the economy springs back rapidly from its slump .
On this view , any day now it will be morning in America .
But if the experience of the last 20 years is any guide , the prospect for the economy is n’t V - shaped , it ’s L-ish : rather than springing back , we ’ll have a prolonged period of flat or at best slowly improving performance .
Let ’s start with housing .
According to the widely used Case - Shiller index , average U.S. home prices fell 17 percent over the past year .
Yet we ’re in the process of deflating a huge housing bubble , and housing prices probably still have a long way to fall .
We are back from Florida !
The vacation was excellent and much - needed , and now I am happily back to work as usual .
Man I missed my Cintiq .
See you tomorrow !
Bush signs housing bill in private , after calling it ' socialistic ' John Byrne
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008
Print This Email This
In a seeming effort to blunt attention to the fact he was signing a bill he once rebuked as socialistic , President George W. Bush quietly approved a massive mortgage rescue bill shortly after 7 a.m. in the Oval Office and announced his signature by email .
" Only a few aides and administration officials were present , including Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Steve Preston and James B. Lockhart III , the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) , " Politico 's Mike Allen remarked .
" The White House announced the signing by e-mail moments later . "
A senior Bush official told Allen the Administration had no desire to herald the Democrats who shepherded the bill through their congressional committees , Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D - CT ) and Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) .
Typically bills are accompanied by a signing ceremony , replete with souvenir pens .
" Bush initially vowed to veto the bill as being overly socialistic , " Allen notes .
" He finally dropped his objection when he decided that it was better than nothing .
In a rare split , House Republicans opposed the bill and business interests like home builders and bankers favored it . "
The White House had said there would be no bill - signing event , with one administration official noting ruefully that they had no desire to trumpet
The measure , regarded as the most significant housing legislation in decades , lets homeowners who cannot afford their payments refinance into more affordable government - backed loans rather than losing their homes .
It offers a temporary financial lifeline to troubled mortgage companies Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) and tightens controls over the two government - sponsored businesses .
The House passed the bill a week ago ; the Senate voted Saturday to send it to the president .
Bush did n't like the version emerging from Congress , and initially said he would veto it , particularly over a provision containing $ 3.9 billion in neighborhood grants .
He contended the money would benefit lenders who helped cause the mortgage meltdown , encouraging them to foreclose rather than work with borrowers .
But he withdrew that threat early last week , saying hurting homeowners could not wait - and even blaming the Democratic Congress ' delays in action for forcing an imperfect solution .
 We look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets , and to provide better oversight for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement .
" The Federal Housing Administration will begin to implement new policies intended to keep more deserving American families in their homes . 

Good God , the Republican Party takes the second highest office in the land very seriously , do n't they ?
First , they play the experience standard with Obama and then seem surprised that we would question it with the choice of the political neophyte Sarah Palin .
She has LOTS of executive experience , Cindy McCain would like you to know .
After all , she was President of the PTA ... and then mayor and then governor .
My gosh , what more do you need ?
From Wikipedia
( I know about its credibility , but Palin 's scrubbers have made sure that it 's very positive , so if anything , it 's giving her more credit )
In 2006 , Palin was sworn in as the 11th governor of Alaska , becoming the first woman and youngest person to hold the office .
She defeated incumbent governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary and former Democratic governor Tony Knowles in the general election .
Palin served two terms on the Wasilla , Alaska , city council from 1992 to 1996 , then served two terms as mayor of Wasilla from 1996 to 2002 .
After an unsuccessful campaign for lieutenant governor of Alaska in 2002 , she chaired the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission from 2003 to 2004 while also serving as Ethics Supervisor of the commission .
Yeah , that 's a whopper of a resume : four years on city council , six years as Mayor , one year as an oil commissioner and 18 months as Governor .
How silly of us to not see it .
Far be it for me to mention that she could n't pass 18 months as Governor without triggering an abuse of position investigation , something that also plagued her years as mayor of Wasilla , population 6,715 .
But then Cindy really goes off the deep end and channels that deep thinker , FOX & Friends Steve Doocy , and touts Alaska 's physical proximity to Russia as evidence that she understands the world scene .
And , also , remember , Alaska is the closest part of our continent to Russia .
So it 's not as if she does n't understand what 's at stake here .
* Double take * Huh ????
I guess for the wife of the man who does n't remember that there is no shared border between Iraq and Pakistan , this would seem logical .
Please tell me that there are n't that many low information voters that buy that line .

STEPHANOPOULOS :
You know what Democrats are saying .
It 's a desperate choice .
She 's just not ready to serve as commander - in - chief .
C. MCCAIN : No , no , no .
I completely disagree , and I know my husband does , too .
She is heavily experienced in what she has done .
She was -- she started out like everybody else -- a member of the PTA , small government at home , then a mayor , now the governor .
She comes with the kind of experience behind her .
And also , I might add , a son who is about to deploy to Iraq .
She comes with say more experience than ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What did you tell her about that ?
Because , of course , you have a son ...
C. MCCAIN : Yes , I did .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... serving .
C. MCCAIN : I did .
I asked her , you know , how do you feel about this ?
Are you -- you know , this is two things you have to do , is not only possibly be a vice presidential candidate , but also , you know , listen , to worry about your son .
And she looked me square in the eye and she said , " You know something ?
I 'm a mother .
I can do it . "
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But she has no national security experience .
C. MCCAIN : You know , she -- the experience that she comes from is with what she 's done in the government .
And , also , remember , Alaska is the closest part of our continent to Russia .
So it 's not as if she does n't understand what 's at stake here .

If Bush and Cheney attack Iran , we will almost certainly know it 's coming .
For months prior to the invasion of Iraq , even while the corporate media bombarded us with the pretense that Bush and Cheney had not yet decided on war , other stories further back in the pages of newspapers and on the internet informed us , or should have informed us , that an attack was coming .
Many of these stories involved the deployment of troops .
( We were told that they were deploying " in case " there was to be a war . )
With so many troops already in the area now , and with the attack on Iran likely not to include ground forces , we may not see the same volume of reports of this sort .
Still , it is unlikely that no troops will let the word slip that an attack is really coming .
During the lead - up to the invasion of Iraq , there were also stories about weapons production .
Long before shocking and aweing Iraq with all those bombs , a major increase in bomb production and conversion to " smart bombs " was needed .
This ought to be the case with Iran as well .
Has anyone checked ?
There were also numerous reports on the military 's plans for attacking Iraq and ( primitive and delusional as they were ) plans for the post - war occupation .
We have seen reports on plans to attack Iran , but not reports of military commanders putting them into place , no reports on plans for a post - apocalypse Iran , and no reports on anything like the rehearsal war games in Qatar that preceded the Iraq attack .
The most telling reports prior to March 19 , 2003 , were those on statements made by the Bush - Cheney gang .
They plastered the insides of our brains with the idea that the United States would have to reluctantly demolish Iraq if Saddam Hussein did not destroy the weapons he had long ago destroyed .
Informed Americans knew that Bush and Cheney were knowingly demanding the impossible .
Every statement they made about the closing of the window for avoiding war was an obvious announcement that war was coming .
The marketing of an attack on Iran has not reached the ultimatum stage .
No series of events have been set up that can compel the White House to " reluctantly " launch another genocide .
Certainly , we 've seen the same sorts of justifications attempted , but they have not progresses to anything like the point they did before the invasion of Iraq .
Unless a provocation from Iran can be created or pretended , it seems unlikely the United States will attack Iran with the marketing campaign for such an attack still in such a premature state .
Of course , we learned a lot about the fraudulent campaign for an attack on Iraq after the fact .
But here is some of what we knew prior to March 19 , 2003 , that should have made us aware what was coming .

Press Releases
SunTrust Bank Acquires the Insured Deposits of First Priority Bank , Bradenton , Florida
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 1 , 2008 Media Contacts :
Andrew Gray ( Cell : 202-494-1049 )
David Barr ( Cell : 703-622-4790 ; Office : 202-898-6992 )
First Priority Bank , Bradenton , Florida , was closed today by the Commissioner of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) was named receiver .
To protect the depositors , the FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with SunTrust Bank , Atlanta , Georgia , to assume the insured deposits of First Priority .
The six branches of First Priority will reopen on Monday as branches of SunTrust Bank .
Depositors of the failed bank will automatically become depositors of SunTrust .
Deposits will continue to be insured by the FDIC , so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance coverage .
For the time being , however , customers of both banks should use their existing branches until SunTrust can fully integrate the deposit records of First Priority .
Over the weekend , customers of First Priority can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards .
Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed .
Loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual .
As of June 30 2008 , First Priority had total assets of $ 259 million and total deposits of $ 227 million .
At the time of closing , there were approximately $ 13 million in uninsured deposits held in approximately 840 accounts that potentially exceeded the insurance limits .
This amount is an estimate that is likely to change once the FDIC obtains additional information from these customers .
Customers with accounts in excess of $ 100,000 should contact the FDIC toll free at 1-800- 837-0215 to set up an appointment to discuss their deposits .
This phone number will be operational this evening until 9:00 p.m. EDT ; on Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EDT ; and on Sunday and thereafter from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EDT .
In addition to continued access to their insured deposits , depositors of First Priority with amounts exceeding the insurance limits will receive a payment of 50 percent of their uninsured balance from the FDIC as receiver .
The FDIC will mail these payments directly to the customers early next week ; the amounts will not appear in their account balances at SunTrust Bank .
Customers who would like more information on today 's transaction should visit the FDIC's Web site at http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/firstprioritybank.html.
Beginning Monday , depositors of First Priority with more than $ 100,000 at the bank may visit the FDIC's Web page , " Is My Account Fully Insured ? " at https://closedbanks.fdic.gov/drrip/AFI/Search to determine their insurance coverage
SunTrust agreed to assume the insured deposits for no premium .
In addition to assuming the failed bank 's insured deposits , SunTrust Bank will purchase approximately $ 42 million of the failed bank 's assets .
The assets are comprised mainly of cash , cash equivalents and securities .
The FDIC , however , entered into a separate agreement with LNV Corporation , Plano , Texas , to purchase $ 14 million in First Priority 's assets .
LNV Corporation is a subsidiary of Beal Bank Nevada , Las Vegas , Nevada .
The FDIC will retain the remaining assets for later disposition .
The cost to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund is estimated to be $ 72 million .
First Priority is the first bank to fail in Florida since Guaranty National Bank , Tallahassee , on March 12 , 2004 .
This year , a total of eight FDIC - insured institutions have been closed .
# # #
Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to restore public confidence in the nation 's banking system .
The FDIC insures deposits at the nation 's 8,494 banks and savings associations and it promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions by identifying , monitoring and addressing risks to which they are exposed .
The FDIC receives no federal tax dollars – insured financial institutions fund its operations .
FDIC press releases and other information are available on the Internet at www.fdic.gov, by subscription electronically ( go to www.fdic.gov/about/subscriptions/index.html) and may also be obtained through the FDIC's Public Information Center ( 877-275-3342 or 703-562-2200 ) .
PR-65-2008
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush if that bush is a pricker bush .
And only if people actually want birds , not bushes .
People offered the banknote believed , on average , that they could use it to buy 83 paperclips , 72 napkins or 46 sweets .
Those offered the coin thought 39 paperclips , 51 napkins or 27 sweets .
In other words , the note was believed to be almost twice as valuable as the coin .
I . The Economist describes a study in Psychonomic Bulletin and Review which people were given a regular dollar or a Susan B . Anthony dollar , and asked to estimate the cost of napkins , candy , etc.
Similar results were obtained using two one - dollar bills vs. one two - dollar bill .
This should n't be surprising , however , when this exact ( reverse ) principle explains why casinos use chips , arcades use tokens -- and why credit card debt is so easy to get into .
The authors explain this to be a funcition of familiarity -- familiarity holds more value .
II .
But there 's a little more to it .
The mistake is to interpret these results as indicating , e.g , the dollar bill above is believed to be able to buy 83 paperclips or 72 napkins , etc -- that the dollar bill is believed by people to have a certain value .
False .
To prove this , ask someone how many paperclips would it take to buy 72 napkins ?
The answer should be 83 .
But most likely , they 'll just look at you blankly .
They have no idea what the exchange rate is .
Notice how with the Susan B dollar , opposite to the paper dollar , paperclips were worththan the napkins .
There 's a difference between use value and exchange value .
Napkins and paperclips have considerable use value that you feel , instinctively , but nearly no exchange value ( i.e. you do n't trade them for other stuff . )
Money is the exact opposite .
Trying to convert exchange value for use value in a back and forth line is hard enough ; trying to do it in a triangle with three objects is nearly impossible .
Marx had hoped that the use value of an object would be the amount of labor embodied in it , but of course that is even intuitively wrong .
The use value of the napkin has absolutely no relationship whatsoever to its labor content ; if the labor to make paperclips increased , the napkin holder would have no way of quantifying it to alter the exchange value .
Because he does n't care how much labor went into it .
Use value is entirely subjective .
Consider theof money ( currency . )
Many people devalue the penny ( e.g. throw it in the trash , ) even though some argument can be made that the copper alone is worth keeping .
Labor theory would make the intrinsic value of a penny higher than a nickel .
( cost of copper is higher , but labor to make coins is mostly the same . )
But yet , it 's tossed .
Or , the reverse case with quarters .
You may have a dollar , but you 'd very likely trade that dollar for three quarters if you needed to fill a parking meter .
The quarter itself suddenly has value beyond its denomination , and you may value it anywhere from $.25 to $ 2.00 , depending on the circumstance .
The reason is this : the value ofhaving a quarter is 100x , or $ 25 -- the cost of a parking ticket .
This value is not transitory ; to any regular city parker , the quarter almostcarries more value than $.25 , even though -- and this is precisely the point -- the higher value of the quarter cannot be reflected in the economy at all , ever .
Try buying a $ 1 coffee with the three quarters you just traded for a dollar .
The price of oil , $ 118 , in the face of falling refinery output and comparatively calm international relations , suggests that the price of oil has less to do with demand or supply , and more to do with something else -- in this case , the falling dollar .
If you do not grasp this , if you do not feel this in your bones , you will always be a wage - slave .
It is absolutely no different than picking a spouse , who I am sure you feel is the perfect mate for you , while another person scratches their head and says , " what the hell does that nut see in that other nut ? "
The key to making money is not working harder , or smarter , or investing , or anything else .
The simple , one koan key is to understand that things have different values , to different people .
And I hope it is clear that this does n't apply only to money .
But anyone who understands this has the ability to exploit this .
Ultimately , you get to choose who you are .
Choose .
OK , a correspondent directs me to John McCain ’s article , Better Health Care at Lower Cost for Every American , in the Sept. / Oct. issue of Contingencies , the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries .
You might want to be seated before reading this .
Here ’s what McCain has to say about the wonders of market - based health reform :
Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition , as we have done over the last decade in banking , would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state - based regulation .
So McCain , who now poses as the scourge of Wall Street , was praising financial deregulation like 10 seconds ago — and promising that if we marketize health care , it will perform as well as the financial industry !
Good news !
I delivered the sixth and final episode of series 3 this morning .
With only three weeks till we begin location filming , that ’s cutting it pretty fine , but the scripts seem to be in good shape so I ’m only waking up in a cold sweat three times a night rather than seven .
That said , they still need work .
So I wo n’t have enough time to contribute as much as I would like to the look of the show .
Normally , when I ’m finished the scripts , I lovingly pore over T - shirt sites and visit comic shops as ‘ research ’ .
This time , that ’s just out of the question .
Which is what brings me to you guys …
How would you like to help in designing the look of series 3 ?
Specifically , you ’d be helping us choose the stuff that litters the main set .
I ’m talking about posters , comics , fanzines , T - shirts … anything you ’ve seen in the last few months that you think is pretty cool or captures the spirit of the show or a particular character .
By now , most of you know the kind of things I like …weird toys , indie comics , sci-fi , geek references , internet memes , boardgames … normally I ’d delight in tracking down the stuff myself , but as I say , it ’s just not going to happen this time round .
In the very first draft of the show I described the set as looking like “ a cross between a comics shop and the batcave ” .
I wanted it to feel like a geek Shangri - La , and in each series I ’ve felt we nearly got there .
Maybe this time , with you guys involved , we ’ll finally nail it .
Please send your suggestions to ben.capel@talkbackthames.tv
We also need to get legal permission to use the stuff , and we need to get it fast , so please include as much information as you can regarding contact details etc etc .
Wow .
This is interesting .
I wonder how it ’ll go ?
George Stephanopoulos followed up on Friday night and asked John McCain a little bit about his health care plan this morning .
Specifically , he wanted to know if it ’s true McCain plans to tax your health care benefits at work as if they ’re salary .
Not only is it true – very , very true – but you ’re not getting the full story .
McCain says he ’ll give you a $ 2500 / $ 5000 ( individual / family ) tax credit to go out and buy your own insurance instead .
Sounds great , but do you know how much insurance costs these days ?
Overall , premiums for family coverage increased to $ 12,680 and premiums for single coverage increased to $ 4,704 , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust .
Employers pick up , on average , about three - quarters of that cost .
Guess who gets to pay the difference if you want to keep the coverage you ’ve got ?
Got an extra few thousand dollars laying around ?
Me neither .
So you go out and buy a cheaper plan because it ’s all you can afford now , and you just hope to G -d you do n’t get sick .
Because those cheap plans cover nothing and come with high deductibles , higher co-pays , and so much fine print that you ’re going to have the equivalent of the subprime mortgage crisis in health care .
A lot of very sick people who cannot afford to pay their bills and who did n’t know their health insurance plan was crap .
Here ’s the exchange from This Week .
It ’s not what McCain says .
It ’s what he does n’t say that matters :
STEPHANOPOULOS :
One of the other points he made in the debate that you were n’t able to respond to in the debate , he said that , for the first time ever , you would tax health benefits by taking away the deduction that employers now get to provide health benefits .
MCCAIN : Right — this all began during World War II with price and wage controls .
And employers then , because they could n’t give them pay raises , gave them increased health benefits .
Now , my plan gives $ 5,000 tax — refundable tax credit for every family in America .
That , for small — a lot — many — huge number of small - business people is a great step forward because they do n’t provide health insurance for their employees .
They can’t , and they ca n’t afford it .
This will , actually , by giving the — the worker and the family tax credits , they ’ll be able to go out and then select their own health care insurance .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But even — but several …
MCCAIN : And we will be able to then make sure that they ’re able to get the lowest cost , most available , most effective health insurance .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But several studies have shown that , for people who now get their health care through employers , this could be a tax increase over time .
And your own economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , told the New York Times , said the campaign cannot yet project how many taxpayers might see their taxes go up , but for some , Mr. McCain ’s health care tax credits would not be large enough to compensate for his proposal to eliminate the tax breaks .
MCCAIN : Actually , my position is that it will be able to give people actually more money to go out and purchase tax — health — health insurance on their own .
And only those with the Cadillac , gold - plated health insurance policies today are the ones who might suffer from it , the ones …
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So they would see their taxes go up , potentially ?
MCCAIN : It depends on — on what plan they have , but that ’s usually the wealthiest people .
Ordinary working Americans have the kind of — or overwhelming majority of them have the health insurance plans that this tax credit , refundable tax credit will actually put more money in their pockets for purchase of health care than what they had before .
McCain is so out of touch with how everyday people live and what everyday people pay that he thinks his plan is a gift .
It is .
Just not for us .
Merry Christmas , insurance industry .
Israel 's Lopsided Legal System Joharah Baker ' When it comes to Palestinians , different standards are applied . '
August 5 , 2008
Israel 's policy of demolishing Palestinian homes is nothing new .
Since the inception of the occupation in 1967 , thousands of Israeli military orders have been handed to Palestinians informing them of the imminent destruction of their houses .
The reasons � or excuses � for this destructive policy are many : involvement in resistance against the Israeli occupation [ known as " terror " to Israel ] , illegal construction , or for " urban planning " [ i.e. , when the decades - old home and surrounding land is in the way of a new Jewish settlement in the West Bank or east Jerusalem ] .
So , Israeli government plans to demolish the homes of Palestinians living in Jerusalem because they were involved in attacks against Israelis , hardly raises eyebrows .
Not because this punitive measure is not cruel or inhumane but because Israel has never been known for its overly humane treatment of the Palestinians under its occupation .
Still , Israel continues to take the world for a fool � at least the Palestinians � when it feigns legality when debating the issue of demolishing Palestinian homes in Jerusalem .
This week , Israeli government officials say they are close to overcoming the legal hurdles necessary to get approval to demolish the home of ' Ala Abu Dheim , the east Jerusalem resident who gunned down eight yeshiva students last March .
The orders to demolish the homes of the two men who ploughed through Israeli traffic with their bulldozers earlier this month is still pending .
Of course all three men were killed on the spot by Israeli police .
At no time did Israeli security officers try to apprehend the men and actually give them their fair day in court , which is the usual procedure in democratic countries .
Israel 's ' shoot to kill ' attitude has become the run of the mill , all in the name of security .
Children playing ball in the vicinity of the border between Gaza and Israel were shot at and killed because patrolling soldiers believed they were " terrorists " trying to infiltrate into Israel .
The point here is that Israel still feels obligated to use the justification of legality when it carries out these highly illegal acts even though in reality , legality is the last consideration .
Besides , in what civilized country is demolishing the home of a criminal considered " legal " and not inhumane collective punishment ?
When Baruch Goldstein sprayed a Hebron mosque with bullets , gunning down 29 Muslims kneeling in prayer , Israeli bulldozers hardly rushed to tear down his home in the settlement of Kiryat Arba .
When an Israeli F - 16 fighter plane dropped a 500 - pound bomb on a Gaza apartment building , destroying the homes of several families and killing at least 16 people , the pilot did not have to worry about his family losing the roof over their heads because of his terror - filled act .
Even if we move out of the murky waters of Israeli / Palestinian politics , this brutal form of collective punishment is unprecedented in other parts of the civilized world , at least against its own citizens .
While the Oklahoma City bomber , Timothy McVeigh who was held responsible for the deaths of 168 people was arrested and later sentenced to death , his family 's home is still standing .
The punishment was meted out against the perpetrator only ; the way it should be .
However , when it comes to Palestinians , different standards are applied .
While Israel claims such punitive measures are meant as a deterrent to further attacks against Israelis , the real purpose is plain and simple : punish the Palestinians , even if they have nothing to do with the crime .
On a more massive scale , this is the policy the United States undertook post - September 11 , 2001 .
We all know Israel takes its cue from the US , or vice versa .
Following the Twin Tower and Pentagon attacks which took the lives of almost 3,000 Americans , the US , or President George W. Bush and his cronies , decided someone had to pay .
Of course those who actually carried out the attacks were already dead and the elusive mastermind behind it is still at large .
That did not stop Bush from forcing whole nations pay the price for the lives of innocent Americans .
Thousands were killed in the bombings in Afghanistan and thousands more in Iraq , with the body count still rising .
Of course there are several other factors at play here besides the declared purpose of catching Osama Bin Laden , first and foremost , western dominance in the Middle East .
Still , the similarities are chilling .
When Israel invades the entire Gaza Strip , killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the name of one Israeli soldier , is this any different from Bush 's gung - ho attitude ?
Hardly .
In Rafah , the Israeli army forces razed approximately 1,500 homes over four years , predominantly to close smuggling tunnels from Egypt and to create a buffer zone between Gaza and the Egyptian border .
In this case , Israel did not even bother with legal channels given that the residents were Palestinian Gazans [ as opposed to Israeli - ID Jerusalemites ] and because like in all other Israeli arguments , defending their security trumps all .
East Jerusalemites � and Palestinians as a whole � face these discriminative , racist - at - heart punishments every day .
Only because they are Palestinian , and in comparison , only because the 9/11 bombers were Arab and Muslim � were these extreme measures taken .
In both cases , whether it was the Bush administration or the Israeli government , the attitude is one of arrogance and superiority .
That is , because they are the US and Israel , this gives them a carte blanche to act with impunity .
Any other less influential country would have been criticized or even forcefully stopped by the so - called international community for similar transgressions .
We all remember when Saddam Hussein foolishly decided to enter Kuwait and " occupy " it .
That occupation did n't last 40 days much less 40 years .
So , when the Israeli media reports that the " legal obstacles " preventing the demolition of ' Ala Abu Dheim 's house " had been removed " and that the demolition of the other two Palestinian homes was still up against " legal difficulties " , it is clear this is part of a more comprehensive master - plan for the Palestinians in general and for Jerusalem in particular .
Israel , and even America , hardly worries about the fact that they have blatant double - standards or that their actions come across as racist .
This is not to justify violent acts against any party , whether Palestinian or Israel because it is a well - known fact that violence only begets more violence .
However , in the occupied territories , only Palestinian violence against Israelis merits such extreme reactions .
It is not only a punishment for the families of those who carried out the attacks but a reminder to all Palestinians that even a flicker of resistance against Israel will not be tolerated .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Hispanic registered voters ' support for Barack Obama for president remained consistent and strong in June , with Obama leading John McCain by 59 % to 29 % among this group .
While Hispanics generally preferred Hillary Clinton to Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination , a solid majority of Hispanics have consistently backed Obama against McCain in general - election trial heats .
Obama has led McCain by about a 2 - to - 1 margin since Gallup began tracking general - election voting preferences in early March .
Gallup has interviewed more than 4,000 Hispanic registered voters during this time period .
An analysis of candidate support by subgroup within the U.S. Hispanic electorate reveals that many of the well - established divisions in this year 's campaign -- such as the gender gap and the marriage gap -- are weak or nonexistent among Hispanic voters .
Rather , Hispanics of differing demographic backgrounds all tend to solidly support Obama .
It thus appears that there is n't much beyond a shared Hispanic ethnicity or identity that explains Hispanic voting patterns .
Perhaps the only exceptions to this general pattern come among the minority of Hispanic voters who identify themselves as Republicans ( 18 % ) or who say they have conservative political views ( 36 % ) .
McCain leads Obama among Hispanic Republicans , and is about even with him among Hispanic conservatives .
In an election pitting one of the younger recent presidential candidates against one of the older ones , candidate preferences by age group have varied .
Differences in the Hispanic vote by age , however , are fairly small .
While younger Hispanic voters show greater support for Obama than for McCain , support for McCain increases only slightly among older Hispanics .
The accompanying table shows how McCain and Obama compare within various subgroups of Hispanics .
Implications
Some political experts assumed Obama 's struggle to attract widespread Hispanic support in the primaries would carry over into the general - election campaign against the Republican candidate .
But Hispanics have become a reliable Democratic voting bloc , and have so far shown little difficulty in transferring their loyalties from Clinton to Obama .
Obama continues to lead McCain by about a 2 - to - 1 margin among Hispanic voters , as he has since March .
Hispanic voters could be crucial in key swing states such as New Mexico , Colorado , and Florida .
While George W. Bush made a strong push for the Hispanic vote in the 2000 and 2004 elections , McCain faces an uphill climb to attract Hispanics ' support , given their consistent and solid support for Obama in recent months .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 4,604 Hispanic registered voters , aged 18 and older , conducted March 7 - June 30 , 2008 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For the sample of 1,123 Hispanic registered voters interviewed in June 2008 , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Goldie Hawn and Her Twin Sister Kate ( Photos )
It 's always such a compliment for a mother to be told " you two could be sisters " when she is out and about with her daughter .
In this case it 's true !
Actressand her equally famous daughterwere seen together at a private dinner forin London , England and they are strikingly similar .
Is Goldie holding her age well or is Kate aging too fast ?
Another possible scenario is that it is way too early and I 'm not fully awake - in which case they look nothing alike and I am offending Kate .
Either way , it 's a sure bet they use the same hair color !

Bill Kristol is a fiercely partisan conservative commentator with , reputedly , good connections to the McCain campaign .
His NYT column yesterday sounds the alarm for McCain 's candidacy .
Reader CA draws our attention to this passage on Palin :
McCain picked Sarah Palin in part because she ’s a talented politician and communicator .
He needs to free her to use her political talents and to communicate in her own voice .
I ’m told McCain recently expressed unhappiness with his staff ’s handling of Palin .
On Sunday he dispatched his top aides Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis to join Palin in Philadelphia .
They ’re supposed to liberate Palin to go on the offensive as a combative conservative in the vice - presidential debate on Thursday ...
In the debate , Palin has to dispatch quickly any queries about herself , and confidently assert that of course she ’s qualified to be vice president .
She should spend her time making the case for McCain and , more important , the case against Obama .
As one shrewd McCain supporter told me , “ Every minute she spends not telling the American people something that makes them less well disposed to Obama is a minute wasted . "
It 's not much of an exaggeration to say that Thursday 's VP debate is make - or - break for the McCain campaign .
Actually , it 's not so much a potential Make ( he 'll get a boost if she does well , but it wo n't alter the fundamentals ) as a potential Break .
If she crashes - or ' Courics ' - I think it will be a blow McCain wo n't recover from .
I think , insofar as anything will work with regard to Palin , the approach outlined by Kristol is the right one .
Cram her full of new information and ask her to pretend to be something she 's not - a world - class foreign affairs expert - and she will drown in her own gibberish .
Let her do what she 's best at and she may cause an upset .
Palin needs to find a cute way of deflecting questions she 's unsure about , make a few jokes , and go straight on to the attack .
It will be crude , and Democrats will cry foul , and everyone will say she lost the arguments on substance .
But if she can deliver one or two memorable zingers and provoke Biden into a gaffe , Palin might just turn this into a good night for her team .

A psychology researcher has controversially claimed that stupidity is causally linked to how likely people are to believe in God .
University of Ulster professor Richard Lynn will draw the conclusion in new research due to be published in the journal Intelligence , the Times Higher Education Supplement reports .
Lynn and his two co-authors argue that average IQ is an excellent predictor of what proportion of the population are true believers , across 137 countries .
They also cite surveys of the US Academy of Sciences and UK Royal Academy showing single - digit rates of religious belief among academics .
That professional skeptics do n't believe in a creator is perhaps not all that surprising .
Lynn argues , however , that it is their intelligence that directly gives rise to the boffinated classes ' non-God - bothering tendencies .
He said : " Why should fewer academics believe in God than the general population ?
I believe it is simply a matter of the IQ .
Academics have higher IQs than the general population . "
Lynn pointed out that most children do believe in God , but as their intelligence develops they tend to have doubts or reject religion .
Similarly , as average IQ in Western societies increased through the 20th century , so did rates of atheism , he said .
The researchers ' claims of a direct causal link have drawn criticism from others in intelligence research , who argue their conclusions are too simplistic .
London Metropolitan University 's Dr David Hardman said : " It is very difficult to conduct true experiments that would explicate a causal relationship between IQ and religious belief .
Nonetheless , there is evidence from other domains that higher levels of intelligence are associated with a greater ability - or perhaps willingness - to question and overturn strongly felt intuitions . "

New science indicating fluoride ’s dangers to the brain and other organs will be presented by prominent fluoride research scientists during back - to - back conferences of the International Society for Fluoride Research ( ISFR ) and the Fluoride Action Network ( FAN ) in Toronto August 7 - 11 , 2008 .
Fluoride , added to water supplies to prevent tooth decay , is also in virtually all non-organic foods and beverages .
Fluoride ’s brain effects were never examined prior to water fluoridation .
Recently , because of health concerns , Health Canada recommended that fluoride levels be lowered in Canadian water supplies ( 0.7 mg/ L ) , children ’s toothpaste and infant formula but claims that “ the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit . ”
“ It is hard to believe that any “ weight of evidence ” analysis could possibly dismiss fluoride ’s neurological impacts .
There have now been over 40 animal studies which show that fluoride can damage the brain , and no less than 18 studies which show that fluoride lowers IQ in children , and only 2 that do n’t .
I look forward to reading the full report when it is made available , ” says Paul Connett , PhD , FAN Executive Director .
According to ISFR conference organizer , Dr. Hardy Limeback , “ Our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health .
Our keynote speaker , Dr. A.K. Susheela , ( Executive Director , Fluorosis Research and Rural Development Foundation , India ) probably knows more about fluoride ’s toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist .
It is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say , ” says Limeback .
Susheela can also explain to Medical Doctors , often untrained in fluoride toxicology , how to diagnose , treat and reverse early symptoms of fluoride toxicity which mimic arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome .
The latest issue of ISFR ’s journal , Fluoride , published 12 newly - translated Chinese studies , which report fluoride ’s effects on the brain , including the lowering of IQ in children .
These and other brain studies will be reviewed at both conferences .
Coupled with these conferences , the Toronto - based Citizens for a Safe Environment ( CSE ) will host two public meetings with FAN in downtown Toronto on Monday August 11 .
According to CSE director Karen Buck , “ These meetings will give the public information they do n’t get from our government or dental organizations .
In the afternoon , a panel will address the question of whether Toronto should stop fluoridating its water .
In the evening experts will explain fluoride ’s dangers to health . ”
After receiving an invitation to attend these meetings , the Ontario Dental Association sent out a news release urging legislators and communities to stand up in support of fluoridation ; but they wo n’t do so , themselves .
“ The best way that the ODA can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide , in person , a cogent and scientifically - referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum , ” says CSE President Karen Buck .
At all three events , Dr. Vyvyan Howard , an infant and fetal pathologist , and president of the International Society of Doctors for the Environment , will be presenting a major review of studies on fluoride ’s brain effects , including the translated Chinese studies .
“ The best way to lower children ’s fluoride intake , as Health Canada suggests , is to stop fluoridation , ” says Connett .
“ It makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers ’ milk . ”

1.8.x is the current stable version of Ruby ’s reference implementation .
It , like its predecessors , does not support tail call optimization for recursive functions .
A couple times in recent months I set out to write something in Ruby and found myself thinking “ I should do this with a recursive function . ”
Then I ’d rattle around inside my head , trying to figure out why I can’t remember how to write tail recursive functions in Ruby .
Finally , I ’d realize “ Oh , damn — that ’s right !
Ruby does n’t support tail call optimization . ”
At that point , I ’d just throw away my initial idea of how to write the code and reorganize the idea to use one of Ruby ’s excellent block - fed iterators instead .
Ruby ’s iterators that take blocks as parameters are beautiful things to behold , for what they are .
Unfortunately , they are sometimes not the ideal solution — just the necessary solution if you do n’t want to drag your code to a painstaking crawl , filling up all available RAM on your system , because there ’s no tail call optimization .
This is one of Ruby ’s biggest , ugliest warts , in my opinion : the lack of support for tail call optimization .
I wants my tail call optimization .
I started searching for information on future planned support for tail call optimization tonight , and found a Weblog post talking about how bare recursion is much faster in Ruby 1.9 than Python 2.5 .
This is not even tail recursive code in the example .
Discussion in comments there suggests that Python 2.5 does not support tail call optimization , and whether Ruby 1.9 will support tail call optimization is essentially impossible to determine from this discussion , since support for tail call optimization would n’t make any difference in this case and the people involved in the discussion seem confused about the matter in any case .
I ’ve searched around elsewhere on the Web for this information ( though not exhaustively ) , and still found nothing that gives me any credible sense of whether Ruby 1.9 incorporates tail call optimization .
Is there someone out there who can answer this question for me ?
Police and customs officials are failing to curb the supply and demand of illegal drugs , a new report claims .
The drugs market in Britain is worth £ 5.3bn , says the UK Drug Policy Commission report , published today , and it is proving " extremely resilient " to crackdowns by law enforcement agencies .
Hundreds of millions of pounds are spent every year on tackling the flow of drugs into the country , and there have been significant seizures and convictions of high - profile traffickers and dealers , but there has been little impact on supply and demand , says the commission .
Its report says the market is too big to be affected by police and customs action , and is able to adapt quickly to disruptions .
The number of class A drug seizures in England and Wales more than doubled between 1996 and 2005 , according to the report .
However , an estimated 60 % to 80 % of drugs would need to be seized regularly to put major traffickers out of business , even though seizure rates on this scale have never been achieved in the UK or elsewhere .
Tim McSweeney , one of the report authors , said : " Within the research literature , there is a consistent call for a better understanding of how drug markets operate and the role that enforcement can have in reducing the damage caused by them .
" We were struck by just how little evidence there is to show that the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on UK enforcement each year has made a sustainable impact and represents value for money . "
The report calls for more to be done to reduce the effect of drugs on communities , with measures such as tackling drugs - related " collateral damage " including gang violence and prostitution .
The authors argue this would have a greater impact on the drugs trade than big hauls .
David Blakey , of the UK Drug Policy Commission , added : " All enforcement agencies aim to reduce drug harms and most have formed local partnerships to do this , but they still tend to be judged by measures of traditional supply - side activity such as seizure rates .
" This is a pity as it is very difficult to show that increasing drug seizures actually leads to less drug - related harm .
Of course , drug dealers must be brought to justice , but we should recognise and encourage the wider role that the police and other law enforcement officials can play in reducing the impact of drug markets on our communities . "
The report said the government channelled £ 380 m in 2005 - 06 in England towards reducing supply .
It added the broader criminal justice costs arising from class A drug use were estimated to be more than £ 4bn .
Willie MacColl , the national drugs coordinator with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency , said today there was no such thing as a " meaningless conviction " but said a balanced approach was needed in tackling drugs misuse .
" It is widely recognised within policing that there is a need to reduce the harm associated with drugs as well as the demand for those drugs , " he said .
" The police have a key role to play within the partnerships that already exist in our communities to reduce harm .
A lot of police effort is also dedicated to supporting this work . "
• Teenage girls are as likely to try cannabis as young men , new research shows today .
For many years , there was a gender divide over use of the drug , with boys being much more likely to try it than girls .
But researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia say girls ' use of cannabis has caught up with that of boys in the 14 - 19 age group .
This mirrors trends in teen smoking and drinking .

Electronic
Arts have sent us a statement regarding their roundly - criticized Spore DRM policy .
In it , EA Games Label President Frank Gibeau states that the company assumed consumers would understand the need for DRM because " if games that take 1 - 4 years to develop are effectively stolen the day they launch , developers and publishers will simply stop investing in PC games " but concedes that a number of customers have strong objections and that EA need to adapt their policy to accommodate them .
Full details of the changes can be found after the jump , but it is worth noting that Gibeau does not address the concerns that many gamers have about the choice of SecuROM as Spore 's copy protection in particular .
Two weeks ago EA launched SPORE – one of the most innovative games in the history of our industry .
We 're extremely pleased with the reception SPORE has received from critics and consumers but we 're disappointed by the misunderstanding surrounding the use of DRM software and the limitation on the number of machines that are authorized to play a single a copy of the game .
We felt that limiting the number of machine authorizations to three would n't be a problem .
·
We assumed that consumers understand piracy is a huge problem – and that if games that take 1 - 4 years to develop are effectively stolen the day they launch , developers and publishers will simply stop investing in PC games .
·
We have found that 75 percent of our consumers install and play any particular game on only one machine and less than 1 percent every try to play on more than three different machines .
·
We assured consumers that if special circumstances warranted more than three machines , they could contact our customer service team and request additional authorizations .
But we 've received complaints from a lot of customers who we recognize and respect .
And while it 's easy to discount the noise from those who only want to post or transfer thousands of copies of the game on the Internet , I believe we need to adapt our policy to accommodate our legitimate consumers .
Going forward , we will amend the DRM policy on Spore to : · Expand the number of eligible machines from three to five .
· Continue to offer channels to request additional activations where warranted .
· Expedite our development of a system that will allow consumers to de-authorize machines and move authorizations to new machines .
When this system goes online , it will effectively give players direct control to manage their authorizations between an unlimited number of machines .
We 're willing to evolve our policy to accommodate our consumers .
But we 're hoping that everyone understands that DRM policy is essential to the economic structure we use to fund our games and as well as to the rights of people who create them .
Without the ability to protect our work from piracy , developers across the entire game industry will eventually stop investing time and money in PC titles .

The finite state firing squad
Myhill posed the firing squad synchronization problem in 1957 .
In this problem , you are given a row of soldiers , each of which can be in a finite number of states .
A clock provides a sequence of time steps , 0 , 1 , 2 , and so on ; at each positive time step , the state of each soldier is set to a function , the transition function , of its previous state and the adjacent soldiers ' previous states .
This function is identical for all soldiers not at the ends of the row ; the end soldiers , however , may have different transition functions .
( Nowadays this would be called a `cellular automaton ' . )
Three of the soldiers ' states are called the quiescent , excited , and firing states .
At time 0 , all soldiers are in their quiescent states , except for one soldier at an end , who is in his excited state .
The problem is to arrange the soldiers ' state sets and transition functions such that for this starting position , no matter how many soldiers you start with , all soldiers will , at some future time , enter their firing states simultaneously .
Try to solve the problem now , or read on for the solution .

Sept. 16 , 2008 : AIG Bailed Out
SRINAGAR , Indian - controlled Kashmir ( CNN ) -- India 's military on Wednesday accused Pakistani forces of another cease - fire breach in Kashmir .
Indian troops in Kashmir go through their drills .
This week has seen tensions mount in the region .
" Pakistani troops fired six 82 - mm mortar rounds in a span of one hour ... at our positions , " Indian defense spokesman Lt. Col.
A. K. Mathur said Wednesday .
But the report was denied by Pakistan 's army spokesman , Maj . Gen.
Athar Abbas , who said there had been no " exchange of fire from our side ... of the LoC [ Line of Control ] , " that divides the Kashmir region between India and Pakistan
Mathur said no Indian forces were wounded in the incident , and they " maintained restraint and did n't retaliate . "
" We contacted the Pakistan army on the hotline and told them to stop the firing so that the situation does n't escalate , " the Indian spokesman said .
But Abbas said he had no reports from local commanders of any incident
" This has been their [ India 's ] allegation but as far as the local commanders are concerned ... there is no incident from our side of any kind , " Abbas said .
The reported incident came after Monday 's border clash in Kashmir , the first major skirmish between South Asia 's nuclear rivals since a 2003 cease - fire .
India maintains that Pakistani crossed the LoC and fired on Indian soldiers , prompting a firefight .
Pakistan blamed India for sparking the incident by crossing into its territory in Kashmir .
Senior Pakistani and Indian military officials met briefly Tuesday to discuss the incident , in which one Indian soldier was killed .
Pakistan denied reports that its forces sustained casualties .
Indian and Pakistani forces have exchanged periodic gunfire since May , but Monday 's clashes appear to be a serious setback to the ongoing peace process between the two nations .
Indian Defense Minister A. K. Antony blames Pakistan for 19 cease - fire violations since January , which Pakistan denies .
Kashmir has been at the root of two wars between India and Pakistan , both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998 .
An 18 - year separatist campaign in the Indian - controlled portion of the largely Muslim territory has claimed more than 43,000 lives , according to government officials , although human rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the toll at twice that number .
India has long accused Pakistan of supporting the separatists in Kashmir , a charge Pakistan denies .
India blamed militants from Pakistan for a suicide car bombing outside its embassy in Afghanistan that killed 58 people on July 7 .
CNN 's Mukhtar Ahmad in Srinagar contributed to this report .

Here ’s something I missed while I was offline last week .
It looks like Matt Marlon , who served as CEO of Traffic Power , has landed himself in jail .
I have mixed feelings about this , but the mixed feelings are mostly satisfaction , curiosity , and just a smidge of glee . 🙂
In my opinion , the stuff that TrafficPower was doing was just bad news .
I think the search engine optimization industry has made a lot of progress in the last few years .
It ’s a little less common to get cold calls from SEOs that guarantee # 1 rankings but wo n’t tell you how they try to do it .
And if a large SEO company wants to try something high - risk with a client , they ’re more likely to explain the potential risks to that client first .
There are still issues , of course , but I was looking over a list of 20 + blackhat SEO companies that I compiled back in 2002 .
The majority either went out of business or have transformed into white - hat SEO companies .
For a while now , I ’ve had a slight hunch that clients that embrace blackhat SEO on their site are willing to cut corners in other areas of business as well .
Earlier today I was reviewing an email from 2001 (! ) where Google removed a very large company ’s website from our index for hidden GIF links , machine - generated doorway pages , and cloaking .
It ’s interesting to look back with the benefit of hindsight now .
Later on , the company :
– had 10 + employees convicted for inflating revenue
– the CEO was sentenced to 10 + years in jail
– another executive was sentenced to 2 + years in jail
Can I definitively claim that there ’s a connection between a willingness to embrace blackhat SEO and a willingness to cut corners in other areas of business ?
No , of course not .
But I have seen several examples like the one I mention above .
That ’s why I ’m glad that as more site owners learn about SEO , the long - term odds of blatent SEO scams going undetected go down .
Hat tip to Aaron Wall for mentioning Matt Marlon ’s new location ( jail ) to me .
Aaron and I have had differences , but I give him major points for fighting Traffic Power when they sued him .
That led to one of the first times that Google confirmed a webspam penalty in public in order to dispute one of the lawsuit ’s claims :
I can confirm that Google has removed traffic - power.com and domains promoted by Traffic Power from our index because of search engine optimization techniques that violated our webmaster guidelines at http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html.
If you are a client or former client of Traffic Power and your site is not in Google , please see my previous advice on requesting reinclusion into Google ’s index to learn what steps to take if you would like to be reincluded in Google ’s index .
Ah , good times . 🙂
Cooling this is costly and noisy A new approach to refrigeration and cooling could make for high - efficiency , portable , and quiet refrigerators in the future .
The method works by repeatedly applying an electric field to long molecules called polar polymers .
Advocates of the method say it will achieve a significant increase of efficiency over conventional cooling .
The technology could also be applied to flexible applications such as self - cooling clothing .
Such a scheme could take a bite out of the 15 % of total energy consumption in the UK that is dedicated to refrigeration .
Cooling with rubber Conventional refrigeration and air conditioning work by compressing a refrigerant , which grows cold as it is allowed to rapidly expand .
The refrigerant is then circulated around to remove heat from fridges or air that is then used for cooling .
While environmentally unfriendly chemicals have been removed from air conditioners and refrigerators , the process is still noisy and relatively inefficient .
The new method instead takes its cooling power from the ordering and disordering of the polymers , which are distributed in a thin film just a millionth of a metre thick .
In an electric field , the molecules spontaneously line up , creating heat .
Removing the field causes the polymers to cool down again as a result of the electrocaloric effect .
This energy - from - order is evidenced when stretching and releasing a rubber band ; stretching it lines up the mess of its constituent long molecules , warming it up .
If the temperature at which these transitions occur is near the temperature of the desired cooling , the effect can be exploited .
Though the temperature range of the new work is still too high to result in ice - cold beer , it has achieved a cooling of 12C , showing that polar polymers might just do the trick .
Cooling with magnets
A similar idea called magnetic refrigeration has existed for years , employing certain materials with " magnetic dipoles " that act like tiny compass needles .
Cycling the materials through a magnetic field performs a similar order / disorder dance that can remove heat .
The approach could do away with laptop fans
That approach is projected to be 40 % more efficient than conventional cooling .
But it presents a number of engineering difficulties , and for the moment relies on gadolinium , a rare metal , to achieve significant results .
The electrocaloric approach will be much more efficient than magnetic cooling , according to Qiming Zhang , the Pennsylvania State University professor who published the new results in the journal Science .
" Compared with magnetic cooling , electric field - regulated cooling devices are much easier to operate , with much lower cost , " says Prof Zhang .
The approach could make for simpler , lighter portable coolers , and could be applied to cooling everything from microelectronics to firefighters ' protective clothing .
Karl Sandeman , a materials scientist from the University of Cambridge who works on magnetic cooling says that the electrocaloric approach might prove to have certain advantages particularly for miniature applications like electronics .
However , Dr Sandeman says , magnetic cooling solutions are closer to market and many of the engineering challenges that have faced magnetic cooling will crop up in the case of electrocalorics .
In both cases , the market will be hard to break into .
" The refrigeration industry has had a solution that works for the last 100 years , so innovation teams are usually quite small , " he says .

What are these ?
NBC is getting big TV numbers out of the Olympics , but on Monday the gold medal for online eyeballs went to Yahoo 's Olympics site .
A good reminder that just as Jerry Yang keeps saying , Yahoo has a really , really big audience .
Now it just has to figure out what it wants to do with them .
As per the Nielsen numbers below , NBC Olympics was the top site for U.S. surfers during the first three days of the games in unique visitors , but Yahoo took the top spot on Monday , when people settled back into more typical work - related surfing habits .
Also interesting : the official Chinese Olympics site , Beijing2008.cn , is getting significant traffic from the U.S. , enough to make it the fourth - largest Olympics - related site , ahead , even , of the New York Times .

Configuring your BitTorrent client is essential if you want to enjoy optimal download speeds .
In our quest to help users get the most out of BitTorrent , we asked one of the uTorrent developers how we can speed up our downloads .
At Torrent Freak we have written quite a few speed guides , but we are not as knowledgeable as the people who work with BitTorrent clients daily .
A few weeks ago we asked Olivier Chalouhi , developer and CTO of Vuze ( formerly known as Azureus ) to share some of his BitTorrent speed tips with us .
Today we continue our mission to help people get the most out of BitTorrent , by asking uTorrent developer Greg Hazel to give us his recommendations on how to optimize BitTorrent download speeds .
Here are his three suggestions .
Cap the upload speed
Limiting your upload speed is by far the most important suggestion , and was also mention by Olivier Chalouhi in our previous BitTorrent speed guides .
The rationale behind it is simple .
Your connection is a tube ( sort of ) , if you max out the upload capacity , the tube gets clogged .
Choose the correct maximum number of connections
Too much connections can actually slow down your torrents , instead of increasing the download speed .
The uTorrent speed guide ( Options > Speed Guide in uTorrent ) automatically recommends the ideal settings .
For users with a maximum upload speed of 256 kbit / sec , uTorrent suggests a maximum of 35 connections per torrent , and 60 in total .
Run as few torrents as possible
Less is more , sometimes at least .
Running fewer torrents will guarantee that your connection can handle all the connections and requests properly .
Since BitTorrent rewards people for uploading , the less torrents you run , the faster they will download .
Again , the uTorrent speed guide will suggest the optimal settings , which is a maximum of 2 torrents for users with a maximum upload speed of 256 kbit / sec .
These three settings are the most important according to Greg , and configuring them correctly in your BitTorrent client , is the key to faster downloads .

From the beginning of the American Republic there has been a group of influential people who have devoted their lives and careers to putting more Power In Government ( PIGs ) .
As soon as the American Revolution ended Alexander Hamilton schemed to overthrow the first Constitution , the Articles of Confederation , and replace it with a document that would legitimize a permanent president who would appoint all the governors and have veto power over all state legislation .
He wanted a king , in other words , who could force British - style mercantilism and an imperialistic foreign policy on America without any significant resistance by the citizens of the states .
He failed during his lifetime , but that is essentially the system Americans live under today .
We now live in " Hamilton ’s republic , " as his idolaters gleefully remind us .
As soon as Hamilton ’s party , the Federalists , gained power , one of the first things they did was to rescind the First Amendment to the new Constitution with the Sedition Act during the presidency of John Adams .
Hamilton authored several long - winded reports as Treasury Secretary in which he invented the insidious notions of " implied " powers in the Constitution along with such an expansive interpretation of the General Welfare and Commerce Clauses that the Constitution would become useless as a restraint on governmental tyranny .
Hamilton ’s political compatriot , Chief Justice John Marshall , turned Hamilton ’s legalistic mysticism into legal precedent during his long tenure on the Court , with many other PIG lawyers following suit over the succeeding generations .
And of course Abraham Lincoln established a French Revolutionary / Stalinist - style regime that imprisoned tens of thousands of Northern political dissenters , employed an army of spies and informers ( on Northern citizens ) , shut down hundreds of opposition newspapers , illegally suspended habeas corpus , deported an outspoken member of the opposition party , confiscated firearms , illegally created the state of West Virginia , censored all telegraph communication , and myriad other assaults on the Constitution , including waging war on his own country after promising to defend the lives and liberties of the very people he was waging war on .
The brilliant John C. Calhoun explained the inevitability of all of this — and more — in his Disquisition on Government , written in the late 1840s and published shortly after his death in 1850 .
Calhoun wrote that it is an error to think that " a written constitution , containing suitable restrictions on the powers of government , is sufficient , of itself , without the aid of any organism . . . to counteract the tendency of the numerical majority to oppression and the abuse of power . "
All democracies are broken down into two basic groups — net taxpayers and net tax consumers , said Calhoun .
And the latter group ( PIGs ) will inevitably prevail , as history teaches us .
The party in favor of constitutional restrictions on governmental power at first " might command some respect " but " would be overpowered . "
It is mere folly , he argued , to suppose that " the party in possession of the ballot box and the physical force of the country [ i.e. , the military ] , could be successfully resisted by an appeal to reason , truth , justice , or the obligations imposed by the constitution . "
Moreover , " the end of the contest [ between net taxpayers and tax consumers ] would be the subversion of the constitution " whereby " the restrictions [ on state power ] would ultimately be annulled , and the government be converted into one of unlimited powers . "
This is why Calhoun embraced the Jeffersonian idea of nullification during the sectional dispute over the 1828 " Tariff of Abominations . "
As explained by Ross Lence in the Foreword to Union and Liberty : The Political Philosophy of John C. Calhoun , the former vice president was " seeking a means by which [ disunion ] could be avoided , " and so he " turned to the doctrine of interposition , which defended the right of a state to interpose its authority to overrule federal legislation .
The seeds of this doctrine were introduced by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and 1799 . "
Of course , such ideas as nullification , interposition , secession , and federalism were snuffed out by the Lincoln administration as a result of the War to Prevent Southern Independence .
Calhoun ’s prediction of a government of unlimited powers eventually came true .
The Jeffersonian strict constructionists did more or less prevail for a while , but were nearly wiped out by 1865 , and were nowhere to be found by the turn of the twentieth century .
At that point numerous notorious PIGs gleefully thumbed their noses at the Constitution and the freedoms it was supposed to protect .
This story is told in great detail in the new book by Tom Woods and Kevin Gutzman entitled Who Killed the Constitution ?
The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush .
Woodrow Wilson resumed the totalitarian attacks on free speech that Adams and Lincoln had pioneered with the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 .
These laws literally criminalized opposition to going to war in Europe , as Woods and Gutzman explain .
In addition , the creepy - sounding " Committee on Public Information " portrayed Germans " as subhuman savages " ; and sauerkraut even became known as " liberty cabbage , " an early precedent for the moronic " freedom fries " language adopted by the Bush administration after its invasion of Iraq in 2003 when the French government refused to participate .
During the Lincoln administration roving gangs of Republican Party thugs destroyed printing presses , intimidated Democratic voters in the Northern states , and generally behaved like twentieth - century brownshirts .
Woods and Gutzman write of how the exact same thuggish behavior was an integral part of the Wilson administration .
A Christian minister was sentenced to 15 years for distributing a pamphlet to five people explaining that Jesus Christ was a pacifist ( reminiscent of how Congressman Ron Paul was loudly booed by an audience of " evangelicals " when he reminded them in 2008 that Jesus was known as The Prince of Peace ) .
Men were tarred and feathered for not spending enough of their income on " Liberty bonds " that helped fund the war ; German language Bibles were burned ; and the producers of a movie about the American Revolution that portrayed America ’s " ally " Great Britain in an unflattering light were sentenced to ten years in prison .
By the 1950s American presidents clearly thought of themselves as dictators who were not constrained one iota by the Constitution .
Consequently , Harry Truman felt justified in having the government seize and operate the steel mills so that he could better prosecute the undeclared war in Korea .
Truman insisted that he had absolute , dictatorial power to " do whatever is for the best of the country . "
Constitution schmonstitution .
The Supreme Court eventually ruled against this particular act of theft , but it had little effect in deterring future dictatorial behavior .
Today , American presidents think of themselves not just as unrestrained dictators but as emperors of the world .
Woods and Gutzman provide a scholarly analysis of why Brown vs. Board of Education was unconstitutional .
The Supreme Court " set itself above the Constitution " for what the majority believed was a good cause .
Constitution schmonstitution .
There is no constitutional authority for the myriad pork - barrel spending projects that Congress funds year in and year out with tax dollars , but so what ?
Woods and Gutzman describe the evolution of this particular power grab , from the time when the " father of the Constitution , " James Madison , vetoed an " internal improvements " bill as unconstitutional to today ’s anything - goes mentality in Washington , D.C .
Then there is the theft of privately - held gold by FDR .
The Supreme Court never even bothered to comment on this grossly unconstitutional act of thievery .
Nor is there any constitutional basis for the government ’s ban on prayer in public schools or military conscription .
Not to mention the dictatorial implications of presidential " executive orders . "
Teddy Roosevelt receives special mention with regard to this latter authoritarian tool .
He issued 1,006 executive orders compared to 51 and 71 for his two predecessors , write Woods and Gutzman .
The " Bush Revolution , " discussed in chapter 12 , proves that modern American presidents and their advisors have nothing but absolute contempt for the Constitution .
Upon reading Who Killed the Constitution ?
the Jeffersonian wing of the founding fathers , were they alive today , would be reaching for their swords , preparing for another revolution .
The Hamiltonians , on the other hand , would be popping champagne corks , high five - ing each other , and smiling very broadly .
Calhoun would be deeply saddened that his dire predictions about the fate of an American democracy that is stripped of its Jeffersonian , states ’ rights moorings have all come true in spades .

Notes and Observations Regarding Yesterday ’s ‘ Let ’s Rock ’ Apple Special Event
Overall Scope
The overall takeaway from yesterday ’s news is that Apple ’s music and iPod business is right on track .
There was nothing exceptional or particularly surprising , but the incremental improvements and changes were significant .
A solid year ’s worth of progress .
One thing that was n’t mentioned , though , and which has figured prominently in past music - related special events , was growth .
In past events , the overview of iPod sales has included charts showing tremendous year - over - year sales growth .
Not yesterday .
Instead , the charts emphasized only market share and total unit sales since 2001 .
The news there is good —
Apple has sold a grand total of 160 million iPods since 2001 and today commands 73.4 percent of the U.S. retail market ( followed by Sandisk at 8.6 percent and Microsoft at 2.6 ) — but the lack of any braggadocio regarding growth indicates that the market is saturated .
That ’s not to say unit sales are decreasing , only that they ’re no longer accelerating .
Of course , one reason iPod sales growth has slowed is that iPhones are n’t included in the tally .
( There was no mention during the event of how many iPhone 3Gs Apple has sold so far , however . )
Growth can only come where there ’s room to grow , which is why even Mac sales are growing faster than iPod sales .
Speaking of Macs , contrary to speculation , there were no announcements regarding new Mac notebooks .
Such speculation was misguided ; Apple has held an iPod / music special event in September or October every year since 2001 , and , to my knowledge , has never once used such events to announce new Mac hardware .
Those of you holding out for a new lineup of MacBooks will have to wait until October 14 , according to sources who , as they say , are familiar with Apple ’s hardware plans .
i Tunes 8
The high - level new features in iTunes 8.0 are the new “ Genius ” recommendation engine , a revamped iPhoto - like grid view , a new visualizer , and improved accessibility on both Mac OS X and Windows .
1
The Genius feature is exposed in two ways .
First , you can create a new on - the - fly “ Genius playlist ” by selecting any one song and clicking the Genius button at the bottom of the window .
This creates a 25 – 100 song playlist based on songs in your library that the Genius algorithm determines go well with the song you started with .
( The button is disabled if you select multiple songs , so you ca n’t start with , say , two songs and ask for a Genius playlist of tracks that go well with both . )
Second , there ’s a new Genius Sidebar on the right side of the iTunes window .
After opting in to the Genius system , the sidebar contains recommendations from the iTunes Store based on the first song in the current selection .
( If you have more than one song selected , the Genius Sidebar only shows recommendations based on the first song in the selection . )
The recommendation engine seems pretty damn smart .
The Genius playlists are a clever idea , like the shuffle feature but with a hint .
After a few hours , I like the results better than either my own manual playlists or purely random shuffles .
The store recommendations in the sidebar seem equally good , but imperfect , in that it sometimes recommends songs which I already have in my library , ripped from CDs .
At first I thought the problem might be with the Genius engine not recognizing songs that were n’t purchased from the iTunes Store , but that ’s not quite it , since it does correctly recognize most of the ripped - from - CD tracks in my library .
For example , the Genius Sidebar ’s recommendations based on The Beastie Boys ’s “ Sabotage ” included “ Intergalactic ” , a song I already had in my library .
The problem seems to be with track metadata ; if , say , the album name on the track in your library does n’t exactly match with the album name in iTunes , it does n’t recognize it as the same song .
If I select “ Sabotage ” and click the Genius playlist button , I get this error :
Invoking the “ Update Genius ” command in the Store menu , as prescribed in the dialog , had no effect .
The album name on my version of the track , ripped from CD and filled in by iTunes using the CDDB database , is “ The Sounds of Science ( Disc 2 ) ” .
The version from the iTunes Store has the album name “ Beastie Boys Anthology - The Sounds of Science ( Box Set ) ” .
Changing my copy ’s album name to match the iTunes Store ’s made no difference either — iTunes still claims “ Genius is unavailable for the song ‘ Sabotage ’ . ”
The new visualizer is stunning .
The old one remains available ( View → Visualizer → i Tunes Classic Visualizer ) but it ’s hard to see how anyone would n’t prefer the new one .
In the details , iTunes 8 introduces a few noteworthy changes .
The Preferences dialog has been simplified .
Podcast settings are finally adjustable on a per-podcast level .
Visually , in the new grid view , Apple has introduced yet another new scrollbar flavor — black ProKit - esque buttons with a dark gray background .
But the scrollbar thumb itself is the same as iTunes ’s regular slate - blue scrollbar thumbs ( which do n’t look like system - standard thumbs ) — except when the window is not frontmost , at which point the scrollbar thumb changes to dark gray , rather than light gray .
New grid - mode scrollbar , active .
New scrollbar , inactive .
And speaking of background windows , the main iTunes window now supports click - through for a small number of elements , including everything in the toolbar ( e.g. the playback controls ) and scrollbars .
iTunes 7.7 did not support click - through for these elements .
NBC and HD TV Shows
NBC withdrew its TV programming from the iTunes Store last year .
As of yesterday , it ’s back .
It ’s hard to see that NBC gained much of anything in the form of concessions from Apple .
NBC executives stated publicly that they wanted Apple “ to take concrete steps to protect content from piracy , since it is estimated that the typical iPod contains a significant amount of illegally downloaded material . ”
I.e. they wanted Apple to somehow magically prevent iPods and iTunes from playing NBC content obtained from sources other than the iTunes Store .
That did n’t happen .
NBC also wanted variable pricing for its shows .
They sort of got that , in that library content — old shows like “ The A - Team ” — are available for just $ 1 per episode .
But NBC also wanted to raise prices for episodes of popular new shows , and that did not happen .
Standard - def episodes of all new shows on iTunes remain at $ 2 .
High - def shows are $ 3 , but that ’s not variable pricing — it ’s the same for all HD shows , not just NBC’s , and as far as I can see all HD TV shows in the iTunes Store are also available in SD .
There are no shows which are only available in HD .
It ’s a win for everyone — Apple , NBC , and customers — that NBC shows are back , but there ’s nothing NBC has today that they would n’t have had if they ’d never pulled their shows from iTunes a year ago — except for millions of dollars in lost revenue .
New iPods
The hard - drive - based iPod Classic continues to fade toward irrelevance .
Last year it was available in two capacities , 80 and 160 GB .
The bad news is that it ’s now down to a single capacity , 120 GB .
The good news is that it ’s in the same slimmer form factor as last year ’s 80 GB model , and at the same $ 249 price .
To my recollection , this is the first time that the size of the highest - capacity iPod has gone down year over year .
Jobs stated during the event that the 80 GB model out - sold the 160 GB model , but for those people who value maximum storage capacity above all else , a 40 GB drop is significant .
The design effort regarding traditional click - wheel iPods all went toward the new Nanos .
On the outside , they ’ve returned to the long - and - narrow form factor , abandoning last year ’s “ fat Nano ” design .
And they ’re now available in a full spectrum of vibrant colors : all six colors of the old striped Apple logo , plus pink , silver , and black .
In a change from previous years , all colors are available in both capacities — 8 GB for $ 149 ; 16 GB for $ 199 .
On the inside , Apple added an accelerometer , which allows the display to rotate when you rotate the iPod .
Video plays horizontally , and when you rotate the iPod to horizontal while playing music , it switches to Cover Flow mode , just like with the iPhone and iPod Touch .
You can create Genius playlists directly on the Nano .
It even has a voice recorder , which works if you connect a microphone .
Even the iPhone does n’t ship with a voice recorder app .
2
The iPod Classic gets none of these new features other than Genius playlists .
[ Correction : According to the iPod Classic User Manual ( PDF ) , the Classic has the same support for voice notes as the Nano . ]
The new iPod Touch gets closer to being a thinner iPhone sans phone .
The original iPod Touch lacked hardware volume controls and a speaker ; the new Touch has both .
Significant price reductions bring the prices closer to the selling prices of the subsidized iPhones : 8 GB for $ 229 , 16 GB for $ 299 , and 32 GB for $ 399 .
( I strongly suspect these new prices for the Touch are the margin - reducing “ product transition ” Apple alluded to in its quarterly finance call in July . )
The portable gaming angle was promoted heavily during the event , and is the crux of the “ Funnest iPod ever ” slogan .
Apple is clearly positioning the iPod Touch as a competitor to handheld gaming devices from Nintendo and Sony .
Discussing the 2.1 release of the iPhone OS ( available as an update for iPod Touches now ; slated for release for iPhones this Friday ) , Jobs was brutal regarding the quality of the 2.0 release , saying :
“ 2.1 software update is a big update .
It fixes lots of bugs .
You ’ll get fewer call drops .
You will get significantly improved battery life , for most customers .
We have fixed a lot of bugs where if you have a lot of apps on the phone , you ’re not going to get some of the crashes and other things that we ’ve seen .
Backing up to iTunes is dramatically faster .
And so just a lot of bugs have been fixed . ”
His tone was n’t so much apologetic as it was scornful .

Philosophy of Science , Note ;
ἡ Φυσικὴ Φιλοσοφία
What to call Philosophy of Science in Greek involves some problems .
I have used Φυσικὴ Φιλοσοφία , but in origin this did not really mean Philosophy of Science :
It was just what the earliest Greek philosophy was called in general , because the philosophers talked about nature , φύσι ς .
What we see in Latin , Philosophia Naturalis , comes to mean what is now called " Physics " ( which would have been Φυσικά , " Natural [ Things ] , " in Greek ) .
The title of Newton 's book on gravity was Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis , the " Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy . "
Thomas Jefferson was still using " Natural Philosophy " to obviously mean " Physics . "
I am not aware of when " Natural Philosophy " dropped out and " Physics " finally came in .
The earliest citations for the modern use of " Physics " in the Oxford English Dictionary are for 1834 and 1860 .
Of course , the term had always existed as the title of Aristotle 's Physics , τὰ Φυσικά .
But as " Physics " came in , or came back in from Aristotle , " Natural Philosophy " seems to have dropped entirely out of the universe of discourse .
The " Natural Philosophers " are now just the Pre-Socratics .
The older term is remembered but rarely used .
The Pre-Socratics are just the Pre-Socratics .
At the same time , what " Philosophy of Science " would be in Greek or Latin itself involves a problem .
In Latin we would get Philosophia Scientiae , or in Greek ἡ τῆ ς Ἐπιστήμη ς Φιλοσοφία .
Both of these would simply mean " Philosophy of Knowledge , " which sounds like what we already call " Epistemology . "
The meaning of " science " in English has narrowed from the " knowledge " meaning of scientia to the modern meaning of the natural or social , " hard " or " soft , " sciences .
This happened by the 1840's .
In fact , I have just seen the claim that the modern meaning of " scientist " was coined by William Whewell , at Trinity College , Cambridge [ Christoph Irmscher , " Inventing the Scientist , " The Wall Street Journal , June 29 - 30 , 2019 , C7 ] .
Wissenschaft in German retains a somewhat broader meaning and still gets used for things in philosophy that , in English , would not usually be regarded as sciences .
In Modern Greek , Επιστήμη ( losing the breathing ) has narrowed down to the English meaning of " science . "
For " knowledge , " Modern Greek has γνώσ η ( which would have been γνῶσ ι ς in Classical Greek ) .
But if we used Επι στήμη for its Modern sense , then our term " Epistemology " would , by the same token , mean the " study of science " rather than of knowledge .
We could use " Epistemology " itself for " Philosophy of Science . "
So I am not sure that the Modern meaning is going to be much help .
A possibility could be " Philosophy of Natural Philosophy " ; but this is redundant ( like the " Department of Redundancy Department " ) , so I have picked up Φ υσικ ὴ Φιλο σοφία off of the cutting room floor and given it new life here .
It may not much matter .
English usage is not going to start using an expression in Greek , and Modern Greek can use its own words .

This is slightly embarrassing to admit , but I 'm addicted to ... Space Invaders .
Not the 1978 - issue game , mind you .
No , I 'm talking about Space Invaders Extreme – a re-visioning of the original game , released this week for the Nintendo DS and PSP by Square Enix ( which now owns Taito , creator of the original thud - thud - thudding arcade classic ) .
The game is enormously fun , gorgeously rendered and – other than the horrid use of extreme in the title – a loving tribute to the Precambrian title that birthed the entire videogame industry .
But here 's the really interesting thing .
I think the new Space Invaders is the first " reissue " of a videogame that is completely successful .
This really has never been done before .
This subgenre of gaming – the classic remake – is littered with failure .
Defender , Asteroids , Galaga :
You name the old - school game , and it 's been ruined by some designer 's misbegotten attempt to improve it .
It 's like a form of cultural taxidermy :
They take a wonderful old game , surgically drain it of all joy , then leave the mounted corpse on your mantelpiece to glare at you with its creepy , glassy eyes .
But why ?
Why is it so hard to update a cool old game ?
Usually because the designers get too fancy .
They assume modern gamers will only play a game if it 's 3 - D , so they go to painful lengths to transform 2 - D titles into full , " immersive " reality .
Among other things , this inevitably screws up the control system .
The playfully unmanageable chaos of the old - school Robotron 2084 , for example , becomes the grindingly unmanageable chaos of the 1996 remake on the Nintendo 64 .
Worse , by moving into 3 - D , these games abandon the chunky , low - fi graphics that made those 1980s titles so vibrant and Jungian in their symbolic heft .
In the original Battlezone , the world was rendered in green , vectorized geometric shapes .
It was a perfect evocation of the ghostly quality of " surgical " Cold War combat :
We fight amongst Platonic solids !
Then Atari redesigned the game in 2006 for the PSP – transforming it into the sort of brown / beige 3 - D sludge so omnipresent in today 's gaming , with sundry powerups that promise " complexity " but only serve to ruin the Zen - like simplicity of the original .
This is what 's so refreshing about the new Space Invaders .
It avoids all these pitfalls .
First off , it remains resolutely 2 - D. Indeed , the aliens look precisely as they did in 1978 – chunky , pixelated blots of Otherness dread .
They still crawl across the screen , slowly at first and then faster as you eliminate their ranks .
And as before , you can only zip back and forth along the ground and fire upward .
Yet Square Enix has also managed to insert clever new bits of gameplay .
Some of the aliens carry shields that deflect missiles back toward you ; others , once wounded , stagger downward in kamikaze attacks .
Every once in a while , one of those mystery ships at the top of the screen will pause , fizz and unleash a searing , laserlike blast for a few seconds .
Meanwhile , you 've got new powerups : multiple missiles , cluster shots and a penetrating laser .
The upshot is that the game remains neatly balanced .
The aliens have their new tricks , but so do you .
In fact , as a whole , the game advances with the same sort of inverse logarithmic difficulty : Around 10 minutes in , you 'll feel precisely the same oh - shit - oh - shit loss of control you experienced in the original arcade game .
It 's quite eerie .
What I 'm trying to argue , ultimately , is that Square Enix has captured the spirit of the original game .
The funky weapons , the zigzaggy attacks – sure , they 're new .
But they also seem like part of the Space Invaders canon .
In essence , Space Invaders Extreme feels like a game that Taito 's designers would have wanted to produce if they 'd had just slightly more processing power .
Square Enix 's designers have deftly channeled the limitations that Taito 's designers faced .
And this , really , is the secret to their success – because it 's your choice of limitations , not freedoms , that makes for superb game design .
So yeah :
It 's 1978 again .
Except , somehow , slightly better .
Welcome back !

Poetic Passage Provokes Heavy Thoughts on Life , Death
Nicolas Sarkozy ( centre ) said he wanted to promote love not war The Israeli and Palestinian leaders have expressed their optimism over the chances for peace at a summit of EU and Mediterranean rim nations in Paris .
Israeli PM
Ehud Olmert said his country had never been so close to reaching an agreement with the Palestinians as now .
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said both were serious and wanted peace .
Leaders from 43 nations have launched the Union for the Mediterranean , which has ending conflict in the Middle East as one of its main priorities .
It will also tackle issues like immigration and pollution .
The summit's host , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , said the aim was to see that the region was a place where people could love each other instead of making war .
Mr Sarkozy urged Middle Eastern countries involved in long - running conflicts to end the deadly spiral of war and violence , as European nations had done by making peace which each other during the 20th Century .
He said the presidency of the European Union - which France currently holds - was committed to progress on Middle East peace .
Syria talks
Speaking after the summit , the Syrian president Bashar al - Assad said it could take between six months and two years to reach a peace agreement with Israel - even if both sides agreed to hold face to face talks .
Turkey is currently acting as a mediator between the two countries .
We have never been as close to the possibility of coming to an agreement as we are today
Ehud Olmert
In a French TV interview , President Assad also said he did not believe any accord could be reached this year , while President Bush remains in office in the US .
Earlier , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he hoped the indirect talks would soon become direct ones .
Ahead of the summit , Mr Sarkozy addressed the media alongside The Palestinian and Israeli leaders .
Mr Sarkozy said the role of Europe and France was to help achieve peace through economic development , political initiatives and providing guarantees for all stakeholders .
He said the main problem was one of confidence .
Mr Olmert said there would be " obstacles , problems , disagreements but we have never been as close to the possibility of coming to an agreement as we are today " .
For his part , Mr Abbas sounded a positive note about future peace talks .
" We have no alternative but to achieve this peace , " he said .
" For the sake of our peoples , the Palestinian and Israeli peoples , the peoples of the Middle East and for the people of the world .
Because we know that peace in the Middle East is the basis of peace in the world . "

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev was quoted by AP news agency as saying that the prime minister had " agreed in principle " to release an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners .
Israel 's Haaretz newspaper said this would be unrelated to the prisoner exchange deals the government is conducting with Hezbollah and Hamas .
There are thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails .
Mr Olmert is under pressure at home , where he is facing serious corruption allegations .
There have been calls for the prime minister , who denies any wrongdoing , to resign .
Optimistic BBC Europe editor Mark Mardell , in Paris , said the meeting had been very optimistic .
Progress has already been made in other areas .
Mr Sarkozy announced on Saturday that Syria and Lebanon had agreed to set up embassies in each other 's capitals for the first time .
Relations between the two have been strained since Lebanon 's former PM Rafik Hariri was assassinated in 2005 - an attack which Lebanon claims Syria was involved in .
Mr Sarkozy is one of those politicians who is full of surprises because he is always campaigning
Mardell blog : Sea of Tranquillity ?
Mediterranean Union is launched The French president also asked Syria 's leader Bashar al - Assad to use his ties with Iran to help resolve the international stand - off over Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
Mr Sarkozy has long spearheaded the idea of a Union for the Mediterranean .
Comprising 27 EU members with states from north Africa , the Balkans , Israel and the Arab world , the new body membership will include 756 m people from Western Europe to the Jordanian desert .
He recently claimed the grouping could transform the Mediterranean region into an area of peace and prosperity .
Critics have dismissed the new union as lacking substance , and diplomats say there are continuing disagreements over key issues such as how to address the Middle East peace process and a possible role for the Arab League .
The only European or Mediterranean rim leader boycotting the Paris meeting is Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi , who has described the union as a new form of colonialism .

Mr. Pfiffner is University Professor in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University .
This essay is drawn from his book , Power Play : The Bush Administration and the Constitution ( Brookings 2008 ) .
The Bush administration , in addition to its over - classification of documents , has undertaken more policies in secret than any administration in recent memory .
For instance :
1. President Bush ’s Military Order of November 13 , 2001 , which authorized military commissions ( which were later invalidated by the Supreme Court ) , was kept secret from National Security Adviser Rice and Secretary of State Powell until the president had signed it .
2. President Bush ordered the National Security Agency to conduct surveillance of Americans without warrants , in spite of the clear language of the law that warrants were required .
Even the legal memorandum justifying the program was kept secret from Congress and from NSA lawyers .
3. President Bush ’s memorandum pursuant to the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) , reinterpreting Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to allow harsh interrogation techniques , was kept secret from the public and Congress .
Most people understand that it is necessary for the government to keep some secrets .
For instance , troop movements that would warn the enemy should they become known are legitimate secrets .
Likewise , covert operations by the CIA must also remain secret .
Some secrets ( and even lies ) are justified when pursuing some public policies ; for instance , plans for President Carter ’s aborted attempt to rescue the hostages in Iran should certainly have been kept secret .
The policy of the United States to rescue U.S. citizens imprisoned in foreign countries is understood , and covert actions taken to pursue that policy are legitimate .
In contrast , the Reagan administration ’s attempt to trade arms to Iran for release of hostages , directly abrogated declared U.S. policy ( it also arguably violated the law ) .
In general , citizens , and particularly members of Congress , should know what the policies of the United States government are .
The fundamental premise of representative democracy is that citizens know about governmental policies and thus can make informed decisions when voting .
The most important way of establishing governmental policy is the passing of laws .
Citizens and the legislators representing them have a right to presume that the executive branch is obeying the law .
But in establishing the Terrorist Surveillance Program , President Bush asserted that he was not bound by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) which required warrants before NSA could conduct surveillance in the United States .
Given the administration ’s justification for NSA ’s illegal surveillance , there may be other , secret programs that are being conducted of which neither Congress nor the American public are aware .
When President Bush ’s military commissions order was invalidated by the Supreme Court because it did not comply with U.S. law , Congress passed the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) which gave legal sanction to the commissions that President Bush had tried to create under his own executive authority .
In that law Congress authorized the president to reinterpret Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
Common Article 3 provides that detained persons be treated “ humanely , ” and it prohibits “ violence to life and person , in particular murder of all kinds , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture , ” and “ outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment .
. . . ”
Compliance with Common Article 3 had not previously been a problem in U.S. policy , but President Bush suspended the Geneva Conventions in February 2002 .
This suspension led , eventually , to the many instances of abuse and torture .
The Supreme Court , in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , ruled that the president was legally bound by the Geneva Conventions .
Thus President Bush needed legal justification for the types of harsh interrogations of detainees that he was authorizing , and the MCA gave him that authority .
The MCA forbade torture in its most egregious forms , but it allowed the president to issue rules specifying which techniques of “ enhanced interrogation ” the CIA would be allowed to use on those suspected of terrorism .
Congressional critics of the Bush administration argued that , for instance , waterboarding constituted torture ; but the administration refused to rule out waterboarding or reveal what techniques were authorized by the president .
In this case , Congress was voting for a bill ( the MCA ) authorizing the president to determine an important policy -- which harsh interrogation techniques could be used by U.S. personnel -- without knowing what they were voting for .
The disturbing aspect of these secret interpretations of laws is that the Bush administration interpreted the law according to its own legal standards .
Those standards gave the president , as commander in chief , virtually unlimited authority in dealing with any national security matter .
The legal memoranda of the Office of Legal Counsel also argued that any congressional enactment ( law ) that constrained the president in his treatment of detainees would be unconstitutional .
According to the arguments of the Bush administration , signing statements give president Bush the authority to decide unilaterally which parts of laws to execute and which to ignore .
Although there have not been blatant , public refusals of the administration to execute the law , there may very well be policies implemented subsequent to presidential signing statements about which we do not know .
In the case of the MCA interrogation policies and signing statements , it is impossible for members of Congress to know what the law , in operation , would be .
Thus they were expected to vote on laws , the consequences of which have not been revealed to them .
Such situations undercut the very ideas of the rule of law and representative democracy .
This pattern of executive actions has the effect of robbing the legislative branch of its most important power : the power to make law .
If presidents can now exercise law - making authority by secret and novel interpretations or by selectively ignoring laws , they usurp the most important power of the first branch of government .
Such a course of action seriously threatens the separation of powers system , because it places into the hands of the executive , in effect the power to make as well as execute , the law - the very type of governance the founders said led to tyranny .
Even though George W. Bush will not be president after January 20 , 2009 , he has set dangerous precedents that future presidents can rely on to abuse their executive power .
Chief executives , regardless of party , seek power , as the Framers of the Constitution predicted .
The Framers carefully crafted a Constitution that is designed to hem in aggrandizing executives through the self interest of members of the other two branches .
Despite several promising decisions by the Supreme Court , neither branch has forcefully asserted its own constitutional prerogatives against the executive .
If they do not do so , future presidents will be able to use the troubling precedents set by President Bush for their own purposes .
McCain was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona in 1982 , the launch of his political career .
McCain :
The original political celebrity
If Barack Obama gave new meaning to the term “ political celebrity , ” then John McCain helped define it .
He emerged as the most popular Republican in Hollywood following his 2000 presidential primary defeat , winning more screen time than the rest of Congress combined .
McCain made cameos in “ Wedding Crashers ” and “ 24 , ” saw his memoir turned into a popular biopic on A&E , and appeared more than 30 times on late night comedy shows .

So this week , when McCain cast Obama ’s celebrity as a disqualifier , it seemed like a curious turn .
Just one day before McCain released an advertisement interspersing pictures of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears with footage of Obama addressing 200,000 people in Berlin , actor Jon Voight told Variety that McCain had “ many great , intelligent , talented Academy - winning actors standing by , awaiting a major press conference to show their support . ”
“ [ The ad ] is a bit ironic given that McCain has been the most pop-culture savvy Republican candidate in quite some time , ” said Ted Johnson , managing editor of Variety and editor of the blog Wilshire and Washington , which monitors the intersection of celebrity and politics .
The McCain campaign continued to hammer at Obama on Friday with the release of a very sarcastic Web ad that at one point cuts to an image of Charlton Heston as Moses parting the Red Sea before posing the question : “ Barack Obama may be The One , but is he ready to lead ? ”
The Spears - Hilton ad hits a similar note , describing Obama as “ the biggest celebrity in the world . ”
The Republican National Committee piled on , launching a Web site Friday called Who Said It ?
Celebrity Edition that features a multiple - choice quiz in which people must identify whether Obama or a celebrity made certain , often vacuous , statements .
It ’s a striking line of attack for McCain , who ’s accepted without complaint the “ celebrity ” epithet from journalists for four decades .
“ John ’s been a celebrity ever since he was shot down , ” former McCain strategist John Weaver told The Atlantic earlier this week , “ whatever that means . ”
Yet , like the way fresh starlets push aside aging actors , political hot shots from years past ( think former President Bill Clinton , often described as a “ rock star ” in his day ) have been overshadowed by the newest crop of talent in this election year .
This sort of churning is typical during presidential campaigns , said Matt Bennett , communications director for Gen.
Wesley Clark ’s 2004 presidential campaign and co-founder of Third Way , a progressive policy group .
“ McCain was famous for a politician , ” Bennett said .
“ Obama has almost transcended that , and has become famous as a famous person which is why they are comparing him to Paris Hilton . ”
Since 2000 , Bennett went on , McCain has enjoyed “ enough fame and authority and celebrity ” to aid candidates and organizations with ads that simply involve him speaking into a camera .
McCain started on the public stage with the pedigree of a family whose name graces a naval ship and a Mississippi National Guard training center .
With his father serving as a top admiral , John McCain first became a household name when he was captured in Vietnam , and even more of one upon his release five years later .
The New York Times featured him on its front page .
He wrote an acclaimed 12,000 - word , first person account for U.S. News and World Report .
President Richard Nixon feted him .
Hollywood warmed to him in 2000 as he ran against one of its least favorite people , George W. Bush .
He endeared himself with liberals , including Warren Beatty , by taking unconventional stances for a Republican presidential candidate , such as favoring campaign finance reform and challenging the Christian right .
His open - door approach with journalists made him the darling of the media elite .
“ You can definitely makes the case that McCain stands out among Republicans for his associations with Hollywood and his celebrity status , ” Johnson said .
“ The fact that he was in ‘ Wedding Crashers , ’ it underscores the fact that he does have a lot of friends in the entertainment industry that Bush ca n’t claim . ”
In the years that followed , he became a near - regular on the late - night comedy circuit , appearing eight times on " The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , " 12 times on the " Late Show with David Letterman , " 10 times on " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , " and three times on " Late Night with Conan O'Brien , " according to imdb.com .
He hosted " Saturday Night Live " in 2002 .
" Faith of My Fathers " pulled in 3.7 million viewers on A&E in 2005 , making it the network ’s most popular program in over a year .
He appeared on “ 24 ” in 2006 .
And he made a brief cameo in “ Wedding Crashers , ” offering congratulations to the father of the bride , a senator played by Christopher Walken .
As a then - likely Republican presidential candidate , McCain ’s appearance in the film stirred a mini-controversy when the Drudge Report labeled it a “ boob raunch fest . ”
But McCain laughed it off — during a visit on Leno ’s show .
“ In Washington , I work with boobs every day , ” McCain joked .
McCain has received support this year from boldfaced names such as SNL creator Lorne Michaels and producer Jerry Bruckheimer .
But the Republican 's circle is far smaller than the one around Obama , and less robust than 2000 , when lifelong Democrats including Harrison Ford and Michael Douglas signed checks for McCain .
So far , Obama has raised $ 4.7 million from the movie , television and music industry , while McCain has received $ 815,000 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan campaign finance group .
A liberal blog noted this week that the McCain campaign had scrubbed its website of an Associated Press story from last year that described him as a “ political celebrity . ”
Dismissing claims circulating in the liberal blogosphere , McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the article was removed as part of routine housecleaning of the website several weeks ago .
But Rogers skirted the question Friday of whether he considered his candidate a political celebrity .
“ John McCain is a widely respected and admired political leader in our country and the world , ” Rogers said , adding that Obama is in a “ different stratosphere . ”
“ Who else could get 200,000 people in Berlin ?
Those are n’t voters .
Those are fans . ”
The campaign , he added , was not attempting to make “ celebrity ” a pejorative term .
“ It is not a dirty word , ” he said of the spot that juxtaposes Obama with Britney and Paris , calls him “ the biggest celebrity in the world ” and then asks , “ but is he ready to lead ? ”
“ We are celebrating his fame , ” Rogers went on , “ and the reality that this guy has entered Tom Cruise - type of fame . ”
Bennett said the heightened sensitivity around " celebrity " was unlikely to cause a full - scale pull back from the entertainment industry by either candidate .
Indeed , on Friday night in Panama City , Fla. , McCain basked in the glow of Nashville — not Hollywood — as country singer John Rich of the duo Big and Rich hosted a " Country First " concert for the presumptive nominee and debuted a new song : " Raising McCain . "
Obama ’s star even shines in Nashville , though — last year “ Big ” Kenny Alphin , the other half of the act , contributed $ 2300 to the Obama campaign .

It was nice to see the large response from my Linux Plumbers Conference talk , and there seems to be a few common themes of questions about the talk that I figured I 'd clear up here .
I have seen the video of the talk , and the video team from the Linux Plumbers Conference is working to put it up online somewhere , hopefully soon .
I 'll link to it when it is available .
First off , my numbers for the binutils development was completely WRONG .
Kees and I sat down and tried to figure out exactly why I did n't count his valid contribution , and it turned out that binutils puts a ChangeLog into each subdirectory , the top - level one is not the summary of all of the individual parts of the project .
So I apologize about that one , Canonical really did have one binutils patch in the past 3 years .
Not that this really affects any of the main points of my talk though ...
All of the other numbers for the other projects are still correct , from what I can tell .
If anyone thinks I got them wrong , please let me know and I will be glad to review them .
Feel free to review the changelog and svn and git trees of the different projects if want to verify .
One main question that I saw a lot , and was even asked about during my talk , was " what about Canonical 's work on the desktop / Gnome / KDE " ?
I really do n't know if they have contributed a lot of effort back upstream on these projects , that was n't my point here .
Remember , this was given at the Linux Plumbers Conference a gathering of developers of the low - level plumbing of Linux .
This was n't a group of desktop developers , so remember the audience that this was addressed to please .
If Canonical has contributed a lot to Gnome / KDE , that 's great , I 'm sure someone will post the numbers soon to verify this .
Either way , please remember that this was not the audience that I was addressing .
I sat down with Matt the day after my talk , as he described , and hopefully the Canonical kernel developers will work to become more of a valid part of the community , which is what I am sincerely hopeing will happen here .
Oh , and Amanda , I have given this very same kind of talk to Amazon , a number of months ago , as well as many other companies over the past 1 1/ 2 years , so it 's not like I am ignoring them at all .
And this response brings me back to my main point of my talk , which most people seem to have missed as they were upset at me pointing out Canonical 's lack of upstream contributions .
And that point was , and still is :
The market right now is just too good for individual developers who have experience in writing open source software for Linux , especially the low - level plumbing of Linux , to waste their time working for companies who do not allow them to contribute back , if they want to .
This was a developer conference .
I am a developer , talking as myself only , and not as a representative of any company ( note the total lack of any corporate branding on my slides ) , to other developers who I totally respect and want to see be as happy in their day - job as I am in mine .
I would like to point out that lwn .
net 's summary of the talk did get this correct , which was great to see .
Hopefully this helps clear things up , if not , let me know and I 'll be glad to address it .

DENVER — Senator Edward M. Kennedy , struggling with brain cancer , arrived on Monday night at the Democratic National Convention in a triumphant appearance that evoked 50 years of party history as Democrats gathered to nominate Senator Barack Obama for president .
Mr. Kennedy ’s appearance wiped away , at least for the evening , some of the tension that continued to plague the party in the wake of the primary fight between Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
It also represented an effort by the Obama campaign to claim the Kennedy mantle , and it set the stage for the second part of what was designed to be an emotionally powerful two - act evening : an appearance later by Michelle Obama , who began a weeklong effort to present her husband — and his entire family — as embodiments of the American dream .
“ You see , Barack does n’t care where you ’re from , or what your background is , or what party , if any , you belong to , ” said Mrs. Obama , without explicitly mentioning the racial undercurrents that have swirled around her husband ’s candidacy .
“ You see , that ’s just not how he sees the world .
He knows that thread that connects us — our belief in America ’s promise , our commitment to our children ’s future — he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree . ”
At the end of the evening ’s proceedings , Mr. Obama appeared before the convention by video hookup , with his young daughters , Malia and Sasha , joining his wife on stage for what was clearly intended to transmit a loving American family tableau .

T he odd pairing of zucchini and grapefruit is featured on the menu of New York City restaurant wd - 50 , with noodlelike strips of squid and a smear of sour cream .
And get this — the zucchini is raw and the grapefruit is dehydrated .
Why ?
They ’re more bitter that way .
“ Raw zucchini is more bitter than cooked zucchini , ” says chef Wylie Dufresne .
When you dry grapefruit , “ the flavors become more concentrated . ”
Not the usual way of thinking about those flavors .
And yet more American chefs are bringing bitter into their menus , playing with the taste in bold ways .
Pino Maffeo of Boston ’s Restaurant L grates intensely bitter , black dried dandelion root over lobster .
Pastry chef Ben Roche of Chicago ’s Moto restaurant spikes coffee ice cream with a chemical compound that ’s sometimes used in cleaning solutions to stop people from accidentally drinking them .
Before you assume these are dishes destined for the graveyard of failed experiments , know this : Customers love them .
“ When they see [ dandelion root ] on the menu , I think their eye just skips to the next word , ” says Maffeo .
“ But then they eat it , and go , ‘ Holy cannoli , what is this ? ’ ”
It ’s a major shift in American taste .
We ’ve historically preferred foods that are salty and sweet ( extra points for fatty ) and , unlike most other cultures , shied away from bitter things .
Think of Italians and Campari , or the Chinese and bitter melon .
Yet in the recent past , American chefs were afraid even to breathe the “ b ” word for fear a dish would n’t sell .
Pastry chef Ben Roche spikes coffee ice cream with a chemical compound used in cleaning solutions to stop people from accidentally drinking them .
“ What are you going to say when you describe something like an artichoke ? ” asks Dufresne .
“ That it ’s bitter and metallic tasting ?
The average - Joe diner is n’t going to say , ‘ Oh yeah , I ’ll take two of those ! ’ ”
The signs are everywhere .
Curls of bitter radicchio have gone from rarefied plates 20 years ago at Da Silvano to the menu boards of McDonald’s .
There ’s a Starbucks on every urban block selling espresso to people who ten years ago pronounced it “ expresso . ”
Remember when practically all our chocolate was milk , except for Hershey ’s Special Dark ?
Now the more - bitter dark is the fastest - growing segment of the American chocolate market , with ultra - dark varieties containing upwards of 80 percent cacao selling briskly .
The trend was so overwhelming that it spurred Hershey ’s to acquire boutique dark - chocolate - maker Scharffen Berger two summers ago .
Likewise bitter beers .
Microbrews are gaining market share faster than less bitter mass - market lagers like Budweiser and Miller .
The biggest category of entries at the Great American Beer Festival , the largest competition for commercial craft brewers in the country , is now India Pale Ales , or IPAs .
These bitter beers typically have between 40 and 60 IBUs ( International Bitterness Units , the measure of how much isomerized alpha acid a beer contains ) .
Budweiser has about 10 .
The country that invented American cheese , the Frappuccino , Jell - O , and Wonder Bread is finally discovering its dark side .
An evolutionary start
Until fairly recently , scientists believed we tasted things in different areas of our tongue .
According to this “ tongue map , ” bitter was experienced at the back .
Although the tongue - map theory has been debunked ( we use our whole tongue to taste everything ) , it ’s still believed to be true that bitter , along with sweet , salty , sour , and umami , the Japanese word that translates , roughly , to “ meaty , ” are the only tastes that humans can detect .
All other flavors are experienced primarily through aroma .
Bitter in the Kitchen
Here are some recipes that exemplify the use of bitter flavors .
Negroni
Start with this classic Campari cocktail and bitter will never seem bad again .
Fennel , Parsley , and Celery Salad with Preserved Lemon- Bitters Dressing
This is a new way to use Angostura Bitters outside the realm of cocktails .
The combination of tastes in this dish — lemons , olives , the slightly sweet , anise flavor of fennel , plus the zing of the bitters — is complex and uncommon .
It ’s probably the most palate - testing recipe of the bunch .
Baked Pasta with Radicchio and Mozzarella
This recipe combines flavors that you already know with a slight sweet - bitter edge .
Saffron Panna Cotta with Bitter Honey
In this creamy dessert , depth comes from the slightly unexpected addition of bitter honey and saffron .
But neither will overwhelm the dish , it ’s nicely balanced .
We all hate bitter at first .
Feed babies something bitter , and they ’ll reflexively recoil no matter what culture they ’re from , says Dr. Paul Breslin of the Philadelphia - based Monell Chemical Senses Center , which conducts research on the senses .
Scientists believe this was once an evolutionary advantage that warned us away from eating plants containing bitter , poisonous alkaloids .
So bitterness is an acquired taste .
But why do some acquire it , and others not ?
There ’s no easy answer .
In both Chinese and Indian traditional medicines , bitter foods are believed to be medicinal .
This makes sense , as bitter foods like kale are often healthful , and strangely enough , even poisonous plants can be good for you .
Foxglove , for instance , contains the poison digitalis , which is lethal in a large dose but heart medicine in a smaller dose .
This would explain the popularity of herbal aperitifs and digestifs in Italy .
Originally , these liqueurs were created as health tonics .
People associated them with feeling better ( whether they actually worked or not ) and in the process took a liking to them .
Others may warm up to bitter things because they really make one feel better .
Think beer , chocolate , coffee , red wine , coca leaves — all bitter .
“ Straight black coffee just does n’t taste that good , ” says Breslin .
“ So what is it that makes people go from drinking their coffee with lots of milk and sugar in it , the way you do when you ’re a young person , to drinking it black ?
It might be that they associate it with , basically , getting high . ”
In and out of favor
Americans were n’t always averse to the taste .
Around the time of the Revolutionary War , pubs routinely served a strong English beer called bitter .
Many turn - of - the - century patent medicines evolved into bitter - flavored soda pop , notes James Trager , author of The Food Chronology : A Food Lover ’s Compendium of Events and Anecdotes , from Prehistory to the Present ( Owl Books , 1997 ) .
Moxie , which gets its flavor from bitter gentian root , was originally marketed as a cure for dementia and impotence .
It evolved , briefly , into the most popular pop in the country ( you can still find it , if you ’re lucky ) .
Coca - Cola , too , originally had medicinal claims and bitter notes .
A taste for bitter persisted , mostly in isolated pockets of immigrants , throughout the 20th century .
( Chef Andrew Carmellini of New York City ’s A Voce restaurant remembers his male relatives in Ohio chugging bottles of vermouth , dubbed by some at the time as “ Italian mouthwash . ” )
However , for the most part , the American palate began to dull .
Industrialized food production began in earnest during World War II .
Regional cuisines were eroded or replaced by canned and processed foods .
“ Food became bland , salty , overcooked , ” says Amy Bentley , professor of Nutrition , Food Studies and Public Health at New York University .
“ Think ‘ fruit cocktail . ’ ”
The longer you cook vegetables , the less bitter they are .
Chef Andrew Carmellini remembers his relatives chugging bottles of vermouth , dubbed “ Italian mouthwash . ”
A new palate expansion
Now we ’re in the midst of a full - scale fruit cocktail backlash .
Thank people like Alice Waters for promoting fresh , seasonal produce and local ingredients over canned and frozen .
And thank the cultural shifts and affluence that have allowed Americans to travel the world and taste other cultures ’ food .
Also thank the recent waves of immigrants from Latin America and Southeast Asia who have introduced new foods to the States .
Mainstream Americans , more and more , are looking for thrills and complexity in what they eat .
“ Americans are finding more satisfaction , and a more hedonistic response to food , like the French , ” says John Scharffenberger , cofounder of Scharffen Berger Chocolate .
“ They ’re eating more intensely flavored foods , ” like stinky cheeses , red wine , wheat bread , olives , curry , and chiles .
“ Bitter being an equal part of a very small flavor perception , if you leave out essentially 25 percent of that , you are leaving out a huge range of flavors available to you , ” says John Zearfoss , a professor at the Culinary Institute of America who has studied the unpopular taste .
In the company of other flavors
Here ’s one thing every cook should understand : Bitter does n’t like to be alone .
Take mustard greens .
On their own , they ’re very bitter .
But when made Southern style , they ’re salted and stewed with pork to impart sweetness , then served with a side of sour lemon , lime , or pepper vinegar .
The end result is savory , with a touch of bitter and a little sweet to balance .
Chefs who play with bitter understand this approach .
“ You kind of have to slip bitter in as a side note , ” says Moto pastry chef Ben Roche .
“ It ’s not a necessary part of the dish , but it kind of makes the dish . ”
He balances his coffee ice cream with sweet milk chocolate pudding and poached dates .
Dufresne of wd - 50 uses sour cream as a fatty , creamy balm to the bitterness of his grapefruit and zucchini , with brininess from the squid as an alternate foil .
David Myers , chef at Los Angeles ’s Sona restaurant , marinates green papaya in bitters , then serves it with grilled lobster ( sweet ) and cooling cucumbers .
Using bitters in a short rib braise “ adds a punch , ” says Myers , but they ’re softened with tangy mustard , red wine , and tomatoes .
Ron Mendoza , pastry sous chef at French Laundry , makes a bitter chocolate terrine paired with candied lemon peel ( sour ) and extra - sweet ice cream .
A fine balance
In some cases , finding the bitter balance is knowing when to pull back and when to be patient .
“ Bitter peaks throughout your meal are nice , ” says Dufresne of wd - 50 .
“ I love the way you can use bitterness in the mouth to stimulate the palate and get people salivating and excited . ”
Rick Bayless of Chicago ’s Frontera Grill makes a sauce from dried guajillo chiles that ’s sweet , salty , tangy , and bitter all at once .
He coaxes this complexity by slow - cooking them with cumin , garlic , and black pepper .
“ A lot of cooks will try to make a 15 - minute guajillo sauce , and all they get is the bitterness , ” says Bayless .
“ I love the way you can use bitterness in the mouth to stimulate the palate and get people salivating and excited , ” says Chef Wylie Dufresne .
If you ’ve acclimated your audience to these subtle bitter notes , you may be ready to go hard - core .
Abhijit Saha , executive chef at the Park Hotel in Bangalore , India , recommends a bitter melon dish called bharwan karela .
Peel a gourd , salt to drain bitterness in the way you would eggplant , and hollow out the center .
Cook the seeds with onion ; Indian pickling spices like fennel , nigella , fenugreek , and mustard seeds ; and turmeric , chili , cumin , and coriander powders .
Parboil the casing , put the cooked filling back inside , truss , fry in a small amount of oil , and sprinkle with chaat masala , a little lemon juice , and salt .
“ Eighty percent of the bitterness will be reduced , and the remaining flavors come through , [ tasting ] artichoke -y or asparagus -y , ” assures Saha .
On second thought , we Americans might want to stay in the shallow end for now .
Somebody recently took bharwan karela to the Frontera Grill staff party .
“ Cooks typically love all flavors , and we love things that are pretty far out there , ” says Bayless .
“ But that bitter melon — oh my God was it bitter ! ”

The TALPA malware scanning API was covered here in December , 2007 .
Several months later , TALPA is back - in the form of a patch set posted by a Red Hat employee .
The resulting discussion has certainly not been what the TALPA developers would have hoped for ; it is , instead , a good example of how a potentially useful idea can be set back by poor execution and presentation to the kernel community .
The idea behind TALPA is simple : various companies in the virus - scanning business would like a hook into the kernel which allows them to check for malware and prevent its spread .
So the patch adds a hook into the VFS code which intercepts every file open operation .
A series of filters can be attached to this intercept , with the most important one being a mechanism which makes the file being opened available to a user - space process as a read - only file descriptor .
That process can scan the file and tell the kernel whether the open operation should be allowed to proceed or not .
In this way , the scanning process can prevent any sort of access to files which are deemed to contain bits with evil intentions .
There are a few other details , of course .
A caching mechanism prevents rescanning of unchanged files , increasing performance considerably .
There is also a hook on close ( ) calls which can trigger the rescanning of a file .
Processes can exempt themselves from scanning if it might get in their way ; scanning can also be turned off for specific files , such as those used for relational database storage .
But the patch set is relatively small , as it really does not have that much to do .
This capability could well prove to be useful .
Even if one is not concerned about malware infections on Linux systems , a lot of files destined for more vulnerable platforms can pass through Linux servers .
There is also the potential for the detection of attempted exploits of the Linux host .
Normally , in the Linux world , the way we respond to knowledge of a specific vulnerability is to patch the problem rather than scan for exploits , but there may be systems which cannot be restarted on short notice , and which could benefit from an updated scanning database while running code with known vulnerabilities .
Also , as Alan Cox pointed out , this feature could be useful for entirely different objectives , such as efficient indexing of files as they change .
What might be best of all , though , is that this hook could replace a number of rather less pleasant things being done by anti-malware vendors now .
Some of these products use binary - only modules , plant hooks into the system call table , and generally behave in unwelcome ways .
Moving all of that to a user - space process behind a well - defined API could be beneficial for everybody involved .
The patches have gotten a generally hostile reception on the kernel mailing lists , though .
Some developers are uninspired about the ultimate objective :
So you are going to try to force us to take something into the Linux kernel due to the security inadequacies of a totally different operating system ?
You might want to rethink that argument .
That 's an objection which can be worked around ; the kernel developers do not normally want to determine which applications will or will not be supported by the system as a whole .
Another objection , though , might be harder : this hook is said not to be the best solution to the problem .
Instead of putting a hook deep within the VFS layer , the anti-malware people could simply hook into the C library ( perhaps with LD_PRELOAD ) , put the malware scanning directly into the processes ( mail clients or web servers , say ) which are passing files through the system , or embed the scanning into a stackable filesystem implemented with FUSE ( or a similar mechanism ) .
That has led to counterarguments that scanning implemented in this manner could be evaded by a hostile application - by performing system calls directly , for example , instead of going through the C library .
Certain kinds of attacks , it is said , could get around a purely user - space solution .
That argument , however , highlights the real problem with this posting .
The patch includes a set of 13 " requirements , " including intercepting file opens , caching results , exempting processes , and so on .
But none of these requirements describe the problem which is really being solved .
In particular , as noted by Al Viro and others , there is no description of the threat which this patch is intended to mitigate :
Various people had been asking for _years_ to define what the hell are you trying to prevent .
Not only there 'd been no coherent answer ( and no , this list of requirements is _not_ that - it's " what kind of hooks do we want " ) , you guys seem to be unable to decide whether you expect the malware in question to be passive or to be actively evading detection with infected processes running on the host that does scanning .
If the scanning host could be infected , then a scanning mechanism which could be circumvented by a rogue program is indeed a problem .
But that is a very different threat than simply trying to prevent evil attachments from creating mayhem on Windows boxes ; it does not appear to be a threat which these patches are trying to address .
The lack of a clearly described problem has caused the discussion of these patches to go around in circles ; it is not possible to evaluate ( 1 ) whether the goals of these patches are worth supporting , or ( 2 ) whether the patches can actually be successful in achieving those goals .
The code , in other words , cannot be reviewed .
Until the TALPA developers can clarify that situation , their work will look like an example of " shoot first , then aim . "
That kind of code tends not to make it into the mainline , even if it could be useful in the end .
Godot Arrives
After months of speculation , Barack Obama has chosen his running mate : Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) .
The NY Times , Washington Post , and LA Times all have stories .
A text message was sent to Obama supporters at 3 A.M. reading : " Barack has chosen Senator Joe Biden to be our VP nominee .
Watch the first Obama - Biden rally live at 3 pm ET on www.barackobama.com
Spread the word ! "
Note the fact that he told his supporters to watch him on the Internet .
Broadcast TV ?
Not for the hip .
Biden has an unusual biography as well as pros and cons .
A brief rundown follows .
He was born in Scranton , PA , to a working - class Irish Catholic family .
They moved to Delaware whe he was 10 .
His father was a car salesman .
He went to college in Delaware and then got a law degree from Syracuse University .
Lawyers are drawn to politics like bees are to honey and at 27 was elected to the local county council .
At 29 he ran for the Senate and won , despite being constitutionally ineligible .
Fortunately , he hit 30 before being inaugurated so they let him him .
He has been in the Senate ever since and is now in his sixth term and running for reelection this year .
A few weeks after his election to the Senate , his wife and baby daughter were killed in a car accident and his two young sons were almost killed .
He wanted to resign from the Senate to care for his boys but the Democrats convinced him to stay on .
He decided to commute an hour and a half every day from his home near Wilmington , DE , to the Senate to maximize his time with them .
Thirty - five years later , he is still doing it .
In 1977 , he married his current wife , Jill .
He started an abortive run for President in 1987 but dropped out after he was caught plagiarizing part of a speech from a British politician , Neil Kinnock .
In February 1988 he suffered a brain aneurysm but recovered fully .
Biden is currently chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , a job he has held before .
He has also chaired the Senate Judiciary committee .
Like any politician , he has pros and cons .
First the pros .
Every serious observer of the Senate , on both sides of the aisle , readily admits that few , if any , senators know as much about foreign policy as Biden .
He shores up a critical weakness in Obama 's CV - - lack of foreign affairs experience .
When McCain attacks Obama for lack of experience , Biden is going to say : " John , Barack and I are a team and I 've been in the Senate 14 years longer than you and I 'm chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , a job you 've never held . "
This alone is worth the price of admission .
It makes it hard for the Republicans to attack the Democrats on foreign policy when the Democratic ticket has more experience than the Republican ticket ( short of McCain picking Colin Powell as Veep ) .
From an electoral point of view , Biden also has virtues .
While Obama would carry Delaware even with Dick Cheney on the ticket , Biden 's working - class roots in northern Appalachia are going to be a big plus during the campaign .
He is going to campaign in Pennsylvania , Virginia , West Virginia , Ohio , and North Carolina extensively .
He will also appeal to ethnic Catholics in the rust belt .
He certainly brings gravitas to the ticket .
He is one of the most senior people in Washington and about as prepared to be President as one can be .
He also has some cons .
As mentioned above , he plagiarized part of a speech in 1988 .
The Republicans will hammer him on for being dishonest .
He will apologize and say it was a long time ago .
Then the Republicans have a tough decision to make .
They can say : " There is no statute of limitations on people who are fundamentally dishonest so we can keep talking about this . "
But that runs the grave risk of the Democrats saying : " Fair enough .
Let 's also talk about McCain taking bribes from convicted felon Charles Keating also in the 1980s . "
Then the Republicans can't dismiss that by saying : " It was long ago . "
If both transgressions are big news , there is a chance people may see what McCain did as more serious than what Biden did .
A second Biden problem is that he has a severe case of verbal diarrhea .
He just can't shut up .
That does n't always add to his allure .
On the other hand , having run for the Senate seven times , he knows the basics of campaigning and dealing with the media .
A third liability is that he is old ( 65 ) .
It will be tough for Obama to hit McCain for being too old ( 71 ) when his own VP is almost as old .
Age might have been a strong argument , but with Biden on the ticket , the Democrats can't use that .
Finally , in 2016 , Biden will be 73 , probably too old to run for President himself so there might be a big primary battle .
Other than plagiarizing one speech , Biden is clean as a hounds ' tooth .
His first wife was tragically killed , then he remarried .
He has never been mentioned in any kind of sex scandal , financial scandal , or anything else .
If there had been any dirt on him , it would have come out during his many campaigns .
If Biden is elected Vice President , the Democrats lose a Senate seat .
He could resign from the Senate right after being elected , in which case the current governor , Ruth Minner ( D - DE ) would replace him .
Or he could wait until there is a new governor .
Currently , two Democrats are engaged in a gubernatorial primary there , Lt. Gov. John Carney is facing off against state treasurer Jack Markell .
But the state is so heavily Democratic that either one is expected to easily defeat whoever the Republicans nominate .
The Republican candidates are a former judge and an airline pilot , an indication that the Republicans have basically conceded the race already .
While it is an indirect plus , the choice of Biden greatly complicates McCain 's situation and enhances Mitt Romney 's chances .
The people most commonly named as being Veepable are former OMB director Rob Portman , Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R - MN ) , and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney .
Portman served as a representative from Ohio , a key swing state , but the Democrats will attack him by saying : " If you need any more proof that McCain will continue Bush 's economic policies , observe that he has chosen the architect of them as his running mate . "
Not a great selling point .
Pawlenty will instantly be compared to Biden and seen to be a lightweight .
He won election as governor of Minnesota in 2002 in a three - way race with 44 % of the vote .
In 2006 he was reelected 46.7 % to 45.7 % in another three - way race .
Thus he has never even won 50 % in his home state .
He has had a decent record as governor , but other than making some trips abroad to encourage foreign companies to invest in Minnesota , Pawlenty does n't know much about foreign affairs .
In the Vice Presidential debate , he wo n't be able to match up to the experienced Biden .
But at least he wo n't be cut off by the moderator on every answer .
That leaves Romney .
Romney was elected governor of a very blue state , Massachusetts , no small feat for a Republican , and had a long and successful career in business .
Wall Street loves him and he has had experience on the campaign trail and did well .
His only scandal is his 1983 trip from Boston to Canada with his dog in a box strapped to the roof of his car .
His real problem is his success .
He was worth about $ 250 million , but after his unsuccessful presidential campaign he 's down to his last $ 200 million .
Can you imagine what the Democrats are going to say ?
Try this : ( Long shot zooming in on mansion ) John McCain 's family is worth over $ 100 million but the exact amount is n't clear because they have consistently refused to release their complete tax returns .
McCain thinks that people earning a mere $ 4 million are n't rich .
He has so many houses he can't remember them all .
His chief economic advisor said our economic problems are all mental .
He just bought his daughter a $ 700,000 condo .
But McCain 's money is peanuts compared to his running mate , Willard Romney 's , whose net worth is more than $ 200 million .
Barack Obama was raised by a single mother and just finished paying of the loans he needed to take out to get through college .
His daughters get an allowance of $ 1 a week .
Who do you think understands how much you are struggling through the Bush economy ?
Get the idea ?
McCain plus Romney allows the Democrats to attack the Republicans as the Plutocrat Party .
With the experience issue partially nullified by Biden , it is not clear what their best strategy is .
Profiling McCain's war heroism will obviously be front and center , but will America 's admiration for his personal courage in Vietnam be enough to offset their personal economic worries ?
McCain could offset this by picking a Veep who pulled himself up by his bootstraps , rather than the son of a wealthy CEO who was later three - term governor of Michigan .
But except for Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R - LA ) , who is only 37 , he does n't have a lot of good choices .
Today 's Polls
We have three new polls , but all are pretty much as expected .
State Obama McCain Start End Pollster California 51 % 37 % Aug 20 Aug 20 Rasmussen Indiana 42 % 46 % Aug 19 Aug 21 Rasmussen Tennessee 32 % 56 % Aug 20 Aug 20 Rasmussen
Only one new Senate poll , but it is an important one .
Al Franken ( D ) is in a statistical tie with Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) in Minnesota .
Coleman had been way ahead .
This result suggests the race may be close after all .
State Democrat D-pct Republican R-pct Start End Pollster Minnesota Al Franken 41 % Norm Coleman * 40 % Aug 07 Aug 17 U. of Minnesota

The cognitive strategies humans use to regulate emotions can determine both neurological and physiological responses to potential rewards , a team of New York University and Rutgers University neuroscientists has discovered .
The findings , reported in the most recent issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience , shed light on how the regulation of emotions may influence decision making .
Previous research has demonstrated these strategies can alter responses to negative events .
However , less understood is whether such strategies can also efficiently regulate expectations of a future reward or a desired outcome .
Scientists have already determined that the expectation of a potential reward brings about positive feelings and aids recognizing environmental cues that predict future rewards .
Central to this process is the role of the striatum , a multi- faceted structure in the brain that is involved in reward processing — and which is especially engaged when potential rewards are predicted or anticipated .
However , the striatum signal is not always beneficial .
Its activity also correlates with drug - specific cravings , most likely increasing urges to partake in risk - seeking behavior in the pursuit of rewards that are detrimental .
Therefore , understanding how to regulate or control the positive feelings associated with reward expectation is an important line of inquiry .
The NYU study was conducted by a team of researchers from the laboratory of NYU Professor Elizabeth Phelps , who co-authored the work with Mauricio R. Delgado , now a professor at Rutgers University , and M. Meredith Gillis , an NYU graduate student .
They sought to better understand the influence of emotional regulation strategies on the physiological and neural processes relevant to expectations of reward .
The study 's subjects were presented with two conditioned stimuli , a blue and a yellow square that either predicted or did not predict a potential monetary reward .
Prior to each trial , participants were also given a written cue that instructed them to either respond to the stimulus ( " think of the meaning of the blue square , such as a potential reward " ) or regulate their emotional response to the stimulus ( " think of something blue in nature that calms you down , such as the ocean " ) .
Skin conductance responses ( SCRs ) of the participants were taken at the beginning of each conditioned stimulus .
These served as a behavioral measure of physiological reaction potentially related to reward anticipation .
The results showed that the participants ' emotion regulation strategies could influence physiological and neural responses relevant to the expectation of reward .
Specifically , results from the SCRs revealed that the subjects ' emotion regulation strategies decreased arousal that was linked to the anticipation of a potential reward .
" Our findings demonstrated that emotion regulation strategies can successfully curb physiological and neural responses associated with the expectation of reward , " said Delgado .
" This is a first step to understanding how our thoughts may effectively control positive emotions and eventual urges that may arise , such as drug cravings . "

Indian call centre workers are seeking more rewarding careers elsewhere .
A 23 - year - old man , barely out of college , has been recovering from a heart attack in hospital .
The doctor 's diagnosis : modern lifestyle - stress and odd hours of work .
He works at a call centre in Mumbai Alarmed ?
His colleagues at the call centre where he works are .
Says one of his best friends and colleague : " I 'm leaving .
Have been planning to for sometime .
" As soon as I get another job , even if it 's less paying , I will leave this industry for good . "
The youth of India seem to have fallen out of love with the call centre industry .
Even before the impact of the economic crisis could be felt on India 's $ 11bn business process outsourcing ( BPO ) industry , which gets 70 % of all the outsourced work from the US , it was in the grip of a crisis of its own .
Several companies , mostly smaller ones unable to maintain international standards , have shut down in Mumbai and Delhi .
Not a career Young men and women in call and contact centres across India are overworked and stressed out .
I feel that I should n't have jumped into a call centre right after graduation because it led to nowhere
Shameela Zaidi Many are leaving the industry .
Shabana Pavaskar , a senior employee at a reputable call centre in Mumbai , feels it is not a career , just a job .
" I have been working here for many years but there 's no promotion , no motivation and the hours are extremely demanding , " she says .
" Overtime is not an option but a compulsion .
A government job with a fairly less salary will be more feasible than working here . "
She says it loud , she says it clear .
And so do many others .
Regrettable choices
While Ms Pavaskar mulls over her next move , many have already left .
Those who have left say they quit because it was frustrating to continue to answer calls day after day , year after year .
Lower salaries have made call centre jobs less attractive .
No creativity , no use of mind required .
Some say their minds have become cabbage .
Shameela Zaidi was among the first to join the fledgling BPO industry at the beginning of the decade .
She was also one of the first among her colleagues to realise it was hardly a career .
" I feel that I should n't have jumped into a call centre right after graduation because it led to nowhere , " she says .
" Instead I should have studied further and earned an MBA ... and then advanced my career in the right way . "
Kainat Kashmiri , a widow , is also among those who left .
She found little time to spend with her growing son and the shifts were at odd hours .
" I did n't get time to spend with my son and my health completely deteriorated , " she says .
" The other important thing is that there is no growth in terms of salary and career . "
Tough to recruit Call centres hold no attraction for these people any more .
They are changing professions .
Where 's the time to use their damn gym or cafeteria or other facilities ?
Shabana Pavaskar
Some are pursuing higher studies in order to get into an industry where there are better opportunities for career growth .
Ms Kashmiri has become a teacher ;
Ms Zaidi has since finished her MBA and is now readying herself for a new career .
Abhishek Tiwari , with many years behind him as a call centre man , left the industry recently despite being promoted to senior manager and recruiting youngsters for his call centre .
He has completely changed his career and seems to be very happy .
" There was a time when our office was cluttered with 500 to 600 people who came for recruitment in one day , " he says .
" Today , even after lowering our standards , getting 40 - 50 people a day was a struggle . "
Aditya Ghia , who runs a recruitment company , hires people on behalf of his BPO clients .
" Some of the KPO ( Knowledge process outsourcing ) and the accounts - based outsourcing firms are not doing well , " he says .
" That 's one of the primary reasons why youngsters are looking at alternative careers . "
Lower pay Mark Kobayashi-Hillary , author of a new book - Who Moved My Job - and the director of the UK National Outsourcing Association , believes there are several factors at play in India .
He says the rapid growth in other sectors in India is making different industries attractive for young graduates .
Another factor is the changing nature of the call centre industry , he says .
" The requirement for companies to answer their consumers by phone , e-mail , or IM on a 24/7 basis has never been so critical - consumers demand rapid service now and a lot of companies are recruiting locally instead of internationally . "
He also said that salaries in the call centre industry had fallen .
The industry has tried hard to make it lucrative for young people by creating cool recreational facilities and improving infrastructure , but that has failed to stop them from leaving for greener pastures .
" Where 's the time to use their damn gym or cafeteria or other facilities ? " says Ms Pavaskar .
Some call centres have lowered their recruitment standards to solicit young people .
Several companies , faced with a paucity of graduates , are spreading their net wider by hiring under - graduates .
As a result , experts say , the standards are falling and they are losing outsourced work from the US .
Has the industry , which hopes to hit the $ 50bn mark by 2012 , peaked ?
Jitendra Sanghvi , deputy secretary general of The Indian Merchants Chamber , is optimistic .
" It 'll hit the $ 50 bn mark for sure , but it 'll take longer than stipulated , " he insists .
Those who have left the industry believe it will not become a full - blown crisis , but the alarm bells are ringing .
Experts say the industry needs to overhaul itself if it wants to reach its target , but in the current financial climate this seems a tall order .

I ’ve begun using Newsvine.com again , for some of my longer writing .
Here ’s my first article .
http://howgoodisthat.newsvine.com/_news/2008/04/25/1453507-an-appeal-to-all-intelligent-christians
Dear intelligent Christians of Newsvine .
As an atheist , I believe in one fewer God than you do .
But this is n’t another of those ultimately pointless rant pieces about the difference between Zeus and Mithra ; what you believe and what I believe .
This is about something far more important than that .
This is an appeal to the doctors and software programmers , teachers and architects , bishops and policemen in the newsvine community and beyond , who are college educated , responsible , rationally minded people who just so happen to attend a Yahweh believing church on a regular basis .
On more than one occasion in the past , I ’ve found myself talking with someone who is religious and I ’ve caught myself in the curious position of feeling like I ’m talking down to them ; being patronising to someone who I had no intention of offending .
If that ’s how my words read , I can assure you that my thoughts did not sound that way when they were leaving my brain , causing the nerve endings in my finger tips to agitate and hit the corresponding keys on my keyboard .
Having said that , however good my intentions to simply talk with you as one adult to another , it ’s an unfortunate fact that 50 % of those reading this from within the United States , will be grossly offended by what I now have to say .
Because there is no easy way to say , I ’m sorry , but you ’re fundamentally wrong to oppose the teaching of Darwin ’s fact of evolution through natural selection in your schools .
I ’m a Brit .
But , given my passive aggressive mix of a moderately consolatory beginning , leaping immediately into a hardline insistence of fact , you ’d probably already worked that out .
In my country , children are taught science in reverse order .
Beginning with biology and ending with physics .
Since I had a relatively good introduction to the sciences in my Catholic run school , the fact that my school has continued to do well in performance tables , many years after I left , is a good indicator that in the intervening years no group of militant parents have come along , hijacked the board and begun insisting that the teaching of the holy trinity myth in R.E. class , takes primacy over the teaching of chemistry and biology in the science class .
However , a movement which some of you reading this in certain States will be more familiar with than others , known as Intelligent Design , is intending to do just such a thing in your publicly funded schools , when it comes to the education of the next generation of voters , policemen , teachers and priests , who will be running your country when you ’ve retired .
Intelligent Design says that because Darwin ’s fact of evolution through natural selection does not require a supernatural explanation for how life on Earth originated , it is therefore false – because on page one , chapter one of the bible , it clearly states the opposite .
Unfortunately for I.D. advocates , Charles Darwin ’s fact of evolution through natural selection is n’t about the origins of life on Earth – it is about how life on Earth evolved once it had already appeared .
Advocates of I.D. , nevertheless , rage on ; building their argument based around the idea that being proven wrong time and time again , is merely proof that they are being discriminated against .
The cause celebré of the Intelligent Design movement , at the moment , is a filmmaker called Ben Stein and his ‘ Expelled ’ documentary , currently in theatres .
Chief among the most offensive of the film ’s many erroneous claims , are it ’s staggeringly ignorant attempts to portray people who support Darwin ’s fact of evolution through natural selection as being proponents of the Nazi pseudo - science , Eugenics .
Stein ’s film does this by deliberately misquoting Charles Darwin ’s writings , to make them seem as if he inspired Hitler , who ’s attempts to prove that the human race would be better off without ‘ Jewish blood ’ in the gene pool , was in some way a justification to murder millions of doctors , teachers , policemen , lawyers , authors , scientists – all because they were non-Arian .
Ben Stein , himself Jewish , by deliberately altering select quotations from Darwin , in his film , in order to have Darwin appear to say something he equivocally did not , is offensive enough .
But saying that this is proof that evolution is therefore evil and incompatible with the beliefs of those from any of the monotheistic faiths , is quite another .
The film is , in my opinion , nothing short of being one long hate - speech , aimed at anyone who has , in their own mind and for their own reasons , decided they are no -longer interested in bronze - age guess work about our place in the cosmos .
Stein and the pro-I.D. movement are effectively telling all religious American voters , that if you want to be on the side of God , you have to be against Charles Darwin and all of the science which has come from a greater understanding of natural selection , in the intervening 150 years since his work was first published .
Here is why Ben Stein is wrong and you should do all you can to tell as many people as you can he is wrong , next Sunday at your church of choice .
Place a tennis ball on an uneven surface and give it a gentle push .
See how it wobbles along , before coming to a stop ?
Now pick up the ball and drop it from shoulder height .
See how it bounces at first , maybe twice and then rolls away again , only this time further than before ?
Why did that happen ?
Was it because you believed it would ?
Or was it because it was being acted upon by an invisible force , some people refer to as gravity ?
Well , there ’s only one way to find out – and this may take several million years , so you might want to make a flask of coffee .
First , drop the ball from varying heights thirty or forty billion times and count how many times , instead of dropping to the floor , bouncing once or twice and then rolling away , the ball shoots off into the air , into the sky , though the clouds and into space .
Assuming the occurrences of this are low , how safe is it to assume that , more often than not , an object with mass , when in close proximity to an object of greater mass , will be attracted towards that greater mass , until the force of the smaller object ’s energy is reduced so much , that it stops moving ?
Very safe ?
Moderately safe ?
Let ’s agree it ’s an almost infinitesimally large number ratio to one that this law of motion , as first observed , tested and proven by Isaac Newton , will ever be proven wrong .
You will note , we are not saying categorically this law will absolutely never ever be broken , just that it is so unlikely to be anything other than utterly reliable , that it may as well be referred to henceforth not as a theory , but as a fact .
So , what has the movement of objects in an electromagnetic force got to do with Charles Darwin ’s ‘ theory ’ of evolution through natural selection ?
Darwin observed , tested and proved that over millions of geological years on Earth , complex life could only have evolved from less complex organisms .
At first , simple bacteria and later simple marine life – in the abundant oceans .
He proved that all life on Earth , in fact , sprang forth from this primeval soup .
He did n’t do this by insisting that his belief that this was how life evolved was right , regardless of contradictory evidence .
He proved that this was true precisely because of the evidence that he could not disprove .
He searched all of his life for a possible mistake he may have made in his observations .
As did his peers .
As did thousands of successive generations of scientists from around the world for the past 150 years .
None of them , not even once , unearthing a single shred of doubt that his work was anything other than the single greatest scientific achievement in the history of human kind .
Darwin was able , using his observations , to repeat the equivalent of the tennis ball dropping from a height experiment for hundreds of millions of years and make predictions about its outcome ; that animals , which in his time he could n’t have known anything about , nevertheless we have since discovered to exist , would show specific kinds of behaviour when living in certain temperate regions ; the kinds of feeding environments they would most likely dwell within and what kind mating habits they would display ; courting rituals , reciprocal altruism with other species .
The list of predictions about the natural world which evolution makes , which have all been proven to be true , grows all the time and has never fallen short of explaining all of them .
Evolution dwarfs the achievement of space flight and many other areas of scientific endeavour – even Quantum electrodynamics is less understood than evolution – and if you doubt the findings of that field of science , what ’s that thing with an Apple logo on it , sitting on the desk in front of you ?
To deny Darwin ’s legacy to our future selves , because a tiny minority of politically motivated religious elite want to say it represents something which it emphatically does not ; about the only intelligent life forms in the whole of the universe , as far as we know , in a brighter more enlighten tomorrow , will be quite simply unfathomable to our grandchildren – but only if we do what it should be our sworn duty to do before it is too late ; speak the truth , because the truth will set us free .
Former man on the moon Dr. Edgar Mitchell found himself in the news today regarding remarks he made on the British radio program Kerrang !
about believing in alien beings – and the long - rumored UFO crash in Roswell , New Mexico .
In the wake of that flap , the American astronaut set the record straight in an interview with Lisa Bonnice , host of BlogTalkRadio ’s ShapeShifting , saying that though there was indeed a cover - up at Rosewell , NASA knew nothing about it – at least not to his knowledge .
Here ’s the full transcript of Mitchell ’s discussion :
LISA BONNICE : Dr. Mitchell , thank you for joining me today .
EDGAR MITCHELL : It ’s a pleasure .
Thank you very much .
LB : As we were mentioning before the show started , you really stirred up a hornet ’s nest , strangely enough , and like you said , you ’ve been saying this for years .
EM : I do n’t know what really got things stirred up , perhaps it was the Larry King show .
I do n’t know .
LB : Could be .
But basically people are freaking out that you were aware of several UFO visits .
EM : That ’s not quite right .
You use that in the plural .
I was talking about the Roswell incident , the Roswell visitation primarily , but there have been many others that have been reported that I have no personal awareness of but that was the one that I was really talking about .
LB : So the interview has been a little misquoted .
But you actually have information about the Roswell incident ?
EM : Yes and my information comes from what I call “ the old timers , ” because I grew up in the Roswell area and when I went to the moon , some of the old timers from that period , some locals , and others military and intelligence people , who were under rather severe oaths to not reveal any of this and kind of wanted to get their conscience clear and off their chests before they passed on , selected me and said , independently – this was n’t a group effort – independently that maybe I might be a safe person to tell their story to .
And all of them confirmed , and what I ’m saying is they confirmed the Roswell incident was a real incident and they in some way had some part in it that they wanted to talk about .
LB : What is it that they told you ?
EM : Well , that the crash of an alien spacecraft in the Roswell area was a real event and much of the lore , I ca n’t say all of the lore , but much of the fact that dead bodies were recovered and live ones were recovered , that they were not of this world , was the story .
And of course it was reported in the Roswell Daily Record one day and promptly denied the next day and a cover story of a weather balloon , and that was pure nonsense .
That was a cover-up .
LB : Why do you suppose , I mean there ’s all kinds of reasons over the years , but you ’re in the inner circle .
Why do you actually think they did the cover - up ?
Do you think it ’s because they thought we ’re just not sophisticated enough yet ?
Maybe mankind was n’t ready ?
EM : Well , the best story , I believe , is simply because this is right in the aftermath of World War II , the Cold War with the Soviet Union was starting to get under way , there was great suspicion of anything having to do with protecting the skies and advanced technology .
Also , the U.S. Army Air Corps had just been separated to become an independent service called the Air Force .
The intelligence service of World War II , the OSS , had disbanded to become the modern CIA , and so President Truman at that point really was on the horns of a dilemma .
Here the Air Force is charged with presumably protecting the skies and the advanced technologies of our nation and the intelligence services did n’t really know what to do with an alien spacecraft and did n’t know whether they were hostile or otherwise , and did n’t want the Soviets to get involved with that , or know about it , so the easiest thing to do was lie about it , cover it up and have it classified and deny that it happened .
And that ’s what has happened and unfortunately , or maybe fortunately , I do n’t know , that President Truman then elected a committee of very high level military and civilian academicians and people and formed the Military and Joint Intelligence Committee .
Abbreviated MAJIC or “ Majic 12 , ” that ’s what it was called , and gave them power to manage this so - called alien presence or crash or whatever they were going to do .
And they passed a very secretive bill that gave authority , perhaps too much authority , and over the last 60 years since that incident , things have been continuously covered up , lied about , hidden , and people have not been able to get in to that – including Barry Goldwater when he was a presidential candidate – tried to crack into it and get the information out and was denied .
President Ford later tried to get some information out and was denied .
President Carter , had his own experience and said he had seen UFOs and tried to find out more and could n’t get it and never mentioned it again .
President Clinton , Ambassador Hubbell tried to get information and was denied .
So this has been well covered up for years starting with the fact that perhaps here was an alien craft in our skies , not knowing whether it was hostile or friendly .
LB : So do you think that now , 60 years later , we ’re finally ready to start believing this ?
Because , my God , the skepticism , I do n’t know how anybody can think that we are the only life in this incredibly huge universe .
EM : Well that ’s a good place to start .
Are we alone in the universe ?
And of course science has not been able to prove that we are or that we are not .
But we ’ve been looking , of course , for habitable planets throughout our galaxy and star systems close enough to be observable and coming slowly to the conclusion that yes there are inhabitable planets out there .
But that ’s a long way from saying we ’ve been visited .
It ’s only this type of incident with some very serious research people that have been doing this for years , and I ’m not one of them , I ’m kind of a Johnny Come Lately to it , that know the answers well or better than I do .
LB : The interviews are quoted as saying that you say sources at NASA who had contact with aliens …
EM : That is totally false .
LB : Then let ’s clear that up .
EM : Yes , please do .
That is not correct .
Because I have talked with government people about it , and military people about it , that was a misquote .
LB : Good .
I ’m glad to clear that one up .
Have you seen the reports ?
The articles that are going around ?
EM : I ’ve seen some of them .
They ’ve been floating into my computer all day long .
LB : Is there anything else in these articles that you would like to use as an opportunity to say “ OK , they misquoted me ” ?
EM : I would have to look at them individually , but that ’s one that , to my knowledge , has nothing to do with NASA .
LB : One of these quotes said that whoever did describe these beings said they resembled “ little people who look strange to us . ”
EM : Well , we ’ve all seen the pictures of the so - called aliens – “ little grays . ”
I have no first - hand evidence that that ’s true , but I do accept the fact that those seem to be the prevalent story .
LB : That does seem to be what the majority of people who say they ’ve seen them agree upon .
Now another one , this one I can see makes so much sense that our technology is not nearly as sophisticated and if they had been hostile we would have been gone by now .
EM : Well , if they proved to be hostile , and wanted to do so , they probably could .
But there ’s utterly no evidence that they really are hostile .
LB : Like you said , if they were , and they were more sophisticated than we are , then what are we doing still sitting here ?
EM :
The craft they they ’ve seen are basically are smaller crafts , they ’re not warships or anything .
And most of the UFO sitings , you know hundreds of military pilots were told to shut up about it , and airline pilots and police officers at night and people who have seen real crafts and I ’m not talking about Venus or Mars or a star or planet but who have seen a real craft , they ’re generally not described as anything like any of ours .
LB : You mentioned in the beginning that they actually found in the Roswell case live beings .
Did anyone tell you what happened with that ?
EM : That ’s what I understand .
Apparently that individual did survive for some time , as far as I know .
But I ca n’t go further than that because I do n’t know any more .
LB : What do you think of NASA ’s statement that “ Dr. Mitchell is a great American but we do n’t share his opinions ” ?
EM : I can understand if they think I was attributing anything to the NASA organization , or deriving anything from the NASA organization , they can certainly say that .
And it ’s true because none of my experience or what I said relates to NASA at all .
LB : You were only in the astronaut program for a fairly short period of time .
EM : For seven years , that ’s true .
LB : This is just fascinating information and I ’m really glad that it ’s really kind of bubbling up even though it might be making your life a little crazy right now .
I really do believe mankind has reached a point in its evolution to where finding out this is real is n’t going to make us all freak out .
EM : I totally agree with that .
It ’s about time and if indeed , as we now believe , we ’re not alone in the universe and there are other species and intelligent species throughout the universe , and the universe is much bigger than we thought it was , this is good knowledge .
It ’s important knowledge .
LB : It really is .
We ’re out of time so quickly , it went so fast .
Are there any last statements you ’d like to make that we have n’t talked about ?
EM : Well , I think the only thing that people should understand is that our star system has a finite lifetime and we ’ve got to continue our space exploration .
We only have a couple more billion years to be on the planet .
We do n’t have to rush it but eventually we have to be off this planet if we want to survive as a species .
Growing in vs. growing out Jason 51 comments Latest by Arlen
Now that Basecamp is 2.5 years old , we ’ve been getting some heat from a few folks who ’ve been with us since the beginning .
They are saying they are starting to grow out of the app .
Their businesses are becoming more complex and their requirements are changing .
They want us to change Basecamp to mirror their new - found complexity and requirements .
We ’re saying no .
And here ’s why :
We ’d rather our customers grow out of our products eventually than never be able to grow into them in the first place .
The problem with following the complexity curve of your customer ’s own businesses and requirements is that eventually your product becomes so complex that the barrier to entry is too high for new customers .
And then eventually you die with your current customers .
You may keep your current customers in the short term , but if no one new can fit through the door then eventually you ’re in trouble .
It ’s ok for software to be “ temporary . ”
Everything else is temporary , why not software ?
You probably do n’t use the same computer you did 5 years ago .
You probably do n’t live in the same apartment or have the same car either .
And you may be in a different relationship too .
Why are software companies afraid if people grow out of things after awhile ?
We ’re also saying no because we believe in simple tools no matter how complex your business is .
People are still people no matter what company they are part of .
People still need simple to - do lists , easy ways to communicate with their team , real - time group chat without audio and video overhead , a place to keep notes , etc .
A big complex company does n’t change these small simple needs .
Remember , unless you ’re Microsoft there are always more people that are n’t using your product than people that are .
Make sure you make it easy for new people to get in .
That ’s where your real continued growth potential is .
Disclaimer :
We are not suggesting that you do n’t pay attention to your current customers .
90 % of everything we add to our products originates in existing customer requests .
It ’s more that we acknowledge that people and situations change and we ca n’t be everything to everyone .
Companies need to be true to a type of customer more than a specific individual customer who ’s needs may change .
( e.g. Ferraris are made for people who like sportscars .
If you outgrow your Ferrari and need a minivan then you ’ve changed and need to look to another product ) .
