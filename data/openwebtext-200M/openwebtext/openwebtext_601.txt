Barack Obama 's campaign is trying to clear up voters ' confusion over this year 's voting procedures with a new web page aimed at dispelling some of the rumors that have been flying around supporter e-mail lists .
The campaign 's " Voter Protection Rumor Control " page was launched after several Obama supporters started e-mailing each other voting procedure information that was sometimes wrong .
Though Obama 's page is aimed at voters in Florida , such e-mail traffic has been seen on other regional group supporter lists , notably in Texas .
One subject of particular confusion is the option of being able to engage in straight party voting in several states , where a voting machine picks all the candidates by party for the voter .
Obama 's page debunks the rumor that " after you vote for Obama , you need to vote a ' straight Democratic ticket ' or your vote for president wo n’t count . "
There is no straight party ticket voting option in Florida .
But some states do offer that option , and that can lead to people inadvertently screwing up their choices .
" What most people do n't realize is , is that when they go through the ballot , they can de-select certain things if they press the candidate 's name twice , " says Pamela Smith , president of the election integrity group Verified Voting .
" The best choice for people is to skip the straight party option and go directly to their candidate and mark for their candidate . "
The group plans on providing voters with more information about their voting systems sometime within the next week or so through the group 's Verifier map , Smith says .
Voters can currently look up the kind of voting system their county uses , but the group will enhance it with pictures of the machines and their interfaces so that voters can familiarize themselves with the process .
Instructions on how to use the machines will also be available .

In a sign that Wall Street is waking up to the political tempest over billions of dollars in year - end bonuses likely to be paid out at securities firms lining up for government infusions , top executives are in discussions to possibly cap their own compensation , according to people familiar with the situation .
While the discussions remain fluid and many details still must be agreed to , the talks underscore an emerging consensus among some of the securities industry 's most powerful executives that the escalating pay controversy is creating yet another public - relations mess for Wall Street .
" There are going to be some people in the financial - services industry who will show real leadership here and recognize the reality of the situation , " one senior Wall Street official said .
At least one major firm has looked at former PepsiCo Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Enrico 's move in 1998 to give up his $ 900,000 salary .
Instead , Mr. Enrico asked PepsiCo directors to fund scholarships for children of " frontline employees . "
Mr. Enrico still got a $ 1.8 million bonus that year .
And as Wall Street firms examine their pay and bonuses , distinctions are being made between the highest - ranking executives and lower - level traders and investment bankers who are n't widely known beyond Wall Street but could get plucked away by rival firms if compensation practices are significantly altered .
There are many ways to get things done in the world of diplomacy .
You can kill 'em with kindness , or you can just try to kill 'em .
On a conference call today with reporters on the topic of the New York Times , John McCain strategist Steve Schmidt chose option B .
It 's not as though Schmidt and the New York Times were once like Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston – the two never took long walks in the park , giggling about ponies , gumdrops , and having kids .
There 's a festering history .
And today marked another chapter .
The wheels fell off
The call started off fine .
Then came a question about a story in the Times this morning about McCain campaign manager Rick Davis 's former high - paying job as a lobbyist with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
It 's a particularly touchy subject , in light of the recent government takeover of the two mortgage firms and the subsequent hard - hitting McCain campaign ads attempting to tie Obama to the mess .
Schmidt spotted the opportunity to take a swipe at the Times like a running back sees a hole in the defensive line .
“ Let ’s be clear and be honest with each other about something fundamental to this race , which is this :
Whatever the New York Times once was , it is today not — by any standard — a journalistic organization , ” Schmidt said .
“ It is a pro-Obama advocacy organization that every day attacks the McCain campaign , attacks Senator McCain , attacks Governor Palin and excuses Senator Obama . ”
And another thing
Schmidt said the New York Times has basically given Barack Obama a free pass in regards to the Senator 's records , statements , and any of his " deceitful " campaign spots .
" It is an organization that has made a decision to has cast aside its journalistic integrity and to advocate for the defeat of one candidate ... and advocate for the election of another candidate , " he said .
Sports
Why 'd he do it ?
Everyone seems to be using the sports analogy of " working the refs . "
If he complains enough , the other media organizations will back down and play equalizer .
You know , like a bald Phil Jackson .
Or maybe more like a bald Lou Pinella .
Former Bush Press Secretary Ari Fleischer compares it to baseball anyway .
" I think Steve was accurately reflecting the views of his campaign , " Fleischer wrote in an email to The Vote blog .
" Just about every Republican campaign feels that way about the media from time to time .
Dealing with the press is sometimes a little like pitching in baseball – everyone once in a while you have to throw high and inside and hope it results in better coverage next time .
Sometimes it does , most often , it does not . "
John Kerry
The Huffington Post 's Sam Stein summons the ghost of the 2004 campaign in a piece titled , " McCain was for the NYT before he was against it . "
For a party that rails against the New York Times , the Republicans sure depend on the Grey Lady to score political points .
Since the end of the primary , John McCain 's campaign has sent at least 60 emails to its rapid response list that reference the New York Times .
NYT responds
By the way , the Times – not surprisingly – has n't cowered and apologized .
Instead , the executive editor released a standard statement .
“ The New York Times is committed to covering the candidates fully , fairly and aggressively , ” Keller wrote .
“ It ’s our job to ask hard questions , fact - check their statements and their advertising , examine their programs , positions , biographies and advisers .
Candidates and their campaign operatives are not always comfortable with that level of scrutiny , but it ’s what our readers expect and deserve . ”

Steve Winter 's winning image of a snow leopard on a night - time prowl
In pictures : Images from Wildlife Photographer of the Year
A picture of an elusive snow leopard on a night - time prowl has won the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2008 award .
Steve Winter 's image was captured during a 13 - month quest to snap the perfect photo of the endangered species in its hostile habitat high in the mountains of Central Asia .
Speaking about his winning snap , Mr Winter said : " I was thrilled to have finally captured the shot I had dreamed of - a wild snow leopard in its true element . "
The competition , now in its 44th year , is run by BBC Wildlife magazine and London 's Natural History Museum .
The panel of judges spent months shifting through more than 32,350 entries before deciding on the winners .
" Everything comes together in this striking picture , " said judge Mark Carwardine on Mr Winter 's image .
" The drama of the snow , the mystery of the darkness , the posture of the rarely photographed snow leopard and the intriguing composition . "
SNOWSTORM LEOPARD
The picture of an elusive snow leopard , captured at an altitude of more than 13,000ft in India 's Ladak 's Hemis High Altitude National Park , was the reward for 13 months of effort for Steve Winter , a photographer for National Geographic magazine .

" I try to do stories that have never been done before , " he told BBC News .
" They do involve an incredible amount of work with scientists and local people .
We were lucky in this instance that we got incredible pictures .
" It was collaboration between myself , the team and the snow leopard , " he joked .
The project involved 14 remote cameras in roughly 45 locations .
It was a case of trial and error - one camera only delivered a picture of half of a leopard in five - and - a - half months .
Working in such harsh conditions , where temperatures plummeted to - 40C ( - 40 F ) , he asked the manufacturers for their advice on the performance of the cameras in extreme temperatures .
" They told me : ' We do n't know , tell us when you get back ' , " he recalled .
Commenting on the use of trigger cameras rather than being sat behind the lens , Mr Winter said : " They are something that needs to be used to get intimate portraits of elusive animals .
" I used to hate these cameras because they just gave you a record of an animal .
" Images are all about composition and light .
If I can not control that as if I would as I put the camera up to my face , then essentially I have failed .
" So I asked myself that if I did not like these cameras , how can I like them more .
" It turns out that snow leopards are the perfect species on which to use these cameras .
They always come to specific locations to mark their territory .
" So I viewed the locations as movie sets .
I put the cameras there , I put the lights there .
" I knew the animal would come ; it was just waiting for the actor to walk on stage and break the beam . "

It was taken by teenager Catriona Parfitt during a family safari holiday in 2007 .
" When the giraffe first arrived , it was very nervous , " Catriona explained .
" As it walked slowly towards the water , it kept looking over its shoulder towards the ridge where there was a pride of four lions . "
She added that perhaps the young lion saw a solitary giraffe as too much of a temptation to leave alone , despite the risks .

The monkey earned his nickname " trouble - maker " , Stefano explained , because it was more interested in the photographer than being photographed .
After spending weeks following the monkeys in the Indonesian island 's Tangkoko National Park , Stefano found that their search for food took them to the coastal edge of the park 's forest .
While most of the primates were busy foraging among the rocks for fallen fruits and nuts , one young adult took an interest in Stefano 's activities .
" He would leap at me and kick off my back like a trampoline , " he recalled .
" It was part play , part confrontation , part attention - seeking , part curiosity . "

He told BBC News that the photo was just a glimpse of a struggle between a tree - frog and cat - eyed tree - snake that lasted for hours through the night in the tropical forests of Belize .
" The snake had failed to get its jaws around the whole of the frog 's head , " he recalled .
" It would n't let go , presumably because the frog would have leapt away .
But it could n't swallow it , either . "
Neither of the creatures showed any sign of giving up in the three hours that David sat in a cramped position .
" It was a complete stalemate , " he added .
In the early hours , when the pair had moved beyond the focus of his lens , David decided to call it a night .
When he returned in the following morning , there was no sign of the pair and no clue to which had finally broken the deadlock .

Paulson briefed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders at a meeting on Thursday night .
Following the meeting , Paulson said the group 's discussion focused on financial institutions ' illiquid assets .
" What we are working on now is an approach to deal with the systemic risk and stresses in our capital markets , " Paulson said .
" As we 've said for some time , the root cause for the stress in the capital markets is the real estate correction and what 's going on in terms of the price declines in real estate , " he said .
" We 're coming together to work on an expeditious solution , which is aimed right at the heart of this problem , which is illiquid assets on financial institutions ' balance sheets . "
Charlie Gasparino breaks the story on Paulson 's plan .
Watch the accompanying video .
A Treasury statement said Paulson and Bernanke were exploring all options available to them and would work with congressional leaders through the weekend .
A government official speaking to CNBC ruled out any formal announcements Thursday or Friday .
The meeting , held at Pelosi 's office , included House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid , other Senate and House leaders from both political parties , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , and SEC Chairman Christopher Cox .
The Bush administration wants to make sure Congress is behind the idea before it moves ahead on the plan , a source told CNBC .
Pelosi , a Democrat , said in a letter to Bush Thursday that the worsening economy demands another bipartisan economic recovery effort , and that Congress will stand ready beyond the Sept. 26 scheduled adjournment date to consider legislation .
The creation of a government facility for bad debts , according to its advocates , would allow banks to shovel bad debt off their balance sheets and allow the firms to go back to business as usual .
It would also eliminate the need for individual company bailouts .
In turn , that could allow the housing market to recover because it would restore banks willingness to lend .
A federal government plan could also involve FDIC - type protection for money market funds , according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .
" This will bring real trust back into the market . "
Donald Marron , chairman of Lightyear Capital , said on CNBC .
" It would free up real , spendable capital in these organizations .
They can use that to make loans , to make transactions and to build confidence in the system .
This is a confidence crisis . "
The news sparked a big rally in stocks after a day in which investors remained nervous about the spreading effects the global credit crisis .
The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve , which engineered an $ 85 billion rescue plan for insurer American International Group earlier this week , declined to comment .
The aide also pointed to an opinion piece in Wednesday 's Wall Street Journal by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , former Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig and former Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in which they said such a body could buy up troubled real estate debt to get credit markets working again .
For Investors
However , getting Congress to approve such a plan quickly would likely be difficult because lawmakers plan to leave by the end of the month to campaign for the Nov. 4 election .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino declined to comment on what steps , if any , the Bush administration was considering .
She also questioned whether doing something in the middle of a market correction was wise and acknowledged it could be difficult to approve something quickly .
Sarah Palin made a attack against Obama that he was “ ” Palling Around With Terrorists . ”
No surprise that the McCain Camapaign would not return the call from CNN .

( CNN ) --
Two days after the House rejected the $ 700 billion bailout bill , the Senate is set to vote on the rescue plan for financial institutions .
Rep . Ron Paul said he believes the $ 700 bailout bill will not solve the financial crisis .
The vote is scheduled for after sundown Wednesday .
Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain , Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama , and Obama 's running mate , Sen . Joe Biden , all said they would be present for the vote .
Speaking to CNN's John Roberts on Wednesday , House Financial Services Committee member and former Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul discussed why he thinks the bailout bill is the wrong solution to the economic problem and what he would do to secure financial security .
John Roberts : Congressman , great to see you .
I was browsing around on your Web site , Campaign for Liberty .
And right there on the very front page , you are appealing to your supporters -- and there are tens of thousands of them -- to get in touch with key senators to tell them to vote this bill down when it comes to a vote in the Senate at sundown tonight .
Why do you want them to vote it down ?
Rep. Ron Paul : I think it 's a bad bill .
I think it 's bad for the taxpayers .
I think it 's doing more of the same thing .
The same policy that we 're following now with this bill is exactly how we got into that trouble .
Watch Ron Paul explain why he opposes the bailout »
And you know , I really do n't have that much clout in Washington , D.C.
And I recognize it .
But there are a couple people outside of Washington that care about what I 'm thinking and care about free market ... economics .
And they will respond .
And I think we did help generate a little bit of mail to the House members .
So you go where you can have the influence .
And I think that people -- the grassroots -- understand this a lot better than members of Congress give them credit for .
Roberts :
So , instead of the bills that are currently before the Senate , the one that may be before the House as early as Thursday , what would you do ?
Paul :
Well , we need to do a lot , but a lot differently .
We have to recognize how we got into this problem .
We have too much debt .
We have too much malinvestment .
Roberts : OK , OK .
So we recognize all of the things that got us here .
But , right now , today , what would you do , if not this bill ?
Paul :
You have to liquidate those mistakes .
Those mistakes were made due to monetary policy .
So you have to allow the market to adjust prices downward .
And that 's what we 're not allowing to do .
If there are too many houses and the prices are too high , the sooner we get the prices down to the market level , as soon as we quit trying to encourage more housing -- this is what we 're doing .
They 're trying to stimulate houses and keep prices high .
It 's exactly opposite of what we should do .
So , we should get out of the way and not buy up bad debt .
There 's illiquid assets , but most of those are probably worthless .
They 're mostly derivatives .
And we 're sticking those with the taxpayer .
So we have to recognize that the liquidation of debt is crucial .
And if we did that , we would have tough times , there 's no doubt about it , for a year .
But if we keep propping a system up that 's not viable , we 're going to have a problem for decades , just like we did in the Depression .
That 's what we 're on the verge of doing .
Roberts : Congressman Paul , what do you think of this idea that 's being floated -- this process called mark to market , which would , they would modify the rules so that the , right now , paper that a lot of these institutions are holding , which is worth nothing , they would actually be able to assign some sort of value to it .
Some people are saying that that would just hide the problem .
Other people are wondering if maybe that might create some sort of voodoo accounting that would allow widespread abuse in the system .
What do you think ?
Paul :
It demonstrates the problem .
You know , when they prevented them from marking them down , this was an SEC [ Securities and Exchange Commission ] regulation .
Shows how regulations backfire .
If you had a market economy and then if you had a market - adjusted FDIC , where insurance was based on the strength of the bank , this would have happened on a daily basis .
But instead , we insure everybody , no matter what the bank is doing , and we do it , either we overkill -- we give you too much credit on bad investments -- and then we make changes all of a sudden , and they 're drastic , to what they have done .
So , it 's impossible .
It 's either too little or too much .
And what you need is insurance of , FDIC type of insurance , has to be driven by the marketplace to measure the viability of a bank .
Roberts :
So what do you think ?
Paul :
This adds to all the moral hazard that we have in the system .
Roberts :
So what do you then think of this idea of raising the limit on [ FDIC ] insurance to $ 250,000 , from its current cap of $ 100,000 ?
Paul :
Well , on the short run it will calm the markets .
People will feel better .
I might even personally feel better for a week or two .
But I know that long term , it 's the wrong thing to do .
I opposed this in the early ' 80s when they went from 30 [ thousand dollars ] to 100 [ thousand dollars ] , saying it would lead to more problems like this with malinvestment .
It would cover over the mistakes .
And the same thing will happen .
But if we raise it to 250 [ thousand dollars ] , people are going to feel better , then it will keep the bubble going for a little while longer and putting more pressure on the dollar .
If the dollar lasts longer , then finally the world will give up on the dollar -- and then we will have a big problem that nobody has even really begun to think about .
Roberts :
A lot of people might hope that you 're wrong with your projection .
Paul : I do too .
I hope I 'm wrong .
Roberts :
You tend to be right on these things on occasion , though .
Dr. Paul , it 's good to talk to you .
Appreciate it .
Paul :
Thank you .

Though she said she might otherwise be “ lunching , ” Lynn Forester de Rothschild , the American - born baroness spent part of her afternoon defecting – from her political party ’s presidential candidate – in full view of the press and a spray of television cameras .
Ms. de Rothschild , a personal friend and prominent backer of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and a member of the committee that helped draft the Democratic Party ’s platform , announced on Wednesday that while she intended to keep her party affiliation , she would not be voting for Senator Barack Obama .
“ It is the last place in the world I thought I would be in October 2008 , ” Ms. de Rothshchild , the New Jersey - born businesswoman who married into the British banking family , said at a press conference in Washington , D.C. organized by the McCain campaign .
“ We have got to make the right choice about who goes to the White House , ” she continued .
“ So this decision to vote Republican for the first time in my life has been after a lot of thought .
I have looked at all four candidates very carefully and I have no question about what I am doing today . ”
For months , Ms. De Rothschild been signaling her displeasure with Mr. Obama .
In June , she told The New York Times that she could not “ fall in line , ” behind the Democratic nominee .
And on Wednesday , flanked by four American flags and wearing a McCain pin , she took herself out of line and positioned herself firmly in the G.O.P. ’s corner .
“ I believe that Barack Obama with MoveOn.org , and Nancy Pelosi and Howard Dean have taken the Democratic Party too far to the left , ” she said .
“ I ’m not comfortable there . ”
Had she talked her decision over with Mrs. Clinton who urged her supporters to stand with Mr. Obama ?
“ No , no , ” said Ms. de Rothschild , smiling and shaking her head .
“ Not since the convention . ”
“ I ’m sure she is not pleased with what I ’m doing today , ” she conceded .
“ But you know what , I have to do what I believe in . ”
And though she acknowledged that she and Mr. McCain ’s running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin “ disagree on some issues , ” Ms. De Rothschild declared : “ I love Sarah Palin , ” adding , “ I think she ’s pretty cool . ”
Ms. de Rothschild , who is the director and C.E.O. of E.L. Rothschild Limited , a British investment firm , spent much of her career as a telecommunications entrepreneur .
She served for two years on President Bill Clinton ’s advisory council on the country ’s information infrastructure during the early 1990’s .
On Wednesday Ms. de Rothschild said she had already informed her family and business colleagues that she intended to spend the rest of the election season actively campaigning for the Republican ticket .
And although she stopped short of quitting her party entirely , Ms. de Rothschild , who ended the press conference by quoting a G.O.P. icon , seemed at least partially converted .
“ Right now I feel a little bit like Ronald Reagan who said , ‘ I did n’t leave the Democratic Party , the Democratic Party left me . ’ “
Google is trying to salvage YouTube 's image and improve the quality of discussion on the freewheeling video sharing site by allowing people to listen to their comments before they are posted .
And in a separate development that also aims to give YouTube legitimacy as a viable alternative to commercial TV , the site now contains full - length episodes of shows such as Star Trek , Beverly Hills 90210 and Dexter .
A YouTube Australia spokesman said the full - length shows were available only to those in the United States for now , but the audio preview feature was being implemented worldwide .
ON Wall Street , when the going gets tough , will the tough get yoga mats ?
Adding classes in yoga , meditation and other so - called mind - body regimens is just one way fitness professionals in the financial district are responding to recent economic uncertainties roiling their corporate clientele .
Some are also offering shorter , cheaper personal training sessions and , in at least one health club , quiet discounts for members who lose their jobs .
Amid layoffs , concerns about staying buff could seem trivial .
( Imagine the headline “ World Markets Near Collapse : Muscle Tone Under Threat . f221 ; )
Yet , businesspeople themselves wonder how a perilous financial climate will affect their physical fitness  and if exercise could help them weather hard times .
Some struggle to squeeze in any workouts at all .
But others , like Amy Sturtevant , an investment director for Oppenheimer & Company in Washington , find themselves doubling down on conditioning for relief .
“ Professionals are doing their best not to panic , but I know a lot of professionals who are panicking ” about the markets , she said .
“ The only way to get away from it is to have some kind of outlet . ”
Ms. Sturtevant , a mother of four , is training for her fourth marathon .
With brokerage clients needing more hand - holding , she said , she stints on sleep rather than skip her 5 a .m. daily boot camp and 20 - mile weekend runs .
Mountainous South Ossetia , which is officially part of Georgia , is separated from North Ossetia in Russia by the border between the two countries running high in the Caucasus Mountains .
Much of the region lies more than 1000 metres above sea level .
Long a source of tension in the region , South Ossetia was the focus of a full - blown war between Russia and Georgia in 2008 .
In the aftermath , it declared independence from Georgia and was recognised by Russia , although only a few other countries followed suit .
South Ossetia is inhabited mostly by Ossetians who speak a language remotely related to Persian .
Georgians account for less than one - third of the population .
Overview Overview
Facts
Leaders
Media Georgia is adamant that there can be no compromise over the status of South Ossetia to the extent that it avoids the use of the name South Ossetia , which it sees as implying political bonds with North Ossetia .
The 2008 conflict left much of the capital Tskhinvali in ruins Insisting that North Ossetia is , in fact , the only Ossetia , Tbilisi prefers to call South Ossetia by the historic Georgian name of Samachablo or , more recently , Tskhinvali Region .
In August 2008 Georgia 's efforts to regain control of the area suffered a crippling blow when Russia - the South Ossetian separatists ' military backers - defeated a Georgian incursion into South Ossetia in a bloody five - day conflict .
History The Ossetians are believed to be descended from tribes which migrated into the area from Asia many hundreds of years ago and settled in what is now North Ossetia .
As the Russian empire expanded into the area in the 18th and 19th centuries , the Ossetians did not join other peoples of the North Caucasus in putting up fierce resistance .
By tradition , the Ossetians have had good relations with Russians and were regarded as loyal citizens , first of the Russian empire and later of the Soviet Union .
They sided with the Kremlin when Bolshevik forces occupied Georgia in the early 1920s and , as part of the carve - up which followed , the South Ossetian Autonomous Region was created in Georgia and North Ossetia was formed in Russia .
Violence flares
In the twilight of the Soviet Union , as Georgian nationalist Zviad Gamsakhurdia came to prominence in Tbilisi , separatist sentiment burgeoned in South Ossetia .
Russian troops were welcomed as liberators in the 2008 conflict After several outbreaks of violence between Georgians and Ossetians , the region declared its intention to secede from Georgia in 1990 and , the following year , declared de facto independence .
The collapse of the USSR and Georgian independence in 1991 only strengthened South Ossetia 's determination to break with Tbilisi .
Sporadic violence involving Georgian irregular forces and Ossetian fighters continued until the summer of 1992 when agreement on the deployment of Georgian , Ossetian and Russian peacekeepers was reached .
Political stalemate followed .
Separatist voices became less strident during President Shevardnadze 's rule in Georgia , but the issues returned to the foreground when Mikhail Saakashvili replaced him as president .
Making clear his intention to bring the breakaway regions to heel , Mr Saakashvili offered South Ossetia dialogue and autonomy within the Georgian state .
But his offer fell far short of separatist demands , and in 2006 South Ossetians overwhelmingly voted to restate their demand for independence in a referendum that Georgia did not recognise .
Tensions came to head in early August 2008 , when , after nearly a week of clashes between Georgian troops and separatist forces , Georgia launched a concerted air and ground assault attack on South Ossetia , briefly gaining control of Tskhinvali .
Georgian forces fire a rocket during the brief war with Russia in 2008 Declaring its citizens to be under under attack , as most South Ossetians have Russian passports , Moscow sent in troops and launched air attacks on the Georgian forces .
Within days Russian forces had swept the Georgians out of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia , and then proceeded to occupy parts of Georgia , causing panic in Tbilisi .
Recognition Following Western protests , Russia pulled its forces back towards South Ossetia and Abkhazia under a cease - fire agreement , but days later proceeded formally to recognise both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states .
Internationally , only Russian 's Latin- American allies Venezuela and Nicaragua have recognised South Ossetian independence , apart from a few Pacific island states .
In April 2009 , Russia bolstered its position in South Ossetia by signing a five - year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper , as well as those of Abkhazia .

Media President : Leonid Tibilov Leonid Tibilov , a former South Ossetian KGB head , was inaugurated in April 2012 after winning a re-run leadership election .
The electoral commission said he won 54 % of the vote .
Leonid Tibilov has promised to heal old wounds
The results of the original election - in November 2011 - were annulled after the Kremlin - backed candidate Anatoly Bibilov complained of alleged poll violations .
His opposition rival , Alla Dzhioyeva , had been ahead in the vote count .
Ms Dzhioyeva was barred from the re-run , and her supporters held 10 days of protests .
After his election win , Mr Tibilov promised to build a " new and successful legitimate state " and vowed to try to heal old wounds in the region .
At his swearing - in , he promised to be faithful to South Ossetia 's Russian backers and to tackle the alleged misuse of Moscow 's aid money .
Tensions over the disbursement of Russian aid dogged Mr Tibilov 's predecessor , Eduard Kokoity .
Former members of his government accused him of corruption and sought early presidential elections .
As Mr Tibilov took office , local and Russian commentators predicted that he would face a major challenge in overcoming Mr Kokoity 's legacy , with success depending on his ability to remove the former leader 's associates from key posts .

Maureen McCormick Book Details Drug Use
reveals details of her downward spiral into depression and drug addiction -- even trading sex for drugs , in her new tell - all , " Here 's the Story : Surviving Marcia Brady and Finding My True Voice . "
McCormick , who played Marcia Brady on The Brady Bunch from 1969 - 1974 , also writes about her relationships with Michael Jackson and Steve Martin , and chronicles her affair with " brother " Greg Brady , played by Barry Williams .
" We could n't hold back any longer , " McCormick , now 52 , writes in the book .
" It was our first kiss , and it was long , passionate and deep .
It was wonderful , too , though as we continued to kiss and press against each other so closely that we could feel each other 's body heat , a part of me — a tiny part , admittedly — said to myself , ` Oh my God !
I 'm kissing my brother .
What am I doing ? '"
After the show ended , McCormick , who grew up in an abusive family , had a hard time reconciling her real life with the one on TV , and began a drug - fueled downward spiral into depression .
" As a teenager , I had no idea that few people are everything they present to the outside world , " McCormick writes .
" Yet there I was , hiding the reality of my life behind the unreal perfection of Marcia Brady . "
McCormick turned to drugs , using cocaine and Quaaludes , among others .
She struggled to regain some of her previous success , but was hindered by a reputation of unreliability due to the drug addiction , even blowing an interview with Steven Speilberg because she was high .
She details cocaine binges and parties at the Playboy mansion and at the home of Sammy Davis .
Jr , trading sex for drugs , and an unwanted pregnancy .
Marcia , Marcia , Marcia .
( It had to be said )
The book hits shelves on Tuesday .
Charlie Mahtesian , who knows Pennsylvania well , explains McCain 's decision to make a stand in Pennsylania :
It ’s an unenviable position to be in , except for one thing :
Nearly everyone in a position to know thinks the race for Pennsylvania ’s 21 electoral votes is considerably tighter than what recent polls reveal .
“ There ’s a tendency in Pennsylvania for the polls to change dramatically in the final days , ” says John Brabender , a top Republican political consultant based in Pittsburgh .
“ In the governor ’s race in 2002 , there were polls just a few days out showing [ Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell ] with a 25 - point lead and he ended up losing 50 of 67 counties and won by nine points . ”
“ I do n’t believe there ’s a double - digit lead , ” said Jon Delano , a western Pennsylvania - based political analyst who also serves as an adjunct professor of Public Policy and Politics at Carnegie Mellon University .
“ The history of the presidential elections here is different . ”
Even top Democrats concede that McCain ’s deficit in the polls — 11 percentage points , according to the latest RealClearPolitics polling average — is n’t a solid indicator of his chances of carrying the state .
On Tuesday , CNN reported that an anxious Rendell has sent two recent memos to the Obama campaign requesting that the Democratic nominee spend more time campaigning in Pennsylvania .
“ The polls do n’t necessarily reflect what will happen on Election Day , ” said T.J. Rooney , the state Democratic Party chairman .
“ We ’re not a state that ’s accustomed to huge blowouts . ”

Space station 's " storm hunter " turns two
( Image credit : NASA )
Wednesday , June 17 , 2020 : The Atmosphere - Space Interactions Monitor ( ASIM ) , which monitors Earth 's thunderstorms from the International Space Station , celebrated its second anniversary this week .
ASIM , which is mounted outside the European module of the space station , launched in April 2018 and began science operations on June 14 , 2018 .
The payload looks for electrical discharges in Earth 's upper atmosphere — known as red sprites , blue jets and elves — which appear as bright flashes of lighting that extend upward and into space .
Because these events happen above thunderstorms , they are difficult to study from the ground , but airplane pilots have reported seeing them during flight .

OSTIA ANTICA , Italy  The ruins of Ostia , an ancient Roman port , have never captured the public imagination in the same way as those of Pompeii , perhaps because Ostia met with a less cataclysmic fate .
Yet past archaeological digs here have yielded evidence of majestic public halls and even multistory apartment buildings that challenge Pompeii ’s primacy .
Now officials hope that the decade - long restoration of four dwellings lavishly decorated with frescoes will focus new attention on this once - bustling port about 15 miles west of Rome .
Last week the second - century insulae , or housing complexes , were presented to the public through the European Heritage Days program , in which each member country of the Council of Europe promotes new cultural assets and sites that have mainly been closed to the public .
“ Over all , this is the most important ensemble of second - and third - century frescoes in the world , ” Angelo Pellegrino , the director of excavations at the site , now called Ostia Antica , said in an interview .
I was talking to friend in New York City the other day about the current financial crisis , and she told me about a scene she had just witnessed in the lobby of the Warwick Hotel .
Four Swedish tourists , who clearly had been on a shopping spree in Manhattan , fueled by the still cheap dollar , were trying to cram all their purchases into four suitcases .
They had bought a hand - held scale  one of those you just grip onto the suitcase and lift  to make sure all their American goodies were not overweight for the flight home .
Another friend of mine in the ship - supply business in Baltimore , Alan Kotz , told me about a German customer who recently put in double his normal order .
When Alan asked him if he was aware of how much he had ordered , the German brushed his question away and laughed : “ Alan , nevermind , everything for us is half price . ”
And a good thing it is .
Even though the dollar has strengthened a bit lately , we are going to need foreigners and sovereign wealth funds from China , Asia , Europe and the Middle East more than ever to survive this crisis  and they are going to need us to be healthy as well .
In the process , we are going to become even more intertwined and dependent on the rest of the world .
Sarah Palin wo n’t have to worry that she does n’t know what the Bush doctrine is .
No one really knew what it meant .
But it had something to do with the unilateral exercise of American power , and the next president ’s ability to act unilaterally on anything other than vital national security issues is going to be reduced .
As the old saying goes :
He who has the gold makes the rules .
Well , we no longer have as much gold , and until we get some , we will have to pay more heed to the rules of those who lend us theirs .
Our take on life , humor and everything in between .
In all fairness , who has n’t been on the board of directors of an organization with ties to Nazi sympathizers ?
McCain and Palin simply have too many ties to extremists and anti-Semites .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid surprised Republicans on Monday by offering them a chance to vote this week on four GOP - backed amendments to an energy bill , including one that would expand offshore oil drilling .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says Democrats would offer four of their own proposals , too .
The Senate has been gridlocked for days on the bill -- which would attempt to curb speculation in the oil futures market -- as both parties argued over which amendments will be put to a vote .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said he was " very encouraged " by Reid 's proposal , but McConnell added he would have to confer with his leadership team .
The possible breakthrough comes days before Congress recesses for August and lawmakers return home to face constituents anxious for relief at fuel pumps .
GOP leaders met late Monday and were expected to discuss the plan with the full Republican membership Tuesday .
But two leadership aides said Republicans probably would seek more than four amendments .
Republicans had been insisting they should be allowed to offer two dozen or more amendments .
Watch how energy has turned into an election issue »
" It has to be north of four , " one of the Republican aides said .
Another added , " I mean , come on , that 's not negotiating . "
But a Democratic leadership aide predicted Republicans " wo n't take yes for an answer . "
And Sen. Charles Schumer , the Senate 's third - ranking Democrat , said Democrats believe Republicans " will say nothing is ever enough . "
" These are there four major amendments , " Schumer said .
" We 'd love to have a deal , but I thought Harry 's offer was a very generous offer . "
Reid , D - Nevada , said Democrats would allow votes on GOP amendments that would permit new drilling on the outer continental shelf ; the development of oil shale in Western states ; construction of new nuclear power plants ; and broader legislation that Republicans have dubbed " find more , use less . "

That legislation includes expanded offshore drilling , conservation initiatives , the improvement of battery technology , and language to curb speculation in the oil futures market .
See how speculation has increased oil prices »
Democratic leaders have generally opposed efforts to repeal a 1981 law barring most offshore drilling .
Reid said Democrats would offer four of their own proposals , but did n't specify what those would be .
He said all amendments would need 60 votes to pass , a threshold that could make it difficult for any of them to succeed .
Republicans , buoyed by recent polls showing a majority of Americans support new offshore drilling , have said they are confident they can get more than 50 senators to support expanded drilling , if not the 60 votes needed to pass .
Energy legislation also has been stalled in the House .
A bipartisan " energy working group " of 28 lawmakers hopes to break the impasse this week by proposing a compromise that couples new offshore drilling with conservation and renewable energy programs .
Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , says she wo n't allow a vote on a bill that includes new offshore oil drilling .
Also this week , the House is expected to vote on its version of an antispeculation bill .
Republican leaders have not decided if they will support the bill .

Sandwiches are dangerous things
Frank Hughes , 62 , was threatened with the penalty by a council official during a spot inspection at his office and told he may be punished over his used tea bags . [ > [>
The businessman , who runs a small scaffolding firm , works from an industrial unit with his wife Liz , 61 , while their team of labourers visit sites across Liverpool . [ > [>
But the official insisted they had flouted new nationwide laws which force companies to declare industrial waste despite the couple explaining they only have cling film from their home - made sandwiches and soggy tea bags . [ >
[> Yesterday Mr Hughes branded their action “ laughable ” . [ > [>
He told the Daily Express : “ In the face of recession , Britain should be looking after its small businesses , not hitting them with as many stealth taxes as they can dream up . [ > [>
“ They want to fine me £ 300 for sandwich wrappers .
The world ’s gone crazy .
We got a letter from the council ’s environmental waste department , like everybody else , about six months ago asking us to declare the waste we produce . [>
[> “ I wrote back to them saying we do n’t have any .
We did n’t get anything back and so I though nothing of it , until an officer walked into the office out of the blue for an inspection .
There was no warning , he just bounded in and demanded to inspect our waste . [ > [>
“ He accused us of lying and said there are dire consequences for trying to avoid having a proper licence . ” [ > [>
He added : “ It got me a bit riled .
Then I remembered that my wife had made me cheese sandwiches that day so I produced the cling film and said , ‘ the only waste here comes from my sarnie wrappers ’ . [ >
[> “ But he jumped on that saying , ‘ Well that ’s waste ! ’
He also asked if we drank tea and when I said ‘ yes ’ he told me that tea bags were also classed as waste .
It was laughable really , I thought he was joking .
We take the wrappers and bags back home with us at night . [ > [>
“ But he said we should pay for a licence and save them up for a week and then call them for collection .
I showed him the door and he said we ’d be getting a £ 300 fine . ” [ > [>
Mr Hughes , whose company Olympic Scaffolding is based in Bootle , Merseyside , added : “ We pay £ 9,000 - a - year in business rates .
What for ?
They wo n’t even come and empty a bin .
It ’s so stupid as to be untrue .
All we do here is eat a few sarnies .
That ’s not industrial waste . [ >
[> “ And the fella who came round was armed with a list of other firms .
But we ’re the only ones who kicked up a fuss . [ > [>
“ I asked if I could take the waste home to dispose of it , and he said ‘ no way ’ . [ > [>
“ So now I ’ll have to pay a company to come out every week to take away a bag of food wrapping .
How much will they charge for that £ 50 ?
£ 100 ?
It ’s madness . [>
[> “ We ’re often phoning the council about fly - tipping round here .
But do they do anything ?
No , they ’re too busy coming after people like me . ” [ > [>

BEAVERTON --
After picking out her lunch , a third - grader at Jacob Wismer Elementary School stood in line to pay , only to find out her account was empty .
Instead of letting the girl charge another meal , the school 's cafeteria manager took the tray from her and trashed her nachos , carrots and unopened water bottle , according to her parents .
" That should remind your parents to pay on time , " the lunch employee told the girl , her parents said .
The employee handed the girl an " emergency lunch " of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and milk .
When the girl said she was allergic to peanuts , she got a bagel .
" This whole implementation I think is just shocking , " said the girl 's mother , Radha Moghe , a part - time Portland Community College nutrition instructor on leave this year .
" Taking away food from a child 's hands once they 've chosen it is probably not the best . "
The Oct. 15 incident raises the issue of how schools deal with students whose lunch accounts are delinquent when the children have no control over their parents ' finances .
Lax lunch policies could mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt , so school districts throughout the metro area keep a close eye on delinquent accounts .
But it 's not clear how individual schools handle it at the lunch counter .
It 's also not unique to Oregon .
Last month , the Edmonds School District in Washington reversed its policy of throwing away food from students ' lunches if they did n't have money or their accounts were more than $ 10 short .
Jacob Wismer 's principal acknowledged the incident , although she had n't heard about the employee 's comment to the girl .
After several discussions with the girl 's parents , the school has changed its lunch procedures .
" I just do n't want to see any students embarrassed like this little girl was , " said Principal Joan McFadden .
Beaverton School District 's policy states that when students become delinquent by three meals , they are given an emergency meal , consisting of a cold sandwich and milk .
Susan Barker , nutrition services administrator , said a cafeteria employee is supposed to trade a food tray for the alternative meal but the food " should n't be thrown out in front of them . "
Of the 3,200 emergency meals served this school year , Barker said this was the first complaint she was aware of .
The nutrition services department is assessing how similar situations are handled at other schools , Barker added .
The girl 's father , Shrirang Moghe , said she was short $ 6.30 in her account and that her mother had dropped off a check that morning , but it was n't credited .
" We just want to not let this happen to any child in the school district , " said Moghe , a software company program manager .
" If there 's a better implementation of this policy , let 's do it . "
Initially upset by their daughter 's experience , Radha and Shrirang Moghe contacted the district , asking it to re-examine how its meal - charging policy is implemented .
As a result , Jacob Wismer switched to a system where teachers can let students know in advance of picking out food whether they need to ask for an emergency meal , McFadden said .
Beaverton switched its three - meal delinquency rule about three years ago when the policy became too lenient , Barker said .
At the end of the 2005 - 06 school year , the independently operated nutrition services department racked up $ 70,000 to $ 80,000 in uncollected debt .
After the new rules were implemented , that amount dropped by $ 50,000 the following year , Barker said .
" We really think this is pretty lenient or generous -- that students get three times that they are n't paying -- compared with some other school districts , " Barker said .
Portland Public
Schools lets elementary students borrow but makes an automated call home if the child has borrowed twice .
When students ' balances are high , even up to $ 25 , schools send letters home and call parents .
At that point , they 'll let students pick fruits and vegetables from their food bar and a milk .
" We want to feed kids at all costs , " said nutrition services director Kristy Obbink .
But , " we are required to pay our own way .
So , just like any business , we have to make rules and a policy that sometimes does n't seem fair . "
The Reynolds School District ended its unrestricted free breakfast and lunch policy last year and opted to give elementary students graham crackers and milk if they could n't afford a lunch .
About three years ago , West Linn - Wilsonville School District staff gave peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to students who did n't pay their bills but abandoned the idea because it was embarrassing for students and not nutritious enough , Superintendent Roger Woehl said .
Shrirang Moghe said the Beaverton district listened to their concerns .
" We believe that their efforts are going to pay off with dividends that we are looking for , " he said .

The trailer for Doubt .
John Patrick Shanley ’s 2005 Pulitzer Prize - winning Doubt is a riveting exploration of paranoia and suspicion in the Catholic Church .
Set in a Bronx parochial school in 1964 — just as the Vatican II reforms begin to transfigure the Church — evidence of a priest ’s wrongdoing comes to light .
Sister Aloysius , a strict school principal and traditionalist nun , faces the decision of a lifetime :
Does she openly accuse a priest and give voice to her fear of his sinful actions , or does she bury her suspicions and leave room for doubt ?
This intense and personal power struggle between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn ultimately calls into question both faith and justice in the shadows of this cloistered institution .

Restaurants facing ' worst winter in a decade . '
The city announced this week plans to expand businesses use of outdoor spaces through Jan .

Adobe Systems has released a new version of its Flash Player software , fixing a critical security bug that could make the Internet a dangerous place for Web surfers .
The new Flash Player 10 software , released Wednesday , fixes security flaws in Adobe 's multimedia software including bugs that could allow hackers to pull off what 's known as a clickjacking attack , wrote Adobe spokesman David Lenoe in a blog posting .
For those who can't update to this new version of Flash , a Flash 9 security patch is still about a month off , he added .
Adobe rates the clickjacking bug as ' critical .'
Although not widely used by criminals , clickjacking has received a lot of attention since it was first discussed a month ago .
Flash is n't the only software that is vulnerable to a clickjacking attack , but Flash attacks have been considered among the most dangerous .
The security researchers who discovered the problem , Robert Hansen and Jeremiah Grossman , had intended to fully discuss clickjacking at a Sept. 24 security conference presentation .
But they backed off and gave a slimmed - down version of their talk when Adobe asked for more time to patch its software .
Last week , however , security researcher Guy Aharonovsky showed how an Adobe Flash clickjacking attack would work , and with the information now out in the open , Hansen and Grossman went public with their findings .
In a clickjacking attack , the hacker users a variety of techniques to take control of what links the victim is actually clicking .
In one attack , for example , the attacker would first have to trick the victim into visiting a malicious Web page and then clicking on what appeared to be a regular Web link .
In reality the victim would be clicking on something altogether different such as a Flash object that turned on his microphone .
" It 's almost impossible for a user to determine what 's going to happen when they click on a link , " said Hansen , who is CEO of SecTheory.org , in an interview last week .
A clickjacker could wiretap victims '
PCs , force them to execute online stock trades , delete blog pages , change a router or firewall configuration , create new Web mail accounts , or even force them to download software , Hansen said .
Because clickjacking affects other browser plugins , the best way to fix the clickjacking problem may be to change the way browsers work , Hansen said .
" Browser makers understand the problem and they 're trying to find ways to mitigate it , " he said .
Unboxing
We 've already seen Envy 133 unboxed elsewhere , but let us assure you that it 's a delight to open up that box , and certainly feels like the premium product that shows up on the price tag .
The laptop itself resides in a leather slip , that we 're sure fingerprintaphobes will be keeping the laptop in to ward off dust and smudges .
It 's also a pleasant sight to see all the necessaries -- Ethernet , disc drive , video adapter -- included with the laptop .
If you 're going to take them out of the laptop , the least thing you can do is put 'em in the box .
Peripherals
Before you even look at the laptop , it 's easy to tell there 's something amiss : there 's an Ethernet port on the AC adaptor , and the whole thing in fact doubles as a WiFi access point .
The adaptor itself is even oddly shaped , a flat square that almost resembles the Envy 133 in miniature .
Another similar black block marks the disc drive , a minimalistic slot - loading affair , with a hide - away eSATA plug .
Even the video adapter -- HDMI to VGA -- manages to be black and boxy .
Laptop Hardware
And now we get to the laptop itself .
Interrupted only by a handful of ports on each side , two fan grills ( input and exhaust ) , and the hinge in the back , the laptop is monolithic in nature , and about as sexy as those press shots have led you to believe .
A thin sliver of a battery snaps on underneath , scoring a major point for road warriors for whom a second or third battery is a way of life .
There 's no discernible indentation to open up the screen , the only way we 've found so far is to grab at the right and left corners and lift .
The entire thing is razor thin , lightweight and carbon - fiber strong -- no worries about build quality here , or feeling inadequate when your friends pull out their own subnotebooks .
Inside there 's a darkened mirror and a keyboard .
The mirror turns out to be an LCD upon further examination , but we still have our doubts .
The keyboard looks simple and cheap , but reveals its quality with use -- as is our practice , we 're writing up these impressions on the laptop itself , and really enjoying the keys , though the tiny right shift key is a tad hard to find .
The power button , forward delete and wireless on / off are all in the function key row .
The trackpad is the hardest thing to track down , denoted only by a square of golfball - style indentations and a long , low button below them , which hardly raises above the surface of the palm rest .
Specs - wise there 's a 1.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo SP7700 processor , X3100 integrated graphics and a 64GB SSD , with Bluetooth and 802.11n WiFi .
For plugs there 's HDMI , which can output at 1920 x 1080 , headphones , USB and an eSATA / USB plug which can power the DVD burner without any outside help .
There 's also an ExpressCard34 slot .
Laptop usage
Tap the power button and instead of getting Windows startup screen , up pops the Voodoo IOS .
It only takes 5 seconds to boot and you 're in a Linux environment with Firefox , Pidgin , Skype and some crappy photo and music apps .
It took no time at all to get onto our local WiFi ( in fact , it took a bit longer for the WiFi control panel to pop up in Windows on first boot ) and we were browsing right away .
Unfortunately , we have large unwieldy hands , and the trackpad is a menace when in Linux .
It 's large , very sensitive , responds to taps as clicks , and presents a learning curve of avoidance , since the " pad " is totally flush with the palm rest .
Luckily there 's a proximity sensor that deactivates the pad while typing , but as soon as you take one hand off the keyboard you 're again at the mercy of the thing .
In Windows there 's a detailed control panel to fix most of these problems , but no such luck in Linux -- though we spoke to Rahul from Voodoo and he says they 're looking into getting some of those options over to Linux .
Booting to Windows is a fairly speedy process , and HP has certainly done a great job of keeping the hardware image clear of crapware -- anti-virus is pre-installed , but it 's AVG , far from the scourge of computing that is Norton .
After spending five minutes configuring the mouse we were much happier , but we 'd still prefer a real trackpad with a matte surface and edges .
When in Windows there 's multitouch pinch - to - zoom , but no multitouch scrolling -- though it 's apparently in the works .
You can scroll by dragging along the edge of the pad , but since you can't find the edge of the pad ...
OK , we 'll stop griping about the touchpad .
Performance is quite good for a laptop of this size , and does the Voodoo name proud .
As regular , self - loathing users of a MacBook Air , we 're pretty incredulous that Voodoo keeps this laptop as cool as it does -- there 's a quiet fan on at most times , expelling warm air out the left side -- and does n't have to step down the processor to do it .
We watched a good deal of HD Hulu with nary a hitch or stutter , and it took some 1080 p QuickTime trailers to find a hitch in framerate , though the machine itself never lost responsiveness .
We did n't test any games , but we 've heard good things considering the specs at play .
Once you turn the computer on and turn up the brightness , the mirror - like LCD becomes quite viewable , though still a bit more glossy than the MacBook Air , and a bit dimmer when viewed off - axis .
The flush edge - to - edge glass front to the LCD means the display is afforded a bit of extra protection , and certainly looks good in action .
Conclusion
Look , nobody 's naive here , we all know the crazy tradeoffs made when selecting a laptop like the Envy .
If you can't live without a disc drive and a LAN plug , or have a fear of finger smudges on glossy surfaces , this certainly is n't the laptop for you .
You 'll also pay a premium , at $ 2,099 for the base model without SSD and a slower processor , but if you can live with some trackpad awkwardness and the aforementioned tradeoffs , Voodoo proved that design above all is n't always a horrible mantra .
Raja Petra was arrested under a law that allows detention without trial A prominent anti-government blogger in Malaysia has been detained for two years on charges of insulting Islam .
Raja Petra Kamarudin has been held without trial under controversial internal security laws which could see him detained indefinitely .
He was arrested on 12 September as part of a crackdown on dissent by the Malaysian government , which is facing a mounting challenge from the opposition .
Raja Petra 's lawyer said the order was " a big blow " to civil liberty .
The BBC's Robin Brant in Kuala Lumpur said the well - known blogger had been a thorn in the side of the Malaysian government , using his blog to become one of its most vociferous critics .
Raja Petra , himself a Muslim , was accused of insulting Islam and inciting racial tensions through an article he published on the Malaysia Today website .
The charge is highly sensitive in multi-ethnic Malaysia .
The arrest came shortly after he used his blog to accuse Malaysia 's Deputy Prime Minister , Najib Razak , of involvement in the 2007 murder of a Mongolian woman - a charge Mr Razak strongly denies .
Shortly before he was arrested Raja Petra told the BBC that he was not afraid of detention but wanted " to be available to help in the dissemination of information that is going to be greatly required " .
' Worst news '
Mr Abdullah has insisted he will remain in office
The blogger has been sent to a detention centre in the state of Perak by order of Malaysia 's home minister .
Marina Lee Abdullah , his wife , told AFP news agency : " This is the worst news I can receive , but we will keep fighting for his release . "
His lawyer , Malik Imtiaz Sarwar , said the order was " definitely a big blow to the idea of civil liberties , especially in a climate when everybody is asking for greater rights " .
Raja Petra was one of three critics of the government arrested in what the opposition said was a sign of panic by the embattled administration of Abdullah Badawi .
Mr Abdullah 's government suffered an unprecedented drop in support in the general election earlier this year and he has faced calls to resign from both opposition and some members of his own party .
Last week he rejected claims by the opposition , led by Anwar Ibrahim , that they had enough support to overthrow him , saying he was " here to stay " .
Mr Anwar recently won a landslide victory in a by - election - returning him to parliament after a decade 's absence .
He was sacked as deputy prime minister in 1998 , and jailed for six years for sodomy and corruption - allegations he has always denied .
Controversial Under the controversial Internal Security Act ( ISA ) , Raja Petra can be held for two years , a sentence which can be renewed indefinitely .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The order can only be overturned by the home minister , not a judge .
Political groups both within the ruling government coalition and outside it have criticised the ISA and the inherent potential for abuse .
A member of the cabinet , Zaid Ibrahim , resigned last week over the government 's use of the act , saying it " should only be used on armed terrorists or those out to topple the government by force " .
Opposition MP Teresa
Kok was detained for one week under the act after she was accused of campaigning for a mosque to lower the volume of its call to prayer .
Another blogger , Syed Azidi Syed Aziz , and Chinese - language journalist Tan Hoon Cheng , have also been held under the ISA .
Raja Petra 's detention is likely to lead to further criticism of the Malaysian government , both domestically and internationally , says our correspondent .

WASHINGTON  President Bush asserted on Tuesday that he had the executive power to bypass several parts of two bills : a military authorization act and a measure giving inspectors general greater independence from White House control .
Mr. Bush signed the two measures into law .
But he then issued a so - called signing statement in which he instructed the executive branch to view parts of each as unconstitutional constraints on presidential power .
In the authorization bill , Mr. Bush challenged four sections .
One forbid the money from being used “ to exercise United States control of the oil resources of Iraq ” ; another required negotiations for an agreement by which Iraq would share some of the costs of the American military operations there .
The sections “ purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the president ’s ability to carry out his constitutional obligations , ” including as commander in chief , Mr. Bush wrote .
Congressman Ridicules Bikes as “ 19th Century Solution ”
Congressman Patrick McHenry standing with an automobile , which , as it happens , was also invented in the 19th century .
The US House of Representatives approved an energy conservation bill on Saturday that includes , among other things , a tax break of $ 20 per month for bike commuters , which would take effect at the beginning of next year .
The vote on HR 2776 was largely split along party lines , and was preceded by inspired testimony from Congressman Patrick McHenry , a Republican representing the 10th District in my home state of North Carolina .
Here ’s McHenry , as quoted in the Congressional Record :
" A major component of the Democrats ’ energy legislation and the Democrats ’ answer to our energy crisis is , hold on , wait one minute , wait one minute , it is promoting the use of the bicycle .
Oh , I can not make this stuff up .
Yes , the American people have heard this .
Their answer to our fuel crisis , the crisis at the pumps , is : Ride a bike .
Democrats believe that using taxpayer funds in this bill to the tune of $ 1 million a year should be devoted to the principle of : " Save energy , ride a bike . ”
Some might argue that depending on bicycles to solve our energy crisis is naive , perhaps ridiculous .
Some might even say Congress should use this energy legislation to create new energy , bring new nuclear power plants on line , use clean coal technology , energy exploration , but no , no .
They want to tell the American people , stop driving , ride a bike .
This is absolutely amazing .
Apparently , the Democrats believe that the miracle on two wheels that we know as a bicycle will end our dependence on foreign oil .
I can not make this stuff up .
It is absolutely amazing .
Ladies and gentlemen , I bring you the Democrats , promoting 19th century solutions to 21st century problems .
If you do n’t like it , ride a bike .
If you do n’t like the price at the pumps , ride a bike .
Stay tuned for the next big idea for the Democrats : Improving energy efficiency by the horse and buggy . "
So proud is McHenry of his witty remarks that he posted the video on his web page .
Like the man said :
You can not make this stuff up .

Hurricane Gustav made landfall in LA just south and east of NOLA as a Category 2 hurricane .
Models done after landfall and their damage forecasts are included below .
The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , or LOOP ( see JoulesBurn 's story on the LOOP here ) , and Port Fourchon , which has historically been a land base for offshore oil support services in the Gulf , was in the path of Gustav and is expected to be damaged .
As you will see below , a good bit of oil and natural gas is also expected to be taken offline : some for weeks , some for much longer , according to Methaz ' models .
Matthew Simmons , of Simmons International says this about the importance of the LOOP :
LOOP is the only facility in the Gulf to unload VLCC tankers which carry over 2 million barrels of crude .
They can in theory be " litered " by unloading onto smaller tankers that can make it into the Gulf Coast ports but this is very lengthy timewise and the spare capacity of these smaller tankers is slim .
We get about 1.2 million b/d of crude imports through Loop . (+/- 10 %)
Our next update will likely be in the morning .
Keep scrolling , there 's a LOT of maps , data , and information in these posts .
We appreciate your help accumulating resources , stories , and newstips in the comment thread below !
Updates today from Chuck Watson at KAC / UCF :
Here 's the 9/1 update :
Well , I think someone ( who out of modesty shall remain nameless ) forecast several days ago , Gustav would hit unfavorable conditions in the northern Gulf and never make it back to mega - storm strength .
That seems to be the case .
Center landfall with peak winds of 100 kts or maybe slightly less looks to be at Grand Isle , at 8 am ET - as of 730et the " eyewall " appears to be touching land .
I 'm mostly sticking with the synthesis from last night ( based on multiple models ) as to impacts , and we 're now in a " wait and see what the inspections bring " mode .
The big question is what if any major damage the LOOP suffered and ( perhaps more vulnerable than the LOOP itself ) the connection pipelines to shore .
Baseline estimate is 10 - 14 days for the port itself .
Radar shot ( 7:30 am ET ) with tracks and LOOP labeled attached .
Production : Unless something broke that should n't have , we expect production to be back up to 60 - 70 % within 30 days , and back to 95 % by the end of the year .
We expect a long - term hit of 3 % or so since this swath went through some areas that Ivan , Katrina , and Rita missed and some older , less productive wells will not be restored .
Refineries and distribution : Mainly short term disruption due to precautionary shutdowns , no long term unless we get unlucky with pipelines .
All in all , my thinking is that this could have been a lot worse .
Storm was disorganized crossing the OCS , so waves and storm surge will be lower than they should be for a storm of this size and intensity .
Here is Chuck 's landfall composite for Gulf ( GOM ) oil and NG production , which covers the GoM loss for the month of September in to the context of overall oil production , imports , and refining .
Note for those crunching the numbers that since GoM is about 25 % of US production , 40 % of the GOM 's contribution of 25 % is 10 % of the total US production .
COMP ATCF Forecast Time : 2008090112 14 day : 8.21 MMBBL ( 52.36 % normal ) , gas 63.50 BCF ( 65.91 % normal ) 30 day : 19.98 MMBBL ( 59.46 % normal ) , gas 145.98 BCF ( 70.70 % normal ) 60 day : 43.01 MMBBL ( 64.00 % normal ) , gas 304.43 BCF ( 73.73 % normal ) 90 day : 95.23 MMBBL ( 94.47 % normal ) , gas 586.06 BCF ( 94.62 % normal ) 6 mon : 195.13 MMBBL ( 96.79 % normal ) , gas 1205.43 BCF ( 97.31 % normal ) 1 year : 400.48 MMBBL ( 97.96 % normal ) , gas 2478.60 BCF ( 98.67 % normal )
Interpretation : the models say that 40 % of GOM oil will be offline for 30 days and ~ 30 % of GOM NG for will be offline for 30 days -- followed by marginal increases in GOM supply ( both imports and production ) through the next months .
( E.g. , the 60 day number for oil is 36 % shut - in , but between 60 - 90 days , the number goes down to 5 % of GOM oil shut - in . )
UPDATE : 10:00 EDT
9/1 - Graphic below is damage models based on LBAR hurricane forecast track , key is below .
Numerical damage estimates are below the fold for oil and natural gas shut - in and damage .
Path / damage estimates using LBAR 10:00 EDT forecast - click twice to enlarge
For all graphics : Rigs / Platforms : Blue : evacuated only ;
Yellow will require inspection before restart ; Red : damage requiring repair ; Refineries : Black : operational impact ( partial shutdown ) Green : Operational impact ( full shutdown )
Red : Damage likely ; Ports : standard hurricane flags for wind
We are not hurricane experts at theoildrum.com .
Neither are we experts on damage forecasts to oil and gas infrastructure from weather events ( though thankfully we do have an expert that helps us ) .
What we try to do , and have been doing for over 3 years , is articulate the fragility and urgency of our nation 's , and our world 's , energy situation .
As Hurricane Gustav moves nearer , and professional meteorologists and energy analysts gauge the impact it may have on our energy infrastructure , feel free to browse our archives of hundreds of empirically based analyses and perspectives on the myriad energy issues that form the backdrop not only for this hurricane , but for any exogenous event that disrupts the increasingly uneasy balance between energy supply and demand in our modern interconnected world .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
After more than a year of circling each other , Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night in Ohio .
The 74 - year - old president and the 77 - year - old former vice president are similar in age , and they share a mutual dislike .
But they differ starkly in style and substance .
All of that was evident from the outset on the Cleveland stage .
Here are key takeaways from the first of three scheduled presidential debates before Election Day on Nov. 3 .
AND IN THIS CORNER
Trump is no stranger to going on offense , but his pugilistic approach on stage left his Democratic opponent fighting to complete a sentence .
Trailing in public and private polling , Trump advisers have pushed him to reframe the election away from a referendum on his presidency to a choice between him and Biden .
Trump , instead , commandeered the debate , trying to trip up Biden by interrupting and insulting him .
In the process , Trump made the debate more about himself .
“ There ’s nothing smart about you , ” Trump said of Biden .
“ 47 years you ’ve done nothing . ”
While Trump played into his reputation as a bully , it may have been effective at breaking up the worst of Biden ’s attacks — simply by talking over them .
Trump aides believed before the debate that Biden would be unable to withstand the withering offensive on style and substance from Trump , but Biden came with a few retorts of his own , calling Trump a “ clown ” and mocking Trump ’s style by asking , “ Will you shut up , man ? ”
Trump ’s supporters may have been cheered by his frontal assault .
Whether undecided voters , who watched the debate to try to learn about the two candidates , were impressed is another matter .
Moderator Chris Wallace was none too amused , delivering a pointed reproach to Trump for his interruptions .
“ Frankly , you ’ve been doing more interrupting , ” Wallace said , appealing to Trump to let his opponent speak .
Trump is fond of superlatives , but in the case of the debate there is little doubt that it was the most acrimonious of since the forums have been televised .
__
TRUMP CAN'T ESCAPE THE VIRUS
Trump has wanted the election to be about anything but the coronavirus pandemic , but he could n’t outrun reality on the debate stage .
“ It is what it is because you are who you are , ” Biden told the president , referring to Trump ’s months of downplaying COVID - 19 while he said privately he understood how deadly it is .
But Trump did n’t take it quietly .
He proceeded to blitz Biden with a mix of self - defense and counter - offensives .
200,000 dead ?
Biden ’s death toll would have been “ millions , ” Trump said .
A rocky economy ?
Biden would ’ve been worse .
Biden would n’t have manufactured enough masks or ventilators .
The kicker : “ There will be a vaccine very soon . ”
Biden fell back on his bottom line : “ A lot of people died , and a lot more are going to unless he gets a lot smarter . ”
For voters still undecided about who ’d better handle the pandemic , the exchange may not have offered anything new .
__
RACIAL RECKONING
Trump said Biden was the politician who helped put millions of Black Americans in prison with the 1994 crime law .
Biden called Trump “ the racist ” in the Oval Office .
For a nation confronting a summer of racial unrest — and centuries of injustice — the debate was the latest cultural flashpoint .
Biden was quiet as Trump blitzed him as a tool of the “ radical left ” and a weak figure who opposes “ law and order . ”
He pressed Biden repeatedly to name any police union that ’s endorsed him .
He falsely accused Biden of wanting to “ defund the police . ”
Biden did n’t capitalize when Trump refused to condemn armed militias and insisted , against the guidance of his own FBI director : “ This is not a right - wing problem .
This is a left - wing problem . ”
“ Proud Boys , stand back and stand by , ” Trump said when prompted on the far - right group .
“ But I ’ll tell you what , somebody ’s got to do something about antifa and the left . ”
The former vice president tried to push back , but not until after Trump had made his arguments , including the misrepresentations .
Biden regained some footing mocking the president ’s warnings about suburbs , saying , “ He would n’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn . ”
And perhaps revealing the thinking about allowing Trump the rhetorical upper hand , Biden said , “ All these dog whistles and racism does n’t work anymore . ”
__
QUESTION ABOUT COURT , ANSWER ABOUT HEALTH CARE
Trump defended his decision to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court just weeks before Election Day , saying “ elections have consequences . ”
Biden said he was “ not opposed to the justice , ” but said the “ American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is . ”
But rather than litigate Republicans ' 2016 blocking of Merrick Garland to the high court , Biden quickly pivoted to the issues that will potentially come before the court : healthcare and abortion .
It ’s an effort by the Democrat to refocus the all - but - certain confirmation fight for Trump ’s third justice to the Supreme Court into an assault on Trump and his record .
Biden said Barrett , who would be the sixth justice on the nine - member court to be appointed by a Republican , would endanger the Affordable Care Act and tens of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions , and would imperil legalized abortion .
It was a reframing of the political debate to terms far more favorable to the Democrat , and one Trump played into .
Trump said of the conservative Barrett , “ You do n’t know her view on Roe vs. Wade ” and he defended his efforts to try to chip away at the popular Obama - era health law .
Biden has tried to press Democrats to use the court confirmation fight as a rallying cry against Trump , and the debate discussion largely played out on his turf .

‘ INVISIBLE ’ WALLACE STRUGGLES TO CONTAIN TRUMP
Debate moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News tried mightily to hold his ground Tuesday after saying beforehand that it was not his job to fact - check the candidates , especially Trump , in real time .
But Wallace struggled to stop Trump from interrupting and at times seemed to lose control of the debate .
“ Mr. President , as the moderator , we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment , ” Wallace said .
Soon after : “ I ’m the moderator , and I ’d like you to let me ask my question . ”
Minutes later : “ I have to give you roughly equal time .
Please let the vice president talk . ”
And when Wallace noted that Trump has n’t come up with his health care plan in nearly four years , Trump turned the question back on Wallace .
“ First of all , I ’m debating you and not him .
That ’s okay .
I ’m not surprised . ”
Wallace said he wanted to be “ invisible . ”
Well , that was impossible .
__
FAMILY BUSINESS
As expected , Trump found a way to bring up Hunter Biden , the former vice president ’s son , and recycle allegations about the younger Biden ’s international business practices .
Biden called Trump ’s litany “ discredited ” and fired back , “ I mean , his family we can talk about all night . ”
But Biden sidestepped any of the specifics of Trump ’s international business dealings and instead turned straight to the camera .
“ This is not about my family or his family , ” Biden said as Trump tried to talk over him .
“ This is about your family . ”
In a later exchange , Trump interrupted Biden when he was talking about his late son , Beau Biden , who died of cancer in 2015 after having served in Iraq .
“ I do n’t know Beau , I know Hunter , " Trump said .
If you 're in Beijing for the Olympics kick starting this weekend , do n't be spilling any beans ( state secrets or otherwise ) in your cab back to the hotel , because you 're being listened to .
As the WSJ is reporting , on your taxi's dash is a microphone that can be activated remotely , at any time and without the driver 's knowledge , for a live listen into any one of Beijing 's estimated 70,000 cabs .
And then , if the folks on the other end do n't like what they hear , they can take things even further .
The GPS - equipped devices also allow for remote disabling by " cutting off the oil or electric supply , " effectively shutting down the engine and keeping it from being restarted .
Yikes .
Beijing police tow the general " it 's for the driver 's safety " line :
Whether these microphones are used to spy on riders is unclear .
Asked if police could listen in on conversations in taxis , a Beijing police official declined to comment , saying that such matters were " confidential " and that they were " not supposed to release such details to the public . "
Advertisement
As the State Department has warned , you can expect to be monitored in just about every other place , public or private .
It 's doubtful that every cab is being recorded at all times , but the tech is there if necessary .
Comforting .
Several Beijing taxi companies declined to comment on the security aspect but said that the GPS helps track taxis and that the microphones will be used for translating services .
About a dozen taxi drivers said the microphones were installed about three years ago , when newer cabs were built without protective metal cages around the drivers .
Cabbies can turn on the system and alert their dispatch centers by touching a discreet button near the steering wheel .
Activists say they are concerned about the ability to listen to conversations with the devices , which appear unique to China .
" This seems to suggest an effort by the police or other security forces to eavesdrop on conversations of passengers , rather than for the immediate safety and security of the taxi driver , " said Phelim Kine of Human Rights Watch .

Under cover of “ voter fraud ” allegations , Republicans suppress the vote — Part 1
By Tom Eley
22 October 2008
This is the first of a two - part article .
The second part will be posted October 23 .
At recent campaign events , Republican presidential and vice presidential candidates John McCain and Sarah Palin have made sensational charges , alleging that widespread “ voter fraud ” is taking place in an attempt to manipulate the election in favor of Barack Obama .
The Republican Party has focused on the voter registration group ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) , which is now the subject of a number of investigations of fraudulent voter registrations .
In his recent debate with Barack Obama , McCain went so far as to claim that ACORN was “ on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . ”
Under cover of charges of voter fraud against ACORN , what is actually taking place is a systematic drive by the McCain campaign and the Republican Party to suppress the vote of sections of the working class — minorities , the youth , legal immigrants , and the poor — who tend to vote Democratic , and to prejudice far - right elements in the population against the legitimacy of a Democratic victory .
“ Voter fraud ”
On October 16 , two FBI sources , speaking on condition of anonymity , leaked word that ACORN was the subject of a federal investigation into voter fraud .
The FBI has not confirmed that such an investigation is taking place and ACORN says that it has not been contacted by federal agents .
It is a violation of Justice Department regulations to divulge that a federal investigation is under way before charges are made .
Until 2007 , such a leak would also have violated Justice Department regulations governing electoral investigations that forbade “ any conduct which has the possibility of affecting the election itself , ” and which required that “ most , if not all , investigation of an alleged election crime must await the end of the election to which the allegation relates . ”
This language was removed in 2007 amidst the controversy over the US attorney firings .
The FBI leak was without doubt intentional , part and parcel of a Republican campaign to intimidate those seeking to defend voting rights , and to cultivate doubt about the validity of what appears increasingly likely to be a lopsided Democratic victory in the upcoming election .
In response to the FBI leak , ACORN called it “ a right - wing attempt to set the stage for a massive voter suppression operation and a gross attempt to besmirch the largest community organization of low and moderate income Americans . ”
The announced FBI investigation is one of a number of transparently political witch - hunts of ACORN taking place in a number of “ battleground ” states .
ACORN is under investigation in Nevada , where its Las Vegas offices were raided on October 8 , Ohio , Indiana , Wisconsin , New Mexico , North Carolina , Missouri , Minnesota , and Pennsylvania , in addition to solidly Republican Texas .
Critics of ACORN have been able to cite only a relative handful of examples of false registration forms out of the 1.3 million new voters the group claims to have registered .
ACORN insists that most of the examples being used against it are cases that the group flagged to authorities .
However , to whatever limited extent fraud has allegedly been perpetrated by individuals working for ACORN , this would be more accurately described as “ voter registration fraud ” — not voter fraud .
The two crimes are very different .
Fraud in voter registration — usually listing people who do not exist as eligible to vote — arises out of the haphazard process by which voters become eligible to cast a ballot in the US .
Americans may cast a ballot in elections only if they have registered to vote with local authorities well before the date of the election .
The process may be more or less onerous and cumbersome , depending on the state .
As a result , a very large share of the potential electorate in the US does not cast a ballot .
Those sections of the population that feel most disenfranchised by the electoral system — the poor , working class , minorities , and the youth — have been those least inclined , or able , to register .
In order to register these groups , community organizations with political ties to the Democratic Party carry out voter registration drives , which very often depend upon workers who are paid based on the number of signatures they gather .
There is thus built into the US system of voter registration a tendency to inflate voter registration rolls .
However , this “ crime ” does not imply the intention , much less the possibility , of manipulating the outcome of elections by illegal means .
This is for the simple reason — often overlooked in media coverage of the allegations against ACORN — that nonexistent registered voters cannot show up to vote .
Voter fraud , on the other hand , is the act of illegally casting ballots that will be counted by election officials .
According to Lorraine Minnite , a political scientist at Barnard College and an expert on voting crime , out of all the elections held between 2002 and 2005 , only 24 voters were convicted of fraud in federal courts , and those convicted often had no intent of committing a crime .
In one case , an African American grandmother from Wisconsin , Kimberly Prude , was jailed for over two years for illegally voting in the 2004 election while on probation .
She has maintained that she was unaware she could not vote .
Pro-Democratic groups do not have a monopoly on registration fraud .
A pro-Republican organization , “ Young Political Majors ” ( YPM ) , has carried out a fraudulent registration campaign that may have a more serious bearing on the election .
Numerous allegations have been made since the 2004 election that YPM has tricked people into signing up as registered Republicans by falsely claiming that the petition individuals are signing is some other sort of document , such as a petition against child pornography .
The Los Angeles Times called 46 voters recently re-registered as Republicans by YPM for the 2008 elections .
The Times discovered that the vast majority of these individuals , 37 , had been “ misled into making the change or that it was done without their knowledge . ”
YPM has registered 70,000 people for the upcoming elections .
The owner of the firm , Mark Jacoby , was arrested on October 19 in Southern California for registering to vote in two different locations .
Republicans have charged that the arrest was a partisan - motivated effort designed to divert attention from ACORN .
US attorney firings
The current witch - hunt of ACORN has not come out of the blue .
The firing of nine US attorneys shortly after the elections of 2006 resulted largely from the attorneys ’ obstinacy in carrying out prosecutions of pro-Democratic registration drives .
David Iglesias , one of the fired attorneys , claims that the Republicans “ wanted some splashy pre-election indictments that would scare these alleged hordes of illegal voters away .
We took over 100 complaints and investigated for almost two years — but I did n’t find one prosecutable case of voter fraud in the entire state of New Mexico . ”
Another prosecutor , John McKay of Seattle , was fired because he refused to carry out a voter fraud investigation after the razor - thin Democratic victory in the 2004 Washington state gubernatorial election .
It is now clear that the firings were in preparation for the 2008 presidential election .
In nearly every case , the purging took place in battleground states and the fired attorneys were replaced by Bush loyalists .
One of the fired prosecutors , Bud Cummins of Arkansas , was replaced by a Karl Rove aide , Tim Griffin .
The Republicans anticipated that Hillary Clinton , the former first lady of the state , would be the Democratic nominee and that therefore Arkansas might be a closely contested state .
Another Bush replacement was Bradley J. Schlozman in Missouri .
His predecessor , Todd Graves , had come under criticism from Missouri Republicans for not carrying out investigations of voter fraud .
Six days before the 2006 elections , Schlozman announced indictments of four ACORN workers for submitting fraudulent registrations to the election board in Kansas City .
ACORN had earlier discovered the fraudulent forms and alerted the authorities .
The indictments were a transparent effort to tilt a tight Senate race between Republican incumbent Jim Talent and Democrat Claire McCaskill in favor of the former .
McCaskill narrowly won .
In hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Schlozman said repeatedly that the Justice Department had directed him to announce the indictments before the election .
He later retracted the testimony .
Schlozman ’s appointment as US attorney was the reward for a career spent suppressing the vote .
As the World Socialist Web Site reported in 2007 , “ as a deputy in the Justice Department ’s civil rights division , [ Schlozman ] had overruled career government lawyers in approving a Texas redistricting plan pushed by Tom DeLay , then House majority leader .
He also approved , over the objections of Justice Department civil rights lawyers , a Georgia law requiring voters to show an official photo ID — a plan designed to disenfranchise poor and minority voters .
Schlozman also was involved in filing amicus briefs in the battleground states of Florida , Michigan and Ohio in 2004 , seeking to prevent the counting of provisional ballots in the presidential election . ”

Would You Buy a New House or an Older Home ?
When making the foray into real estate , have you thought about whether you ’d buy a new house or an older home ?
Does it matter ?
Here are some pros and cons .
Thanks to the present housing slump , potential home buyers are finding some great bargains , if they have the patience and the savvy to haggle the final price .
Many houses in the market have been erected during the last 5 years and should be pretty much trouble free .
But , as they say in the construction business , they do n’t make them the way they used to .
Experts also say that a house increases in value over the first 20 years , and then the only valuable property is the land .
Land almost never decreases in value , unless there is a toxic landfill underneath .
So the important question for potential buyers is : is it better to buy an old house or one recently made ?
Why You Should Buy An Older Home
Size is not important , but it sure helps .
One of the big pluses in buying an old house is the property size .
They used to build houses on larger lots .
If you have a large family , the opportunity to live on a larger piece of property seems like a wonderful option .
In general , the square footage for the average single family home has increased over time , while land size appears to have shrunk .
A home built in the 50’s and 60’s has a typical living space of around 900 to 1,600 square feet but it was n’t uncommon for land parcels then to be larger than what it is today , especially in the suburbs .
These days , larger plots of land would be considered prime real estate and will cost you a fortune .
Not to mention the type of wood and materials used in the past , redwood instead of pine , and the size , 2 x 6 instead of 2 x 4 .
It ’s true that some old homes still cost a fortune in some areas , so you ’ll have to be patient and search for the great opportunity .
They ca n’t see us and other goodies .
Aside from the size , old homes give you some privacy from the neighbors .
The new subdivisions tend to build a new house right next to a nosy neighbor who could crawl through your bedroom window from his own .
Think about the area where older homes were built ; their zoning preserves the neighborhood and may afford you more agreeable neighbors , with protection from noisy businesses setting up shop in your vicinity .
Trees may also be an advantage ; they ’ve had time to grow and form a beautiful canopy on the streets where you might jog every day .
Finally , there is the distance .
Older homes may be closer to the city and give you less commute time .
Wow , that ’s worth a lot .
Think of the gas and the frustration you save .
However … here are some ( perhaps obvious ) reasons why a newer home could be better for you .
Why You Should Buy A New House
Of course , there are disadvantages to buying an older home .
I can think of five areas that should be thoroughly vetted before you make an offer on a house that ’s more than 20 years old :
Plumbing
Electrical System
Termites
Roof
Structural Integrity
As you check out an older home , note that if the house had good owners , then they would have probably replaced the heating and cooling systems recently , including the boiler .
Check for signs of good maintenance .
But watch out for asbestos ; have an expert check the pipes to see whether they were covered with asbestos as insulation .
An older home may also have lots of areas that may need repairs and a lot of stuff may require replacement .
Also , many things may not be “ up to code ” .
These days , newer homes have many more amenities — fire sprinklers built in , yard sprinklers installed , built in HVAC systems , and a lot of modern features just not available in older residences .
Additionally , newer houses are built with a lot more forethought , and understandably , address the many requirements of today ’s homeowners .
They are built with more storage , additional rooms , and a “ flow ” that represents the modern family ’s lifestyle .
Many new homes are erected today with a “ green ” designation .
How Do You Decide : Old vs New House ?
What it boils down to is location , location , location … and cost .
Is it possible to fix the old home at an affordable price and still get a bargain ?
Do you like the old house so much that you must have it ?
Do the pros outweigh the cons ?
That feeling of yesteryear .
Old houses have a certain feeling that ’s non-existent in newer homes .
The walls talk to you from generations past ( as long as they do n’t include some grisly murders or have a sordid reputation ) .
Are you willing to sacrifice some of the modern conveniences , larger bathrooms and modern kitchens , for the pleasure of large trees and gardens , pleasant neighbors and proximity to the work place ?
The tradeoff may ultimately boil down to that mature garden vs cool bathroom fixtures and low - flow plumbing !

I spent 15 years in the States and left in 2006 , precisely because I saw the horrifying decline of this great nation .
Do n’t you think , though , that before a turnaround plan you need to do a SWOT analysis ?
Here ’s a quick stab at it :
Strengths :
Bar none , the most diligent , hard - working , dedicated , disciplined and focused people in the world .
I ’ve lived on three continents and know what I am talking about .
Weaknesses :
1. Decay of rationalism .
Right there is your biggest problem .
The War on Science ; the ascend of bullshit artists and religious nutjobs ; the contempt for reality , facts , numbers , data that has pervaded the business , financial and political elites .
2 . Very poor lifestyle energy - efficiency , especially in transportation
3 . Unsustainable military spending and engagements
4. Proliferation of a " heads I win , tails someone else loses " model in the economy and finance , also known as " Privatization of profits , socialization of losses " ( And yes , many venture capitalists can be blamed for that , too . )
Opportunities :
Given the long traditions of rational pragmatism in America and the nation - wide consensus that things need to be changed , there is a real opportunity here for bold and rational changes .
In that regard your country is extremely lucky that it will have as a President someone who is universally acknowledged as the " deepest thinker to ever get in the Oval Office " .
I know this may sound crazy after the past eight years , but being smart and thinking is actually NOT a bad thing .
( And yes , Clinton was also amazingly brilliant , however , he was not really a " thinker " .
He would rely on his intelligence to mostly wing it and go by feel , instead of through a formal analytical thought process )
Threats :
Being too late to avoid a profound decline .
Finally , I am a bit ambivalent on the debt thing .
Yes , I am worried that my children ( all of them U.S. citizen ) would have to pay it down , however , as pointed out , you would be crazy not to finance your country ’s prosperity at such low financing costs ( 3 - 4 % ) .

It was the dirtiest look that Derrick had ever seen .
As he stood in the foyer , paralyzed by his wife ’s dagger - like glare , his mind rushed through all the things he could have possibly done wrong .
Did I forget to pick up the kids ?
Was it someone ’s birthday ?
Crap , it is n’t our anniversary , is it ?
After a few - second - long silence that lasted an eternity , Derrick nervously stammered a greeting .
“ Uhh , hi… honey … I ’m home ? ”
She clenched her jaw as her eyes tensed with anger .
Without abating her piercing glaze , Derrick ’s wife slowly raised her right hand to eye level .
Her tight fist gripped a several - page document bearing the unmistakable logo of Scarlet Financial .
Derrick grimaced , realizing exactly how much trouble he was in .
Taking a Step Back
Eight months earlier , Joe Judge started his first day as a Web Systems Developer at Scarlet Financial ( as I ’ll call them ) .
Though he had worked at a handful of financial services firms in the past , Scarlet was a bit different in that they catered specifically to very high net worth individuals .
If you did n’t have at least ten million dollars in manageable assets , then you ’d have to stick with Charles Schwab , Vanguard , Fidelity , or whatever else the hoi polloi use ; Scarlet certainly was n’t for you .
In the years prior , the internet - savvy demographic within Scarlet ’s client base had grown from zero to a large enough number that might leave if they did n’t have any online financial services .
So , being the client - focused company that they were , Scarlet set out to build a website that would allow clients to view their positions and manage their account .
At first , the website was n’t really self - serve ; it simply merely managed requests and communication between clients and their financial consultant .
But as clients became more internet - savvy , they wanted more interactivity and more features .
In a short few years , Scarlet ’s basic website turned into a full - fledged financial portal .
When Joe started , the big feature that everyone was working on was called Extended Access Management .
The idea of “ Extended Access ” is commonplace in many high - end financial services firms .
Often times , an individual with a complex portfolio of different financial products will need to provide others with limited access to their accounts .
A business partner , for example , may want to monitor his partner ’s personal financial records to ensure that there ’s enough assets and liquidity to cover their joint guarantees ; insurance underwriters , on the other hand , will want continuously verify that their umbrella policies are appropriately coordinated with other insurance policies ; and bankers always want to be certain of their borrowers ’ solvency , especially when it comes to large , complex loans .
Most of us would solve these “ access issues ” by simply copying our account statements , redacting unnecessary and sensitive information , and then mailing out the statements to whoever requested them .
However , since the usage of Xerox machines , Whiteout , and postage stamps are below Scarlet ’s clients , Scarlet developed an internal , extended access system that automatically mailed the appropriate statements with the appropriate level of detail to the appropriate parties at the appropriate times .
Joe ’s job – along with the rest of the development team – was to externalize this system and allow clients to directly manage extended access through their financial portal .
The extended access system was n’t terribly complicated .
Each client had a “ master account ” that had full access all of the client ’s financial products .
The master account could also manage sub-accounts that would have various privileges ( full , transactional read - only , summary read - only , etc ) on various financial products .
Each sub - account could also be assigned statement mailings , so that the sub - account holder would receive the financial information periodically .
A Minor Bug
However , somewhere along the development process – perhaps in a data migration script – a minor bug slipped through .
Master accounts that were setup to receive a Master Account Statement – i.e. the document that showed detailed information about all financial products – defaulted to using the master account holder ’s mailing address .
With so many sub-accounts and statement mailings in the mix , no one seemed to notice the discrepancy .
And besides , why would a master account holder not want the master account statement going to his mailing address , anyway ?
As it turned out , there was a good reason why .
Certain individuals had worked with their Scarlet advisor to create a sub-account for themselves .
The master account statement would be sent to some other address – the office , a post box – while the sub - account statement would be sent home .
This enabled the deceitful to easily hide assets from their family – namely , their spouses – without going to the trouble of creating an entirely new account .
Which brings us back to Derrick .
Like of many other Scarlet clients , Derrick had a “ family ” sub - account that did n’t quite represent his entire financial portfolio .
And like some of the even more unscrupulous clients , he had a charge card account for his certain , “ private ” purchases .
Clients ' Consequences
With his pulse pounding and his heart quickly ascending to his throat , Derrick knew exactly what had turned his wife into a furious tiger , ready to tear him limb from limb .
A million thoughts poured into his head as he tried to recall everything he had charged in the past month , and how he might explain it .
1-800 - Flowers – uh ... uh … employee … mother passed away !
The Ritz – um … err… drinks with a client at the hotel bar !
Saks Fifth Avenue – eee… aaa… early Christmas shopping !
The Ritz , again – ahh… more drinks with clients !
Tiffany 's – ooo… secretary appreciation day !
The Ritz , yet again – um … yee… accidental charge !
It was a pointless thought exercise .
The accidently - mailed master account statement that his wife clenched detailed charge after charge of adulterous activities , many of which were local but occurred while he was “ away on business . ”
And that ’s not to mention the “ secret ” savings account ( which had $ 9,000 deposited in that month alone ) that was undoubtedly Derrick ’s “ start a new life ” fund .
While the following month was n’t quite as painful for Scarlet as it was for some of it clients , they did end up losing several high - profile clients and nearly $ 450 million in managed assets .
Word has it that divorce lawyers , however , made out with quite a pretty penny .
Col Vendeveld wanted to negotiate a plea deal , defence lawyers say A US military prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay has resigned in what defence lawyers describe as a row over ethics .
Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld had quit because his office suppressed evidence that could have cleared a client , defence lawyer Major David Frakt said .
The chief prosecutor has confirmed the resignation , but he denied withholding any evidence .
The case involves an Afghan detainee accused of throwing a grenade at a US military jeep , injuring three people .
The prosecution is said to have withheld evidence that others had confessed to carrying out the attack .
Col Vandeveld is the fourth Guantanamo military prosecutor to quit .
Court declaration Col Lawrence Morris , the Guantanamo military commissions chief prosecutor , told reporters that there were no grounds for Col Vandeveld 's " ethical qualms " .
" All you have is somebody who is disappointed that his superiors did n't see the wisdom of his recommendations in the case , " Col Morris said .
Maj Frakt told reporters that Col Vandeveld had wanted to negotiate a plea deal for the detainee , but that his superiors had blocked this .
Col Vandeveld has not commented publically , but made his concerns known in an declaration to the military court at Guantanamo Bay .
Q&A : Guantanamo tribunals
The declaration can only be made public by a tribunal judge , but in a copy obtained by the Associated Press news agency , Col Vandeveld wrote that " potentially exculpatory evidence has not been provided " .
He blamed this on a failure by " prosecutors and officers of the court " .
Col Vandeveld was prosecuting Mohammed Jawad , 24 , who is accused of tossing a grenade into a military jeep at a bazaar in Kabul in 2002 , injuring two US soldiers and their Afghan interpreter .
Col Vandeveld said prosecutors knew that Mr Jawad might have been drugged before the attack , and that the Afghan interior ministry said two other men had confessed to the same crime .
He also expressed concerns over Mr Jawad 's treatment .
" As a juvenile at the time of his capture , Jawad should have been segregated from the adult detainees , and some serious attempt made to rehabilitate him , " Col Vandeveld wrote in his declaration .
" I am bothered by the fact that this was not done . "
In August , a military judge ruling barred the tribunal 's legal adviser , Air Force Brig Gen Thomas Hartmann , from Mr Jawad 's case , accusing him of having compromised his objectivity .
Brig Gen Hartmann allegedly " pushed " for Mr Jawad to be charged because of the " gripping " details of his case .
The judge , Col Steve Henley , said that Brig Gen Hartmann 's public statements aligning himself with prosecutors and defending the Pentagon 's system for prosecuting terror suspects had compromised his objectivity .

What are these ?
Badly written , too , no doubt .
Please do n't laugh .
I will be writing a lot more about this , but the Swedes just made perhaps the worst decision in the history of the prize today in naming Paul Krugman the 2008 award winner .
It is not that Krugman 's work is entirely without merit , but it always had major problems with it .
Right now I have to get over my shock and horror and write a commissioned piece on this .
But today I would say is a sad day for economics , not a day to be celebrated .
Mises supposedly said during his dying days that he hoped for another Hayek , as I am picking up my jaw from the floor I am hoping for another Samuelson or Arrow to get the award rather the hackonomics that was just honored .
Addendum : My Forbes online column can be found here .
I already mentioned in the comments section Alex 's first - rate summary of Krugman 's contributions to New Trade Theory ---
Alex does about as good a job as anyone could in explaining the contribution and its benefits to our understanding .
It is a model of charitable interpretation of a theorist .
The consequences of Alex 's interpretation focus on another side of the " appreciative theory " of how markets work .
But I think we have to remember that Krugman gets via monopolistic competition and the welfare implications for theory that implies .
This leads us down the road where the absence of public choice considerations produces a more optimistic view of how government can promote the desired ends than is warranted in theory let alone real practice .
Russ Roberts at Cafe Hayek has an assessment that is closer to mine , though Russ focuses on Krugman 's popular statements and how they reflect an abandonment of the economic way of thinking .
Bob Higgs at the Independent Institute reacts to the Krugman prize .
Which is much better– Non-Abstinence or Abstinence - Based healing ?
Each has advantages .
However , one is absolutely more powerful than the other .
Abstinence Treatment Defined
Drug and alcohol abstaining have actually long been declared as the best and most reliable method to beat addiction .
Even dating back centuries , before dependencies were dealt with as medical conditions , the standard method to break drug or alcohol dependences was through abstaining .
Non-Abstinence Treatment Defined
When comparing Non-Abstinence vs. abstaining alcohol substance abuse program , you will rapidly discover that Non-Abstinence for alcohol and drugs is really various from abstaining .
The Non-Abstinence method for addiction treatment refers to 2 different concepts .
When talking about addiction , something is specific : addiction is ravaging not just to people ; however , also households , neighborhoods , and society at big .
The havoc that addiction wreaks has actually reached epidemic percentages , leaving leaders worldwide with choices to make relating to how to fight its unfavorable impacts .
Historically , specifically in the United States and Canada , addiction treatment has actually centered upon an abstinence - based design .
To be dealt with and recover from addiction , most treatment centers and 12 - step programs such as the initial Twelve - step programs , assert that abstaining is important .
More just recently , to attend to the large reaching and severe repercussions of drug addiction , programs that intend to minimize the damage triggered by addiction without motivating abstaining have actually been established .
Non-Abstinence methods are frequently entirely corresponded with programs that offer addicts with tidy needles and education about more secure substance abuse , which were initially presented as the spread of HIV and HELP ended up being a significant public health issue .
Since this association , Non-Abstinence designs are criticized for allowing addicts and viewed as a waste of resources that might be invested in restoring those struggling with alcohol addiction and drug addiction through abstinence - based addiction treatment centers .
A More Extensive look at Non-Abstinence
While the media highlights programs such as the safe - injection website in Vancouver BC and other big - scale needle exchange programs , there is a lot more to Non-Abstinence than programs established to fight the spread of HIV .
A Non-Abstinence technique to addiction healing might be stated to include any method that looks for to decrease the damage brought on by addiction , less obviously , total abstaining .
Methadone upkeep treatment is a Non-Abstinence strategy that has actually assisted many individuals in living more workable lives and minimizes the extreme damage that intravenous heroin usage triggers in all locations of individuals ’ lives .
While still probably questionable , methadone upkeep has actually ended up being a life - saving and appropriate type of treatment for some people .
Methadone upkeep is not meant to be long - lasting options , rather an approach of damage minimization that can assist people , later on , attain total abstaining .
Indeed many individuals admit to rehab programmes like cocaine detox at Abbeycare , then attempt to return to low / social - use principles .
Lots of assets that using methods to addiction treatment that are not concentrated on overall abstaining are favorable and needed for the neighborhood for the following factors :
To get more individuals into treatment
The preconception of identifying oneself as an alcoholic or addict keeps lots of people from looking for treatment in the very first instance .
Worry is a big part of addiction , and by providing an option to the 12 actions , or an option to abstaining just , it is believed that more individuals might take that initial step to get assistance .
More drug replacement treatments such as methadone upkeep are a workable primary step for numerous who wish to release themselves from a life of addiction .
Avoidance
Non-Abstinence techniques to treatment can assist individuals in evaluating and moderating their alcohol , and drug usage may be before they end up being totally reliant or addicted , which might avoid brand - new cases of addiction .
Not just avoiding more extreme cases of addiction , however preventing the spread of HIV through tidy needle programs produces much safer neighborhoods .
Addiction as an Illness and Abstinence - Based Healing
Among the issues with a Non-Abstinence technique , particularly in regards to supporting small amounts is that addiction is frequently defined by a desire yet failure to minimize the usage of drugs .
Addiction is an illness that follows a foreseeable pattern .
While small amounts might be possible for some individuals or for a time period , the nature of addiction makes consuming in small amounts an incredibly hard objective , which some recommend is similarly as challenging as attaining total abstaining – yet not as physically or mentally satisfying .
Damage reduction is also regularly believed of as an economical choice for federal governments to put in location when they can’t pay for to send out a big portion of the population into domestic rehabilitation to accomplish abstaining .
If lots of individuals associate non-voluntary abstinence - based treatment to conserving their lives , mentioning they would have most likely passed away from their addiction before they were “ all set ” to alter .
When we take a look at Non-Abstinence more thoroughly , we can see that abstinence - based addiction treatment usually includes some damage minimization strategies , and frequently damage minimization programs , such as methadone upkeep , are suggested to be a stepping stone towards overall abstaining .
Lots of addiction counselors include an inspirational speaking with technique even within the abstinence - based treatment .
This phase of modification method is often connected with damage minimization ; however , in counseling , it is possible to “ satisfy customers where they are , ” while still asserting abstaining as a needed element of treatment .
While programs focused on minimizing the spread of HIV and HELP through promoting “ more secure ” substance abuse are accomplishing that beneficial objective , the lifestyle of those struggling with addiction is still stopping working .
Analyzing Success Rates of Non-Abstinence vs. Abstaining Treatment
When talking about either abstaining treatment or the Non-Abstinence technique , discovering a precise and dependable success rate is almost difficult .
Since the collection of this information relies entirely on clients self - reporting their alcohol or drug usage , this is generally .
With the pity and preconception connected to addiction , specifically following typically pricey treatment , some recuperating addicts might not be sincere or upcoming in confessing slips or regressions .
Alcoholics Anonymous has actually plainly conserved numerous lives and has actually certainly achieved success in altering the lives of lots of alcohol abusers and their households .
Their reported success rates vary anywhere from 5 percent to 70 percent , depending on the source of information .
The very same can be stated for many abstinence - only programs .
When it comes to small amounts , because the meaning of success and failure appears fuzzy at best , numerous of the data connected to the approach is also undependable .
This approximate nature makes it much simpler to declare success in Non-Abstinence than abstaining .
Here are some data from previous research studies into the effectiveness of abstaining vs. Non-Abstinence .
A 2006 Scottish research study tracked 695 recuperating alcoholics for 33 months following treatment .
The outcomes revealed that simply 5.9 percent of women and 9 percent of males had actually stayed totally abstinent for a minimum of 90 days throughout the near three - year stretch .
Thirty - four percent of people who stay abstinent for one - to - three years will wind up relapsing .
Roughly 30 percent of Small amounts Management members proceed to abstinence - only programs .
In 2012 , half of the therapists talked to in a research study stated that it was all right for alcohol abusers to have a periodic beverage .
Criticisms of Non-Abstinence Treatment
Much of the abstinence - only addiction healing neighborhood assaults the Non-Abstinence theory for allowing addicts to continue drinking .
As was found with Kishline ( it was , later on , discovered that she was concealing her drinking the whole time ) , it ’s not unusual for an individual to lie about how much alcohol he or she is taking in .
Given that Small amounts Management groups are not meant to be extensive or long - lasting , a subscription is primarily online , and groups do not form quickly or last long .
This remains in direct contrast to AA , which frequently includes conferences with members who have actually been sober for many years or perhaps years .
When an individual does try to produce an MM conference , they should make plans by themselves ( area , time , beverages , hiring members , and so on ) and threat losing privacy , which might be an issue for prominent people .
Criticisms of Abstinence - Only Treatments
The most typical indictment versus abstinence - based addiction healing approaches is their rigorous adherence to the 12 - steps design , which concentrates on faith - based addiction treatment .
Not all individuals are comfy with the concept of focusing or hopping on spirituality .
Since they do not desire to stop utilizing totally , challengers of the technique also point to low success rates and objection for numerous people to look for treatment .
Roughly 10 percent of individuals who require treatment for a drug abuse issue really look for and get it .
Others argue that the abstinence - only technique unjustly demonizes addicts who regression and perpetuates the unfavorable preconception associated with addiction .
According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol addiction , 16 percent of the adult populations are non-dependent issue drinkers .
A report from the Centers from Illness Control and Avoidance revealed that 9 out of 10 binge drinkers were n’t alcohol reliant .
Conversation and Suggestions of Non-Abstinence vs. Abstaining Treatment
The argument between Non-Abstinence and abstaining boils down to a person ’s requirements .
For an individual who is an identified alcoholic or a heavy drinker ( more than five beverages on the exact same event on each of 5 or more days in a 30 - day duration ) , Non-Abstinence might not be a reasonable alternative .
Alcoholics and drug addicts typically need more than simply the basic 30 - day detox recommended by Small amounts Management and other Non-Abstinence companies .
Abstaining treatment is the only method to make sure that the illness stays in remission .
Drinkers who self - identify as requiring suppressing their drinking might discover Non-Abstinence to be a much better method .
How numerous drinkers can even remember how numerous alcoholic drinks they had the night before ?
If a person is abusing illegal drugs or prescription drugs , abstinence - only treatment might be recommended .
If an individual has actually triggered considerable damage to his or her life or the lives of others , abstinence - only treatment is the most recommended course of action .
A simple Sharpie pen is emerging as an effective tool to prevent surgical errors and infections .
Surgeons typically use marking pens to ensure they operate on the correct part of a patient ’s body .
But one concern is that the germs from the pen could pose a risk for infection .
As a result , many hospitals use sterile pens once and throw them away , a practice that costs thousands of dollars a year .
Infection control experts from the University of Alberta decided to study pens used to mark up surgical patients .
They compared a one - use sterile surgical pen to a standard Sharpie — the brand name for a line of no -smudge permanent markers favored by everyone from autograph - writing football stars to President Bush .
In a controlled experiment , the tips of both kinds of pens were heavily contaminated with four types of bacteria that can cause surgical site infections , including two germ types that are resistant to antibiotics .
The researchers recapped the markers and allowed them to sit for 24 hours .
Surprisingly , the sterile , one - use marker was still contaminated .
But the Sharpies were not .
As it turns out , the ink used in a Sharpie pen has an alcohol base , making it an unexpected germ fighter .
The researchers , who will present their findings at an infectious disease conference later this month , noted that they used an unusually large number of germs on the markers to conduct the experiment .
That suggests that in the real world , a Sharpie would be highly effective in preventing the spread of germs even after multiple uses .
“ We went much further than what would happen in real life , ” said Dr. Sarah Forgie , associate professor in the department of pediatrics , in a press release .
Dr. Forgie noted that the pen itself should be cleaned with an alcohol swab between patients , just as is done with stethoscopes .
However , she said the marking tip does not pose a risk of bacterial transmission and does n’t need to be discarded after each use , potentially saving thousands of dollars in annual hospital costs .
Patients undergoing surgery should always make sure that only their surgeon — not a nurse or other surgical staff — draws on the body with a permanent marker to identify the correct surgical site .

Gallup Daily : Obama Leading McCain by 4 Points Voter preferences similar to Saturday , when Obama led by 6 points
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama continues to lead John McCain in national voter preferences for the presidential election , now by a four percentage point margin , 49 % to 45 %
Until now , Obama had advanced on McCain in Gallup Poll Daily tracking each day this past week , with the start of that trend coinciding with the news of Lehman Brothers ' imminent bankruptcy on Sunday , Sept. 14 .
Obama 's position versus McCain shifted from a two - point deficit in voter preferences in Monday 's report ( tracking interviews from Sept. 12 - 14 , 2008 ) , to a two - point advantage on Wednesday , a four - point lead on Thursday and a six - point lead on Saturday .
Today 's report , based on interviewing conducted Sept. 18-20 ( Thursday through Saturday ) , marks the first day since the start of Obama 's recent ascent that his lead over McCain has not increased .
From a broader perspective , the race has been relatively close all year , with neither candidate achieving as much as a 10 - point lead .
Obama 's record high nine - point lead came in late July ( following his trip to Europe and the Middle East ) .
He also held an eight - point lead right after the Democratic National Convention in late August .
McCain 's best performance came in late April / early May when he led Obama by six - points .
More recently , his best showing has been with five - point leads , immediately following the Republican National Convention in early September .

ST . PAUL — He was n't flashy , and he did n't aim for the kind of dramatic flourishes or rhetorical flights that have made other acceptance addresses historic or classics of the genre .
Instead , John McCain kicked off his general election campaign Thursday night with the kind of straight talk that he has been known for throughout his career .
" I 've been called a maverick , someone who marches to the beat of his own drummer , " the Republican presidential nominee declared before the Republican National Convention , adding that , " What it really means is I understand who I really work for ... I work for you . "
He pledged to bring massive change to Washington and promised Americans that he would " stand on your side and fight for your future , " and said he has over the years carried that battle to many entrenched interests including big spenders , corrupt officials , and legislators who waste taxpayers ' money on their pet projects .
McCain 's address signaled that he will take the fight to Democrat Barack Obama 's home territory by arguing that he , not Obama , can bring about the kind of change that Americans seem to be clamoring for .
McCain argues that he has the experience to deliver on his promises to bring a new era of reform , bipartisanship , and problem - solving to Washington while Obama offers little more than empty rhetoric .
" We need to change the way government does almost everything , " McCain said .
In a moving passage , he spoke of his more than five years as a POW when he stood up to torture and shocking abuse , and fellow American prisoners saved his life by caring for him when he was near death .
But he said the experience made him a better person .
" I was n't the same man any more , " he declared to rising cheers .
" I was my country 's . "
He went on to urge Americans to fight for change , for " what 's right , " and " for justice . "
" Stand up and fight , " he concluded . " ... Never quit . "
This appeal for change marks an important pivot point for the veteran senator from Arizona .
He has spent the past few months attacking Obama , a one - term senator from Illinois , for inexperience and bad judgment — in short , for not being ready to be commander in chief .
But after choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate , the inexperience argument has less resonance .
Palin has been governor for less than two years and she has a thin resume of government service before that .
But in addition to her popularity among conservative Republicans , the campaign says Palin appeals to rural voters , conservative , values - oriented Democrats who in the past supported Ronald Reagan , and women who are disaffected with Obama because he defeated Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries .
McCain also would seem to be an unlikely change agent .
The 72 - year - old senator has been a fixture in Washington for a generation , and , as he proudly told U.S. News in a recent interview , he has helped shape policy for every major American conflict over the past two decades .
But eight out of 10 Americans tell pollsters they believe the country is heading in the wrong direction , and most Americans want a change from the policies of the unpopular President George W. Bush .
Obama plans to continue linking McCain to those policies , which the Democrats say he has voted for 90 percent of the time .
Overall , McCain strategists tell U.S. News that the former Navy aviator and Vietnam POW has a clear battle plan for the fall .
He will attempt to capitalize on his reputation , at least until his recent overtures to party insiders and traditional constituencies , as a maverick who , in the favorite slogan of the GOP convention , puts " country first . "
" He is the reform candidate , " says a senior McCain adviser .
" This is the reform team [ McCain and Palin ] that knows how to bring reform to Washington . "
McCain also plans to emphasize the traditional GOP advantage with voters on national security , since many Americans are n't sure that the Democrats are tough enough to keep the country safe .
" We can still make this a commander in chief election , " the adviser says .
The McCain campaign and the national Republican Party plan a huge advertising blitz in battleground states including Ohio , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Florida , and Colorado , attacking Obama 's credentials and promoting McCain as the only leader who can " keep us safe . "
McCain did n't generate the same fiery enthusiasm as Palin when she gave her acceptance speech earlier this week .
Palin immediately became a darling of the conservatives who constitute a large part of the delegations at the convention , many of whom have disagreed with McCain on issues in the past .
But on Thursday night , all seemed to be forgiven , at least for a few hours .
Thousand of delegates , many waving blue and white " McCain - Palin " and " Country First " signs , repeatedly interrupted his remarks with cheers and applause .

Marketers ask me all the time the benefits of thought leadership , and I have only one thing to say : “ Make it happen . ”
When it does n’t work , it ’s often for a number of reasons :
1. Poor execution .
2 . Not enough effort .
In b2b , there really is no such thing as over - exposure .
3 . Poor choice of superstar – a .k.a. , your thought leader .
The one who is going to fill the house , put butts in the seats and pretty much make your brand the equivalent of a household name .
Masters of thought leadership include :
1. Wall Street ( the latest happenings not withstanding ) .
Think Mary Meeker and the cult of Alan Greenspan .
2. College Basketball and football coaches – remember , these dudes have even written books that smart people actually read !
At least we are led to believe they actually wrote the books .
3. Politicians – duh – for the most part .
And they can come and go .
Witness Henry Blodgett .
But my favorite master of the thought leadership game is T. Boone Pickens .
In a nutshell , T . Boone is a wildcatter who made billions in the oil game .
Since 2001 until earlier this year , T. Boone could move the crude oil markets like no other .
He was always the thought leader du jour on CNBC , “ The Wall Street Journal , ” and you name it with his oil price predictions .
He always brought data to his commentary and was the first person to call for the $ 100 barrel of oil .
What people were never told was that he was the single biggest holder in oil futures on the Nymerc ( where oil is traded ) .
Pure brilliance :
An oil speculator from Oklahoma , looked upon as the oil expert , who every time he got on tv made tens of millions for himself and his beloved Oklahoma State University ( he donated $ 60 some - odd million to their athletic department ) .
Check out this Bloomberg article from ’07 :
Boone Pickens , chairman of Dallas - based BP Capital LLC , told financial news network CNBC that crude - oil prices will rise to $ 100 a barrel , perhaps before the end of this year .
“ It could come this quarter , ” Pickens said today on CNBC .
“ Within a year , you ’re going to see $ 100 oil . ”
Guess what this “ genius ” is doing now ?
Selling alternative energy .
Guess what that means ?
He started selling his oil contracts at $ 150 a barrel and could be going short .

What ’s the moral of the story ?
I used to giggle at PR folks , but the reality is , companies need to create superstars in their industry .
I am not saying it ’s easier in the b2b world , but there is a massive desire for content and b2b organizations need to take advantage .
Here are my tips :
1 . Think like a political strategist or Hollywood PR machine :
Make sure the message , ideology , and goals are clear and well fleshed out .
2 . Pick the right superstar : its usually a CEO , but it can be a resident “ smarty - pants . ”
3 . Blog , panel and speak :
Get in front of the masses .
Keep in mind , all three are realistic .
How many trade show companies send out requests for speakers ?
4. Pictures : Learn from the best , the face works .
5 . Leverage the other thought leaders : get yours in the loop with other bloggers , columnists , writers and talking heads .
These are the guys who will turn to your guru for quotes .
Take it from T. Boone , the thought leader can move the market in your direction .

Holy crap .
… just two weeks ago , when Palin ’s church , the Wasilla Bible Church , gave its pulpit over to a figure viewed with deep hostility by many Jewish organizations : David Brickner , the founder of Jews for Jesus .
Palin ’s pastor , Larry Kroon , introduced Brickner on Aug. 17 , according to a transcript of the sermon on the church ’s website .
“ He ’s a leader of Jews for Jesus , a ministry that is out on the leading edge in a pressing , demanding area of witnessing and evangelism , ” Kroon said .
Brickner then explained that Jesus and his disciples were themselves Jewish .
“ The Jewish community , in particular , has a difficult time understanding this reality , ” he said .
Brickner ’s mission has drawn wide criticism from the organized Jewish community , and the Anti-Defamation League accused them in a report of “ targeting Jews for conversion with subterfuge and deception . ”
Brickner also described terrorist attacks on Israelis as God ’s “ judgment of unbelief ” of Jews who have n’t embraced Christianity .
“ Judgment is very real and we see it played out on the pages of the newspapers and on the television .
It ’s very real .
When [ Brickner ’s son ] was in Jerusalem he was there to witness some of that judgment , some of that conflict , when a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars , killing numbers of people .
Judgment — you ca n’t miss it . ”
Palin was in church that day , Kroon said , though he cautioned against attributing Brickner ’s views to her .
More than 5,000 people marched through downtown Montreal on Sunday to protest the Conservative party 's policies .
The march was organized by a coalition of artists , environmental and social groups , and unions opposed to actions taken by the Conservative minority government .
Tory policies on the arts and culture , the environment , women 's rights , First Nations rights , Afghanistan and the economy are a threat to the country , the coalition said .
" I 'm ashamed to be a Canadian , to tell you the truth , and I chose this country , " said Odette Greeya , a protestor who immigrated to Quebec from France .
People who work in the manufacturing sector have n't been protected enough by Conservative policies and the situation will get worse if they win a majority , warns the Quebec Federation of Labour .
" I think it 's going to be real dangerous , " said federation president Michel Arsenault .
" Dangerous for the workers of this country , for the business community . "
Protesters ' long list of grievances speaks to a profound malaise with the Tory government , said Claudette Carbonneau , president of the CSN labour federation .
" There has to be a real mess , within a minority government , to draw this kind of protest , " she said .
Canadians should vote strategically to block the Conservative party from a majority , said Quebec actor Émmanuel Bilodeau .
The coalition of groups also wanted to draw attention to Omar Khadr , a Canadian being detained in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba on terrorism - related charges .
WASHINGTON : A group of Republicans are putting together an alternative to the $ 700 - billion rescue plan proposed by US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , a media report said today .
The rejection of the bailout plan on Monday by the US House of Representatives has made the group to press forward with its own plan , news broadcaster CNBC quoting sources reported on its website .
The development of the alternative plan comes as members of the Senate consider voting on the original financial rescue plan later today , the report added .
According to sources , components of the alternative plan include a guarantee from the US treasury of up to 100 per cent for bank losses resulting from failed mortgage - backed securities originated prior to the plan 's enactment , the report said .
Such insurance would provide immediate value to the securities and a foundation for which they could then be sold and the Treasury Department would finance that insurance by assessing a premium on outstanding mortgage - backed securities , it added .
The alternative plan also includes allowing companies to carry back losses arising in tax years ending in 2007 , 2008 , or 2009 , generating a tax refund and immediate capital .
While it also envisages allowing a ' repatriation window ' for profits earned by US firms overseas .
Such repatriation amounts would not be taxed if invested in distressed debt ( as defined by Treasury ) for at least one year , the report stated .
Besides , the Republicans in their alternative plan also propose to allow banks to treat losses on shares of preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as ordinary losses , not as capital losses .
"
The first thing I would do is say , Let 's not call it a bailout .
Let 's call it a rescue , " McCain told CNN .
He said , " Americans are frightened right now " , and the Arizona Republican maintained and argued that political leaders must give them an immediate solution and a longer - term approach to the problem .
Meanwhile , Obama has issued a statement saying that increasing the federal deposit insurance would help small businesses and make the US banking system more secure , besides restoring public confidence .
The Bush administration is frantically looking at ways in which the rude shocks of the last few days could be minimised , essentially making the point that continuing losses in Wall Street of close to trillion dollars or more can not be sustained by the economy .
In response to McCain 's statement today about his intention to suspend his campaign to work on the bailout bill , Senator Obama held a news conference to reiterate what he would like to see in the bill , as well as his view that the debate should go on as scheduled .
Although he would n't answer direct questions about whether he thought McCain 's decision was politically - motivated , he went out of his way to make clear that he approached McCain first and that he thinks this is an ideal time for a debate because the American people deserve to know how the next President will solve these problems .

" This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from their leaders .
" With respect to the debates , it ’s my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who , in approximately 40 days , will be responsible for dealing with this mess .
And I think that it is going to be part of the president ’s job to deal with more than one thing at once .
I think there ’s no reason why we ca n’t be constructive in helping to solve this problem and also tell the American people what we believe and where we stand and where we want to take the country . "
Pelosi and Reid are calling McCain 's bluff :
" The debate should take place as scheduled , " Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with NPR to be broadcast this afternoon .
" We have to be able to do a couple of things at once .
That 's what leadership requires . "
" I understand that the candidates are putting together a joint statement at Senator Obama 's suggestion , " said Sen. Harry Reid .
" But it would not be helpful at this time to have them come back during these negotiations and risk injecting presidential politics into this process or distract important talks about the future of our nation 's economy .
If that changes , we will call upon them .
We need leadership ; not a campaign photo op . "
UPDATE : Chris Matthews just reported that the Debate Commission and Ole Miss have announced that the debate will continue as scheduled .
SuveryUSA conducted a lightning - quick poll and found that 90 % of Americans believe the debate should go on as scheduled .

( CNN ) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama weighed in Friday on the passage of the economic bailout bill , which was signed into law by President Bush .
Sen .
Barack Obama says the passage of the bailout bill " must be the beginning " of help for the economy .
" This is not a moment for celebration , but a sobering day when we found out that three - quarters of a million jobs were lost just this year .
Passing this rescue plan cannot be the end of our work to strengthen our economy -- it must be the beginning , " Obama said in a statement .
" America is facing one of the greatest financial crises in history , and today 's passage of an emergency rescue plan was absolutely necessary to prevent an economic catastrophe that could have cost millions of jobs and forced businesses across the country into bankruptcy , " he added .
McCain , speaking in Flagstaff , Arizona , said he commended the House for " coming together to pass the economic rescue bill today .
I am glad I suspended my campaign and went back to Washington to help bring the House Republicans to the table . "
" This rescue bill is n't perfect , and it is an outrage that it 's even necessary , but we have to stop the damage to our economy done by corrupt and incompetent practices on Wall Street and in Washington .
The action Congress took today is a tourniquet .
It is not a permanent solution , " he added .
Earlier Friday , Obama and McCain released statements reacting to a jobs report that paints a dismal outlook for American workers .
It shows that employers cut 159,000 jobs in September -- the biggest decline in five years .
" Just since January , we 've lost more than 750,000 jobs across America , 7,000 in Pennsylvania alone , " Obama said at a rally in Arlington , Pennsylvania .
" This is the economy that John McCain said -- just two weeks ago -- was fundamentally strong .
" This is the economy that my opponent said made great progress under the policies of George W. Bush .
And those are the economic policies that he proposes to continue for another four years . "
The McCain campaign 's statement urged Congress to do more to help taxpayers .
" Today 's report of another 159,000 lost jobs confirms what America 's working men and women have understood for months :
Our nation 's economy is on the wrong track .
It is imperative that Congress act to address the financial crisis while protecting taxpayers and being good stewards of their dollars .
But we must do more , " McCain said .
Also Friday , Obama took time out to praise Sen. Joe Biden : " I was so proud of Joe . ... America saw clearly why I thought he'd make such a great vice president , especially during these difficult and challenging times . "
Meanwhile , only hours after the year 's sole vice presidential debate ended , the Obama campaign released a television ad highlighting one of Biden 's more memorable lines of the night .
Watch iReporters weigh in on the VP debate »
The 30 - second spot , called " Can't Explain , " shows Biden 's exchange with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin over McCain 's health care plan .
Biden noted that McCain would pay for his proposed $ 5,000 tax credit to families with taxes on every individual with an employer - sponsored health care plan .
" I call that the ultimate Bridge to Nowhere , " Biden said of the plan , to laughter from the crowd in what was a clear reference to the infamous pork - barrel project .
It 's a line Biden has repeatedly used on the campaign trail .
Watch the full Obama ad
The moment was among the more memorable ones in a debate that featured few knock - out jabs .
Palin , a one - time supporter of the bridge project , did not respond to the line but was seen smiling .
Tucker Bounds , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , called Biden 's contention an " outright lie . "
" Oddly , instead of shying away from an outright lie told by Joe Biden last night , the Obama campaign appears willing to double - down on his reckless dishonestly .
It 's a lie for the Obama campaign to say John McCain 's health care plan taxes health care , when the McCain plan clearly provides the equivalent tax break for every American .
" Whether Barack Obama and his running mate are voting in favor of higher taxes on Americans making just $ 42,000 or telling bald faced lies , Americans know failed leadership when they see it . "
Bounds was referring to a June 5 , 2008 , vote on a resolution ( Senate Concurrent Resolution 70 ) meant to outline the Senate 's budget priorities through 2013 , but the measure had no practical effect .
Obama and running mate Biden voted " yes " on the resolution .
McCain did not vote .
According to a CNN review of the resolution , it assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts pushed by President Bush will expire in that time .
That 's what McCain calls a tax increase .
However , the Democrats offered their own cuts in the 48 - page resolution , which called for several tax cuts and breaks , including rolling back the alternative - minimum tax and the so - called " marriage penalty . "
According to an analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center , the tax plan Obama has proposed during the campaign would increase taxes in 2009 on the wealthiest 20 percent of households , while offering tax cuts for the other 80 percent .
McCain , speaking in Pueblo , Colorado , on Friday , touched on the " underdog " status he now faces .
" We have 32 days , who 's counting ... between now and the election , " he said .
" My friends , have no doubt : I 'm the underdog in this race , OK .
I 've always loved being the underdog . "
The Arizona senator also made a direct appeal to supporters to get out the vote .
" I 'm going to have to get you out to work .
... I 'm going to count on your help .
You 've got to get out all of your friends -- Republicans , Democrats , Libertarians ... whoever they are .
You got to get them out .
And I 'll be counting on you . "
Meanwhile , McCain 's decision Thursday to pull out of Michigan prompted the state Republican Party chairman to issue a desperate plea Friday for donations to help fund political activities the presidential campaign probably would have shouldered .
" I wo n't sugarcoat it ; the McCain campaign 's decision to pull out of Michigan is a tough blow , " Saul Anuzis , chairman of the Michigan Republican Party , wrote in an e-mail fundraising solicitation to Republicans .
" But we can not let it deter us . "
The latest CNN poll of Michigan voters , released late last month , suggested Obama was holding on to his edge over McCain in the fight for the state 's 17 electoral votes .
Among likely voters , Obama held a 5 - point lead , 51 percent to 46 percent ; among the larger sample of registered voters , the lead was 7 points .
Obama had a 4 - point advantage in the previous CNN poll in Michigan , conducted at the beginning of September .

Michigan has voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential contests , though John Kerry 's winning margin there over President Bush in 2004 was just 3 points .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Exxon Mobil Corp topped its own record for the biggest U.S. quarterly operating profit and Royal Dutch Shell Plc earnings beat market forecasts on Thursday , helped by high oil prices and fatter refinery margins .

But both Exxon and Shell said their quarterly oil output fell , in part from damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike , which swept through the Gulf of Mexico during the quarter .
U.S. oil prices averaged about $ 118 a barrel in the third quarter , more than $ 40 higher than the year - ago period .
They had peaked above a record $ 147 in early July before turning and falling by nearly 60 percent over the next three months .
That decline , coupled with knock - on effects of the credit crunch on oil and gas producers , prompted a few more U.S. oil services companies to cut 2009 spending forecasts on Thursday .
Exxon and Shell posted strong performances in refining , which benefited as the falling crude oil price trimmed costs , even as demand for gasoline shrank , analysts said .
Gene Pisasale , senior energy analyst at PNC Capital Advisors , called Exxon ’s U.S. refining profits a positive , but said it needed to focus on boosting oil and gas output .
“ They need to be more aggressive with the drill bit .
...
That ’s going to be the focus going forward , ” he said .
The global economic slump has prompted energy experts to pare back oil demand forecasts in recent months , and the oil price declines have forced many companies , such as Hess and Suncor Energy , to rein in spending on projects .
Yet Irving , Texas - based Exxon said it planned to stick to its spending plans of $ 25 billion this year as it maintained its strong financial position despite the economic turmoil .
Smaller rival Marathon Oil Corp said rising production and improved refinery margins helped it more than double profit in the quarter , but it cut planned 2009 spending by more than 15 percent because of the current business environment .
Exxon ’s earnings jumped 58 percent from a year ago to $ 14.8 billion , and operating profit climbed 42 percent to $ 13.4 billion , easily topping the previous U.S. record it set in the second quarter at $ 11.7 billion .
Exxon ’s majority - owned Imperial Oil Ltd , Canada ’s top oil company , also had a strong quarter .
Shell ’s profit rose 71 percent to $ 10.9 billion , topping analyst forecasts , but its shares slipped as investors focused on the Anglo - Dutch major ’s 7 percent drop in oil and gas production .
Shell also said Chief Financial Officer Peter Voser would take over from Jeroen van der Veer as CEO next July .
A decline in oil futures prices that cut into a rally early this week pushed Exxon shares down 2.5 percent , after early gains , and Shell fell 4.1 percent .
Marathon jumped 6.3 percent .
SERVICE SECTOR SEES SLOWDOWN
U.S. oil services company BJ Services
Co , while posting a rise in profit on Thursday , foresaw weaker activity by oil and gas producers weighing on its future earnings .
It cut fiscal 2009 capital spending plans to a range of $ 550 million to $ 575 million , down from $ 600 million in 2008 .
Rival Cameron International Corp , alongside a solid third - quarter performance , also said its 2009 capital expenditure would fall .
“ When you look at the kind of capex we spent the last couple of years , if you make the assumption that we ’re pretty much where we need to be on capacity given the outlook , you ’ll probably see capex come down a little bit , ” Chief Financial Officer Charles Sledge told analysts on a conference call .
That dimmer outlook was echoed by driller Patterson - UTI Energy , which said the number of rigs hired by energy companies to search for oil and gas was likely to shrink through the end of the year .
Patterson - UTI posted a rise quarterly profits of more than 10 percent , while contract driller Pride International Inc saw its profits surge .
Pride shares jumped 13 percent , Patterson - UTI shares rose 9 percent and Cameron was up 8.8 percent , while BJ Services fell less than 1 percent .
India ’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp reported a 5.7 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday , missing market expectations as its subsidy burden grew .
ONGC , accounting for 78 percent of India ’s oil and gas production , must sell oil from its domestic output at mandated discounts to state - run refiners to keep retail prices low .
Virginia sheriff accused of cockfight bribes
He pleads not guilty to charges linked to cockfighting ring
A sheriff pleaded not guilty Thursday to federal conspiracy and money - laundering charges stemming from accusations that he took bribes in exchange for promising not to interfere with a cockfighting ring .
A 22 - count indictment against Page County Sheriff Daniel Presgraves unsealed Thursday also accuses him of intimidating potential witnesses .
The indictment alleges he sexually assaulted and harassed four female employees , harassed seven others and intimidated another .
In releasing Presgraves on $ 50,000 bond , U.S. Magistrate B. Waugh Crigler barred him from acting as sheriff while the case is pending .
If convicted on all charges , he faces up to 304 years behind bars .
" It 's a very sad day when we have to stand before you to report that a federal grand jury has found sufficient cause to return an indictment against an elected public official , " acting U.S. Attorney Julia Dudley said .
Presgraves also was charged with taking bribes from a local corporation , which officials refused to identify ; diverting public money for his own use ; and using inmates to work on his private property .
Separately , the grand jury indicted the Virginia Game Fowl Breeders Association and its president , Chester William Fannon , for allegedly making illegal campaign contributions .
Like Presgraves , Fannon pleaded not guilty and was released on $ 50,000 bond .
According to the indictment , Fannon made $ 11,000 in personal contributions , which were then reimbursed by the association .
Tim McGraw Apolgizes to Fans
Country singeris confused and flat out disappointed with his record label .
Curb Records has chosen to release another greatest hits album for the singer instead of his new material .
McGraw has been working on an album for over a year and has even been singing three new songs on his recent tour .
In an apology to his fans he said :
" I am saddened and disappointed that my label chose to put out another hits album instead of new music .
I 've only had one studio album since my last hits package .
It has to be just as confusing to the fans as it is to me . "
Sounds fishy to us .
Tim also added that he was n't involved in the process whatsoever and while he is proud of his songs that will be featured , he is " embarrassed as an artist " .
Our thought is that maybe he should team up with his wife , country sensation Faith Hill and do some new songs under her label .
That ought to show his record label that he can succeed with or without them .
Curb Records was not available for comment but they are likely to want to discuss the matter with McGraw at his earliest convenience .

New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees has told a gathering of delegates from more than 80 cities that sitting in traffic in Sydney is like being in love .
Mr Rees has told the opening of Sydney 's Metropolis Congress that the city 's transport systems are " stressed " but the congestion problems could be worse .
" Congestion is a concern for all Sydneysiders , " he said .
" If you think you are in traffic , you are in traffic .
It 's not a relative concept .
It 's no good for me saying , ' Oh , it 's much worse in New York or Paris ' .
" It 's like being in love .
If you think you are in love , you are in love .
If you think you are in traffic , you are in traffic .
" So for those of you who are from overseas , and those of you who are from other major cities who have jumped in a taxi this morning or been on a bus , please get into the ear of some of our journalists and let them know that the congestion in Sydney is not as bad as it could perhaps be . "
' Water secret '
Mr Rees also told the audience his predecessor , Morris Iemma , had told him not to reveal the extent of Sydney 's water crisis when he was water minister .
The new Premier said Sydneysiders would be " drinking mud " if not for the city 's water restrictions .
" The former premier would n't let me say this , but I can say it now : we transfer roughly half of our water supply each day up from the Shoalhaven River in the south , " he said .
" In February last year , in the middle of the worst drought in 100 years , if we had n't been transferring water from that river and if we had n't had water restrictions on , our water supply would have been down to 7 per cent . "
" That 's scary .
That means people [ would be ] drinking mud . "
Mr Rees said the city 's planned desalination plant was needed to guarantee its water supply independent of rain .
Train wreck
The Premier also promoted the state 's biggest infrastructure project , the Epping - to - Chatswood train line , at the conference , despite today 's revelations that its cost has blown out again .
Tests have found the underground line will be too noisy for commuters .
Media reports suggest noise levels in the trains on the line reach 90 decibels , which is as loud as a 737 jet coming in to land .
RailCorp is refusing to release the results of the tests .
It says its plan to fix the problem will cost extra .
The line was originally due to run from Parramatta to Chatswood and open in 2006 at a cost of $ 1.4 billion , but it was cut in half in 2003 and costs have since soared to $ 2.3 billion .
The State Government says the opening of the line will not be delayed any further .
The full service will not open until mid-next year but shuttle services are due to begin in February .
The rail line is the state 's biggest infrastructure project .
The Metropolis 2008 congress was opened by actress Cate Blanchett , who is the joint artistic director of Sydney Theatre Company .
Mayors , governors , senior city officials , academics and industry leaders are attending the four - day event , which is due to focus on issues affecting cities , including climate change , infrastructure , leadership and urban renewal .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
When Russia shut down its stock markets to avoid the global collapse sweeping the markets earlier this week , most of Wall Street shook its head .
The move smacked of totalitarianism and artificial manipulation , such a brazen intervention would n't happen in a free market .
Well , the Russians are having a good chuckle after Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox , following the lead of the U.K. 's Financial Services Authority , initiated a ban in short selling for 799 U.S. financial institutions including Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS , - 1.14 % and Washington Mutual Inc. WM , - 0.55 % .
See full story .
The move smacks of irony on several fronts .
For one , institutions such as Morgan and Goldman regularly practice short - selling as part of their proprietary trading strategies .
These firms made billions in profits by running hedge funds or serving them through prime brokerage operations .
They shrugged when companies complained that short sellers were ruining their companies .
Now , Morgan 's John Mack and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman not only won a ban of naked shorting , but of all shorting of their industry .
They also have persuaded New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to investigate short selling in the market place .
Remember , short selling is perfectly legal .
Manipulating prices through rumor is n't .
But what is the SEC banning ?
Eric Newman , portfolio manager at TFS Capital TFSMX , said the SEC is doing exactly what claims to be against -- manipulating the markets and propping up ailing financial companies .
They 're doing it because the banks are essentially backed by taxpayers and have become politically important .
Our complaint through history about countries that try to influence their markets by changing the rules mid-game was that it was tantamount to cheating .
For all of its faults , the U.S. markets were supposed to be the most level playing fields in the world .
At least Russia shut everyone out of the game .
- David Weidner
Well , of course , right ?
I mean a job well done deserves a bonus !
Bloomberg :
Five straight quarters of losses and a 70 percent slide in its stock this year have n't stopped Merrill Lynch & Co. from allocating about $ 6.7 billion to pay bonuses .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley , both still on track for profitable years , have set aside about $ 13 billion for bonuses after three quarters , down 28 percent from a year ago .
Even some employees at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , which declared the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history last month , will get the same bonus they received a year ago .
The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , a $ 700 billion taxpayer bailout , public outcry over excessive pay and the demise of three of the biggest securities firms wo n't deter Wall Street from offering year - end rewards to employees on top of their salaries , compensation experts say .
``Critical producers and critical managers will be retained with the same bonus they had last year , '' said Robert Sloan , head of U.S. financial - services recruiting at Egon Zehnder International , a New York - based executive - search firm .
`` The others will see sharp cuts . ''
Goldman , the biggest and most profitable Wall Street firm until it opted to become a bank holding company last month , has set aside about $ 6.85 billion for bonuses , or an average of $ 210,300 for each employee , down 32 percent from $ 339,400 a year ago .
Morgan Stanley , the second - biggest securities firm until it also converted to a bank , has $ 6.44 billion for bonuses , or $ 138,700 per person , down 20 percent from last year .
Both firms accrue a fixed percentage of their revenue for compensation , so the decline in bonus pools matches the drop in revenue .
... ``We are in the process of determining appropriate levels of year - end compensation , and no decisions have been made , '' said Mark Lake , a spokesman at Morgan Stanley .
I bet if you go to the unemployment office you might be able to find a few people with some suggestions .
The Nobel Peace Prize for 2008
English
Norwegian
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2008 to Martti Ahtisaari for his important efforts , on several continents and over more than three decades , to resolve international conflicts .
These efforts have contributed to a more peaceful world and to “ fraternity between nations ” in Alfred Nobel ’s spirit .
Throughout all his adult life , whether as a senior Finnish public servant and President or in an international capacity , often connected to the United Nations , Ahtisaari has worked for peace and reconciliation .
For the past twenty years , he has figured prominently in endeavours to resolve several serious and long - lasting conflicts .
In 1989 - 90 he played a significant part in the establishment of Namibia ’s independence ; in 2005 he and his organization Crisis Management Initiative ( CMI ) were central to the solution of the complicated Aceh question in Indonesia .
In 1999 and again in 2005 - 07 , he sought under especially difficult circumstances to find a solution to the conflict in Kosovo .
In 2008 , through the CMI and in cooperation with other institutions , Ahtisaari has tried to help find a peaceful conclusion to the problems in Iraq .
He has also made constructive contributions to the resolution of conflicts in Northern Ireland , in Central Asia , and on the Horn of Africa .
Although the parties themselves have the main responsibility for avoiding war and conflict , the Norwegian Nobel Committee has on several occasions awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to mediators in international politics .
Today Ahtisaari is an outstanding international mediator .
Through his untiring efforts and good results , he has shown what role mediation of various kinds can play in the resolution of international conflicts .
The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to express the hope that others may be inspired by his efforts and his achievements .

On July 23 2008 , the High Resolution Stereo Camera on board the ESA ’s Mars Express took the highest - resolution full - disc image yet of the surface of the moon Phobos .
New observations of Mars ' moon Phobos show the object ismore like a pile of rubble than a single solid body .
Phobos , the larger of Mars ' two moons ( Deimos is the other ) , is anenigmatic satellite : Scientists are n't sure howit formed , or where its material came from .
New data from the European Space Agency 's MarsExpress spacecraft currently in orbit around the red planet are helping toshed light on the moon 's origins .
Scientists have created a 3 - D map of Phobosfrom high - resolution images taken during Mars Express 's summer 2008 flybys ofthe moon , and used this data to calculate its volume .
Another team of researchers used radio signals from thespacecraft that vary based on the tug of Phobo 's gravity to calculate theobject 's precise mass , and found that it weighs 1.072 x 10^16 kg ( 2.36 x 10 ^16 pounds ) , or about 1 billionth the mass of the Earth .
" We can be ten times more precise in our frequencyshift measurements today " than previous estimates based on data fromearlier satellite missions , said Pascal Rosenblatt of the Royal Observatory ofBelgium , a member of the Mars Express Radio Science team .
The mass and volume information allowed researchers toreckon Phobos ' density , and the scientists found that the moon is not solid , but probably filled with giant caverns .
Researchers call this kind of body , which is basically a clump of rocks held together by gravity , a rubble pile .
Phobos ' density ?
1.85 grams per cubic centimeter ( 0.067 pounds per cubic inch ) ?
is lower than the density of Martian surface rocks , which are 2.7 to 3.3 grams per cubic centimeter ( 0.098 to 0.119 pounds percubic inch ) .
In fact , its density is similar to that of some asteroids , suggesting that Phobos and its sister moon could be captured asteroids , ratherthan satellites created out of material from Mars itself .
To get to the bottom of Phobos ' origins , samples of the moonmust be brought back to Earth for analysis , scientists say .
A Russian missionplanned to launch next year , called Phobos - Grunt ( meaning " Phobos - soil " ) , could do exactly that , and will need MarsExpress 's precise measurements of Phobos ' mass to land on the moon .
Correction :
The mass of Phobos has been corrected .
With the Y : The Last Man film coming in 2010 , we ’ll soon get a big - screen treatment of Brian K. Vaughan ’s world without men .
All - female societies are not uncommon in science fiction , from culturally advanced utopias to post - apocalyptic sex comedies .
Far less common are societies where men live , either by choice or circumstance , with few or no women .
How do these societies come about ?
How do they perpetuate themselves without the opposite sex ?
And what happens to men when the women disappear from their lives ?
World Without Women by Day Keene and Leonard Pruyn ( 1960 )
How it happened : A mysterious illness kills off all the women in the world save a few .
How they reproduce : Unfortunately , all the women have been rendered barren , except one who was living in isolation during the plague .
How it works :
The now largely male society becomes obsessed with the surviving women , with most states declaring martial law .
Men who harass or assault women are shot , prostitution is legalized , and some countries require their remaining women to enter polyandrous marriages .

The White Plague by Frank Herbert ( 1982 )
How it happened : A molecular biologist , driven mad by the loss of his wife and children by the IRA , concocts and releases a deadly biological weapon that affects only women .
How they reproduce : A very small handful of women were successfully inoculated against the plague .
How it works :
The world returns to a semblance of stability , with the decimation of the female population finally uniting a once - divided world , a unity that extends to the sharing of breeding women like any other natural resource .
Childbirth becomes the primary function of able women and is quickly commoditized , with women agreeing to carry the children of important military officials in exchange for protection and influence .
“ A Man ’s World ” by Alan Moore ( 1985 )
How it happened : The Culacaons are all naturally male .
How they reproduce : Through the act of “ gamugha , ” in which one party meets an unpleasant end .
How it works :
The system works out fine for the Culacaon , but it can lead to some cross-cultural misunderstandings .

Hatching Stones by Anna Wilson ( 1991 )
How it happens :
When cloning becomes a technological feasibility , men find that they prefer cloning themselves to having natural - born children .
Women become increasingly rare from generation to generation , until the few remaining women go into voluntary exile .
How they reproduce : Men have themselves cloned .
How it works :
The men offer women exile to quell political tensions between men wish to employ cloning as the exclusive means of reproduction and women who seek a return to natural childbirth .
The clones , who are portrayed as the product of their predecessors ’ narcissism , live a happily hedonistic existence but suffer from a lack of personal identity .

The Disappearance by Philip Wylie ( 1951 )
How it happened : A single dimension shifted suddenly and mysteriously in two , with one universe populated entirely with males and the other populated entirely with females .
How they reproduce :
The universes remerge before it ever comes to that .
How it works : Neither dimension functions well without the other .
The infrastructure and technological capabilities of the male universe remains intact , but violence breaks out around the world , forcing men to achieve their ends by force .
“ The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal ” by Cordwainer Smith ( 1964 )
How it happened :
On the planet Arachosia , feminity is carcinogenic , so one female scientist devises a way to make the entire population male .
How they reproduce :
In making the females male , the scientist also ensures that humans on Arachosia continue by developing a system whereby males can carry male children , remaking humans as the klopt .
How it works :
Without women , the klopt descend into a dysfunctional , nightmarish society filled with violence .
Having not seen other humans in generations , they remember women as abominations , and consequently believed that all humans of the two - gendered variety should be destroyed .

The Guardians of the Universe ( Green Lantern )
How it happened :
The male Malthusians sought to combat evil and promote order in the universe , establishing orders such as the Green Lantern Corps .
The female Malthusians , however , had no interest in meddling in the affairs of other species ( or disapproved of the Guardians ’ decision to suppress their emotions , depending on where you are in the continuity ) and left the males to guard the universe alone .
How they reproduce : The Malthusians , known later as the Oans , are immortal and have no need to reproduce .
How it works :
All goes well until a battle with Hal Jordan , under the influence of Parallax , destroys Oa and nearly all the Guardians .
When Kyle Rayner , as the nearly omnipotent Ion , decides to resurrect the Guardians , he makes them male and female , deciding they could benefit from both perspectives .

Ethan of Athos by Lois McMaster Bujold ( 1986 )
How it happened : Believing that women have a demonic quality that inspires madness in men , a group of men settled on Athos to lead a monastic ( though not asexual ) existence free from women .
How they reproduce :
Athos receives eggs from female donors on other planets .
The eggs are then fertilized with Y chromosome - carrying sperm from the intended father , and implanted inside and birthed from a uterine replicator .
How it works :
Athos represents one of fiction ’s rare all - male utopias .
Strongly family - oriented , men in the agrarian society form both romantic and platonic parenting relationships and tight - knit family units .
But this society is preserved through strict controls on information .
Men are taught from an early age that women of evil , monstrous beings , and all incoming news is heavily censored .
( LifeWire ) --
Think twice before accepting an invitation to a party .
That 's the lesson Tonya Bowman , 39 , learned recently after a birthday bash for a newfound acquaintance at a pricey sushi restaurant .
Do n't be bullied into paying for someone else 's meal or drinks if they invited you , psychotherapist says .
While Bowman ordered economically -- rice , miso soup and tea -- everyone else acted as if money were no object .
" When the bill came , " Bowman says , the birthday girl " smiled and made a big production by way of a toast , saying , ' Thank you all so much for my lovely birthday dinner .
I really do appreciate it .
You guys are great .
Here 's to you !'
Then she just sat there , waiting for us to decide how to split the bill . "
The bill for the birthday girl and her seven " guests " came to a whopping $ 3,450 , which someone suggested splitting evenly .
That worked out to $ 500 per person , plus tip .
" I almost started crying , " says Bowman , a municipal employee in Oakland , California .
" My heart was racing ; my face felt hot .
I was embarrassed , humiliated and angry for having been put in that position in the first place .
I was n't told that I would be helping to pay for her dinner . "
When the bill was being passed around , Bowman panicked .
" I simply put down $ 50 near my plate and excused myself to go to the restroom , " she says .
" I walked right by the restroom and out the front door . "
The acquaintance sent Bowman an angry e-mail .
" She wanted me to know that I totally ruined her birthday dinner because she ended up having to cover the $ 450 that I was supposed to pay .
She said she had planned to use that money on a spa day for her birthday and now she could n't because of me .
She asked if I could please pay her back , and if I did n't have the money right now , that was OK , because she would be willing to make payment arrangements with me .
" I did n't pay ... and she 's no longer my friend or acquaintance . "
Linnda Durré , Ph.D. , an Orlando psychotherapist , says Bowman 's story is n't unique .
" It 's appalling what people do and how rude and insensitive they can be , " she says .
" I 've heard stories about adults giving their parents an anniversary party and the parents getting stuck with the bill . "
Surprise !
Now pay up
Rachel Mays , 31 , is still shaking her head about a surprise party she attended for a friend 's birthday last year .
" We all got there at the determined 8:30 p.m. start time , and there was a fabulous open bar .
Then , we were asked whether we preferred chicken or beef for dinner , " says Mays , the owner of Bread and Butter Public Relations in Los Angeles .
Mays and her boyfriend were surprised dinner was being served at such a late party .
Not wanting to be the odd couple standing in the back , they ordered anyway .
A few days later , however , the host told Mays she owed $ 120 for dinner and gave her an address to which she could mail a check .
" I ignored his first e-mail , " admits Mays , " but when I received the second , I let him know I was n't working at the time and frankly , thought it was tacky to not mention these details when he sent out the invitations . "
Mays did n't pay , but says she now avoids gatherings where she knows that person will be present .
Elayne Savage , Ph.D. , a communication and relationship coach in Berkeley , California , says such situations leave people feeling disrespected and manipulated .
She says an unpleasant surprise " throws us off our center .
We expect our friends to treat us with the same consideration and understanding we would show them .
It is very disappointing when this does not happen . "
BYOF : Bring your own food
Melinda Williams , 48 , owner of a public relations and advertising agency in Chester County , Pennsylvania , was thrilled to be invited to a neighbor 's pool party cookout soon after moving to the neighborhood .
Then she read the invitation 's fine print .
" I remember it saying something to the effect of ' We supply the paper goods and pool , you supply the rest , ' " she says .
So Williams and her husband came prepared : " We brought a cooler with a full London broil and side dishes -- enough for everyone at the party . "
When they arrived and saw a row of coolers by the pool , Williams says she and her husband opened one up and helped themselves to beverages , assuming that they were to be shared .
" We were quickly chastised by another family ( and told ) that that cooler and beverages belonged to them , " she says .
" We could n't believe it !
" We waited for about two hours and they never started cooking anyone 's meat , and we had a small baby at the time , so we just left our food and cooler there and went home . "
How to party without hurt feelings
" Situations like this can cause deep rifts in families and friendships that may be irreparable , " says Durré .
" I suggest being up front from the start .
That way people are n't surprised , hurt , angry or resentful , and relationships can be salvaged . "
She offers these tips to avoid sticky situations :
• Talk to your host :
If costs concern you , talk with the party planner before you RSVP .
Durré suggests saying something like , " How generous of you to host so many people at the restaurant , " so that when you accept , you 're acknowledging that you are guests -- not paying guests .
• Be direct :
If it 's a family member or a friend you know well , do n't beat around the bush , says Durré .
" You may just want to be more direct and say , ' Are you covering the expenses by yourself or would you like us to share the expense with you ? '
That way , there are no surprises . "
• Be honest :
If unexpectedly faced with a bill , you 're under no obligation to pay it .
Durré offers this script for people who want to take a stand : " When I 'm invited to a party , I assume that the host is paying for it .
To learn that I 'm responsible for all or part of this is rather unexpected and rather off - putting .
I wish you had told me beforehand .
I 'm really under no obligation to pay for this and I resent that you did n't tell me in advance . "

All About Etiquette and Manners • Personal Finance
El nivel de incremento dependerá de lo que decida la Fed la próxima semana .
Un alza en EU garantizaría otro acá , más el añadido de las presiones inflacionarias .
La política monetaria de México no llegará al final de su ciclo alcista mientras la inflación no dé claras señales de contención y de corrección hacia la meta establecida .
Y eso todavía no sucede .
La inflación que mide el Inegi va desde un índice general hasta una selección de productos y servicios de consumo personal que marquen la inflación de una familia , por ejemplo .
Pero lo que vale para justificar decisiones monetarias es la fotografía del bosque completo .
El Índice Nacional de Precios al Consumidor , el más amplio de los referentes , alcanzó en mayo 6.16 por ciento .
El nivel más alto desde la Gran Depresión de finales de la década pasada .
Pero al mismo tiempo la inflación no subyacente , la que incluye los movimientos en los precios más volátiles como los productos agropecuarios o energéticos , está ya en 10.60 por ciento .
Sin embargo , la inflación que elimina esos precios más volátiles , la inflación - corazón o subyacente está en 4.78 % , cifra que no se aleja tanto de la meta del Banco de México de 3 % más-menos 1 punto porcentual .
Si vemos la inflación de la canasta básica , nos encontramos con el escándalo de 8.48 por ciento .
Peor será su inflación si es joven y pertenece a una clase media alta , urbana .
En la decisión de política monetaria de la junta de gobierno del Banco de México evidentemente que toma en cuenta todos estos indicadores y muchos más porque deben ponderar , por ejemplo , la presión salarial que genera un aumento en los básicos .
Tanto o más que un aumento en las tasas de interés cuenta la contundencia del mensaje que lance el banco central .
Porque el aumento en el costo del dinero no siempre limita en el terreno de la realidad los costos del financiamiento privado .
Es tan alto el nivel de tasas de interés al consumo y tan alta la resistencia de los consumidores a aceptar estos precios tan altos por el dinero prestado que aun con los aumentos de la tasa de referencia del Banxico , han bajado algunas tasas de créditos personales .
Cuenta mucho ahí la cara de enojados y estrictos que puedan generar los banqueros centrales , en especial Agustín Carstens , para advertir lo conveniente que resulta por ahora guardar el ingreso en lugar de gastarlo .
Hay razones estadísticas para adelantar que si no hay más sorpresas inflacionarias como el aumento a las gasolinas o la depreciación del peso , pueda iniciar un descenso de las mediciones por la simple comparación contra un piso más alto .
La apreciación del peso de las últimas semanas y las expectativas de que pueda mantenerse en los niveles actuales por algún tiempo , también contribuyen a moderar las presiones .
Pero está claro que el machete de las tasas de interés del banco central se mantiene afilado y sin temor a ser utilizado por parte de la junta de gobierno de ese instituto .
Por lo pronto , en la siguiente reunión de decisión de política monetaria dentro de dos semanas debería arrojar un nuevo aumento a la tasa de interés .
El nivel de aumento dependerá de lo que decida la Reserva Federal ( Fed ) en su reunión del Comité de Mercado Abierto de la próxima semana .
Un incremento en Estados Unidos ( EU ) garantizaría otro acá , más el añadido de las presiones inflacionarias .
NEW YORK / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve stepped forward as a commercial lender of last resort and signaled a readiness to cut interest rates as stocks spun lower for a fifth straight day and pressure mounted for a coordinated , international response to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Financial shares tumbled , led by Bank of America Corp , a day after the largest U.S. bank said it would sell $ 10 billion in new stock and stoked fears that other banks may also need to raise capital .
The British government was readying a rescue package for the UK banking system likely to include public money injected into the banks .
That plan will be announced on Wednesday , just five days after the U.S. government approved a $ 700 billion bailout fund that has failed to calm markets .
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. economy was being battered by a financial crisis of “ historic dimension ” and that the risk for inflation has eased with the falling prices for oil and other commodities .
“ In light of these developments , the Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate , ” said Bernanke , who is regarded as an expert on the Great Depression .
In an unprecedented move , the Fed also created a new commercial paper facility that would buy short - term , highly rated debt , stepping into the corporate debt market in a program that falls outside the $ 700 billion rescue plan approved by the U.S. Congress on Friday .
Stocks remained under pressure while U.S. government bond prices recovered and gold prices moved higher in a continued flight to safety .
The S&P 500 index shed another 6 percent .
That broad measure of the market has now dropped 15 percent over five days , its weakest run since 1987 .
Earlier , Russia negotiated an emergency bailout for Iceland and unveiled an aid package for its own banks , Australia slashed interest rates by 1 percentage point to 6 percent , and Britain considered a massive injection of public funds .
Iceland , the North Atlantic island facing down a threat of “ national bankruptcy , ” took over its second - largest bank and propped up a battered currency .
At ground zero in the crisis , the interbank lending market remained stalled , with the cost of borrowing dollars , euros and sterling all higher as financial institutions sought to preserve capital and remained unwilling to lend to each other .
CALLS FOR GREATER COORDINATION
Analysts credited the Fed with trying to create a fire break in the still - developing crisis , but said it was not enough to stop a wealth - destroying cycle in the markets .
U.S. consumer borrowing dropped for the first time in a decade in August as banks began to tighten credit standards and consumers pulled back from spending .
“ I think the Fed has done a reasonably good job considering the unusual situation we are in , ” said Joseph Trevisani , chief market analyst with FX Solutions .
Fed fund futures have priced in a 50 - basis point rate cut by the Fed this month , with a 75 basis point cut an outside possibility .
Expectations have built that the weekend meeting of Group of Seven officials in Washington could set the stage for coordinated rate cuts including the European Central Bank .
U.S. President George W. Bush , whose credibility with voters on economic policy has plunged , said he had spoken with European leaders to make sure there was coordination in dealing with the market turmoil .

“ I have been in close contact with European leaders .
I was on the phone with them this morning to ensure that our actions are closely coordinated , ” Bush said .
The White House had earlier said Bush spoke with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
In Tokyo , Japanese government officials and media said France had proposed an emergency summit meeting of the leaders of the richest economies and Russia .
The crisis that began with defaults in the $ 11 trillion U.S. mortgage market is also washing up on Asian shores , pushing South Korea to call for emergency talks with Tokyo and Beijing , and forcing a policy easing from India .

The International Monetary Fund increased its estimate of global losses from the financial meltdown to $ 1.4 trillion and warned that the economic downturn was deepening .
“ The financial planet is in total crisis , ” European Central Bank Governing Council member Guy Quaden said .
COUNTING THE TOLL
Entering a U.S. corporate earnings reporting season , companies were expected to reinforce the view that the world ’s largest economy shuddered into recession at the start of the current quarter .
The largest U.S. aluminum producer , Alcoa Inc , posted a drop in quarterly earnings of more than 50 percent on crumbling demand for metal to make planes and cars , and said it would halt major investments .
The result was worse than expected and underscored the growing risk of a deepening downturn .
Alcoa shares dropped 4 percent in after - hours trade .
“ The sad thing here is that I do n’t think Alcoa is going to be alone this earnings season , ” said Brian Hicks , co-manager of the Global Resources Fund at U.S. Global Investors .
“ I think there will be quite a few earnings misses due to the fact that it looks like conditions have weakened much more than people expected . ”
Shares of Bank of America Corp dropped 26 percent after a surprise earnings announcement a day earlier in which the bank halved its dividend and said it would sell at least $ 10 billion in new stock to raise capital .
A syndicate source said Bank of America had raised its $ 10 billion by selling 455 million shares at $ 22 each -- a sale price 7 percent below Tuesday ’s close .
Meanwhile , Wells Fargo &
Co stands to claim up to 80 percent of Wachovia Corp ’s deposits , while Citigroup Inc would get the remainder , a person briefed on the matter told Reuters .
The parties have been in intensive talks to hammer out a compromise in a contested deal for Wachovia also triggered by the credit market distress .
Wachovia and Citigroup declined to comment .
Wells Fargo was not available for comment .

A little more than a week ago , A Hamburger Today introduced the world to the Hamburger Fatty Melt , a burger with grilled cheese sandwiches as its bun .
And what did the world do ?
It spit in our face .
Here on this site , and on other sites where it was blogged about , all we heard was , " Where 's the bacon ? "
Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth .
I went through several iterations of the sandwich , trying different breads and different patty sizes , to find the proper beef - to - bun ratio - - to create a burger you could actually fit in your mouth and one that a glutton of normal proportions might actually make .
But I guess with something like this , more is more , and so I heeded the call of the internets , and decided to make a second version of this burger with what you all said was the missing ingredient .
What you are looking at above , ladies and gents , is the new , improved Bacon Hamburger Fatty Melt .
Here 's the smack on this meat stack .
From top to bottom :
Bacon - stuffed grilled cheese sandwich as bun top
Bacon
Cheese
Four - ounce beef patty
Bacon - stuffed grilled cheese sandwich as bun bottom
Happy now ?
No ?
Then get a load of what follows , after the jump .
The Double ( !) Bacon Hamburger Fatty Melt
The stack - up on this one :

Four - ounce beef patty
Bacon - stuffed grilled cheese sandwich as interstitial bun ( a nod to the Big Mac )

Bacon - stuffed grilled cheese sandwich as bun bottom
And here 's the autopsy shot :
Wanna make one ?
Follow the recipe for The Hamburger Fatty Melt but stuff sandwiches with bacon and add bacon as a topping to your clogged little heart 's content .
We also did a Single Bacon Fatty Melt with grilled onions ( another frequently requested topping ) , for a heavier patty - melt vibe :

One of the great things about the iPhone is the regular software updates .
Free and automatic improvements are piped , hot and steaming , to your pocket computer .
We do n't know exactly when the next version of the iPhone operating system ( v2.2 ) will arrive , but the leaks are springing fast , and the new OS looks like a useful update – full of new toys .
Here 's what the rumors say so far .
Google Street View
Screenshots have emerged since the first October rumors that more or less confirm that Google 's Street View will be added to the Maps application .
The iPhone does n't have the built - in compass of the
T- Mobile G1 , so we wo n't be getting the nifty live detection that lets the Android phone overlay a picture of what 's in front of you over what 's actually in front of you , but then what 's the point of that anyway ?
More useful is the addition of public transport information , seen in the picture at the top of the post .
We should also be getting walking directions in addition to the driving directions now available .
Direct Podcast Downloads
The screenshot above shows us an option to grab more episodes of a subscribed podcast ( which we covered in depth yesterday ) .
This is great news .
Apart from charging , the only reason I connect my iPod Touch to my Mac so often is to update podcasts .
Couple this with a way to delete the podcasts you 've already heard , like you can do with video files , and the iPhone is one step closer to being an independent computing platform .
We also see a new Video icon at bottom right .
Does this mean that video podcasts can be watched without using the video player , or that a separate video player has been abolished altogether and simply merged with the iPod ?
Rating Applications on Deletion
A report from the iPhone Hellas forum tells us that , upon deleting an application for the iPhone 's home screen , we 'll be presented with the rating dialog above .
This , combined with the App Store 's new policy of limiting comments to those people who have actually bought the application , should improve the accuracy of those ratings .
It could also be a big pain in the butt if you are constantly testing new apps , like we do .
Line - In Support
The Apple Blog reports that the 2.2 software will support " manipulation of line - ln audio accessories . "
The iPhone and the 2G iPod Touch already support input through the headphone jack .
We 're not sure if this new feature applies to signals coming through this jack , or to audio coming in through the dock connector – currently third - party applications do n't get access to that part of the hardware .
If the latter is true , it could lead to clip - on mics and speakers like the Griffin iTalk , and it could also explain why Griffin has released a recording application to the App Store .
Emoji Emoticons
Do we really need this ?
Location Sharing
The post at the iPhone Hellas forum also gives us this screenshot .
You will be able to share your location details via e-mail , and when another iPhone owner clicks on a link in that mail , they 'll see a map of your location in the Maps application .
Sounds kind of basic , but it could be a killer feature when your friends want to know just which dark , seedy bar you 're drinking in , and you can't muster the strength to stand up and take a look outside .
Safari Tweaks
Way back in September , we pointed to this shot of a redesigned Safari interface , a slightly cleaner layout where Google gets its own spot in the search bar , the loss of the search icon and the relocation of the reload arrow to inside the URL bar .
Expect more interface tweaks across the whole OS .
Copy and Paste
Kidding !
You did n't fall for that one , did you ?

This is my recipe for a traditional Ecuadorian chicken rice soup , called aguado de gallina o pollo .
It ’s a thick soup made with chicken , rice , potatoes , onions , peppers , other vegetables , herbs and spices .
En Español
The literal translation of aguado is watery or watered down , which is ironic because this is actually a very thick chicken soup , almost a stew , but still a soup .
The first time Nicolas tried this soup he commented that he liked it and asked what was in it ( besides de chicken obviously ) .
When I mentioned that it had rice he was surprised , aguado de gallina soup , like many other Ecuadorian poultry dishes is slow cooked until the chicken is extremely tender .
The rice practically dissolves into the soup thickening it .
The rice also gives the aguado a very creamy and almost sticky consistency .
The very traditional way to cook this soup is very simple and only uses chicken , rice , potatoes , onions , and spices , my version is a little bit more modern as bell peppers , tomatoes , carrots , peas and herbs are added to the soup .
The traditional version also uses water instead of chicken broth .
It ’s hard to explain the main reason I do n’t stick to the traditional aguado chicken rice soup recipe , in Ecuador we have “ pollos ” and “ gallinas ” .
Pollos are chickens that are younger and are usually , but not always , raised in a more commercial environment .
Gallinas are more like hens which are raised for their eggs , more often on farms or just in your backyard .
It is said that the meat from a pollo is more tender , which makes sense because it is younger , however it lacks true flavor .
On the other hand , the meat from a gallina is much tougher but is full of flavor , so in order to get a really true flavorful chicken dish you have to use a gallina , the older the better they say , and to tenderize it you must cook it slowly .
If you taste a traditional aguado de gallina in Ecuador made with a nice old hen it will be one of the most tasty dishes with a very strong chicken flavor .
Well , I have tried chicken meat from Whole Foods , farmer ’s markets , etc and none of them can match the Ecuadorian gallinas , which leads to the conclusion that most of them are pollos .
So to get as much chicken flavor as possible , I make the soup with chicken broth and add additional ingredients to improve the flavor .
So , technically I should really call this chicken rice soup an aguado de pollo , instead of a true aguado de gallina – but regardless it ’s still one of the most delicious and comforting chicken soups .
Ecuadorian chicken rice soup { Aguado de gallina} Ecuadorian chicken rice soup or aguado de gallina is a thick soup made with chicken , rice , potatoes , onions , peppers , other vegetables , herbs and spices .
4.8 from 62 votes Print Pin Prep Time : 30 minutes Cook Time : 1 hour 30 minutes Total Time : 2 hours Servings : 8 Ingredients 3 lbs chicken assorted pieces
¾ cup rice uncooked
2 tbs sunflower oil or butter
1 cup chopped red onion about ½ onion
1 cup chopped bell pepper about 1 pepper
2 roma tomatoes peeled , seeded and chopped
6 garlic cloves crushed
2 tbs chopped parsley
1 tsp dried oregano or 1 tbs fresh chopped oregano
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground achiote
8 cups chicken broth or water
2 potatoes peeled and diced , about 3 ½ cups
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup peas fresh or frozen
2 tbs finely chopped cilantro
Salt and pepper to taste Serve with : Chopped chives or green onions
Avocado slices
Aji criollo hot sauce Instructions Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes
Heat the oil or butter in a large sauce pan to make a refrito with the onions , garlic , pepper , tomatoes , parsley , oregano , cumin , achiote and salt , cook for 10 minutes stirring frequently .
Add the chicken broth or water and bring to a boil .
Add the chicken pieces and cook for about 30 minutes on low medium heat .
Add the soaked rice and the chopped potatoes , cook for 45 minutes on low heat , stirring occasionally .
Add the carrots and cook for 5 minutes
Add the peas and cook for 5 - 7 minutes or until the both the peas and carrots are tender .
Add the chopped cilantro and serve with avocado slices and hot sauce or aji .
These days even in Ecuador you are probably more likely to find this soup made with pollo than with gallina , especially in the larger cities .
However , if you find yourself in small town where people raise their own chickens you just might get to enjoy an authentic aguado de gallina .
During my last visit to Ecuador , I had the best aguado de gallina that was cooked in small hut ( no electricity ) in a clay pot over a wood burning stove , and prepared with the freshest chicken - and by freshest I mean that it was walking around outside when we arrived .
As with most other Ecuadorian soups , I served this aguado chicken rice soup with avocado slices , you can also sprinkle it with some chopped chives or chopped green onions and serve some ají hot sauce on the side .

Did you happen to notice the ads after the second Presidential debate ?
CBS had Exxon .
ABC had Chevron .
CNN had the coal lobby .
The great people at the " We Can Solve It " campaign are one of the biggest supporters that clean energy has .
They promote legislation that will help America overcome its energy crisis .
The question is why would ABC refuse to air one of their ads ?
They refused to air the latest ad fromWE Campaign promoting the use of renewable energy in America .
They did n't run thead during the debate ; even though the funds were available .
To put it simply , ABC is protecting its big-oil advertising revenue .
To make matters worse , the network has not given , WE CEO , an answer for the refusal .
In response , the organization is asking that people sign a petition on their website , send a letter , and ask that ABC reconsider their position so that the ad can air .
Do you think this absurd ?

250,000 in Houston still lack running water Hundreds of thousands may stay without water for a while
A quarter of a million people in the Houston region were without running water Tuesday , according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , which regulates more than 2,500 public water systems in the 10 - county region hammered by Hurricane Ike .
Commission officials did not know about another 600,000 people because they have been unable to communicate with those utilities in the wake of the storm .
The result is hundreds of thousands of people who cannot bathe , use the bathroom , or even cook nearly two weeks after they lost access to running water .
Restoring it may prove complicated .
The problem has myriad causes , including power outages and severe infrastructure damage in coastal areas .
Some public water systems , which Texas regulators require to continue pumping in spite of power outages , have failed to do so , according to residents they serve and state officials .
" I can do without the lights or the air conditioning , but I can't do without water , " said Rose Melchor , 69 , who lives near Hobby Airport .
Melchor filled bathtubs and old kitty litter containers with water before the storm but ran out in two days .
She has depended on neighbors for water needs , and her relatives have had to bathe and cook with bottled water .
They only pour water into the toilet to flush it after using the restroom several times , she said .
" We expect this kind of thing for a couple days , but not this long , " she said .
Melchor lacks water because trees uprooted by the storm damaged city water lines .
A spokesman said the city is working on the problem , which is affecting several dozen people .
Otherwise , Houston officials said , the city and the 400,000 customers it serves are back online , although some apartment high - rises are unable to pump water above the fourth floor because of a lack of power .
' This event was huge '
Many served by public utility systems and private water companies in Houston and Harris County , however , remain without running water .
The same is true in many of the communities battered by Ike — including in Fort Bend , Chambers , Brazoria and Liberty counties — where , with a few exceptions , water and sewer delivery managed by major municipalities is working .
Elected officials there have used generators , while some of the minor water systems in those areas have been unable to do the same .
In the event of a power outage , private utilities are required to keep water flowing through the use of generators or by having enough elevated storage so that gravity will move it into homes .
But many have been unable to do so , state officials said .
" This event was huge , and in this kind of situation , it takes time , " said Elston Johnson , manager of the TCEQ 's public drinking water section .
His employees are contacting the systems , providing technical advice and visiting some in the Greater Houston area , he said .
But in the case of utilities that have not been using generators to pump water , they are not ordering them to do so .
" Our posture is more of helping in those situations , " he said .
Ginger Spahni , who lives in the Hampton Oaks subdivision in northeastern Harris County and has not had power or water since Ike hit , said she was angry the companies were not pumping via generators .
Told to pray for power
She has been using buckets of water from her employer to cook , flush toilets and bathe herself and two small children .
She said she has seen elderly residents in her neighborhood relieve themselves outdoors .
When she sought information about the delay from the Suburban Utility Co. , which supplies water to her neighborhood , a customer service representative told her the company had run out of gasoline for a generator .
Later , another representative told her to pray for the power to come back on so the pumping station would work .
" God 's giving us a nice , cool breeze , " she said .
" But I do n't think God can make them turn the generator on at their pumping stations . "
Company officials did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday .
In many coastal communities , the culprit was hurricane devastation .
Brazoria County wells
In the beachfront town of Surfside Beach , there is no power , no water and no sewer service .
Utilities were so damaged " nobody 's trying to fix it yet , " Police Chief Randy Smith said .
In Quintana , another Brazoria County beach town , the water system is being operated by generator .
Oak Island , the fishing community in Chambers County devastated by Ike , has no water or sewer service .
Lake Anahuac , one of the county 's main drinking sources , was contaminated with saltwater and breached levees .
The city of Anahuac has a 90 - day supply of water but will have to seek another supply once that is exhausted , Mayor Guy Jackson said .
Residents who rely on wells also have struggled .
Since most rely on electric pumps , no power means no water .
" I do n't want to be maudlin or anything , but I have to use pond water to flush my toilet , " said Loretta Thomas , 57 , who lives on Hopper Road , near U.S. 59 , in northeastern Harris County .
" I 'm not saying I have to have everything with a bow on it , but when you 're without water , it 's kind of scary . "
Chronicle reporters Richard Stewart , Eric Hanson , Cindy Horswell , Renée C. Lee and Mark Babineck contributed to this report .

BBC investigated after peer says climate change programme was biased ' one - sided polemic '
' Potty peer ' : Lord Monckton said his sceptical views were misrepresented
The BBC is being investigated by television watchdogs after a leading climate change sceptic claimed his views were deliberately misrepresented .
Lord Monckton , a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher , says he was made to look like a ‘ potty peer ’ on a TV programme that ‘ was a one - sided polemic for the new religion of global warming ’ .
Earth : The Climate Wars , which was broadcast on BBC 2 , was billed as a definitive guide to the history of global warming , including arguments for and against .
During the series , Dr Iain Stewart , a geologist , interviewed leading climate change sceptics , including Lord Monckton .
But the peer complained to Ofcom that the broadcast had been unfairly edited .
‘ I very much hope Ofcom will do something about this , ’ he said yesterday .
‘ The BBC very gravely misrepresented me and several others , as well as the science behind our argument .
It is a breach of its code of conduct .
‘ I was interviewed for 90 minutes and all my views were backed up by sound scientific data , but this was all omitted .
They made it sound as if these were just my personal views , as if I was some potty peer .
It was caddish of them . ’
Ofcom confirmed it was looking into a ‘ fairness complaint ’ about the documentary .
A BBC spokesman said : ‘ We stand by the programme . ’
Lord Monckton , 56 , a former journalist and Cambridge graduate , says scientific data shows the world is cooler today than in the Middle Ages .
He appeared alongside other sceptics including distinguished Florida - based meteorologist Professor Fred Singer , John Christy , a climate change expert and adviser to the U.S. government and the climatologist Dr Patrick Michaels , of the University of Virginia .
All their interviews , he claims , were heavily cut so that they appeared as personal views .
‘ We do not dispute that there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , but we do dispute its effects ’ , he said .
‘ The data shows that 2008 is the same temperature as 1980 and that the effects of these changes in the atmosphere are not negative but more likely to be beneficial . ’
Lord Monckton played a key role in a legal challenge heard in the High Court in October 2007 in an effort to prevent Al Gore ’s film on global warming , An Inconvenient Truth , from being shown in English schools .
Contains Spoilers
Engadget just posted the first real picture and accurate description I ’ve seen in public of the new 15 - inch MacBook Pro , set to be announced later today .
It ’s the real deal .
Major visible changes from the previous MacBook Pros :
A new iMac - style black border around the display .
A single - piece aluminum frame .
No more chintzy plastic trim along the edges and seams .
No more physical latch .
MacBook Air - style black keyboard .
And good news for those of you who ’ve been bitching about Apple ’s laptops having a single button : the single - button trackpad is gone .
Which is to say there is no button at all .
The new trackpad is similar to the Air’s , in that it is bigger and supports additional multi- touch gestures .
But unlike the Air’s , the MacBook Pro ’s new trackpad is made of glass , and is a button itself .
You just press and it clicks .
This is not like the current software option where you can enable “ Tap to Click ” in the trackpad preferences , but instead a glass trackpad that acts as a physical button , with a click you can feel .
Sounds odd , but I hear it ’s very cool in practice .
The new MacBook Pro is not available with a matte - finish display .
If you do n’t like glossy , you can suck it .
( I bought a matte - finish display for my MacBook Pro back in March , so do n’t shoot the messenger . )
Engadget is also correct that there is no new 17 - inch MacBook Pro .
I do n’t know if the 17 - inch revision is simply forthcoming , or whether it ’s being phased out .
My hunch is that it ’s being phased out .
The current 17 - inch model will remain for sale for the time being — albeit with a larger 320 GB hard drive and 4 GB of RAM instead of 2 — but there is no 17 - inch model with the features or appearance of the new 15 - inch Pro .
I have some educated guesses as to what else will be announced .
The new regular MacBooks look like 13 - inch versions of the new MacBook Pro .
Another single - piece all - aluminum chassis , the same black border around the display , and the same new no -button multi - touch trackpads .
The displays are backlit LEDs , like the 15 - inch Pros .
( Engadget , which is reporting that the regular MacBooks are n’t being revised , is wrong .
They ’re not just being announced but should be shipping by the end of the week . )
The updated Airs look the same as the current Airs , but now offer larger hard drives : a 120 GB disk in the low - end model , and a twice - as - large 128 GB solid - state drive in the high - end model .
CPU performance remains more or less unchanged across the board : 2.4 / 2.53 GHz for the MacBook Pro ; 2.0 / 2.4 GHz for the MacBook ; and 1.6 / 1.83 GHz for the MacBook Air .
What is new with regard to performance are the video cards : all these new MacBooks — regular , Pro , and Air — ship with the new Nvidia 9400M GPU .
It ’s apparently a screamer performance - wise , especially compared to the Intel integrated graphic chipsets that shipped with previous MacBooks and MacBook Airs , and it is capable of driving the 30 - inch Cinema Display as an external monitor .
1
In addition to the 9400 M , the MacBook Pro sports a second GPU , the Nvidia 9600M GT .
I have never heard of a notebook with two graphics processors , but that ’s the deal for the new MacBook Pros , and presumably there are huge performance advantages to this configuration .
Update : Via Twitter , Stuart Maxwell writes , “ The Lenovo Thinkpad T500 has two graphics cards .
One is used on battery to conserve power . ”
Apparently some Sony Vaios use dual graphic cards like this , too — a low - power one for battery , a high - power one when plugged - in .
( Recall , too , that taking advantage of GPUs for system - wide performance gains is one of the main focal points for Snow Leopard .
Snow Leopard ’s OpenCL allows applications to offload general computing tasks to the GPU .
Or , I guess , the GPUs , plural . )
Keep your eyes peeled for jackassery in post - event news coverage , much of which , I predict , will focus on the fact that none of these new machines sell for under $ 1299 .
The reality is that these new machines are all steps up , but the rumors that caught the most attention in the past week were the ones regarding $ 799 and $ 899 laptops .
None of these “ $ 800 new MacBook ! ” rumors came from anyone with any credibility , but that wo n’t stop some people from holding it against Apple that they did n’t pan out .
MacBook Pro prices will remain the same , at $ 1999 and $ 2499 .
Same for MacBook Airs : $ 1799 and $ 2499 .
Regular MacBook pricing is interesting , though .
In the old ( plastic ) MacBook lineup , there were three standard configurations :
$ 1099 : 2.1 GHz , white , 1 GB memory , 120 GB disk
$ 1299 : 2.4 GHz , white , 2 GB memory , 160 GB disk
$ 1499 : 2.4 GHz , black , 2 GB memory , 250 GB disk
In the new ( aluminum ) MacBook lineup , there are only two standard configurations :
$ 1299 : 2.0 GHz , 2 GB memory , 160 GB disk
$ 1499 : 2.4 GHz , 2 GB memory , 250 GB disk
Which is notable in that the new $ 1299 model sports a CPU that is 16 percent slower than the old one .
That is not to say the system itself is “ slower ” , Apple ’s argument will apparently be that the new Nvidia GPUs more than make up for the difference .
What we ’re seeing may be the beginning of the end of CPU hertz as the rule - of - thumb metric for system performance .
Also notable is that the 2.1 GHz white MacBook remains in the new lineup , at a new price of $ 999 — technically breaking the $ 1000 barrier , but nowhere near the $ 800 price point some financial analysts have been whacking off to .
Investigative journalist Gareth Porter , a smart guy and a friend of mine , gave an interview to " The Real News " on Sunday on the topic of foreign policy directions under a McCain or Obama presidency .
Gareth 's opinion is that , contra McKinney and Nader , there is a qualitative difference between McCain , a died - in - the - wool neoconservative , and Obama 's more pragmatic approach to American superpowerdom - but that even Obama would n't make a clear break with the past 50 years of American power projection , instead repurposing it away from the Bush Years with less violently militaristic expressions .
So that although both would to a continuation of one or other of the Bush terms , just as Bush followed the last 50 years , McCain would hyper - extend the first term 's Cheney - esque bellicosity while Obama would emphasise and amplify the pragmatic policies of the likes of Secretary of Defense Bob Gates .
One of the major points Gareth makes in his interview is that , from everything McCain has said about Iraq during his campaign , it is n't impossible to believe McCain would keep the occupation of Iraq going even over the wishes of the Iraqi people and government , perhaps even arranging a coup to unseat Prime Minister Maliki .
I think it would certainly be interesting to see how he would respond if asked about this outright by the establishment press .
Obama however , while he'd be likely to hurry withdrawal even beyond the Maliki - approved timetable if he thought it could be done , is just as inextricably committed to staying in Afghanistan and to using military force as the main effort there as McCain is - perhaps even more so when you consider what he has said about the Pakistan border area .
McCain , as a paid up neocon , would doubtless be saying " faster please " on war with Iran , which Obama seems to realize would be a disaster .
As to Russian relations , while Gareth does n't address those in his interview , it seems unlikely that neither Obama nor McCain would depart greatly from the underlying concept of American foreign policy for five decades - that the US is allowed a sphere of influence , the whole world , but no - one else is and certainly not Russia .
The question is , can the US maintain that position any longer ?
Condi Rice , visiting America's " with us " autocrat ally in Kazakhstan , has said that the US has no intention of allowing Russia a " near foreign " .
" This is not a zero - sum game , " she told reporters flying with her to the Kazakh capital .
U.S. gains need not mean Russian losses , she said .
" First of all , Kazakhstan is an independent country .
It can have friendships with whomever it wishes , " she said .
" That 's perfectly acceptable in the 21st century , so we do n't see and do n't accept any notion of a special sphere of influence " for Russia in this region .
Kazakhstan is a bit of an odd one - the dictatorship in all but name ( it has elections but no - one opposed to President Nazarbayev ever gets elected ) does indeed have a successful multi-lateral foreign policy on trade and military co-operation .
It has a military alliance with Russia and therefore is ineligible for NATO , but in February signed a deal with the US to procure equipment and training to bring it up to NATO standard and conducts regular joint exercises with the US .
But one has to question whether , without the US presence in Afghanistan and Kazakh permission for supply flights there , America would be interested .
Military aide has always seemed a sweetener for the supply flights .
So while it may be a good nation from which to make a speech about there being no special spheres of influence anymore , is that actually the truth ?
Certainly , America 's sphere of influence now matches its national security interests - global , and wherever the US decided those interests lie .
Even if that means reneging on previous promises to not base US troops in or allow into NATO nations that were once Soviet dominions and that Russia considers its " near foreign " .
Even if it means invading other nations without a UN mandate or threatening to attack others .
It 's unclear , though , that anyone else gets to do the same thing - especially not Russia .
Recent controversy and outrage over Russian deals with Venezuela and the resurrection of the South American fleet suggest that America still has a " near foreign " of its own .
Worries about Russia expanding its basing agreements and military patrol flights again - both things the US does far more of - did n't bring knowing nods of acceptance for Russia 's acknowledgment that anyone can have global national interests in the 21st Century , they brought rhetoric about a new Russian aggression and Imperial ambition .
At the end of the day , though , realpolitik says Condi is correct even if for the wrong reasons .
No-one has the power now to consistently safeguard and hoard a sphere of influence - and not even America has the power to prevent any other nation having a global reach nowadays , after Bush 's adventurism and a financial crisis have gutted America 's superpowers like a Kryptonite enema .
Other nations have no intention of allowing the US to keep a tight grip on its " near foreign " any longer either .
Welcome to the multi- polar post - Bush world .
Rice 's statement is better seen as a recognition of truth rather than a high - minded statement of policy .
Although I doubt Rice or McCain see it that way I 'm certain Obama does .

The OSP end - of - summer meeting
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/c05428264231bbf3#
For those of you interested in what happened at the OSP end - of - summer meeting , I posted my summary on our blog .
http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/38
FWIW , I remind you all that Janest ' blog is aggregated , together with many other OCaml - related blog , on the OCaml Planet , available at http://planet.ocamlcore.org .
Syntax highlighting and Ocaml / PHP integration
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/4102101b6120cca5#
I 'm looking for a GPL - compatible syntax highlighting library with support for most common programming languages and markups .
Obviously I would prefer a native Ocaml library , though something in C would also be acceptable due the relative ease of writing bindings .
One library that looks competent is GeSHi [ 1 ] .
Unfortunately it is written in PHP .
However , for lack of alternatives , I am looking into ways of integrating GeSHi with Ocaml .
I reckon that a shell invocation of PHP is straightforward , but I bet that it would entail a huge performance penalty due to the startup time .
Therefore , I am looking into somehow integrating the PHP interpreter within the main Ocaml programme .
Something like Apache 's mod_php .
Does anyone have any experience with this ?
( Note that I have * zero* experience with PHP ) .
If all else fails , my backup solution is simply to run a small webserver with GeSHi and transform the library call into a web service .
Though I would rather avoid this convoluted option .
Thanks in advance for your input !
Best regards , Dario Teixeira P.S. Another ( possibly far - fetched ) solution is to take advantage of the syntax highlighting capabilities of Vim or Emacs .
Something along the lines of embedding or remotely invoking one of these editors , with the sole purpose of asking them to highlight a text file .
Is this even possible ? [ 1 ]
http://qbnz.com/highlighter/
I have had decent results opening a pipe to GNU source - highlight .
I 'm mainly using it on JSON , so I can't vouch for its support of other languages but it seems pretty comprehensive .
let pipe program input = let ( in_channel , out_channel ) = Unix.open_process program in output_string out_channel input ; close_out out_channel ; let result = ref [ ] in begin try while true do result := input_line in_channel :: ! result done with End_of_file -> ( ) end ; ignore ( Unix.close_process ( in_channel , out_channel ) ) ; String.concat "
" ( List.rev !result ) let pre_body = Pcre.regexp ~flags : [ `DOTALL ] " .*< pre >( .*)</ pre>.* " let source_highlight lang code = let result = pipe ( " source - highlight -s " ^ lang ) code in Pcre.replace ~rex: pre_body ~ templ : " $ 1 " result Caveat :
The " pipe " function above will block on large inputs due to buffering deadlock .
It should probably be rewritten using Unix.select .
I 've used vim a little bit for my static webpages , here 's the result : http://martin.jambon.free.fr/hello.c.html
http://martin.jambon.free.fr/quine.sh.html
http://martin.jambon.free.fr/micmatch/Makefile.html
The script is : #!/bin/sh -e # Usage : any 2html < file1 > [ < file2 > ...]
# Requires : vim [ $ # - lt 1 ] && echo " Usage : $ 0 < fic1 > < fic2 > ... " && exit 1 while [ -n " $ 1 " ] do file=`basename " $ 1 " ` cp -f " $ 1 " / tmp vim -f +" syn on " +" so \\ \$ VIMRUNTIME/syntax/2html.vim " + " wq " + " q " / tmp /" $ file " cp -f / tmp / " $ file " .
html " $ 1 " .html shift done
You might try Highlight [ 1 ] and Caml2html [ 2 ] .
I know I 've tried Highlight but I simply can't remember how the result looked like , most probably because I needed to write to a tex file ( I still do n't know if there 's anything with color support ) .
Caml2 html generates nice pages but only supports the ocaml language , it 's written in ocaml however .
OK , tried hightlight again ...
Its output is less colorized than vim's but still alright and this can be changed .
It 's GPLv2 .
The drawback is that it 's written in C++ so probably not the best solution if you want to hack it . (* I 've been going through ( p ) 7zip to write bindings , why does C++ have to be that horrible ? *)
The code might be perfectly understandable though , I 've not looked at it . [ 1 ]

Part of Palin 's closing argument last night , and the McCain campaign 's incessant whining about her supposed unfair treatment , certainly signaled that .
Download Download
I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter , even , of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what they 've just heard .
I 'd rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did .
Team McCain was in full paranoia mode yesterday , going around and accusing CBS and Katie Couric of editing the Palin interview to make her look worse than she really was , a great feat if it were actually true .
I think this frontal assault signals that McCain will relegate her to the right - wing talk show circuit for the rest of the race , hoping that her adequate performance last night ( coupled with her fiery , condescending speech in Minneapolis - St. Paul ) will be what voters remember about her .
If there 's one thing we 've learned about Governor Palin , it 's that she can read a teleprompter and recall memorized taking points just fine .
But when she 's actually challenged to think on her feet ( like in the Couric and Gibson interviews ) , she falters about as badly as a politican could falter .
While it may be a wise strategy for McCain to stash her away for for the next 32 days , it 's transparently laughable to claim that somehow the traditional media " filter " is the problem here .
McCain on Letterman Video
appeared onlast night , apologizing for dissing the late night television host last month .
McCain humbled himself immediately , saying : " I screwed up , what can I say ? "
Trying to lighten the mood he went on to offer up : " Look at all the conversation I gave you . "
Letterman got much mileage out of McCain 's last minute cancellation .
He ranted when his staff discovered the candidate was down the street sitting for an interview with Katie Couric .
At one point Letterman asked the presidential hopeful , " In your gut , in your stomach , if I was to run upstairs and wake you in the middle of the night and say ' John , is Sarah Palin really the woman to lead us through the next four , eight years - through the next 9/11 attack ? ' "
McCain replied : " Absolutely .
She has inspired Americans .
That 's the thing we need . "
Check out the video clip below .
McCain hit the Al Smith Dinner comedy roast afterward .

CORNING , Calif . --
The family of a dead elderly woman cremated her remains on a makeshift barbecue and continued collecting her retirement checks amounting to more than $ 25,000 , authorities in Northern California said .
Ramona Allmond 's daughter and grandson were arrested Sunday on suspicion of embezzlement , elder abuse and disposing of a body without a permit .
Allmond , 84 , likely died of natural causes , though investigators were still trying to determine the exact cause of death , said Tehama County sheriff 's Capt .
Paul Hosler .
Allmond 's daughter , Kathleen Allmond , 50 , and Allmond 's grandson , Tony Ray , 30 , told investigators their relative died in December .
They left her body on her bedroom floor for a week before cremating the remains in their backyard fire pit , Hosler said .
Investigators said the two kept collecting Allmond 's monthly retirement checks , amounting to more than $ 25,000 .
Sheriff 's Detective Richard Knox said they may have been trying to honor Allmond 's desire to die at home and be cremated .
The two were arrested after Allmond 's son grew suspicious about her whereabouts .
Both were in jail in lieu of bail , with arraignment scheduled for Thursday .
The sheriff 's department said they do not yet have attorneys .

Apple has announced via its Apple Developer Connection website that it has dropped the NDA that has left iPhone developers frustrated since the release of iPhone OS 2.0 this past July .
In a note addressed " To Our Developers , " Apple finally admitted that the NDA had " created too much of a burden on developers , authors and others interested in helping further the iPhone ’s success . "
Apple had , like most companies , attached a nondisclosure agreement to developers that wanted early access to the SDK before iPhone OS 2.0 was released .
Nearly everyone involved in iPhone development expected the NDA to be lifted once 2.0 was officially released .
Apple unexpectedly kept the NDA in place , however , and offered no explanation to developers — nor did it offer a timetable on when it might be lifted .
This caused serious problems for those who had books ready to be published to help new developers , as well as programmers wanting to post to blogs or forums discussing iPhone programming tips and techniques .
The prohibition on blog and forum posts also made it difficult for developers to get help when they run into trouble .
There was a lot of speculation about Apple 's reasoning for keeping the NDA in place , including slow - moving bureaucracy and sheer ignorance , though protecting IP seemed most reasonable .
Apple said in Wednesday 's note that protecting IP was its reason for keeping the NDA in place .
" We put it in place as one more way to help protect the iPhone from being ripped off by others , " reads the note .
From what we 're seeing on Twitter , the collective iPhone developer community could n't be more delighted .
" Ok . I 'm back in on iPhone dev , " said Second Gear 's Justin Williams .
Jonathan Wight , developer of the TouchCode frameworks , said , " I now have a whole bunch of code to put online . "
Addison - Wesley Senior Acquisitions Editor Chuck Toporek , on his way to inform production to start printing The iPhone Developer 's Cookbook , stopped to say , " Thank you , thank you , thank you ! "
Even one of the NDA 's most fervent detractors , Twitterrific developer Craig Hockenberry , joked , " The downside , of course , is that I need to find something else to be bitter about .
Anyone want to get on my lawn ? "
" I think this will really open the floodgates for iPhone development .
An open exchange between developers is crucial on any platform , and with the shackles off , iPhone will flourish , " says Ben Gottlieb , developer of Crosswords for iPhone .
" Kudos for Apple to listening to the developer community and adjusting their position .
Any increase in transparency is a welcome change , and hopefully this is a sign of more good things to come , " he tells Ars .
Though Apple has said nothing about the recent issues regarding App Store rejections , this is certainly a major step toward regaining developers ' trust .
Of course , Apple will still keep unreleased versions of the iPhone OS and beta SDKs under NDA .
But as with Mac OS X , iPhone developers are free to publicly discuss any APIs or other features in released versions .
This will certainly go a long way towards maintaining a large and vibrant developer community .
The NDA 's demise also means that we can finally run our in - depth probe into the iPhone SDK .
Look for it this evening .

Last week saw the one year anniversary of SSC ’s Ulimate Aero becoming the fastest production car in the world at 256.18 mph , pushing past marks set by Koenigsegg ’s CCR and Bugatti’s Veyron .
It ’s the first time the top speed record has stood for a whole year since McLaren ’s F1 held it for seven years with 386.4 kmh ( 240.1 mph ) .
Now comes news that an Ultimate Aero EV ( Electric Vehicle ) is in development .
A 500 bhp EV is planned for late 2009 and a 1000 bhp 4WD EV is also under consideration .
Now here ’s the kicker – the press statement reads :
“ The drive train under development will feature a revolutionary power source allowing for extended time between charging intervals with the possibility of several years between charging . ”
The anniversary date was September 13 to be exact , but it ’s the prospect of the first 100 % Green Supercar that is interesting .
Engineering details are yet undisclosed but SSC expects to roll out its first prototype in February 2009 .
As for the revolutionary drive train , well , we have no idea what is planned and … we ’ll suspend disbelief in respect of the company ’s proven ability to do exactly what it has said it will do in the past .
A track record as good as SSC ’s gives this otherwise ridiculous claim some credibility , though it ’ll need to be pretty special to run a few years between charges – maybe it ’s a micro-nuclear powerplant ,
" I think we can do it faster , leaner and cleaner than any other manufacturer " says Jerod Shelby , SSC Founder .
Consistent with its company philosophy of being the benchmark , SSC plans next to break the record for the fastest electric car in the world .

We know nothing of the kind about Mr. Bryan , for he has not been tried .
We do not know that his mind is unsteady , his principles unsafe .

ST .
LOUIS - Attorneys for the voting registration organizations ACORN and Project Vote filed an anti-discrimination voting rights suit in the U.S. Federal District court this morning , alleging the United States government is involved in " a widespread , systematic effort to disenfranchise Imaginary - Americans and deprive them of access to polls . "
" Participation in our electoral process is a fundamental right , and the foundation of our democracy , " said ASDF ASDFG , a spokesperson for the National Association for the Advancement of Imaginary People , one of the groups named as plaintiffs in the class action .
" We will not be silent when government denies people access to the polls on the basis of color , or sex , or existential status . "
The new suit was prompted by on a series of law enforcement raids of ACORN offices in 10 states over the past week , as well as a reported Justice Department investigation .
Federal and state officials say they were acting on tips of fraudulent voter registration forms , after election officials reported a flood of unusual applications submitted by ACORN canvassers .
In Las Vegas the Clarke County election commission reported thousands of registrations signed by the Dallas Cowboys , while in St. Louis officials discovered thousands of others signed by Power Rangers , Menudo , and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles .
In Cleveland , Ohio Republican officials complained to the Federal Election Commission after early - voting sites barred observers when thousands of Invisible - Ohioans arrived at the polls aboard hundreds of invisible ACORN buses .
In Ida Grove , Iowa , Ida County Registrar Debby Ballard expressed concern when a convoy of Chicago ACORN semis submitted 4,000,000 provisional ballots , 17 seconds before a 5 pm deadline .
" I 'm proud that Ida County can boast of a 114,312 % voter registration rate , but I 'm not sure if I can get all of them processed by Monday , " said Ballard .
" I 've got a pilates class in Sioux City . "
After the raids , ACORN officials initially blamed the problems on rogue volunteers .
" We are in the midst of our most successful signup ever , registering over 7 trillion new voters in the last week alone , " said ACORN spokesman Charles Jackson .
" It 's impossible to have 100 % quality control , and a few misspellings might have fallen through the cracks . "
On Tuesday , ACORN said it would dismiss any workers suspected of fraud , and would outsource 40 % of voter registration jobs to Banglore Registration Industries .
" The quality control is better in India , and we can save over $ 35 per metric ton , " noted Jackson .
After consultation with attorneys , however , ACORN -- which has received $ 800,000 from the Obama campaign for registration efforts -- filed a suit claiming the increased legal scrutiny was driven by a political agenda .
Amicus briefs were added from several Imaginary Rights groups , adding civil rights violations to the list of complaints .
" Whether we are obituary notices , hallucinatory giant rabbits , or strings of random keyboard strokes , it 's time for the chimera community to stand up and claim our rights as citizens , " said ASDFG .
" We will no longer be silent and invisible .
Okay , maybe invisible . "
In addition to $ 3.2 jubajillion in damages and free federal mortgages for homeless spectres , the suit also seeks enforcement of the Americans with Dimensional Disabilities Act .
The Act requires voting places to make accommodations for existentially - challenged voters who have trouble completing ballots written in standard 3 - dimensional reality .
The accommodations include multiple site registration , time travel , and allowances for alcoholics to cast ballots for dependent D.T. phantasms .
" Many of our community inhabit the Tapioca subluster of the 11th Dimension , and it's hard for them to find a convenient spacehole to make it to the local elementary school , " explained ASDFG .
A ruling in the suit is expected later this week from St. Louis federal appelate judge Fwinklezorg the Hydragoat .
Open Source and the Digital Living Room

Are digital living rooms the next frontier for open source ?
I 've had my eye on some interesting developments in this area recently .
Ars Technica has a good analysis of the announcements from Neuros last week at OSCON about how open source set - top boxes are headed our way .
And Matt Asay has a good item up about Open Remote and Control4 - - both focused on open source home automation .
How far can embedded Linux and other open source offerings go in the digital living room and home automation spaces ?
Ars Technica cites this quote from Joe Born , CEO of Neuros : " The conventional view of convergence has largely been surrounding PCs , " said Born .
" But if you take a step back , you see a lot of things that PC is n't the answer for .
Embedded devices still remain cheaper . "
At OSCON , Born talked about how embedded Linux devices will bring open source to set - top boxes .
He also showed how applications can be built for Neuros OSD , a programmable digital video recorder .
In the case of Open Remote , it 's worth looking around the project 's site .
Open Remote is focused on numerous home automation sub- projects ranging from entertainment options to lighting controls .
Marc Fleury , the founder of JBoss , oversees the project .
As Matt Asay points out , Control4 may be significant competition for Open Remote .
This company has been on my radar for a while .
Its lighting , audio / video , touch - screen , and other controllers are primarily Linux - based , and they 're inexpensive online - ordered products .
I agree with Joe Born that embedded devices , peripherals and controllers of the type Control4 focuses on may be more promising solutions for home automation than computers are .
The idea that a computer would be at the center of the digital living room has many problems , including long boot times when the user just wants to execute a simple task , as well as the cost issues Born cites above .
Look for more purpose - driven , dedicated devices around homes based on Linux and other open source cores .

( Cleveland ) – Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich wants to ban hand guns in America .
Kucinich is currently drafting legislation that would ban the purchase , sale , transfer or possession of hand guns by civilians .
A gun buy - back provision will be included in the bill .
Kucinich announced this move in the aftermath of Monday�s deadly shooting at Virginia Tech .
Kucinich noted in a speech to congress that about 32 people die each day in America due to hand gun related incidents .
33 died at VT .
Kucinich says it ’s becoming “ painfully obvious ” that the easy availability of handguns constituents a growing national crisis of public health and safety , one that he says calls for a powerful , wide - ranging response from congress .
He says the level of violence in our society constitutes a national emergency .
Already this Congress , Kucinich has introduced HR 808 , legislation to establish a Department of Peace and Nonviolence .
It would address the issue of domestic violence , gang violence , and violence in the schools , which is reflected in the current homicide rates .
Kucinich notes recent studies that indicate many killers had histories of mental illness .
He says the lack of parity for mental health care remains one of the most serious deficiencies in healthcare in the United States .
Kucinich has also proposed HR 676 , Medicare for all .
It would establish a universal not - for - profit healthcare system , which would provide full and comprehensive mental healthcare .
And some comments :

Three times as many people are killed in many days in Iraq as died in Blacksburg yesterday .
Yet we are constantly told we are winning in Iraq .

Ban colleges from keeping students after their campus police deal with them for stalking other students on campus and they were involuntarily committed by their own parents – like Cho was two years ago – Kucinich .
Ban “ deinstitutionalization ” of diagnosed psychotics , Kucinich .
The overwhelming majority of Americans refuse to live in a giant open - air padded cell so that the very - few diagnosed psychotics can roam free .

Since you ’re supporting those limitations on that Constitutional right from the Bill of Rights , how about a similar limit on free speech ?
Sometimes words hurt people , even lead them to do harm to others reputations , careers , even goading them into crime or injury .
This menace to our society must be stopped .
Let ’s just keep it fair .
We ’ll keep the same restrictions on the right of free speech as you and many others would like upon the right to bear arms .
You have to register to excersize your right to free speech with each excersize you want to make thereof .
You must do this 30 days in advance before being allowed to make your statement , if authorized at the end of a background check and waiting period .
You will be taxed on this as well .
If there is anything that can be construed as psychological problems in your background you can be denied a permit to excersize your right of free speech , to keep other people safe from the harm your words might do .
( woulda stopped the Church of Scientology in it ’s tracks at least ) .
Maybe if someone had stood up to this guy and wrapped a chair around his neck when he was reloading , or if someone with a CCW permit were allowed to excerise their * Constitutional Right * to bear arms , this would n’t have happened , or would have at least saved some of those lives .
Instead , there are those in our society that would rather teach us to cower , line up , bow our heads , and take what is dished out to us without fighting back .
Til Americans remember how to fight back ( and that we do n’t have to be Euro - style Pacifists ) , madmen will know that they can pull off stunts like this .
Same goes for 9 - 11 .

Judge : GOP 's voter purge a ' violation of federal law ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday October 13 , 2008
Print This Email This The American Civil Liberties Union is trumpeting a judge 's decision in Michigan which brings to a halt the practice of eliminating voters from rolls if their mailing address is found to be invalid .
Recently , the GOP chairman in Macomb County , Michigan , detailed a plan to use a list of foreclosed homes to challenge voters .
His pronouncement drew an immediate backlash , with predictions that the plan would " backfire . "
It has .
The suit , filed by ACLU national and ACLU of Michigan , along with the Advancement Project , aimed to protect voters whose registration cards were returned to government offices by post as ' undeliverable . '
Judge Stephen J. Murphy of the U.S. District Court of Michigan 's Eastern District concluded that the program of eliminating these voters from rolls is in violation of federal law .
The voter purge program , better known to elections integrity experts as ' voter caging , ' is a long - storied GOP tactic employed against minority , student and low - income voters .
In September , the Obama campaign filed a lawsuit in Michigan challenging the illegal tactic .
" You essentially send a first - class letter to a hoursehold where you suspect that that person no longer lives there but where they 're still registered to vote , " explained Allen Raymond , a convicted GOP elections fraudster who spent time in prison after the discovery of a phone - jamming scheme during the 2002 elections .
" That letter comes back .
... Somebody [ at the local polling place ] then challenges that vote if that person comes in to vote . "
" This is a very significant ruling for Michigan voters , " said Matthew Lund , the ACLU cooperating attorney and a partner at Pepper Hamilton LLP who argued the case , in a release .
" The court recognized  and repeated several times  that the state of Michigan is conducting unlawful voter purges that clearly violate the National Voter Registration Act.
Michigan voters who were removed from the voting rolls for no reason other than failure to receive their ID card in the mail will now be allowed to vote in November . 
" More than 1,400 voters in that category have been disqualified so far in 2008 , " reports the Associated Press .
" The judge says it 's unclear how many cancellations actually are wrong but it's a violation of federal law .
Murphy says those people should n't be prevented from voting if they can produce more proof of residency at the polls . "
" This program has a very detrimental impact in minority , low - income and student communities across Michigan , " claims an ACLU advisory .
" These communities tend to be more transient and to live in multi- family housing . "
 This is a major victory for Michigan voters and the integrity of our democratic process ,  said Meredith Bell - Platts , staff counsel with the ACLU Voting Rights Project , in a release .
 Todays decision brings us one step closer to restoring confidence in a electoral system that has been poisoned by illegal disfranchisement policies .
As a result of the judges decision , fewer Michigan voters will be illegally purged and wrongly disfranchised  and that s good for everyone . 
WASHINGTON , Sept 23 ( Reuters ) - A plan that the U.S. Treasury conceived to restore confidence in credit markets is “ unacceptable ” in its current form , but Congress could pass a plan if changes are made , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said on Tuesday .
“ What they have sent us is not acceptable , ” said Sen. Christopher Dodd , who heads the senate ’s law - writing panel .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson offered a plan on Saturday to authorize the government to use taxpayer funds to buy up billions of dollars in bad mortgage - backed securities that were created by investment banks during the home price bubble .
( CNN ) --
In a secret operation a U.S. official called " brilliant , " the Colombian military infiltrated rebel group FARC and deceived its members into giving up 15 hostages including former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt , Colombia 's defense ministry said .
Appearing healthy after being held hostage for six years in the jungle , Betancourt walked down from a Colombian military jet in Bogota on Wednesday and hugged her mother and husband , a broad smile on her face .
" God carried out this miracle , " she said .
" This is a miracle because I know that all of you suffered with my family , my children , with me .
This is a moment of pride for all of Colombia for such a perfect operation . "
Along with Betancourt , three American contractors and 11 other hostages who were Colombian police were rescued in Wednesday 's operation .
The 46 - year - old Betancourt is a former senator who fought Colombia 's drug cartels as a congresswoman in the 1990s .
She ran for president in 2002 , calling for a nation " free of corruption , violence and free of drugs . "
As a hostage , she was reduced to a frail woman whose health was reportedly in serious jeopardy .
She said she awoke Wednesday at 4:30 a.m. and said the rosary , then was told by her guards that she and the other hostages were to be transferred to another location , where their detention was to continue .
" My heart broke because I did not want another transfer , another time , in captivity , " she said .
But her guard , a woman , was unmoved , and ordered Betancourt to cross a river to the pickup spot -- " very harsh , move , hurry up fast , as always , " she said .
Soon , two white helicopters approached and several men approached the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia commanders who were overseeing their transfer , she said .
" They spoke with Commander Enrique and Cesar , " she said of her captors .
As she looked closer , she saw that the men from the helicopter were wearing shirts emblazoned with the likeness of Che Guevara , the Argentine hero of the Cuban revolution .
" I thought , this is FARC , " she said .
Placed in handcuffs , Betancourt got into the helicopter , still unaware of what was happening .
" They closed the helicopter doors , the helicopter started flying and suddenly there was something happening , " she said .
" Suddenly I saw the commander who , during four years , had been at the head of our team , who so many times was so cruel and humiliated me , and I saw him on the floor naked with bound eyes . "
Then , the reality of her liberation hit home .
" The chief of operations said , ' We are the national army and you are all free , ' and the helicopter almost fell because we started jumping , we screamed , we cried , we hugged .
We could n't believe it . "
Watch Betancourt call the operation ' perfect ' »
Not a single shot was fired , she added .
Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said the Colombian military infiltrated the FARC leadership and arranged for the hostages to be taken to the south of the country , where they were to be picked up by helicopters that the rebels believed were controlled by another group .
They were initially transported to a military air base southwest of Bogota , from which they were to travel later Wednesday to the capital , a military spokesman said .
She added that she hopes that FARC commanders would not punish the guards who were fooled .
It was not their fault , she said ; the operation was too perfect for them to detect the deceit .
The FARC , which has fought a longstanding and complicated conflict with Colombia 's government and right - wing paramilitary groups , defends the taking of captives as a legitimate act of war and is believed to hold roughly 750 prisoners in the nation 's remote jungles .
The freed hostages also include Americans Keith Stansell , Marc Gonsalves and Thomas Howes .
A senior U.S. State Department official told CNN the families of the hostages had no idea the rescue operation was taking place .
The plight of Betancourt , who has French and Colombian citizenship , has attracted worldwide attention .
She was abducted February 23 , 2002 , after venturing into rebel territory while campaigning for the Colombian presidency .
Videos later showed a slim Betancourt , sitting silently in a jungle setting .
News of her deteriorating health came after the FARC released six hostages this year .
One of the freed hostages , Luis Eladio Perez , said that Betancourt had suffered from chronic liver problems since 2004 .
He said he last saw her February 4 this year .
" Ingrid made a sign for me to go to the bathroom , and she did the same , and we were able to talk for about five minutes , " Perez said .
" I saw she was very ill and wasting away .
She looked much worse than in that ' proof - of - life ' video the rebels filmed in October . "
Betancourt " seemed desperate , " even though " she told me to stay calm and that the guerillas were giving her vitamins and calcium , " he said .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed gratitude to Colombian authorities and said Betancourt " is in good health . "
Watch Sarkozy give thanks »
Betancourt 's jubilant daughter , Melanie Delloye , said , " I feel like I 've just awakened from a bad dream . "
Watch family daughter talk about getting mother back »
She and other members of the family spoke alongside Sarkozy .
U.S. President George W. Bush congratulated Colombian President Alvaro Uribe by phone .
Uribe is slated to address the nation at 10 p.m. ET ( 0200 GMT ) .
A senior State Department official said the United States played no role in the operation , though it was briefed on it ahead of time .
The official called the operation " brilliant " and " a huge success , " saying it involved a deception operation against the FARC .
According to Pentagon officials , Colombians told the United States about the operation in the past few days .
The U.S. approved the plans but had no part in them .
The United States is offering medical support to the three American contractors , including a medical evacuation back to America .
William Bronfield , a senior U.S. ambassador , confirmed the United States was briefed about the operation .
He is on his way to the Colombian airbase where the hostages were taken .
Contractors Stansell , Gonsalves and Howes have been held since February 13 , 2003 , when their single - engine plane crashed in the mountains south of Bogota .
The Americans were working for Northrop Grumman Corp. as part of a U.S. - funded counternarcotics effort .
Two other men on the plane , American pilot Tommy Janis and a Colombian , were shot to death by FARC .
A rescue plane searching for the men crashed six weeks later , killing its American pilot , Butch Oliver , and another American crew member .
Stansell , Gonsalves and Howes were last seen in a 2003 interview by a Colombian journalist who made his way into a FARC stronghold .
The journalist 's video was shown on CBS ' " 60 Minutes . "
" To our country , we miss you , and we hope we return one day .
We 're alive and well , " said Stansell , then 38 , a systems analyst .
" We expect to get out of here one day .
We can't say for sure , " said Howes , then 50 , a professional pilot .
" But our main concern is the welfare of our families . "
" I'm a proud American , " said Gonsalves , then 31 , also a systems analyst .
" I look to you guys , and I ask for a diplomatic solution to get us home safe , please . "
CNN 's Jim Bittermann in Paris contributed to this report .

John McCain and Barack Obama debate , town - hall - style , in Nashville , Tenn. , on Tuesday .
It was neither candidate 's best night .
The worst debate ever
With the country at one of its most interesting — not to mention terrifying — moments in a generation , John McCain and Barack Obama met in Nashville , Tenn. , for what was surely one of the dullest and least satisfying presidential debates in memory .
There have been boring debates before , of course .
Truth be told , probably only a fraction of these encounters , over the 32 years since general election debates became a fixture of presidential campaigns , actually delivered on their promise of great political drama .
And even interesting debates are inevitably somewhat stilted affairs , as candidates cleave to their scripts and try to avoid blunders .
Advertisement
But the Belmont University showdown was something entirely different .
Place the gravity of the moment next to the blah - blah - blah artifice of the rhetoric and overall insubstantiality of the evening , and this is what you get : the worst presidential debate ever .
The day after leaves behind a puzzle :
How the hell did candidates manage to be so timid and uninspiring at a time when American troops are in two problematic wars , the world financial markets are in scary freefall and the Dow has lost 1,400 points since Oct.
1 ? This is a moment history rarely sees — and both men blew it .
It was an odd reversal of the usual optics of power .
Ordinarily , the national stage can take even life - size pols such as Michael Dukakis and imbue them with an outsize aura .
Tuesday 's debate was a look through the wrong end of the telescope : Men with fascinating biographies seemed conventional .
The promise both men once offered of a new , less contrived and more creative brand of politics was a distant memory .
An evening this bad is not the result of just an off night by the candidates .
It can flow only from a confluence of circumstances .
Here is our appraisal of the factors behind the most disappointing presidential debate ever .
The presidential debate commission ’s rules are a scandal .
It would be hard to cook up a duller way of debating than the one we witnessed last night .
The commission allowed the cautious handlers of the presidential campaigns to negotiate a format designed to limit improvisation , intellectual engagement and truth - telling .
The rules were so constraining , it raises the question :
Why even put a moderator in the chair ?
Tom Brokaw threw up his hands from the outset , apologizing for the constraints he was under , which did n’t allow him to press on evasive answers or encourage a promising exchange .
Too bad he could n’t have just defied the commission altogether .
He should have tossed out the script and said , " This moment is too important to allow misinformation to go unchallenged and serious issues to be ignored . "
It ’s not Brokaw ’s fault .
Or Jim Lehrer ’s or Gwen Ifill’s .
The problem is the commission that has been invested with pseudo - constitutional status to run the debates but , in fact , weakly defers to candidates and clings to antiquated formats .
No serious candidate would skip a debate .
So the commission should use its leverage to insist that the debates are interesting to voters , rather than safe for candidates .
Allow moderators to be more aggressive — and to call out candidates for lame answers — and then allow the candidates to go at it over the issues that matter most , without time constraints .
The television ratings show voters want to hear from the candidates and are willing to sit through 90 minutes of boredom to get a glimpse of the two men in one arena .
Imagine what would happen if these events were actually exciting and informative .
The candidates are stumped .
When Sarah Palin dodged questions with scripted messages and folksy one - liners in her debate against Joe Biden , her nonresponsiveness was often glaringly obvious .
With McCain and Obama , you have to print out the transcript and read carefully to fully appreciate how they glided past sharp questions .
Because both have gone through dozens of such encounters over the past couple of years , and because Obama , in particular , is an exceptionally fluent speaker , their answers can sound plausible — even when the fog machine is going full - blast .
It is hard to imagine a more relevant question for the moment than the evening ’s first , when an audience member asked for “ the fastest , most positive solution ” to help older people , whose economic standing is most imperiled by the crash in home values and markets .
To this specific question , Obama offered a generic answer about the perils of excessive deregulation , the need for health care and the scandal of junketeering executives at American International Group , one of the companies bailed out by the government .
McCain was at first no more responsive as he called for energy independence and low taxes .
When he pivoted to a specific answer , it was with a breathtakingly ambitious idea to “ order the secretary of the Treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America ” and renegotiate the terms so that people have to move .
But the actual details of this unprecedented intervention — the cost , logistics and philosophical rationale for protecting people from unwise purchases — were murky .
And , amazingly , neither McCain nor Obama , nor Brokaw , returned to the subject .
The obvious conclusion is that everyone was winging it , hoping to get out of the evening alive even though ( like most Americans ) they are baffled about both the causes of and the cures for this fast - moving crisis .
The fog was not confined to the financial crisis .
It also covered the debate over Iraq , which was almost entirely backward - looking .
There was no independent on the stage .
Where is this election ’s Ross Perot ?
In 1992 ( and much less so in 1996 ) , the eccentric billionaire ’s presence at the debates helped give the proceedings a kind of cracker barrel candor .
An independent on the stage helps highlight — and , with luck — temper the major - party nominees ’ usual instinct to pander or avoid telling hard truths about themselves .
Brokaw provided the candidates a clear opportunity when he asked about consumers getting drunk on easy credit .
But neither candidate took him up on the invitation .
Obama ’s message was about the need for more regulation to protect investors , and McCain gave a paean to the inherent greatness of Americans .
But one big reason for the crisis is that ordinary Americans bought cars , houses and other things they simply could not afford .
They entered into mortgages they knew could be too good to be true : no money down , low payments for the first few years .
It is hard to imagine any outcome that does not involve significant sacrifice and more economic self - discipline for ordinary Americans .
An independent candidate would have increased the likeliness that someone would have thrown the flag on these evasions .
Self - importance .
Both Obama and McCain were once cult - of - personality candidates , running on their inspirational personal biographies and reformist profiles more than on their policy records .
At least in this format , unfortunately , neither of them had an especially appealing personality .
The combination of the two , as at the first debate in Mississippi , gave the evening a tense mood that contributed to the feeling of time hanging heavy .
McCain ’s contribution to the peevish tone was more obvious , as when he referred to Obama as “ that one . ”
Obama was , as ever , cooler and more poised .
As the younger man — trying to make history as the first African - American president — he surely feels a special imperative to convey calm and reassurance .
He does it so well , however , that he did not do much to convey what he is passionate about .
Neither man showed much humor .
Self - deprecation seems not to come naturally to either one .
The I - love - me quotient has rarely been higher in one of these debates .
It was a stark contrast to the personality and even warmth that both Biden and Palin showed at last week ’s St. Louis encounter .
Obama and McCain both are men with large life stories , asking to lead the country at a large moment .
With one more debate to go , could someone turn the telescope around ?

The former House Majority Leader veers off message in an interview with PolitickerCA : " If McCain wins the election , we 've got just as much work to do as if Obama won , " DeLay said .
" I 've known McCain for 23 years , and McCain 's hard to swallow . "
More : " His stance on global warming , immigration , campaign finance , affirmative action , " DeLay said , " it 's just a whole list of things that is not going to appeal to conservative Republicans .
And if he becomes president , teaming up with the Democrats , we 're going to have a lot of work to do to stop them . "
This is actually not a bad thing for McCain vis a vis independent voters as it allows his campaign to note that he 's taken on and angered members of parties .
DeLay , it should be noted , did say he was planning to vote for McCain and that Obama is " awful . "
UPDATE : I got at it two paragraphs above , but should probably have been more explicit : McCain and DeLay clashed over the years and the GOP nominee aggressively went after some of the former leader 's aides in the Abramoff probe .
One of the great parts about Politico is that you do n't have to lard items with explanations about who is who as there is an expectation about the knowledge of readers .
But I should have fleshed out the McCain - DeLay backstory a bit more .

There is more bad news for digital advertising , which oh - so - many Web start - ups count on for revenue .
The price advertisers are willing to pay for ad space online is down 27 percent this year , according to a PubMatic report released Wednesday .
“ We ’re definitely seeing a softening in the market due to the ongoing malaise in the offline economy , ” said Rajeev Goel , president and co-founder of PubMatic , which helps publishers find space across ad networks .
PubMatic tracked the sale of display ads through ad networks on Web sites in 20 different topic areas .
Ads on social networks fetched the smallest price per thousand eyeballs — 21 cents , down 22 percent from the second quarter .
Ads on sports sites were next lowest , at 25 cents .
Ad prices on entertainment sites saw the steepest drop , to 33 cents .
Ads on business and finance sites had relatively high prices , at 86 cents , but that was down 22 percent from the second quarter .
Web sites about technology were the only category that did n’t see ad prices fall — they stayed flat at 57 cents per thousand pairs of eyeballs .
Ads on small Web sites , those that get fewer than 1 million page views per month , sold on ad networks for three times as much as space on big sites with more than 100 million page views per month .
The average price advertisers paid for every thousand pairs of eyeballs that viewed their ads was 61 cents on small Web sites and 18 cents on large sites .
That ’s because small sites have niche content so advertisers can reach a more targeted audience , Mr. Goel said .
For example , a teenager in the United States and Mr. Goel ’s aunt in India both use Facebook , he said , so an advertiser who buys space via an ad network does n’t know who is seeing that ad .
A small site dedicated to vacationing in Eugene , Oregon , for example , or to restaurant reviews in Albany , N.Y. , would have a more defined set of readers .
Then again , GigaOM on Tuesday raised the question of whether people even look at display ads on Web sites .
One analyst who studied people ’s Internet behavior and tracked their eye movement found that they do not look at picture ads — no matter how much the advertiser paid .

At last night ’s debate John McCain was asked who he might choose as the new Treasury Secretary to replace Henry Paulson .
He dropped the name of billionaire Warren Buffett ( an Obama supporter ) and jokingly shot down Tom Brokaw , but his top pick in all seriousness was former eBay CEO Meg Whitman .
He ’s mentioned them both before , along with Cisco ’s John Chambers , and even considered Whitman as a potential vice president .
But would a CEO from Silicon Valley – an area associated with bubble bursts and risky investments – necessarily be the best person to manage the U.S. economy ?
" It 's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence , " the Arizona senator said at the debate , of whom we would " immediately say ' we can trust that individual . ' "
Whitman is no longer CEO but is still on the eBay payroll .
While eBay grew significantly under her direction it just announced cuts of 10 percent of its workforce in an attempt to streamline its costs , and has been described by some analysts as " deteriorating . "
McCain also said that " 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay , " and that this demonstrates her ability to create jobs .
But equating real job growth to people making money through an online auction site is a dangerous comparison , says Andrew Rasiej , co-founder of TechPresident and the Personal Democracy Forum .
" Picking someone from Silicon Valley or any industry without deep banking industry acumen is the financial equivalent of saying one has foreign policy experience because they can see another country from their beach , " said Rasiej .
His pick from Silicon Valley would be someone like Michael Moritz , a venture capitalist from Sequoia Capital and former board member of Google .
McCain admits that he does n’t know how to use a computer , so floating around names from the tech industry could simply be an attempt to counter the notion that he is n't tech savvy ( at least in his associations ) .
On the other hand – while they are facing a bit of a downturn like everyone else – watching companies like Google grow from a startup to a household name is impressive , and they could very well spawn a savior to the sad state of the economy .
To his credit , though , at least McCain named names ; Obama merely agreed that Buffett was a good prospect .
Who else do you think the new president should consider from Silicon Valley , if anyone ?

Do a small number of entrepreneurs create very valuable companies while most create companies that are largely worthless , or do a large number of people create companies of modest value ?
The answer , at least according to one set of data , appears to be the former .
To address this question , I commissioned a special tabulation from the U.S. Census to see what level of sales the different companies in single cohort of start - ups achieves at age six .
I picked age 6 since that seems to be an age at which most sophisticated angels and venture capitalists are trying to exit their investments .
I had to look at a fairly old cohort ( 1996 ) because I needed sales data six years later and Census has n’t yet released the 2007 data that would permit analysis of a later cohort .
Census provided me with the count of the number of new single establishment businesses started in 1996 and the number that had reached following sales levels in 2002 :
zero ;
between 1 and $ 99,999 ;
between $ 100,000 and $ 499,999 ;
between $ 500,000 and $ 999,999 ;
between $ 1,000,000 and $ 4,999,999 ;
between $ 5,000,000 and $ 9,999,999 ;
between $ 10,000,000 and $ 49,999,999 ;
between $ 50,000,000 and $ 99,999,999 ;
and $ 100,000,000 plus .
Most exits of companies are by sale to another private company .
So I used Pratt ’s Stats estimates of the price - to - one - year - sales multiple for sales of private companies over the period to calculate the value of six year old businesses .
The median ( typical ) company was worth nothing at age six .
But the value of six year old companies is incredibly skewed .
The table below shows the proportion of start - ups accounted for by companies with different levels of sales and the proportion of the value created by businesses of that sales level .
The 83 percent of companies that have less than $ 500,000 in sales at age six account for only 4 percent of the value of the cohort of companies .
By contrast , the 1.6 percent of the companies that had sales of $ 5,000,000 or more accounted for 54.2 percent of the value of the cohort .
In fact , just the 175 companies that had reached $ 100,000,000 in sales or more in year six accounted for 14.5 percent of the value of the 1996 cohort of start - ups .
Generating significant financial value is something done by a very small percentage of start - ups , but a handful that do generate a lot of value .

McCain ‘ amazed ’ by Palin treatment
John McCain called out fellow Republicans who have questioned running mate Sarah Palin ’s credentials Tuesday .
“ What ’s their problem ? ” McCain asked during an interview with radio host Don Imus .

“ She is a governor , the most popular governor in America , ” McCain said .
“ I think she is the most qualified of any that has run recently for vice president . ”
“ I ’m amazed .
I ’m amazed .
Which is better ?
Serve 35 years in the United States Senate and say you ’ve got to divide Iraq into three different countries , or be governor of a state and a reformer and give people their tax dollars back and bring about reform in the way that your state does business ?
Which is better ? ”
Several leading conservatives , including columnists Kathleen Parker of National Review and David Brooks of the New York Times , have questioned McCain ’s judgment in selecting Palin .
Parker called Palin “ out of her league ” in a September column urging the Alaska governor to drop out of the race .
Brooks , meanwhile , called Palin “ a fatal cancer to the Republican Party ” during a forum hosted by The Atlantic magazine earlier this month .
McCain dismissed their criticisms and credited Palin for energizing the conservative base in a year in which the GOP faces “ a stiff headwind . ”
“ She has ignited our crowds , ” McCain said .
“ She has a wonderful family , a great husband , great values and she shares my worldview . ”
“ I ’m entertained at the elitist attitude towards a person who is proven leader . ”
Looking back on Palin ’s early interviews with ABC ’s Charles Gibson and CBS ’s Katie Couric , McCain said Palin did well and derided the press for asking “ gotcha ” questions .
“ She did a great job in those interviews .
If you want to go with the gotcha questions that ’s fine , that ’s fine , I understand that .
I get them all the time , ” the Arizona senator said .
“ It ’s easy to make fun of people and ask them gotcha questions .
That ’s fine .
I understand how the game is played .
But do n’t think the American people buy that baloney . ”
McCain also mocked suggestions that Palin has to face tough interviews on the Sunday shows in order to prove herself to voters .
“ That ’s hilarious .
With thousands of people showing up at town hall meetings , I ’ve never had a person show up and ask when she is going on ‘ Meet the Press . ’
Not one . ”
With less than two weeks to go before Election Day , the Republican conceded that he is trailing Barack Obama but seemed optimistic about his chances .
“ We ’re doing fine .
We have a lot of enthusiasm out there .
We ’re working hard and enjoying the rallies and having fun .
I ’m very confident , ” he said .
“ I think we ’re behind , but it ’s within the margin of error and we ’re coming up .
All the indicators are that we ’re coming up . ”
Scott Adams is the genius behind the comic strip “ Dilbert , ” and behind every genius is a stalker , lurking in a crawl space .
I like to think that each of our readers is like that stalker : hungry , semi-naked , and scratching at an itch that does n’t exist .
I ’m almost choked up now .
And now , the man , the legend , Scott Adams :
Cartoon Lounge : Scott , thanks for taking the time to do this interview .
I ’ve already buried your fee of fifty gold doubloons in your back yard , as per your instructions .
You have a very beautiful garden .
Scott Adams : ( Nods , lips sealed tightly . )
C.L. : How does it make you feel that “ Office Space , ” “ The Office , ” the American version of “ The Office , ” the German version of “ The Office , ” and the animated television show “ Dilbert ” all stole your idea ?
S.A. : I would feel bad if I had n’t stolen the idea of a loser with a talking dog from Charles Schulz .
My contribution to the creative process was realizing Dilbert would starve if he did n’t have a job .
C.L. :
When you first started drawing “ Dilbert , ” were people in your office mad ?
Was your boss like , “ Wait a second … I have pointy hair … ” ?
S.A. : I had several different bosses during the early years of “ Dilbert . ”
They were all pretty sure I was mocking someone else .
C.L. : Do you own a dogbert ?
S.A. : I recently got a toy Australian Shepherd .
I ’m teaching her to walk on two legs ( really ) because I think it ’s funny .
Not all the time , but at least when company comes over .
If I can get her to wear glasses , that ’s pure comedy gold .
C.L. : A rat ?
S.A. : I ’m sure there is a rat around here someplace .
C.L. : Dinosaur ?
S.A. : Hard to say .
They are notoriously good at hiding .
C.L. : How did you first get published , and when did you become syndicated ?
S.A. : For the full story , see my new twentieth anniversary book , “ Dilbert 2.0 . ” ( Smooth , eh ? )
The short version is that I bought a book on how to become a cartoonist and followed the directions on submitting work to the big comic - syndication outfits .
I was rejected by all of them but United Media .
Before that , my only attempt at commercial cartooning had been some submissions to magazines such as The New Yorker and Playboy , all rejected .
( Actually , the comics rejected by the The New Yorker and Playboy are in “ Dilbert 2.0 . ” )
C.L. :
Do you generally come up with a bunch of strips for the week in one sitting , or spread it out over the week ?
S.A. : For most of my career I did one comic a day , every day , including weekends and holidays .
After I got married a few years ago , I have been doing two dailies per day on Mondays , Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Fridays , and one Sunday comic on Wednesdays .
That gets me ahead for vacations , and leaves weekends mostly open .
C.L. : How far in advance do you have to have a strip in ?
S.A. : I think it ’s about five weeks for daily comics and nine weeks for Sundays .
C.L. : You lost the ability to draw .
How did this happen , what was it like for you , and how did you overcome it ?
S.A. : It was tough .
I burned out my drawing hand by using it too much .
The common word for it is writer ’s cramp .
The fancy words for it are focal dystonia .
The symptom in my case was a pinky finger that went spastic when I tried to draw .
I first got symptoms over ten years ago , and drew some strips left - handed while working through it .
Over time , I retrained the hand by a gradual process of getting closer and closer to the motion of drawing without actually drawing , until my brain somehow allowed it .
( The problem is in the brain .
That can be proven by the fact that my right hand would spasm when I drew with my left hand . )
Anyway , I was probably the first person who ever overcame that particular problem .
About ten years later , I overused the hand again , and the problem returned .
This time I ditched paper and pen and started using the Wacom Cintiq 21 ux , which allows me to draw directly to the computer screen .
Although the motion is the same as drawing on paper , my brain does n’t recognize it as such , and I have no problems whatsoever .
Now the dystonia has gone away again , but would pop up if I started overusing the hand and drawing on paper again .
But that wo n’t happen .
The computer cuts my production time in half .
I love it .
C.L. : You lost the ability to speak .
How did this happen , what was it like for you , and how did you overcome it ?
S.A. : These dystonia problems often travel in pairs .
After a bout of a routine respiratory virus , plus allergies , I got a normal case of laryngitis that never went away .
It morphed ( again from overuse and straining the voice muscles ) into something called spasmodic dysphonia .
The vocal cords would clench shut when I tried to speak , making it difficult for anyone to understand a word I said .
I was essentially unable to speak for over three years .
The condition is incurable , or so the literature says .
This summer , I had surgery at U.C.L.A. to rewire the nerves in my neck and cure this incurable condition .
My surgeon , Dr. Berke , pioneered this technique .
Apparently it worked , because for the past two weeks I have been able to speak .
( It takes several months for the nerves to regenerate . )
I ca n’t shout yet , but the prognosis is good .
In casual conversation my voice sounds about normal , and will keep improving .
C.L. : Incredible .
I have had a turtle for four long , dark years , and I have not been able to teach him word one .
S.A. : I think I bought some wax from him .
C.L. : I read … somewhere … that you once put on a fake wig and mustache and pretended to be a management consultant for Logitech .
First of all , that is awesome .
Second , is it true ?
Third , was this just for the sake of art ( i.e. tax deductible ) ?
S.A. : It is true .
I did it for fun , and for publicity for a book .
C.L. : Now that you work from home , do you have to take vacations where you spend a month in an office so you can get material for “ Dilbert ” ?
S.A. : I have an endless stream of suggestions coming in from readers who are in cubicles .
That keeps me going .
C.L. :
Who were your favorite cartoonists / comics growing up ?
S.A. : Charles Schulz , all the cartoonists for Mad , and Al Capp .
C.L. : Who are your favorites now ?
S.A. : “ Pearls Before Swine , ” “ Basic Instructions , ” “ F Minus , ” and anything by Roz Chast .
C.L. : What makes you angry ?
S.A. : I get angry in retail stores that have vague rules about where the line forms .
C.L. :
As the owner of a small sandwich shop in New York City , I am always interested to find out about the operations of other cartoonists who run food empires .
How did you decide to start Scott Adams Food , Inc. , and when can we expect to see the Dilberito in stores again ?
S.A. : I started a food company after realizing it was impossible to get all the vitamins and minerals you need from a well - balanced diet .
Do the math yourself .
You can eat veggies all day long and never get close to the recommended minimums .
So I thought I could make the world a better place by selling a fortified food that was inexpensive and tasty and convenient .
As it turns out , the world was n’t interested in being healthy , so I got out of that business eventually .
C.L. : Back to the new book , “ Dilbert 2.0 . ” — What is included ?
S.A. : It ’s a big , beautiful , ten - pound coffee - table book with a few thousand of my favorite comics , including the ones too naughty to get published in newspapers .
It also has stories about the trouble I got into for strips that did get published .
I tell the story of how I went from cubicle to cartooning , which required lots of luck and the kindness of strangers .
We also include a disc that has every “ Dilbert ” comic published in newspapers from 1989 until we went to production .
C.L. :
There is a huge economic crisis in the world , people are losing their homes , their jobs , their retirements .
Can you show us what would happen if Dilbert became a werewolf who was always dancing ?
S.A. : Finally , a question no one has ever asked !
C.L. :
We are doing nonstop election coverage this month .
Any thoughts on whether there will be an election ?
S.A. : There will be an election , followed by rioting , the complete unraveling of society , and , I assume , a zombie problem .
And everyone will agree it ’s an improvement .
C.L. : Thanks again , Scott .

Begala : McCain sat on board of racist group David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This NBC's Tom Brokaw talked to Paul Begala about how the McCain campaign is attacking Barack Obama 's association with William Ayers , who was a member of the Weather Underground .
Brokaw played a clip of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin criticizing Obama 's connection to Ayers by referencing a New York Times article published on the subject .
" It turns out one of his earlier supporters is a man who , according to The New York Times , is a domestic terrorist , " Palin said .
After pointing out that Obama was eight years old when Ayers ' planned the attacks , Begala believes " guilt by association " attacks are dangerous territory for McCain .
Begala said , " This guilt by association path is going to be trouble ultimately for the McCain campaign .
You can go back -- I have written a book about the candidate .
A dozen researchers go through him .
I did n't even put this in the book .
John McCain sat on a board .
" It was the U.S. Council for World Freedom .
It was chaired by a guy named John Singlaub who wound up involved in the Iran Contra scandal .
It was an ultra conservative right - wing group .
" The Anti-Defamation League , in 1981 when McCain was on the board , said this about this organization .
It was affiliated with the World Anti-Communist League , the parent organization which ADL said had increasingly become a gathering place , a forum , a point of contact for extremists , racist and anti-Semites . "

Click to viewLast night , it was finally New York 's turn to see the 25 minutes of Watchmen and get a chance to hear from director Zack Snyder and Watchmen 's artist , Dave Gibbons , about the heavy undertaking that is bringing the classic graphic novel to life on the big screen .
But more importantly , Snyder shared with us a bombshell - Hollywood wanted to change the graphic novel 's alternate 1985 to the George W. Bush era , and turn Watchmen into a movie about the War on Terror .
After a quick viewing of a few clips
Snyder shared even more " almost " moments where the studio wanted to meddle , easter eggs and what he could n't live without .
Details ( and spoilers ) ahead .
Snyder said he had a meeting with the studio early on , where they shared their early " Hollywood " vision for the Watchmen movie .
It would have been an updated George Bush - era film , where the Minutemen team had been hunting down terrorists .
But Snyder 's love for Nixon 's Watchmen involvement brought him back to the table , asking Warner Brothers to trust him that 1985 is the right way to start the movie , and " maybe we should just leave it the way it is . "
But before we got to hear more about the studio's attempted revamps , we saw some footage from the movie :
Advertisement
While it's hard to judge an unfinished movie from just a few minutes , the main things I was stuck with upon leaving were the colors and the look to each character .
Even when covered in blood ( or someone 's innards ) the characters sets and scenes were all still striking and iconic - looking .
The movie starts with a McLaughlin Group - type talk show on TV .
There is a discussion about whether or not Dr. Manhattan 's presence is escalating the strain on foreign policy .
The Comedian ( old and warn ) switches the television to a show where " Unforgettable " begins to play .
Just as he's about to relax the door is thrown open and The Comedian is in his deadly fight with the " bad guy . "
The fight scenes are just as painstakingly crafted as the sets in Watchmen .
With each blow ( all to the tune of " Unforgettable " ) , you greeted to a slow - mo pan out shot that honestly makes the whole thing much more enjoyable .
Yet if this continues to happen throughout the entirety of the film I can see it getting tedious .
The fight continues , and you all know how it ends - bloody .
Zack 's Watchmen is blooooody , but wonderfully so .
With each drop of red this movie is setting itself apart from the one - liner superhero movies of yesterday and reminding us that these heroes can and will die .
Even bits from the trailer of exploding soldiers in the Vietnam war that appeared to be shiny bursts ( above ) were replaced with dark blood from Dr. Manhattan 's victims .
The same goes for the fight scene in the prison which we touched on earlier .
Cut to the opening credits playing the way too obvious and too long " The Times They Are A - Changin ' " by Bob Dylan .
But besides the extra-long song the viewer is treated to a montage pictures and video showing the creation of the Minutemen superhero team .
If you need a historical point of reference , Watchmen 's opening credits has 1,000 of them .
Ranging from Silhouette replacing the sailor in the infamous nurse - kissing V - Day black and white still , to Ozymandias standing outside of Studio 54 .
Finally we got to see the creation of Dr. Manhattan and listen to the inner monologue of the " god " himself .
Watching him turn from Dr. Jonathan Osterman to blue beast was amazing .
The detail that they went into ripping out each little organ was shocking .
The appearing - reappearing floating circulatory system that floats about days later is forever burned in my eyes .
I really see why this character is Snyder 's favorite .
Overall there was a lot of stuff that was a little " I get it - the Watchmen are a part of history " .
But besides that and a few scoring changes it was gorgeous , the characters were so lovely that even their teeth were sparkling in the Snyder film .
Dr. Manhattan 's back story alone ( just the simple day - to - day life of a 1950s ) man was strikingly detail oriented .
So I 'm excited to see what Snyder is going to do with the real meat of the movie .
Which he addresses in the Q&A with reporters : Q : Can you assure us that the ending wo n't puss out ?
ZS : The ending does not puss out .
I will assure you of that .
In that meeting , in that same war on terror meeting .
There was a different ending .
The moral checkmate that is the end of the movie , to me that 's the movie .
That 's the point of the graphic novel .
I 'm not going to spoil it , but the " bad guy " who 's not really the bad guy but lets call him the bad guy because it 's easier to say it that way .
The bad guy has an evil plan and you might call it that , he does something really horrific .
But at the end , the question of whether or not this was the right thing to do and the way all of the characters have to react to that is really sort of beautifully constructed so that the question that it poses is really the crux of the movie .
I can assure you that in that first movie , that was not the why of the movie .
The why was to run around and fight in rubber suits and beat the shit out of each other , which has also got merit , I will not say it does n't but that 's not why I make a movie .
Q : Where does Watchmen fit in the comic book movies with Iron Man etc. ?
ZS : I think that question is related to the graphic novel .
It 's where the graphic novel lives in the graphic book world .
Its place , in my opinion anyway , in the comic book world ...
Here 's the thing also : Iron Man , Batman , those two movies in particular , they 're not based on graphic novels per say .
Those characters get to go on adventures based on a director or a writer coming up with one for them to go on .
And there are political and or creative reasons why they did something that are completely valid and awesome , but they do n't serve any piece of literature like Watchmen does .
I have an obligation to that material and I think that material , the last thing it wants to do is send its characters out on an adventure in the classic Hollywood sense .
It 's completely deconstructed in what we 've been trained to think a superhero is .
DG : I think another example as to why this is being made now is it kind of stands in relation to the other superhero movies that the comic book did to the superhero comics at the time .
In other words the average movie - goer understands superheroes .
They know about secret identities and alcaves and nuclear powered heroes .
They come in and see it and immediately know what it 's about .
And just like I like to think that the readers of comics in the 1980s were , they will be finding questions being asked that they were n't thinking of before .
Like basically if there was a Dr. Manhattan what would the world be like ?
If there really were superheroes , what would they be like ?
ZS : It 's come full circle .
My mother knows the origins stories to superheroes she has no business knowing .
She 's just been to the movies a lot .
The average movie goer has the back story .
Advertisement
Q : Some people have been nervous that the movie would be simply panel by panel but I see now that may not be the case ?
ZS : The book has a luxurious pace that is awesome .
But I knew that I had to get some information out at the beginning of the movie .
There were things that I had to do that were different .
So there are going to be differences in the basic structuring .
But there are things that I like , that I wanted to keep .
Like in the title sequence I remember reading about Dollar Bill getting his cape stuck in a revolving door , and thinking , " gosh I want to see that . "
The Incredibles made a whole movie out of it and I thought it was worth a shot , you know .
Those were the things that I was inspired by that were in the supplemental material that maybe there was n't a frame for and I wanted to try and work it in .
Just like Wally Weaver plays a couple different parts , he takes a lot of the weight of the scientific community .
But that line he takes Milton Glass ' part as well .
He says " I never said that Superman was real and he 's American , I said God was real and he 's American , " I always thought that was a really cool line .
I wanted that to be on the poster , but they were n't into that by the way [ Laughs ] .
DG : Stragely enough if they had stuck to everything I drew I would be very disappointed because I think it 's important that it stands as a good movie .
And a good movie is n't just a literal translation of every single comic book panel .
I really loved the things like with Wally Weaver where things have been amalgamated that had been made much better for the film .

Q : What was the hardest stuff to get into the movie ?
ZS : The hardest stuff to get into the movie was the stuff I liked the best .
I remembered when we started talking about the movie and if you 're familiar with the book , the Comedian 's funeral and Manhattan on Mars , and some of the Rorschach flashbacks - those three are the corner stones of the beginning , middle and end of the movie ...
But those three sequences and the Comedian 's funeral in particular were difficult .
Everyone is internalizing , it 's raining and they 're thinking about how the Comedian affected their lives and they 're flashing to that moment .
It 's very particular , although those are kind of the whys as to why I did this movie .
Whenever I was debating on doing this movie I would think about the Comedian 's funeral , on Mars and Rorschach and I gotta do it .
Those things for me is as cool as it gets .
As far as things I could n't get in , the whole detective story - those two detectives that are trying to figuring out why these people are killing each other - those are the things we had to leave out .
Although you do see them in the movie , just not their whole story .
Q : What 's the status on the Black Freighter ?
ZS : In Watchmen there is a parallel pirate story that kind of parallels the Watchmen story .
We are creating it as an animated film and it is our hope that on the DVD that we can put those sequences into the DVD so they are woven right into the the actual story line of the movie , in the theatrical release that wo n't be the case .
But we 're going to release a DVD at the time of the theatrical release there is going to be a DVD that has a mock documentary on it called " Under The Hood " that is a TV show from ' 85 where this guy looks back to ' 72 ( I believe ) which is the year that [ superhero autobiography ]
Under the Hood was published , and that reporter had done a news story about the publishing of the book and is now doing a retrospective on what had happened to all the characters .
So it includes a lot of stuff form the body of the book .
It will also include the animated short on it .
The one movie will be the Ultimate Black Freighter Watchmen movie which will be 3 hours and something , 25 minutes .
Who can say ?
Q : Zack you 've done Frank Miller and Alan Moore - is there a Neil Gaiman movie in your future ?
ZS : It 's pretty funny .
I did n't mean it I really did n't .
It 's a coincidence , but he 's good .
Advertisement
( I could n't find that still , but this interior of The Comedian 's home has pin-up of Sally Jupiter on the wall ) Q : What did you put in this movie for the fans ?
ZS : You know it 's more an Easter Eggy thing than it is a filming technique that if you play the movie backwards [ you see something . ]
" I 'm good , but I 'm not that good . "
But there 's tons of that stuff .
Even in the shot where the Comedian punches his hand through the wall .
If you look at that shot on his bedside table , even though it 's only a second long , there is a picture of Laurie torn out of a magazine where Manhattan is torn out of it , and it 's put into a frame .
And if you know the story that makes sense .
It 's literally like 12 frames long .
There 's a lot of that .
Q : What was the budget of the film ?
ZS : I can't say the number because there 's lots of laws apparently .
But I will say , there was n't anything that we wanted to film that we did n't shoot .
Q : Speaking of Easter Eggs was that a 3001 on the Comedian 's door [ from the footage ] ?
ZS : Yeah , there are subtler ones than that [ Laughs ] .
There is a rabid and vocal fan base for the graphic novel that support the graphic novel and may be against the motion picture or the changes you 'd make to support the motion picture .
And I always say look , No Country For Old Men I guarantee you is changed twice as much or three times as much as we changed Watchmen .
But there is no vocal group of anti No Country For Old Men purists .
That are going to kill the Coens .
Although Cormac McCarthy is awesome , so there 's grounds .
That 's a difficult thing I just treat it like a great book that you 're making into a movie .
Q : Dave do you think some day you could convince Alan [ Moore ] to watch it ?
And in your heart of hearts what do you think he would think ?
DG : I do n't think it 's my job to convince Alan to do anything .
I would n't even go there .
I 'd rather not be drawn into hypothetical speculation about Alan 's thought process .
Enlarge By Wilfredo Lee , Associated Press Joseph Brown stocks bottled water on shelves of a Washington grocery store .
Tests on leading brands of bottled water turned up a variety of contaminants often found in tap water , according to a study released Wednesday by an environmental advocacy group .
The findings challenge the popular impression — and marketing pitch — that bottled water is purer than tap water , the researchers say .
However , all the brands met federal health standards for drinking water .
Two violated a California state standard , the study said .
An industry group branded the findings " alarmist . "
Joe Doss , president of the International Bottled Water Association , said the study is based on the faulty premise that a contaminant is a health concern " even if it does not exceed the established regulatory limit or no standard has been set . "
The study 's lab tests on 10 brands of bottled water detected 38 chemicals including bacteria , caffeine , the pain reliever acetaminophen , fertilizer , solvents , plastic - making chemicals and the radioactive element strontium .
Though some probably came from tap water that some companies use for their bottled water , other contaminants probably leached from plastic bottles , the researchers said .
" In some cases , it appears bottled water is no less polluted than tap water and , at 1,900 times the cost , consumers should expect better , " said Jane Houlihan , an environmental engineer who co-authored the study .
The two - year study was done by the Washington - based Environmental Working Group , an organization founded by scientists that advocates stricter regulation .
It found the contaminants in bottled water purchased in nine states and Washington , D.C. Researchers tested one batch for each of 10 brands .
Eight did not have contaminants high enough to warrant further testing .
But two brands did , so more tests were done and those revealed chlorine byproducts above California 's standard , the group reported .
The researchers identified those two brands as Sam's Choice sold by Wal - Mart and Acadia of Giant Food supermarkets .
In the Wal - Mart and Giant Food bottled water , the highest concentration of chlorine byproducts , known as trihalomethanes , was over 35 parts per billion .
California 's limit is 10 parts per billion or less , and the industry 's International Bottled Water Association makes 10 its voluntary guideline .
The federal limit is 80 .
Wal - Mart said its own studies did not turn up illegal levels of contaminants .
Giant Food officials released a statement asserting that Acadia meets all regulatory standards .
Acadia is sold in the mid-Atlantic states , so it is n't held to California 's standard .
In most places , bottled water must meet roughly the same federal standards as tap water .
The researchers also said the Wal - Mart brand was five times California 's limit for one particular chlorine byproduct , bromodichloromethane .
The environmental group wants Wal - Mart to label its bottles in California with a warning because the chlorine - based contaminants have been linked with cancer .
It has filed a notice of intent to sue .
Wal - Mart spokeswoman Shannon Frederick said the company was " puzzled " by the findings because testing by suppliers and another lab had detected no " reportable amounts " of such contaminants .
She said Wal - Mart would investigate further but defended the quality of its bottled water .
The researchers recommend that people worried about water contaminants drink tap water with a carbon filter .

Voting for the Party , not for the Candidate :
I blogged about this five years ago , but reader Dilan Esper suggested I repost it ; so here it is , with a few small changes :
Many people are opposed to “ party line ” voting ( by which I mean voting in partisan general elections based almost entirely on candidates ’ party affiliation , rather than focusing more on each candidate ’s own particular politics or character ) .
Such party line voting , they argue , shows laziness , stereotyping , or lack of independence .
I , on the other hand , think that in most situations voting for the party and not for the candidate is the most sensible approach .
A few words on why .
1. Elections of legislators ( federal or state ) .
Which particular people are in the legislature definitely matters — but which party has a legislative majority matters far more .
Legislative power is generally exercised by organized legislative party blocs , not by individual representatives who make up their own minds .
I generally think the country would be better off if the Republicans ( for all their warts ) are in control than if the Democrats are .
So if I and those like me vote for a Democratic candidate over a Republican because we think that this particular Democrat is better ( smarter , more honest , or even more in agreement with us on many issues , despite his party affiliation ) , and this candidate ’s election ends up giving Democrats control of the relevant legislative chamber , then we ’ve hurt the causes that we favor :
By electing this candidate , whom we like , we ’ve essentially elected a party that we dislike .
And even if the candidate breaks with the party in some cases ( which may be part of why we voted for him ) , in most situations — both when voting on legislation , and , as importantly , voting on whom to put on various legislative committees and the like — he ’ll follow party discipline .
2. Elections of Presidents and governors .
Presidents and governors ostensibly exercise executive power by themselves , so I may well imagine that an honest , smart Democrat may do a better job than a dishonest , dumb Republican .
But in reality , electing a President or governor also means electing his party , and not just him .
First , he ’ll probably select a cabinet that ’s drawn from a wide chunk of his own party ( since , among other things , he needs to maintain good relations with the party faithful ) .
He may well appoint some judges that he might not much like , but that help cement relations with various wings of his party .
And a Democratic President may let a Democratic Congress get its way on more issues ( even ones on which he does n’t fully agree with them ) , or may block the Republican Congress ’s proposals ( even ones which he does n’t much disagree with ) , because that ’s what his party base will want .
( Naturally , all this applies equally to Republican Presidents . )
This suggests to me that one should basically ask “ Which party do I want to see in power ? , ” and then vote for candidates of that party nearly all the time — because you are in effect electing a party , more than you are electing a person .
There are , of course , some exceptions ( “ Intentionally voting for split government ” is one that I ’ve heard most talked about this year ) :
A . The truly awful candidates .
Some candidates are so bad — either so personally dishonest or corrupt , or so far from your own views — that you might refuse to vote for them , even if you generally support their party .
First , you might just feel that you ca n’t endorse this person .
Second , even if your view is purely instrumental , you might think that it ’s better for your party if this member of the party is defeated than if he wins .
I ’d have voted against David Duke in Louisiana for both of those reasons .
B. Trying to affect the position of your own preferred party .
In some situations , you might feel more strongly about sending a message to the leadership of your preferred party than you do about winning this particular election .
I take it that this is what some ( though not all )
Nader voters who otherwise preferred Democrats were thinking in 2000 , as were some Libertarian voters who otherwise preferred Republicans .
I think this is a dangerous game to play , but if that ’s what you ’re self - consciously trying to do , then I can see why you ’d vote against your otherwise preferred party .
Again , though , the focus should be on which party you want to elect , and not whether you think this particular candidate is a better person than the other one .
C. Nonpartisan elections and primaries .
Naturally , none of this applies to nonpartisan elections or to primaries where you ’re choosing from several candidates within the same party .
D. Intentionally voting for split government .
You might conclude that it ’s better for the country if control of the House , Senate , and the Presidency are split ; if that ’s so , then you might intentionally vote for one party in one race and another in another .
E. Mixed preferences for a major party and a third party .
You might want to vote Republican if the election is close and your vote might matter to the outcome ( see item I below on that ) , but Libertarian if the election is n’t close and you want to express support for Libertarians ; likewise for Democrats and Greens and similar combinations .
But this too is a reflection of the core strategic principle , which is usually “ vote for the party , not for the candidate . ”
F. Different preferences at different levels of government .
My suggestion that you should choose your preferred party operates at each level of government ; you might , for instance , conclude that you want the Republicans to run the country , but you want the Democrats to run the state government of your own state .
That ’s consistent with my general theory .
( Who controls the states may affect who controls the federal government , and vice versa , but the effect is weak enough that supporting different parties at different levels may make sense . )
I would just say that you should then vote for Republican candidates virtually all the time at the federal level , and for Democratic candidates virtually all the time at the state level .
G. The voter who is really in the middle .
If you are really so much in the middle that you are indifferent whether the Democrats or the Republicans win , then of course it makes sense to vote for the particular candidate that you like most :
The strategic party power considerations are by hypothesis irrelevant to you — you ’d rather elect ( say ) a smart Republican over a dumb Democrat because you just do n’t care whether the Republicans or the Democrats are in power .
I think few people really feel that way , though ; I think that even if you are n’t a consistent supporter of one party or the other , and even if you disagree with much that either party would do , you can probably identify what you think is the lesser of two evils ( or the greater of two very slight goods ) in any particular election .
H . The voter who is near the middle , and who really cares a lot about a particular candidate .
This is a more common variant of G — say you mildly prefer the Democrats over the Republicans , but you think that this Republican candidate is much better than the Democrats , in a way that really matters :
Either he has the brilliance or charisma to really add a lot to legislative deliberations , or he is running for an executive office , where one person ’s character , intelligence , and policy preferences really can make a huge difference .
This too may be reason enough for you to abandon party - line voting ; but again , you ’d have to really feel that this one candidate can do so much good that the expected value of this good really exceeds the expected harm of the wrong party ( from your perspective , of course ) getting power .
I. Expressive voting .
Of course , there ’s been something of a fiction behind this whole discussion of strategic voting — the fiction that your vote will make much of a difference .
In fact , your one vote is highly unlikely to affect things ( though in a few elections , including even Congressional ones , the result does turn on a handful of votes ) .
We therefore vote largely because of how it makes us feel about ourselves ( e.g. , because we ’ve been taught that to be a dutiful citizen , one should vote , or because we feel good about voting for a particular person we really like ) .
So under that approach , if it makes you feel good to think that you vote based on each candidate ’s individual merit , that ’s what you should do , and never mind the practical consequences , since as a practical matter , your one vote is extaordinarily unlikely to actually have any practical consequences .
Still , I find it hard to feel good about casting a vote that , if duplicated by many others , would actually lead to a result that I dislike .
That might ultimately be more an aesthetic rather than rational judgment here , but that ’s what expressive voting necessarily involves .
Thus , so long as I feel that I ought to vote , based on the fiction that my vote does have some practical effect , I prefer to go through with the fiction , and ask what practical effect that I ’d like to have .
And since my preferred practical effect is having the Republican Party be in power , I almost always vote party line .
Finally , I ’m sure that there are other reasons to depart from the “ vote the party , not the candidate ” approach , though I suspect that most are variants on some of the ones I identify above .
I ’m not saying that party line voting is always the right approach ( right in the sense of being most likely to lead to the results that you , as a voter , like ) .
I just think there is enough reason for me to adopt it as a very strong presumption in my voting choices .
What we were learning  through The New York Times , Newsweek and Roll Call  was ugly .
Davis Manafort , the lobbying firm owned by McCain ’s campaign manager , Rick Davis , had received $ 15,000 a month from Freddie Mac from late 2005 until last month .
This was in addition to the $ 30,000 a month that Davis was paid from 2000 to 2005 by the so - called Homeownership Alliance , an advocacy organization that he headed and that was financed by Freddie and Fannie to fight regulation .
The McCain campaign tried to pre-emptively deflect such revelations by reviving the old Rove trick of accusing your opponent of your own biggest failings .
It ran attack ads about Obama ’s own links to the mortgage giants .
But neither of the former Freddie - Fannie executives vilified in those ads , Franklin Raines and James Johnson , had worked at those companies lately or are currently associated with the Obama campaign .
( Raines never worked for the campaign at all . )
By contrast , Davis is the tip of the Freddie - Fannie - McCain iceberg .
McCain ’s senior adviser , his campaign ’s vice chairman , his Congressional liaison and the reported head of his White House transition team all either made fortunes from recent Freddie - Fannie lobbying or were players in firms that did .
By Wednesday , the McCain campaign ’s latest tactic for countering this news  attacking the press , especially The Times  was paying diminishing returns .
Davis abruptly canceled his scheduled appearance that day at a weekly reporters ’ lunch sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor , escaping any further questions by pleading that he had to hit the campaign trail .
( He turned up at the “ 21 ” Club in New York that night , wining and dining McCain fund - raisers . )
It ’s then that Angry Old Ironsides McCain suddenly emerged to bark that our financial distress was “ the greatest crisis we ’ve faced , clearly , since World War II ”  even greater than the Russia - Georgia conflict , which in August he had called the “ first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war . ”
Campaigns , debates and no doubt Bristol Palin ’s nuptials had to be suspended immediately so he could ride to the rescue , with Joe Lieberman as his Robin .
Yet even as he huffed and puffed about being a “ leader , ” McCain took no action and felt no urgency .
As his Congressional colleagues worked tirelessly in Washington , he malingered in New York .
He checked out the suffering on Main Street ( or perhaps High Street ) by conferring with Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild , the Hillary - turned - McCain supporter best known for her fabulous London digs and her diatribes against Obama ’s elitism .
McCain also found time to have a well - publicized chat with one of those celebrities he so disdains , Bono , and to give a self - promoting public speech at the Clinton Global Initiative .

There was no suspension of his campaign .
His surrogates and ads remained on television .
Huffington
Post bloggers , working the phones , could n’t find a single McCain campaign office that had gone on hiatus .
This “ suspension ” ruse was an exact replay of McCain ’s self - righteous “ suspension ” of the G.O.P. convention as Hurricane Gustav arrived on Labor Day .
“ We will put aside our political hats and put on our American hats , ” he declared then , solemnly pledging that conventioneers would help those in need .
But as anyone in the Twin Cities could see , the assembled put on their party hats instead , piling into the lobbyists ’ bacchanals earlier than scheduled , albeit on the down - low .
Lee Jasper , who advised former London Mayor Ken Livingstone on equalities , said it was time the black community ran its own schools , with black teachers and black governors .
He said black schools and colleges could prove to be a " beacon of excellence " for the black community .
Mr Jasper said Jewish , Muslim and Hindu communities already had their own schools .
And he accused the " liberal community " of dismissing the idea of black schools , while failing to address " institutional racism " within education .
The comments come after a study suggested that black Caribbean students are less likely to be entered for higher - tier science and maths exams because of low teacher expectations .
The study , conducted by Dr Steve Strand at Warwick University , noted that black Caribbean pupils are among those more likely to be excluded from school , or have special educational needs , including behavioural , emotional and social difficulties .
Mr Jasper said : " The fact is , it 's time the black community ran its own schools , devised a curriculum that suited the needs of our children , employed teachers that look like the young people they are teaching . "
Mr Jasper said black schools would be open to all races but would be " focused in terms of their ethos , ethics and curriculum to the needs of our children " .
" Some of the greatest black leaders in the world - Dr Martin Luther King , Nelson Mandela , to name just two - attended all black schools and universities .
" The US has many historically black colleges and universities .
They cater for the needs of the African American and they excel .
I am not arguing here for a BNP - style ' apartheid education system ' .
I am talking about black business , parents , schools and our magnificent churches coming together and establishing schools that are open to all and are organised around the behavioural , pastoral , psychological and cultural requirements of black young people growing up in a economic environment that excludes black people . "
Add former Bush press flack and lifelong Republican Scott McClellan to the long list of unlikely Obama endorsements .
WaPo :
Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan , who angered many Republicans earlier this year with a memoir criticizing President Bush , said today that he 's voting for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
McClellan told CNN that Obama 's message " is very similar to the one that Governor Bush ran on in 2000 , " apparently referring to the current president 's early pitch as a reformer and a moderate .
" From the very beginning I have said I am going to support the candidate that has the best chance for changing the way Washington works and getting things done and I will be voting for Barack Obama , " McClellan said during the interview , which was taped for the Saturday broadcast of a new CNN show , " D.L. Hughley Breaks the News . "

Eleven Arguments Against Same - Sex Marriage - Dobson
www.family.org ^ | May 23 , 2004 | Dr. James Dobson
Posted on by AngieGal
An argument in favor of homosexual marriage that you are likely to hear again and again on radio talk shows , on national television , and on the Internet , reflects a line of reasoning that you must be prepared to counter .
It is embodied in these kinds of questions :
Why all the fuss about gay marriage anyway ?
And why should it matter to you if a gay couple marries and moves into your neighborhood ?
Why shouldnt our definition of family be broadened and modernized ?
After all , what harm could possibly be done by yielding to the demands of those who say traditional notions of family are outmoded and irrelevant ?
Columnist Steve Blow , in a recent edition of The Dallas Morning News , echoed some of these questions .
His op - ed piece was titled  Gay Marriage : Why Would It Affect Me ?  and was apparently written after he had read one of my recent newsletters on the subject .
Blow wrote :
When opponents talk about the defense of marriage ,  they lose me .
James Dobsons Focus on the Family just sent out a mailer to 2.5 million homes saying :  The homosexual activists  movement is poised to administer a devastating and potentially fatal blow to the traditional family . 
And I say ,  Huh ? 
How does anyones pledge of love and commitment turn into a fatal blow to families ?
Mr. Blow clearly believes that the only reason for not legalizing homosexual marriage is sheer bigotry .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
There are very compelling arguments against marriage between homosexuals that should be considered by anyone who has not yet become familiar with the issues .
Unfortunately , the American people , as a whole , have not yet thought through the consequences and measured the impact of this revolutionary concept .
I could list fifty or more legitimate concerns .
Let me focus on only eleven :
1 . The legalization of homosexual marriage will quickly destroy the traditional family .
2. Children will suffer most .
3. Public schools in every state will embrace homosexuality .
4. Adoption laws will be instantly obsolete .
5 . Foster - care programs will be impacted dramatically .
6 . The health care system will stagger and perhaps collapse .
7. Social Security will be severely stressed .
8. Religious freedom will almost certainly be jeopardized .
9 . Other nations are watching our march toward homosexual marriage and will follow our lead .
10 .
The gospel of Jesus Christ will be severely curtailed .
11 . The culture war will be over , and the world may soon become as it was in the days of Noah ( Matthew 24:37 ) .
_________________________________________________
In his latest book , Marriage Under Fire , Dr. James Dobson defends the sanctity of traditional marriage , presenting clearly defined reasons for it in the legal , financial , social and emotional arenas .
Dobson says Christians everywhere must rally to become a solid force now more than ever .

So many assertions , so little evidence .
This business of blaming the decline of marriage in the Scandanavian Countries and The Netherlands on gay marriage is particularly ludicrous , as a matter of causation .
Dobson merely asserting it did , wo n't cut it .
Of course , there is an issue vis a vis entitlement programs that must be addressed , including the gaming of the system .
To : AngieGal
I would disagree on : 1 . The legalization of homosexual marriage will quickly destroy the traditional family .
The traditional family is getting more popular - the younger generation in larger numbers is choosing it over the alternatives .
If you look at the gay parades they are mostly older , just like the war protesters - they 'll die away .
8 . Religious freedom will almost certainly be jeopardized .
What people are crying about concerning religious freedom and persecution of Christians in America is laughable .
The churches simply need to drop their tax exempt status to be free of the government .
10 . The gospel of Jesus Christ will be severely curtailed .
There is no way God 's plans will ever be curtailed by man .
If that were possible God would have been dead for good long ago .
Okay , just my opinion , your 're certainly welcome to yours .
To : AngieGal
Some of that is already happening under the radar .
I know my lesbian niece ( and her much older policewoman girlfriend -- who worked openly gay for the gov't of a state where sodomy was illegal ) became foster parent to a few unlucky kids just before she killed herself .
She was looking to adopt one of them .
Beware of privatized foster care and single person adoptions .
And the schools ... do n't even get me started .
Oh .. and the drug , juvenile crime and mental health counselling done by most states are sometimes heavily staffed by homosexuals .
The watchdog media stays silent .
God help the children of this generation .
I am wondering why I have to obey the laws when liberals do n't .
What about equal disobeying protection of the laws .

The one thing Dobson seems to have forgotten to mention is that until Christians abstain from the same sexual practices homosexuals engage in , there will be no moral authority or moral high ground for " family values " to stand on .
This is a difficult teaching , as all oral sex is sodomy , according to the Bible , and according to our old time sodomy laws in this country .
This means heterosexual oral sex , of course .

He forgot the massive health care cost of their diseases and infections .
They 'll run rampant , like the common cold .
Who knows what mutation will breed in their bodies next .
Over use of antibiotics has already caused antibiotic resistance .
The homosexuals are always getting intestinal infections from foreign objects , and stomach infections from ingesting bile .
When you play in the sewer , you get sick .

By the way , here is a counterpoint to the bit that gay marriage causes more out of wedlock births .

*** There is no way God 's plans will ever be curtailed by man ***
That 's not what he said .

“ You know you ’re in trouble when you have to bail out the bailouts , ” said Floyd Norris in The New York Times online , and “ Europe did that twice very late Sunday night . ”
Following a failed summit on Saturday , Germany had to salvage a week - old bailout of its No. 2 mortgage lender , Hypo Real Estate , and the Dutch government restructured its bailout of Fortis .
Worse yet , as America ’s “ financial upheaval ” washes " with full force on to the shores of the Old Continent , ” said David Marsh in MarketWatch , Europe is falling apart .
Just when it needs unity , European nations are resurrecting old “ beggar - thy - neighbor polices ” — Ireland , then Greece , and now Germany have guaranteed their residents ’ bank deposits , and other countries are feeling pressure to match them .
Europe 's governments “ are having to throw the rulebook away , ” said Britain ’s The Guardian in an editorial .
If Europe does n’t rethink its economic model — creating a “ continental banking regulator , ” say — Hypo wo n’t be the last teetering bank .
This section is from the book " Health Via Food " , by William Howard Hay .
Also available from Amazon : Health via food , by William Howard Hay .
Disease has always been a complete mystery in all ages and among all peoples .
Always there has been that feeling of misunderstanding , heavily mixed with superstition and fear .
Always it has been considered and treated as an extrinsic affair , something that attacks us from without .
It has generally been considered a ministration of some higher power as a punishment for sins committed against this higher power , but always with the feeling of helplessness and fear .
This attitude easily lent itself to the plundering of the fearful by those in authority , the priests , later physicians , or magicians , augurs , workers of charms and miracles , so that humanity , through this fear of disease , has been plundered incessantly from the beginning of conscious time to the very present moment .
One fears only what he does not understand , even as the animal , and when a thing is understood there is nothing to fear , for knowing the nature of this we can easily devise means to avoid its supposed dangers .
Thousands of years ago there existed in Egypt , the home of medicine , two different schools , the one official , recognised by the Egyptian government , the other and more recent school considered a sort of experimental idea without the sanction of government .
If one died under the ministrations of a member of the recognised school of medicine no blame attached officially to the one who administered the treatment , as it was considered then , as now , that everything had been done that science could devise , and if the patient died under this sort of treatment it was his own fault , or he was out of luck .
If one died under the newer school of treatment , the one administering this was held responsible for the death , and paid with his life for the life of the patient ; surely a most deterring penalty .
Now the strange part of this historical fact is that the recognized , official school at that time was the one that believed that disease was a self - created , intrinsic affair , and that all that could be done to relieve was to discontinue its causes , assisted by such means as the enema , fast , baths , massages , sunlight , diet , the so - called natural means , while the other and non-official school believed disease an extrinsic affair , something that attacked the victim from without , and so to be treated with means to counteract this thing , whatever it was .
This led the newer school to the use of various drugs , in an effort to counteract this outside influence , also to much surgical interference , as we have today many records of operations performed thousands of years ago showing trephining operations , sections of the body ( our present day internal operations ) and a surprising amount of operative lore that we used to think originated with this present civilization .
It would seem that unless the physicians of the new school at that time were much more successful with their operations and their drugging than are our present crop , the ranks of their adherents must have been rapidly thinned by the number of vicarious deaths claimed as forfeit for surgical and medical losses .
Hippocrates , the so - called father of medicine , was educated in Alexandria , under perhaps both schools of treatment , and his practice and teaching show much of both sides .
He believed in the potency of drugs to assist Nature , as also in operations , yet he evidenced all through his teachings a profound respect for Nature as expressed in the human body , and many of his suggestions for treatment would fit well with the practice of the so - called naturopathic school of today .
He still retained the idea of allowing Nature free rein in the management of the case , but believed much could be done through the agency of baths or massages or drugs to relieve the condition and so assist the body in regaining a normal state .
It is easy to see how the new school , exploiting all sorts of remedies that consistently failed to relieve , was led farther and farther into the field of research and experiment in their hunt for something that would cure , so that by the Middle Ages everything imaginable had been used : toad 's toenails , bat 's tongues , the entrails of various animals , the more disgusting the better suited to the case , and always with this idea that something not yet discovered would cure disease .
The fountain of youth was ever the chief incentive , and perhaps more ingenuity was expended in search for something that would promote eternal youth than for anything else .
Yet always the search went on , and never did it arrive , for when disease is understood it will be easily seen that there can be no remedy for it except the discontinuance of its causes .
From the time of Hippocrates to the very present this same search is going on , and it will go on unavailingly till humanity realizes that its troubles are always intrinsic , as is also the only remedy .
Our prescriptions today do not include such strange things as toad 's toenails or bat 's tongues , but they are no more availing in the relief or cure of disease than were these ancient nosodes .
We are still treating disease as if it were something , an entity , blaming it on germs or other extraneous influences , and of course this holds us to the idea of extraneous cure .
Here and there for the past hundred years and more has arisen a voice protesting that we were on the wrong track on both our understanding of disease and our means for its relief , yet these were always regarded as the protests of idle dreamers who did not understand , and their voices were drowned in the tumult of those who were exploiting panaceas or special treatments guaranteed to cure this or that ailment .
Even now , with the present awakening on the subject , the number of those who understand what disease is and what to do for it is inconsiderable as compared with the great majority who still believe and teach that disease is something that we do not know anything about and that all we can do about it is to wait till it develops and then do something for the symptoms , just as the cry at present is for early diagnosis and early operation in cancer , when the very earliest possible diagnosis is too late , much too late , for effective treatment .

“ Working people have had enough of policies which have delivered vast wealth to a tiny few who have profited from lax or non-existent regulation of financial markets , while those who actually produce the goods and services of the real economy have seen their wages stagnate or fall .
The ITUC ’s Founding Congress in 2006 launched the call for this world day of action , to demand a fundamental transformation of globalisation , ending the policies of free market neo-liberalism which have brought us to the very edge of a catastrophic global recession .
The time for that change is now ” , said ITUC General Secretary Guy Ryder .
The day will start with a gathering of young trade unionists in Fiji , following which rallies , demonstrations , educational , cultural and media events will be taking place in more than 500 cities , towns and villages across the planet , ending as the eastern - most activity of the day comes to a close in Alaska .
Live internet coverage of the activities around the world , including videos , photographs and messages from events in every continent , is being broadcast on the special website for the World Day for Decent Work www.wddw.org.
Union organizations from 115 countries have pre-registered their October 7 activities on the website , and these will be updated via a 24 - hour live feed .
The events include large - scale national mobilizations in several countries involving public rallies and workplace meetings , demonstrations in front of national parliaments , concerts , trade union member - to - member contacts in person and by phone and email , seminars involving trade unionists , academics and politicians and high visibility public events in city squares and other venues .
Events organized by young trade unionists will feature prominently in a number of countries , and women trade unionists in every continent will be stepping up their “ Decent Work – Decent Life for Women ” campaign , which focuses on major concerns to women and men at work , including pay equity and maternity rights amongst other issues .
These and other national actions are linked to the three main themes for the World Day : Rights at Work ; Solidarity ; and Ending Poverty and Inequality .
A number of the national actions will focus on international solidarity with trade unionists facing severe repression in countries such as Burma , Colombia , Swaziland and Zimbabwe .
“ Workers around the world will be speaking with a united voice on this first ever mobilization of its type , protesting against the results of more than two decades of deregulation : growing insecurity , huge inequality and a downward spiral of global competition which puts profits before people ’s fundamental rights .
We aim to make this day a catalyst for real change ” , said Ryder .

Newly released video shows how easily electronic voting machines can be hacked , pried open John Byrne
Published : Tuesday September 9 , 2008
Print This Email This
Test of company 's software recently double - counted thousands of votes A newly released video depicts an eerie scenario in which voting machines produce an XXXXXX result for the ballot position of US senator after a vote is placed and then replaces the XXXXXX with an individual 's name .
Though it appears to be part of an eerie low - budget sci- fi thriller , the producers were n't B - movie conspiracy theorists .
Instead , they were students from the University of Santa Barbara 's Security Group , participating in a project commissioned by the California Secretary of State .
Why the video was posted now despite the fact that the project took place last year remains unknown .
It may have its roots in a legal threat issued by the voting machines ' manufacturer in March .
In a sharply worded letter to a Princeton research team that had audited their machines before , Edwin Smith , the VP for " Compliance / Quality / Certification , " said that the publication of any security audit of " Sequoia software [ or ] its behavior " would force the company to " take appropriate steps " through its " retained counsel . "
In the film , included below , students demonstrate uploading a virus - like program to a voting terminal by inserting a data card and pressing a key .
They then proceed through the voting process -- selecting candidates and approving ballot issues .
Following their votes , the machine spits out a paper receipt .
The receipt correctly displays the student 's choices .
But a moment later , it spits out a second receipt , topped " VOID , " which has replaced the student 's senatorial selection with XXXXXX .
The following receipt replaces XXXXXX with James P. ' Jim ' Gray .
The student project also reveals the system 's vulnerability to hacking the machines ' internal workings .
One student is able to slip one of the virus - implanting cards into a theoretically " sealed " machine simply by peeling back the flap .
Sealed machines opened up in seconds A physically sealed machine is opened and hacked in just 18 seconds .
A second machine is unscrewed in less than a minute .
A piece of sheet metal holding on the door is removed in several minutes with a simple Phillips head screwdriver .
It 's possible the letter from Sequoia 's Smith has succeeded in keeping some audits of the company 's software off the national radar .
In his letter to the Princeton professors who 'd planned an audit of the company 's voting machines , the firm all but threatens a lawsuit .
" As you have likely read in the news media , certain New Jersey election officials have stated that they plan to send to you one or more Sequoia Advantage voting machines for analysis , " Smith writes .
" I want to make you aware that if the County does so , it violates their established Sequoia licensing Agreement for use of the voting system .
Sequoia has also retained counsel to stop any infringement of our intellectual properties , including any non-compliant analysis .
We will also take appropriate steps to protect against any publication of Sequoia software , its behavior , reports regarding same or any other infringement of our intellectual property . "
Sequoia reemerged in the news late last month after votes were double counted during a test in Florida .
Yesterday , the company blamed the glitch on " operator error . "
" Procedures by the poll workers and the Supervisor 's office staff proved to be good , " Sequoia asserted .
" The hardware and software performed as it should .
The accuracy will be confirmed at a later date .
The reason that the vote totals doubled in these 40 precincts was due to an inadvertent operator error .
The California students ' video was picked up Tuesday by the blog BoingBoing .

The idea of a little farm in a big city sounds daunting to some , impossible to others , but to bloggers who are reclaiming their bit of city green space and saying no to Big Farm , self - reliance is not only possible , but the preferred way to live a rich and rewarding life .
A small movement of people are eschewing the outsourcing of their everyday needs and are choosing , instead , to produce as much of what they need at home , transforming tiny plots of land into thriving gardens , raising chickens and goats for eggs and milk , canning , preserving , cheesemaking , soapmaking , and any other project on which Mother Earth News has advice .
And , in true 21st century form , they ’re blogging about it .
Why urban homesteading ?
To be honest , it ’s nothing really new .
Asians and Cubans have been growing food in big cities for decades .
Community gardens have thrived in many urban areas .
But as awareness of environmental issues grows , and as the origins of food become harder and harder to trace the further we get from farm to table , many city - dwellers have chosen to take matters into their own hands , producing for pennies what they had to rely on others to procure .
Documentation on the internet makes sharing information readily available .
It ’s also a feasible alternative to moving completely off the grid .
For those who enjoy the benefits of urban life , such as culture , nightlife , and public transportation , it ’s a way to stay grounded in the city .
You may have heard of Pasadena , California ’s Dervaes family .
They ’ve transformed 1/5 of a residential acre into a blueprint for urban homesteading .
They grow 350 types of plants which yield 6,000 pounds of food per year –from a 1/10th of an acre garden , which supports not only their family , but provides income for the four adult family members living at home through their Dervaes Gardens food supply business .
In addition to their produce , they have chickens , ducks , and goats which supply milk and eggs , and have incorporated several sources of energy , including brewing their own biodiesel , to futher increase their self - reliance .
Their online journal can be found here .
Undoubtedly the hippest of the urban homesteaders , Los Angeles bloggers Kelly Coyne and Erik Knutzen , authors of The Urban Homestead : Your Guide to Self - Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City , and the Homegrown Evolution blog explore not only the “ how ” of urban homesteading , but the “ why ” , and also cover news that might interested urban homesteaders .
Their book , The Urban Homestead , makes the DIY ethos seem incredibly possible , particularly for those on a budget , utilizing would - be waste into productive re-uses in accessible , entertaining language , and do n’t shy away from lamenting failed projects or frustrations with this type of lifestyle .
Urban homesteading is n’t just for those with a Southern - California growing season .
Leda Meredith blogs about urban homesteaing from her Brookyn , NY apartment on Leda ’s Urban Homestead .
She just finished a year of eating only food from a 250 - mile radius of Brooklyn , which was made easier by her wealth of knowledge of food foraging –finding edible plants growing in the wild , a subject she teaches classes on .
And Patrice Farmer ( ha ! ) , a single mom in Michigan , is raising her daughter–and chickens–on an urban homestead and documenting it on A Single Mom ’s Adventure into Urban Homesteading .
If the idea of raising chickens in your backyard intimidates you , just read her blog and see how possible it really is .
Urban Hippie Mama is another favorite , blogging about raising a family ( and a garden , some chickens , and some goats ) in the Pacific Northwest .
What ’s most amazing about these different urban homsteading movements is the varied responses to the challenge of utilizing urban spaces and the creativity involved in reclaiming what has been discarded , both literally and figuratively to support human life .
Blogs like these not only document individual homesteaders processes , achievements , and struggles , but share that information with others and empower them to do the same .
We ’ve had a small garden for the past three years , but after reading the Coyne and Knutzen book , I began to see the vast possibilities of what I thought was too - cramped a space .
Now , I ’ve got several urban homesteading projects in the wings , and undoubtedly , I ’ll blog about it .
The BBC iPlayer team works hard to release new versions of the BBC iPlayer frequently in its bid to make it as widely available as possible across different devices and to come up with the most exciting new features .
Though not as sexy , the team also has to address the [ inevitable ] bug fixes .
Over the past six months we added Flash streaming ( Dec ) , added Most Popular , More Like This , etc. ( Jan ) , and made BBC iPlayer available on iPhone ( Feb ) and Wii ( April ) .
We then went quiet for a while as we built an all - new server architecture better suited to powering the types of product propositions that we look forward to releasing over the next six months .
An iceberg seen from off the coast of Graham Land in Antarctica
The first of the releases built on our new platform - the all - new BBC iPlayer 2.0 site - went live on June 25 , just over a month ago .
Like an iceberg , the BBC iPlayer 2.0 site is the bit " above the water " .
The new site is doing well , but to me more important than the site itself is the ability that our new architecture ( the invisible mass below the water ) gives us to deliver innovative and world - class new features , even faster than we 've been shipping them so far .
Okay , now on to the announcement : H.264 .
The video you see in BBC iPlayer today is encoded using the On2 VP6 codec , at a bitrate of 500 Kbps .
The On2 codec ( a video compression technology from a company called On2 ) is pretty much the standard for video delivery over the internet today .
It 's optimised for moderately low data rates ( 300 Kbps to 700 Kbps , rather than the 2 M bps to 4 M bps needed for HD content ) , and low CPU usage , allowing it to work reasonably well on older computers .
In short , On2 VP6 is the video workhorse of the internet .
When we went live with streaming in BBC iPlayer back in December last year , we needed to make some decisions about the streaming technology to use .
Adobe Flash with On2 VP6 codec was the obvious technology choice ( it 's also used by YouTube and most other video sites ) , because evryone already had Flash installed , meaning that nobody would need to install anything in order to use BBC iPlayer - an important criterion .
Choosing a bitrate was more difficult : too low and the resulting video quality would be unacceptably poor ; too high ( with corresponding higher bandwidth ) and people on lower bandwidth connections would experience buffering problems - ie , pauses in playback that reduce your viewing pleasure .
I think we chose well , hitting the right spot between quality and bitrate and giving a good quality playback experience , at least when playing back within the playback " window " on the BBC iPlayer web site .
However , the full - screen experience was less than optimal .
As the majority of BBC iPlayer users watch BBC iPlayer in full - screen mode , this is clearly something that needs to be addressed .
Enter H.264 .
H.264 is a high - performance video compression technology - the new kid on the block , so to speak .
It 's actually been around for a few years , but only recently have a few things come together to make H.264 usable by us .
Compared to On2 VP6 , H.264 delivers sharper video quality at a lower data rate , but requires more CPU power to decode , particularly on older machines , and the user needs to have the latest version of Flash installed .
Back in December of last year , relatively few people had installed the Flash player needed to play H.264 content ; now almost 80 % of BBC iPlayer users have it .
More machines now have graphics cards with H.264 hardware acceleration .
Additionally , Level3 , a content distribution network ( CDN ) is now able to stream H.264 content to ISPs in the UK , and the content encoding workflows that we use ( Anystream and Telestream ) are now able to support H.264 .
Actually , when I say that our content encoding workflows are now able to support H.264 , that 's not quite correct yet .
Our compression technology suppliers are frantically working on getting the preferred MainConcept H.264 compressor into their software , something they 're hoping to complete in the next week or two .
In the meantime we 're using the QuickTime codec , which produces results that are acceptable , but not as good .
So it seems we 're really on the leading edge here .
Anyway , to cut a long story short , the good news for those looking for video quality improvements in BBC iPlayer is that , starting this week , we 're going to be encoding our content in H.264 format at 800 Kbps .
Additionally , our media player now supports hardware acceleration in full - screen mode , giving a greatly improved image at lower CPU usage than before .
Along with the change to H.264 , the soundtrack in our video programmes is changing to AAC + , another new compression technology that delivers better sound at a lower bitrate .
The bass is deeper , the treble tighter , the overall effect is a noticeably better listening experience , particularly if you listen with headphones or hook up your computer to your TV or home sound system .
However , given that we 're on the ( leading ) edge here , with our CDN network and video compression partners only now being able to support our requirements , we 're going to play it safe and introduce H.264 in two phases :
In the first phase , starting this week , we 're going to create our content in both On2 VP6 and H.264 format , and provide a button to let you choose which works best for you and your internet connection , Normal or High :
Initially , the default will continue be On2 VP6 , which will remain the choice for users on slower internet connections .
However , if your internet connection speed is 1 M bps or higher , try the " HIGH " H.264 version .
In the second phase , we 're going to add automatic bitrate detection , so that our media player software automatically chooses the right version for your computer and internet connection speed - we 'll likely introduce this auto- detection feature in September .
This will make it as easy as possible for all users to get the best quality of service possible with the equipment they have .
Initially the H.264 option will only be offered to people who have the latest version of Flash installed , and will be offered incrementally as new content rolls out through our encoding chain .
We 'll also be making a number of tweaks and enhancements over the coming weeks as our video compressor suppliers deliver more software updates , so look out for further improvements over the next few weeks .
On a different topic , the BBC iPlayer has been shortlisted for three British Technology Awards - Best Home Entertainment , Most Indispensable Technology and Best Online Technology .
The winners are determined by popular vote here .
All votes for BBC iPlayer are much appreciated :)
Anthony Rose is Head of Digital Media , BBC Future Media & Technology .
Senator Patrick Leahy is concerned about the Pentagon 's decision to designate an Army unit to Northern Command .
On October 1 , the Pentagon , for the first time ever , dedicated an Army force specifically to NorthCom , which is in charge of securing not some foreign region but the United States of America .
The unit it assigned is the 3rd Infantry , First Brigade Combat Team , which has spent three of the last five years in Iraq .
It was one of the first units to get to Baghdad , and it was active in retaking and patrolling Fallujah .
One of its specialties is counterinsurgency .
This marks a change for NorthCom , which was established on October 1 , 2002 .
Its website still says it " has few permanently assigned forces , " and that " the command is assigned forces whenever necessary to execute missions , as ordered by the President and the Secretary of Defense . "
Leahy " asked for a briefing from his staff " on this development and " wants to monitor the situation , " an aide to Leahy said .
Leahy was instrumental in getting Congress to repeal the " Insurrection Act Rider " in the 2006 defense appropriations bill .
That rider had given the President sweeping power to use military troops in ways contrary to the Insurrection Act and Posse Comitatus Act .
The rider authorized the President to have troops patrol our streets in response to disasters , epidemics , and any " condition " he might cite .
Leahy said last December that this rider " made it easier for the President to take over the Guard and to declare martial law . "
In a Senate statement on April 24 , 2007 , he cautioned against inserting the military " into domestic situations . "
As he put it : " One of the distinguishing characteristics of the United States is that we do not use the military to patrol our communities and neighborhoods . "
A few months before that , he warned that we must ensure that " the military is not used in a way that offends and endangers some of our most cherished values and liberties . "
The repeal of the rider was signed by Bush on January 28 , though Amy Goodman reports that " Bush attached a signing statement that he did not feel bound by the repeal . "
The roles the 1st Brigade Combat Team will take on at NorthCom are a bit unclear .
" They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control , " said the Army Times when it first reported on it .
These duties would be in addition to dealing with " potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack . "
Soldiers in the unit " also will learn how to use ‘ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has field , ' 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them , " the article noted .
Cloutier even bragged to the Army Times : " I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered . "
The Army Times has since issued a correction , stating that the " non-lethal crowd control package " is " intended for use on deployments to the war zone , not in the U.S. "
NorthCom 's own press release of September 30 says , " This response force will not be called upon to help with law enforcement , civil disturbance , or crowd control . "

The unit will have its regular weapons , however .
It will store other weapons in " containers , " and will have access to tanks , as Amy Goodman has reported and the Pentagon has confirmed .
The Army is taking a strong interest in this deployment .
Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey personally observed the combat team 's training exercise , entitled " Vibrant Response , " which was held at Fort Stewart , Georgia , last month .
According to NorthCom 's public affairs department , Gen . Casey " pointed out that being part of the new force requires a shift in thinking for soldiers who are accustomed to taking charge . "
One soldier in the exercise said he learned that the troops should " preposition containers and equipment . "
NorthCom 's website , in a section on frequently asked questions about Joint Task Forces - Civil Support , cites " DoD Directive 3025.1 " as laying out the criteria for how the Pentagon will respond in domestic situations .
That directive talks about " military support in dealing with the actual or anticipated consequences of civil emergencies . "
Those civil emergencies could be " arising during peace , war , or transition to war . "
While it states that such support " does not include military support to local law enforcement , " there is a provision in the directive for the military to take over functions of the civilian government .
Military personnel " shall not perform any function of civil government unless absolutely necessary on a temporary basis under conditions of Immediate Response .
Any commander who is directed , or undertakes , to perform such functions shall facilitate the reestablishment of civil responsibility at the earliest possible time , " the document states .
Under this " Immediate Response " exception , local military commanders can even act without prior approval from their superiors .
" Imminently serious conditions resulting from any civil emergency or attack may require immediate action by military commanders , or by responsible officials of other DoD agencies , to save lives , prevent human suffering , or mitigate great property damage , " it says .
" When such conditions exist and time does not permit prior approval from higher headquarters , local military commanders and responsible officials of other DoD Components are authorized by this Directive , subject to any supplemental direction that may be provide by their DoD Component , to take necessary action to respond to requests of civil authorities . "
The Pentagon 's decision to dedicate the First Brigade Combat Team to NorthCom has raised alarms , especially in the context of the current economic crisis .
In Bush 's National Security Presidential Directive 51 , he lays out his authority in the event of a catastrophic emergency .
In such an emergency , " the President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government " and will coordinate with state , local , and tribal governments , along with private sector owners of infrastructure .
NSPD 51 defines a catastrophic emergency as " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government function . "
Notice the use of the word " or " above .
In our current circumstances , it might be more relevant to read the definition this way : " any incident . . . that results in extraordinary levels of . . . disruption severely affecting the U.S. . . . economy . "
President Bush could declare a catastrophic emergency today .
And he'd have the 3rd Infantry , First Brigade Combat Team , well trained from its years patrolling Iraq , at his disposal here at home .
NEWSMAKER INTERVIEW :
ABOARD THE STRAIGHT TALK AIR — Sen .
John McCain on Wednesday blasted President Bush for building a mountain of debt for future generations , failing to pay for expanding Medicare and abusing executive powers , leveling his strongest criticism to date of an administration whose unpopularity may be dragging the Republican Party to the brink of a massive electoral defeat .
“ We just let things get completely out of hand , ” he said of his own party ’s rule in the past eight years .
In an interview with The Washington Times , Mr. McCain lashed out at a litany of Bush policies and issues that he said he would have handled differently as president , days after a poll showed that he began making up ground on Sen.
Barack Obama since he emphatically sought to distance himself from Mr. Bush in the final debate .
“ Spending , the conduct of the war in Iraq for years , growth in the size of government , larger than any time since the Great Society , laying a $ 10 trillion debt on future generations of America , owing $ 500 billion to China , obviously , failure to both enforce and modernize the [ financial ] regulatory agencies that were designed for the 1930s and certainly not for the 21st century , failure to address the issue of climate change seriously , ” Mr. McCain said in an interview with The Washington Times aboard his campaign plane en route from New Hampshire to Ohio .
“ Those are just some of them , ” he said with a laugh , chomping into a peanut butter sandwich as a few campaign aides in his midair office joined in the laughter .
In the interview , Mr. McCain rejected the notion that he could win on the strength of voters who wo n’t vote for a black president .
“ I reject categorically the concept that people would , any number of people would vote on the basis of race , ” he said .
He also hit Mr. Obama for breaking his pledge to take public campaign financing ; said Democratic vice - presidential nominee Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. has as much as acknowledged that Mr. Obama would make the world more dangerous ; and cautioned that while he may be down in the race , he ’s not out .
“ There is one lesson of history , and that is every time we ’ve been written off , that ’s when we ’ve had a comeback , ” he said with an emphatic chop of his hand , just after flying out of the state that propelled him to the Republican nomination .
The self - described maverick , who was counted out of the Republican race in summer 2007 , may to be doing just that .
Although he trails in the polls in at least a half - dozen pivotal states , a new Associated Press survey finds the race statistically even , with Mr. Obama at 44 percent and Mr. McCain at 43 percent .
The survey found that Mr. McCain had surged among whites and people earning less than $ 50,000 ; among rural voters — he now has an 18 - point advantage , up from four points in the previous poll — and on the issue of the economy , where he picked up nine percentage points and now trails the Democrat by just six points .
Harsher criticism
Mr. Obama has spent virtually the entire campaign linking Mr. McCain to the president , saying a McCain term would be “ four more years of George Bush ” and identifying various Republican policies with the adjective “ Bush - McCain . ”
Mr. McCain has in recent days sharpened his criticism of Mr. Bush , including adding a line from his final debate to his daily stump speech , that if Mr. Obama “ wanted to run against George Bush , he should have run four years ago . ”
But on Wednesday , Mr. McCain went further in distancing himself from the man who beat him for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination .
In addition to the long list of failures he attributed to Mr. Bush , Mr. McCain blamed the president for supporting the Medicare prescription - drug bill , saying , “ They did n’t pay for it . ”
“ They put a trillion - dollar debt on future generations of Americans , then allowed the liberals to expand it so they ’re paying my — they ’re paying for my prescription drugs .
Why should the taxpayers pay for my prescription drugs ? ” he said with exasperation .
He rejected Mr. Bush ’s use of issuing “ signing statements ” when he signs bills into law , in which the president has suggested that he would ignore elements of the bills , labeling them potentially unconstitutional .
“ I would veto the bills or say , ‘ Look , I do n’t like it but I ’ll obey the law that ’s passed by Congress and signed by the president . ’
I think the signing statements was not a correct implementation of the power of the executive .
I think it was overstepping , ” he said .
And Mr. McCain emphatically rejected Mr. Bush ’s claims of executive privilege , often used to shield the White House from scrutiny .
“ I do n’t agree with that either .
I do n’t agree with [ Vice President ]
Dick Cheney ’s allegation that he ’s part of both the legislative and the executive branch , ” he said .
Still , Mr. McCain said Mr. Bush deserves credit for expanding faith - based organizations , which he said have done “ enormously good things , domestically and overseas . ”
“ The president put into real practice compassionate conservatism when they supported and helped grow enormously a lot of these faith - based organizations , which , by the way , is now at risk because Senator Obama says they have to adhere to federal hiring practices , which would then cause them not to be able to function , ” he said .
The Republican also targeted his own party , saying they got drunk with power and lacked the resolve of President Reagan .
“ I think , frankly , the problem was , with a Republican Congress , that the president was told by the speaker and majority leaders and others , ‘ Do n’t veto these bills , we need this pork , we need this excess spending , we need to grow these bureaucracies . ’
They all sponsor certain ones .
And he did n’t do what Ronald Reagan used to and say , ‘ No ’ ; say , ‘ No .
We ’re not going to do this . ’”
When contacted about Mr. McCain ’s criticism of Mr. Bush , White House spokesman Anthony E. Warren said the administration would have no comment .
Biden crisis
Mr. McCain said Mr. Biden has now as much as acknowledged that the world will be more dangerous if Mr. Obama wins the presidential election .
“ We live in a dangerous world and Senator Obama ’s running mate has just assured Americans it ’ll be a heck of a lot more dangerous if you elect him president , ” he said .
Mr. Biden predicted at a fundraiser Sunday that if elected president , Mr. Obama would face immediate challenge from a hostile power or terrorist group intent on testing the first - term senator .
“ Mark my words .
It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy .
The world is looking .
We ’re about to elect a brilliant 47 - year - old senator president of the United States of America .
Remember , I said it standing here , if you do n’t remember anything else I said .
Watch , we ’re going to have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy . ”
Mr. Biden said Mr. Obama would have to make “ some really tough ” decisions when that occurs , adding emphatically : “ As a student of history and having served with seven presidents , I guarantee you it ’s going to happen . ”
The Democratic vice - presidential running mate said he could envision four or five scenarios , citing the Middle East and Russia .
Mr. McCain called Mr. Biden ’s comment “ the most remarkable comment I have ever seen in presidential politics . ”
“ Now he is saying — if we elected Senator Obama as president of the United States we are going to have an international crisis in these very dangerous times with the economy in the tank ? ” Mr. McCain said .
At a press conference Wednesday in Virginia , Mr. Obama noted Mr. Biden ’s words , saying that although “ Joe sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes , ” his central point was correct and a reason to back the Democratic team .
“ His core point was , the next administration is going to be tested , regardless of who it is , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ The question is : Will the next president meet that test by moving America in a new direction , by sending a clear signal to the rest of the world that we are no longer about bluster and unilateralism and ideology ? ”
In a statement , McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds responded : “ It ’s not leadership for Barack Obama to promise to be straight with Americans , only to dismiss serious statements and concern from his own running mate as simple ‘ rhetorical flourishes . ’ ”
Poll standings
As for the state of the campaign map , Mr. McCain said he sees himself five percentage points down to Mr. Obama in the race for Pennsylvania , although every poll in the past two weeks has put the deficit in double digits .
Still , he said he is making a comeback , and pointed to comments by Democratic luminaries he said encourage him .
“ Ed Rendell just said , I want President Clinton to come back because I ’m nervous , ” Mr. McCain said , referring to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania who has reportedly sent memos asking the Clintons to return to the state to campaign for Mr. Obama .
Mr. McCain said Mr. Obama ’s giant fundraising total — he announced this weekend that he raised more than $ 150 million in September — is going to produce “ a scandal . ”
His campaign and the Republican National Committee have released the names of all his donors , including those who have contributed less than $ 200 .
That ’s not required by federal election rules , and Mr. Obama has declined to release his small - dollar donors , leading to speculation that some donors are trying to circumvent fundraising laws .
“ History is a clear indicator .
Senator Obama has unleashed a force which we will pay a very heavy price for sometime in the future if not now , because it ’s very unlikely we can track down and document the contributions that he refuses to reveal , ” said Mr. McCain , who co-authored a bipartisan bill to overhaul campaign fundraising laws .
Fair campaigning
Mr. McCain took great umbrage at comments by Rep. John Lewis , Georgia Democrat , who compared the atmosphere at recent Republican rallies to those of 1960s - era segregationist George Wallace .
“ Here , a guy I admire and respect , a hero of the civil rights movement , saying , making a statement that somehow [ Governor Sarah ] Palin and I are involved in segregationist behavior , I mean , is beyond reason .
In the debate the other night , Barack Obama refused to repudiate those remarks .
I ’ve repudiated every time there ’s been some inappropriate comment by a GOP operative anywhere . ”
Mr. McCain called that failure to repudiate Mr. Lewis ’ comment “ certainly something that I do n’t think is acceptable . ”
The Republican nominee defended his campaign strategy of targeting Mr. Obama ’s ties to former domestic terrorist William Ayers but not to his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr .
Saying the issue of Mr. Wright has been “ pretty well - ventilated , ” Mr. McCain said Mr. Obama has been slippery on his links to Mr. Ayers .
He would not himself say being linked to Mr. Ayers makes Mr. Obama radical .
“ The American people can make that judgment , he said , adding , “ it ’s about full revelation of the relationship . ”
“ First [ he ] said it was a guy in the neighborhood , then he said , aw , well , that he knew him , now we find out he wrote blurbs for his book , now we find out that he served on the Woods Foundation board , which , coincidentally , gave ACORN $ 230,000 , ” he said , referring to the liberal activist group which has long - standing ties to Mr. Obama and Mr. Ayers and is accused of voter - registration fraud in several states .
“ Look , it was an extensive relationship — the American people need to know the full extent of it .
He ’s not being candid and truthful , ” the senator from Arizona said .
Asked whether he thinks he ’s getting bad press coverage ( the Project for Excellence in Journalism says in a report out today that 57 percent of the stories written about him for the past six weeks have been negative , with just 14 percent positive ) , he said , “ Ah , listen , I ’m not going to complain about the press corps . ”
But he bristles when asked about whether he is still the “ old McCain , ” the maverick who wowed the media with his 2000 presidential run , when he bucked the Republican Party establishment , drawing gushing praise from an infatuated media .
“ The interesting thing is , and it ’s happened on numerous occasions , I get ‘ How come you ’re not the old McCain ? ’ and usually it ’s an Obama talking point from somebody .
And I say , ‘ OK , tell me how I ’ve changed . ’
‘ Well , you changed on taxes . ’
I say , ‘ Look , I was for tax cuts , I was n’t for those tax cuts , ’ ” he said , explaining his opposition to Mr. Bush ’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 .
“ There is no example they can cite that I ’m any different , but they want people to believe that I ’m different .
I understand that , but it ’s just baloney .
I ’m the same guy . …
We ’re working as hard as we can .
You just put one foot ahead of the other for the next 13 days as we have for the past two years , ” he said with a laugh .

PostSharp is an AOP framework that works using byte code weaving .
That is , it re-writes your IL to add behaviors to it .
From my point of view , it is like having the cake ( interception , byte code weaving ) and eating it ( I have n't even looked at the PostSharp source code , just used the binary release ) .
My initial spike with it went very well .
Here it is :
[ Serializable ] public class Logger : OnFieldAccessAspect { public override void OnGetValue( FieldAccessEventArgs eventArgs ) { Console.WriteLine(eventArgs.InstanceTag ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( " get value " ) ; base .OnGetValue( eventArgs ) ; } public override InstanceTagRequest GetInstanceTagRequest ( ) { return new InstanceTagRequest ( " logger " , new Guid ( " 4f8a4963-82bf-4d32-8775-42cc3cd119bd " ) , false ) ; } public override void OnSetValue( FieldAccessEventArgs eventArgs ) { int i = ( int ?)eventArgs.InstanceTag ??
0 ; eventArgs.InstanceTag = i + 1 ; Console. WriteLine ( " set value " ) ; base . OnSetValue( eventArgs ) ; } }
This is an aspect that run on each field access .
It is not really useful , but it helps to show how things works .
A couple of things that are I think are insanely useful :
Aspects are instantiated at compile time , allowed time to set themselves up , then serialized to an resource in the assembly .
At runtime , they are de-serialized and ready to run .
The possibilities this give you are amazing .
InstanceTag is a way to keep additional data per aspect .
Now , let us assume that I want to add the aspect to this code :
[ Logger ] public class Customer { public string Name { get ; set ; } }
Note , there is no field .
( Well , there is , it is generated by the compiler ) .
Now we compile and run the PostSharp post compile step .
With that , we can now investigate what is going on .
As you can see , we are deserializing the attribute and storing it in a field that we can now access .
Let us check the Customer implementation now :
We have the logger field , which is used for something , but we also have the ~get ~ < Name>k__Backingfield and ~set~< Name>k__Backing
Field .
< Name>k__Backing
Field ( and I would love to hear the story behind that ) is the compiler generated field that was created for us .
The ~ get ~ ... and ~ set~ are generated by PostSharp .
Before we look at them , we will look at the implementation of Name .
Where it used to call the field directly , now it is doing this via a method call .
And now we can look at those method calls .
There is a lot going on here .
We create a new field access event arg , call the aspect method , and return the value .
Note that the state ( instance tag ) is stored in the object as well , for each field access .
It looks very well done .

President Mikhail Saakashvili has denied that Georgia 's armed forces committed war crimes during their attack on South Ossetia in August .
Evidence obtained by the BBC in the breakaway region suggests Georgia used indiscriminate force , and may have targeted civilians .
Witnesses said tanks had fired on an apartment block , and civilians were shot at as they fled the fighting .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband has raised the issue with Tbilisi .
South Ossetia and another region , Abkhazia , broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s , in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Georgia 's attempt to re-conquer South Ossetia triggered a Russian invasion and the most serious crisis in relations between the Kremlin and the West since the Cold War .
Witness claims
The BBC recently undertook the first unrestricted visit to South Ossetia by a foreign news organisation since the conflict .
Marina Kochieva , a doctor in the regional capital Tskhinvali's main hospital , told our reporters that she and three relatives were targeted by a Georgian tank as they were trying to escape by car from the town on the night of 9 August .
There were certainly war crimes committed , certainly not by us
Mikhail Saakashvili
The claims against Georgia
She said the tank fired on her car and two other vehicles , leading them to crash into a ditch .
The firing continued as she and her companions lay on the ground , she added .
Georgy Tadtayev , a 21 - year - old dental student , was one of the Ossetian civilians killed during the fighting .
His mother , Taya Sitnik , 45 , told the BBC he bled to death in her arms on the morning of 9 August after a fragment from a Georgian tank shell hit him in the throat as they were both sheltering from artillery fire in the basement of her block of flats .
Mrs Sitnik said she subsequently saw the tank positioned a few metres from the building , firing shells into every floor .
Extensive damage to the five - storey block appeared consistent with her version of events .
Mr Saakashvili said : " We strongly deny ... accusation of war crimes - but of course , we are very open for any kind of comments , we are very open for any kind of investigation .
There is a high level of anger towards Georgians in South Ossetia " We called indeed for international investigation into [ the ] conduct of this war , into conditions leading to this war , into circumstances leading to this invasion . "
He added : " Those areas which were under Georgian control - and they were not Georgian villages , they were basically villages mostly predominantly populated by ethnic Ossetians but they were affiliated with the Georgian government - were 100 % destroyed .
" So , you know , there were certainly war crimes committed , certainly not by us . "
' Without favour ' Mr Miliband - normally a strong supporter of Georgia - told the BBC : " I think the Georgian action was reckless , I think the Russian response was disproportionate and wrong .
" And that is the series of events that have landed us where we are .
" On my visit to Tbilisi of course I raised at the highest level in Georgia , the questions that have been asked and raised about war crimes and other military actions by the Georgian authorities .
" We have acted in this without fear , without favour . "
The BBC visit also confirmed the systematic destruction of villages inside South Ossetia that were inhabited by ethnic Georgians .
Some homes appeared to have been not just burned by Ossetians , but also bulldozed by the territory 's Russian - backed authorities .

It does n't take a genius to figure out that the United States ' financial system – indeed , global finance – is in a mess .
And now , with the US House of Representatives having rejected the Bush administration 's proposed $ 700 bn bail - out plan , it is also obvious that there is no consensus on how to fix it .
The problems in the US economy and financial system have been apparent for years .
But that did n't prevent America 's leaders from turning to the same people who helped create the mess , who did n't see the problems until they brought us to the brink of another Great Depression , and who have been veering from one bail - out to another , to rescue us .
As global markets plummet , the rescue plan will almost certainly be put to another vote in Congress .
They may rescue Wall Street , but what about the economy ?
What about taxpayers , already beleaguered by unprecedented deficits , and with bills still to pay for decaying infrastructure and two wars ?
In such circumstances , can any bail - out plan work ?
To be sure , the rescue plan that was just defeated was far better than what the Bush administration originally proposed .
But its basic approach remained critically flawed .
First , it relied – once again – on trickle - down economics : somehow , throwing enough money at Wall Street would trickle down to Main Street , helping ordinary workers and homeowners .
Trickle - down economics almost never works , and it is no more likely to work this time .
Moreover , the plan assumed that the fundamental problem was one of confidence .
That is no doubt part of the problem ; but the underlying problem is that financial markets made some very bad loans .
There was a housing bubble , and loans were made on the basis of inflated prices .
That bubble has burst .
House prices probably will fall further , so there will be more foreclosures , and no amount of talking up the market is going to change that .
The bad loans , in turn , have created massive holes in banks ' balance sheets , which have to be repaired .
Any government bail - out that pays fair value for these assets will do nothing to repair that hole .
On the contrary , it would be like providing massive blood transfusions to a patient suffering from vast internal hemorrhaging .
Even if a bail - out plan were implemented quickly – which appears increasingly unlikely – there would be some credit contraction .
The US economy has been sustained by a consumption boom fueled by excessive borrowing , and that will be curtailed .
States and localities are cutting back expenditures .
Household balance sheets are weaker .
An economic slowdown will exacerbate all our financial problems .
We could do more with less money .
The holes in financial institutions ' balance sheets should be filled in a transparent way .
The Scandinavian countries showed the way two decades ago .
Warren Buffet showed another way , in providing equity to Goldman Sachs .
By issuing preferred shares with warrants ( options ) , one reduces the public 's downside risk and ensures that they participate in some of the upside potential .
This approach is not only proven , but it also provides both the incentives and wherewithal needed for lending to resume .
It avoids the hopeless task of trying to value millions of complex mortgages and the even more complex financial products in which they are embedded , and it deals with the " lemons " problem – the government gets stuck with the worst or most overpriced assets .
Finally , it can be done far more quickly .
At the same time , several steps can be taken to reduce foreclosures .
First , housing can be made more affordable for poor and middle - income Americans by converting the mortgage deduction into a cashable tax credit .
The government effectively pays 50 % of the mortgage interest and real estate taxes for upper - income Americans , yet does nothing for the poor .
Second , bankruptcy reform is needed to allow homeowners to write down the value of their homes and stay in their houses .
Third , government could assume part of a mortgage , taking advantage of its lower borrowing costs .
By contrast , US treasury secretary Henry Paulson 's approach is another example of the kind of shell games that got America into its mess .
Investment banks and credit rating agencies believed in financial alchemy – the notion that significant value could be created by slicing and dicing securities .
The new view is that real value can be created by un-slicing and un-dicing – pulling these assets out of the financial system and turning them over to the government .
But that requires overpaying for the assets , benefiting only the banks .
In the end , there is a high likelihood that if such a plan is ultimately adopted , American taxpayers will be left on the hook .
In environmental economics , there is a basic principle , called " the polluter pays principle . "
It is a matter of both equity and efficiency .
Wall Street has polluted the economy with toxic mortgages .
It should pay for the cleanup .
There is a growing consensus among economists that any bail - out based on Paulson 's plan wo n't work .
If so , the huge increase in the national debt and the realisation that even $ 700bn is not enough to rescue the US economy will erode confidence further and aggravate its weakness .
But it is impossible for politicians to do nothing in such a crisis .
So we may have to pray that an agreement crafted with the toxic mix of special interests , misguided economics , and right - wing ideologies that produced the crisis can somehow produce a rescue plan that works – or whose failure does n't do too much damage .
Getting things right – including a new regulatory system that reduces the likelihood that such a crisis will recur – is one of the many tasks to be left to the next administration .
In cooperation with Project Syndicate , 2008 .
In a move suggesting how the credit crisis could disrupt American higher education , Wachovia Bank has limited the access of nearly 1,000 colleges to $ 9.3 billion the bank has held for them in a short - term investment fund , raising worries on some campuses about meeting payrolls and other obligations .
Wachovia , the North Carolina bank that agreed this week to sell its banking operations to Citigroup , has held the money in its role as trustee for a fund used by colleges and universities and managed by a Connecticut nonprofit , Commonfund .
On Monday , Wachovia announced that it would resign its role as trustee of the fund , and would limit access to the fund to 10 percent of each college ’s account value .
On Tuesday , Commonfund said that by selling some government bonds and other assets held in the fund , it had succeeded in raising its liquidity to 26 percent .
Still , Wachovia ’s announcement sent shock waves through higher education , sending hundreds of college presidents rushing to check their financial vulnerability on every front .
Yesterday we put out a call for the viciously panned script of I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell , the upcoming film written by I - totally - fucked - that - chick blogger Tucker Max .
We immediately received about a dozen copies of the script , which is apparently being forwarded around Hollywood like a list of bad lawyer jokes .
I also could have said " like herpes , " and I could also follow up by joking that the script is about as funny as a bad lawyer with herpes , haha .
Friends , it opens with Tucker Max fucking a deaf girl and screaming " DON'T TAZE ME , BRO !. "
It is that bad .

War Heroes ?

John McCain ran in 2008 as a war hero and now he poses as an expert on military affairs .
There are just a few problems with that .
McCain is despised by fellow Vets , especially fellow POWs , not only for cooperating with the enemy , but also for blocking every effort to make sure all American POWs were returned after the war .
Interestingly enough , the other veteran who obstructed truth on the matter was JOHN KERRY , the fake candidate and Skull and Bones member who ran against Bush in 2004 and stepped aside in spite of massive and obvious electoral fraud in Ohio .
Kerry 's family got a massive pay off from the Communist Vietnam government for his " service " on their behalf helping kill off POW investigations .
New Mexicans for Science and Reason CHEMTRAIL FEARS THRIVE ON INTERNET Send Chemtrail Comments to : David E. Thomas ( Help fight SPAM !
Please replace the AT with an @ ) WW2 VIDEO SHOWS " ON - AGAIN / OFF - AGAIN CHEMTRAILS " ( a.k.a. " contrails " ) in 1944 !!
Memphis Belle WWII Bomber Contrails - 1944 N.M. Physicist M. K. Johnson 's Report on Chemtrails - UPDATED ! ( January 2010 )
Perhaps you 've come across the dire warnings on the Internet : " HIGH ALERT !!
REPORTS ARE COMING FROM EVERYWHERE PEOPLE !!
RED ALERT ** HOSPITALS JAMMED AS BANNED PESTICIDE IS SPRAYED FROM THE SKIES ( formerly on http://home.earthlink.net/~ravenlmr/index2.htm.)
What 's all this about , you ask ?
It 's called " Chemtrails , " a purported government program to deliver poisonous or mind - controlling substances to the general population by spraying from airplanes .
Some Typical Chemtrails websites :
http://www.rense.com/politics6/chemdatapage.html
http://www.carnicom.com/contrails.htm
( Lots of pictures , letters from New Mexico )
BEFORE you e-mail me to flaunt the Nov. 9th " Chemtrails " report by Louisiana station KSLA ( on Youtube here ) , please check out this analysis .
At just over 50 seconds into the segment , Investigative Reporter Jeff Ferrell says " KSLA News 12 had the sample tested at a lab .
The results : A high level of barium , 6.8 parts per million , ( ppm ) .
That 's more than three times the toxic level set by the Environmental Protection Agency , or EPA . "
The Problem ?
The actual video clearly shows 68.8 ug /L ( stands for MICROGRAMS PER LITER ) , eg 68.8 ppb ( STANDS FOR PARTS PER BILLION ) .
A Liter of water is 1000 grams , or 1 kilogram .
Just as 1+1=2 , so does a millionth of a gram out of one thousand grams correspond to one part per Billion .
And so does 68.8 millionths of a gram per liter correspond to 68.8 parts per BILLION .
The reporter was not off by a factor of 1000 , but only 100 instead , but only because he read the " 68.8 " as " 6.8 " .
So Ferrell only over - estimated the amount of barium in the test report by a factor of 100 ( or , 10,000 PER CENT if you prefer percentages ) .
From the EPA / CDC site : " The EPA has set a limit of 2.0 milligrams of barium per liter of drinking water ( 2.0 mg / L ) , which is the same as 2 ppm [ parts per million ] . "
The reporter got it wrong .
The test result was not " three times the toxic level set by the Environmental Protection Agency , or EPA . " ( i.e. 300 % ) .
It was actually less than 3.5 % .
It was around 30 times LESS THAN THE EPA'S TOXIC LIMIT .
The Astronomy Picture of the Day ( APOD ) site for October 13 , 2004 shows a striking picture of contrails over the southeastern United States .
The site is full of incredibly inflammatory statements , such as " The exhaust of an airplane engine can create a contrail by saturating the surrounding air with extra moisture . "
( Actually , the comments are seen as inflanmmatory only by believers in " chemtrails , " supposed government spraying of biotoxins and death via seemingly innocent " contrails . " )
Source : http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap041013.html
The APOD page links to general NASA sites on contrails , such as this one :
http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/GLOBE/contrails/
Our local " chemtrails " enthusiast , Cliff Carnicom of Santa Fe , has announced on his website that " NASA has recently adopted a public strategy of abusing its position of national and public service by attempting to indoctrinate the citizens , including children , that the aerosol operations are a " normal " and expected consequence of daily life and aircraft .
Nothing can be further from the truth , as is also apparent from an honest and thorough examination of the issue . ... "
Source : http://carnicom.com/nasa1.htm
Contrails ( " CHEMTRAILS " ) are NORMAL .
The International Space Station crew sees them all the time , except when airplanes are not flying , as happened in the days after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
Here is the report from www.space.com from September 14th , 2001 :
" Three days after suicide airplane hijackers toppled the World Trade Center in New York and slammed into the Pentagon in Washington , D.C. , the station crew noted an obvious absence of airborne jetliners from their perch 240 miles ( 384 kilometers ) above Earth . '
Ill tell you one thing that s really strange : Normally when we go over the U.S. , the sky is like a spider web of contrails , ' U.S. astronaut and outpost commander Frank Culbertson told flight controllers at NASAs Mission Control Center in Houston .
' And now the sky is just about completely empty .
There are no contrails in the sky , ' he added . '
It s very , very weird .'
' I hadnt thought of that perspective , ' fellow astronaut Cady Coleman replied . "

Old - timer Debunks Chemtrails !
John Day , meteorologist ( Photo credit : Willamette Week )
Chris Lydgate of the Willamette Week ( Oregon ) wrote a detailed report on Sept. 26th , 2001 on the " CHEM TRAIL " phenomenon .
Lydgate wrote about Portland observers of the " Chemtrails , " and even New Mexico 's own Cliff Carnicom ( see http://www.nmsr.org/chemtrls.htm).
He also included comments from an old - timer meteorologist who puts the kibosh on the " Trails . "
He wrote " If there is a giant conspiracy to spray chemicals from the sky , chances are good that Professor John Day is not a part of it .
The author of six books on meteorology , Day is a world - renowned expert on clouds , a professor emeritus at Linfield College and a regular contributor to the McMinnville News - Register , ...
When he hears the word ' chemtrail , ' however , Day 's frosty mustache droops , and his sky - blue eyes darken .
' I do n't happen to warm up to that phenomenon , ' he sighs .
Despite his reluctance to be drawn into the controversy , Day graciously agreed to examine photographs of chemtrails to see if he spotted anything unusual .
' This is a perfectly normal situation with cirrocumulus cloud and a single spreading contrail , ' he declared after inspecting one photo for a full minute .
Then he flipped to the next .
' Nothing weird about that .

Contrail formation , Day explained , depends on the relative humidity of the atmosphere -- he ratio of what is to what could be at a particular temperature .
When relative humidity is low , contrails dissipate within seconds .
But when relative humidity is high , especially at the subzero temperatures of the upper atmosphere , the addition of even a tiny amount of water vapor acts as a catalyst .
Under these conditions , contrails may linger and spread to cover the whole sky .
... At length , Day extracted from his bookshelf a well - thumbed edition of Peterson 's Field Guide to Clouds and Weather , which he co-authored in 1991 ( a good 10 years before chemtrails became widely discussed ) , turned to the section on contrails , and pointed to a photograph of a thick , white plume - - a plume that looked for all the world like a chemtrail ...

USA Today takes on CHEMTRAILS !
If you see a contrail from a plane , does that mean that the government is again spraying deadly chemicals or biological agents on its citizens ?
A 7 March 2001 article by Traci Watson in USA Today describes the " chemtrail " phenomenon .
She quotes Patrick Minnis of NASA 's Langley Research Center in Hampton , VA , who said " If you try to pin these people down and refute things , it 's , ' Well , you 're just part of the conspiracy ...
Logic is not exactly a real selling point for most of them . ''
Watson also writes that " The cloud - forming contrails that conspiracy theorists find so ominous are ' perfectly natural , ' Minnis says .
The odd grid and parallel - line patterns are easily explained as contrails blown together by the wind , scientists say . "

9 . Seal chips without a clip .
Few things feel as disappointingly avoidable as finding a bag of tortilla , potato , or kettle chips completely crisp - less the morning after a party or pig - out session .
This handy clip , however , shows how you can put an air - tight seal on your crunchy comestibles without having to get up for a clip ( even the super - useful binder kind ) .

Before hunting down and shelling out for cell batteries for your watch or micro-gadgets , consider the clip above , which shows how you can get eight watch batteries from a 12 - volt ( AA ) battery .
It seems unreal , until you crack open a 9 - volt battery and find six AAAs inside .
Sadly , not every battery is full of magical cheaper - than - store - bought goodness , as we learned the hard way .
But for those batteries that do give up the free voltage , it 's a neat hack .

6 . Open a beer bottle with paper .
Sad but true :
You will almost always win more accolades , and whispers of " brilliant " or " genius , " by opening a beer with the flimsiest of materials than by changing a friend 's flat .
Having said that , popping a beer bottle with paper is really cool , and saves you or your fellow imbibers the time and embarrassment of hunting down an opener .
Collegiate wisdom , however , warns that trying too many times on the same bottle can have eruptive side - effects , so practicing over a sink might be a good idea .

It 's not a bad idea to have a last - resort plan for getting into your house or car when you have an I - can 't - believe - I - did - that emergency , but forget the 10 - piece kits and CIA training .
A " bump key " is the layman 's way of picking a lock — something that , unfortunately , a lot of less - scrupulous types have known for some time .
This video shows you everything you need to know , but keep in mind it 's illegal in most states to be found in possession of such a tool , so do n't plan on carrying this thing around in your cargo pockets .

2. Boost your Wi -Fi signal with tinfoil parabolas .
Extend and strengthen your Wi-Fi router 's signal by fashioning a couple of tinfoil parabolas and putting them on your antenna .
The experts at DL.TV demonstrate how to make a couple of " Windsurfers " for your home router so the signal makes it all the way to the basement .
The guys in the vid said the parabola doubled his signal strength ; our own Kyle said he only saw about a 5 % gain — either way , worth it for the cost of glue , paper , and tinfoil .
Here 's the parabolic template for printing out your own " Windsurfer . "

While there will be no capping and trading in President Bush ’s government , 10 northeast states are taking emissions into their own hands .
On Thursday , the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , bypassing the federal government , started its permit auction , creating the first mandatory cap - and - trade program in the United States .
The initiative involves Maine , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Delaware , Maryland , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Rhode Island and Vermont .
The auction gave 12.5 million permits for CO2 emitters , with each worth one ton of carbon dioxide .
The group will then offer 188 million permits a year for three years , according to a Reuters article .
The group hopes for emissions to be stabilized from the region ’s power companies by 2012 , and then they ’ll lower the emissions cap by 10 percent of current levels by 2019 .
The intiative is setting modest goals to begin with – probably a good idea , considering it ’s not caught on so much at the federal level yet .
Best to start low and meet those goals than to show the feds that a cap - and - trade program does n’t work .
There is still question about what how the states will spend their auction money .
The official doctrine says they ’ll spend it on alternative energy – but who knows yet if that ’ll actually come to play and how exactly they ’ll do that .
I think the states should use that money as subsidies to residents and local businesses who use , say , expensive solar panels in their homes and other green technology .
Hopefully the money wo n’t just go into budgets or big corporations .
And hopefully this cap - and - trade trend will expand across the country .
Other regions are carefully watching the results of this auction and the next in December – maybe our new president will start paying attention , too .
But it may take awhile .
RGGI has been on discussion tables since 2003 … and finally five years later we ’re seeing this first auction .
It took until 2007 for Massachusetts , Rhode Island and Maryland to definitively sign onto the intiative .
And who knows if capping and trading is even the right way to go .
But it ’s a step in the right direction .

It ’s going to be a powerful integrated media solution .
Despite thorough research , we ’ve yet to ascertain the problem that this is the solution to .
Unless , you know , you ’re one of those spend - happy numpties that has to buy the latest ‘ thing ’ and then spend hours defending and justifying the purchase you know to be a waste of cash .
It ’s a unique way for advertisers to connect with gamers .
This means it ’s another opportunity for cash - hungry capitalist pigs to sell you the idea that your life will be for nothing unless you buy Pro Resistance Storm 4 .

We 'd like to introduce Relevance 's latest open source project , Vasco .
Vasco is a route explorer for Rails projects .
As we develop applications with explicit requirements for RESTful APIs for integration purposes , our clients need some way to visually accept that the stories are complete .
It is also helpful for the developers to have a way to manually interact with the APIs as a second avenue for testing , verifying whether our routes end in gold and silk , or pain and death .
So , we wrote Vasco .
Vasco is a simple plugin , with a single rake task .
Once installed and initialized , it creates a web interface that knows about all your RESTful routes and the models at the far end of them .
It lets you play with the GETs , POSTs , PUTs and DELETEs and see the responses .
If your APIs are protected by BASIC auth , no worries , since the plugin runs from inside your app .
And if you are lucky , it will expand your colonial footprint and lead to Empire .
To install , just run :
> script / plugin install git://github.com/relevance/vasco.git
Once installed :
> rake vasco : explore
After that , launch your app and point your browser to http://localhost:3000/vasco
( or wherever you home your dev apps ) .
You 'll be treated to a simple interface .
On the left is a list of all the controllers in the app with RESTful routes associated with them .
On the right are two boxes , one for viewing the request , one for the response .
Click any controller to expand its list of available routes .
If you click on something like , in this example , GET / ports , Vasco will send the request to your app and display the results immediately .
If you click on a route that requires user input , like PUT / ships / : id , a dialog will appear with a form you can fill in .
The :id field will be prepopulated with a known ID from the database , assuming your database had fixture or other data loaded when you ran the vasco : explore task .
You can fill in the rest of the form and either commit the request , or cancel .
After PUTting the request , the results will again be displayed .
When a call only returns a status code , the results will be displayed as a simple success or failure message .
We 've got docs on the GitHub wiki , as well as a list of upcoming features .
We hope you enjoy Señor de Gama .
From Colombia , the indigenous groups in the Cauca department have made an international SOS to call attention on their plight .
On their website , cric -colombia.org they explain how they have been protesting the human rights abuses they have been victim of , represented by the murder of one of their community leaders by hit men and the death threats on other regional and community leaders and spokespeople .
They have requested a public audience with the Government Officials , and have been protesting since October 12 , demanding the protection of their human rights and making the government live up to the promises of the signed treaties of the past .
However , it is said that armed government forces , have shot live ammunition at the protesters , leaving 2 dead and more than 60 indigenous members injured .
On this blog post on the indigenous community site they show pictures of the protest and the injuries some have sustained as well as the list of those injured up to October 14th .
On October 15th , the armed forces opened fire once again on the protesters , killing one and leaving 39 injured .
They have also blocked the roads and ambulances can't get in to help those who are hurt and needing assistance .
( Links in Spanish unless otherwise noted )
They write :
la fuerza publica entró disparando con armas de largo alcance y ya hay 3 heridos mas de gravedad .
la fuerza militar entro ya al territorio de dialogo y negociación .
Se solicita de manera urgente que organismos internacionales frenen esta violencia .
tambien a los pueblos inigenas que refuercen el personal que esta siendo atacado .
The armed forces came in shooting with long range weapons and there are already 3 other persons seriously injured .
The military forces have barged into the territory of dialogue and negotiation .
We urgently request international organizations to stop this violence .
Also for the indigenous communities to get more people to back those who have been attacked .
The indigenous community has been sending emails and posting on their website [ es ] updates on the situation .
The following video was posted last week by user nasacin , including cellphone and video camera images from the manifestations , clips showing shot indigenous community members , a soldier speaking about the differences between the Mob Control ESMAD and the armed forces , stating that the armed forces are to keep the peace , and the ESMAD is the one in charge of defusing violent situations .
However , when asked who it is that is shooting with rifles , the soldier does n't answer .
Blogger Alejandro Peláez last week wrote of how foreign media is reporting on the indigenous protests , but local media had n't published anything at all :
Las noticias son hechos , y para escribir sobre hechos toca salir del escritorio , entrevistar personas , buscar en archivos , viajar al monte .
Las masacres , por ejemplo , son hechos .
Pero en este país los medios cubren este tipo de hechos con diez años de diferencia y ahí ya no son noticia , son historia .
En este momento , como lo cuenta AdamIsacson ( sí , un gringo sentando en Washington D.C. ) , hay serios disturbios en el Cauca y El Tiempo ni lo anota .
Tal vez presenten una crónica completísima dentro de diez años .
Chévere .
News is facts , and to write about facts you have to get out from behind your desk , interview people , search the archives , head out into the mountains .
Massacres , for example , are facts .
But in this country the media covers this type of events with a 10 year difference when they are no longer a news story , but history .
In this moment , as Adam Isacson ( yes , a gringo sitting in Washington D.C. ) reports , there are serious disturbances in the Cauca , and El Tiempo does n't even have a note on it .
Maybe they 'll present a full chronicle of it in ten years .
Great .
In Gacetilla Colombiana , a Digg style application for Colombian news , posters have been linking foreign news as an alternative for those who are under the “ media blackout ” on this event , in particular to a major foreign news chain 's video [ en ] where a citizen media recording shows what could be an armed but hooded person dressed in green with a rifle going moving through the mob squad and shooting at the indigenous protesters as the members of the mob squad move to let him pass .
In the blog “ Lets Change the World ” , Decio Machado posts the email chain sent out by the Indigenous groups , the means through which most Colombians have found out about the crisis .
The Selvas.org blog also posts updates on the situation , how indigenous groups are all marching towards a main city called Cali and blocking the Panamerican Highway and other roads with 10 000 people , including cane pickers , farmers women and children .
In the national blogging award winner Tienen Huevo blog , they write outraged at the fact that at the same time there is an ethnocide going on in the streets of Colombia , trying to reach Cali , while a fashion and makeup expo is taking place , with people more concentrated on clothing and fashion shows than the indigenous situation .
The government has responded to the accusations of opening fire on the indigenous protesters by saying that they have orders not to shoot , so it must 've been an inside job , someone infiltrated from the indigenous communities among the police in order to cause panic and bad feeling .
Bacteria Opina blog has a caricature of the situation where two indigenous protesters comment that in spite of marching with “ indigenous malice ” , a phrase used to determine the ability to make do with whatever is doled out their way , the government is accusing them of being an “ indigenous milicia ” .
The government has issued statements saying that these indigenous protests are infiltrated by guerrillas and are terrorist activities , statements the indigenous communities refute absolutely on their blog .
These other videos online on YouTube show the indigenous community 's past struggles , this is the first of the multipart series :
Federico Ruiz posts a play - by - play ping - pong match style summary of events up until Saturday :
los indígenas decretan un paro , el gobierno lo declara ilegal , los indígenas se toman la panamericana , el gobierno manda a una fuerza especial antimotines de la policía para que desbloqueen las carreteras , más indígenas se suman a las movilizaciones , el procurador de la nación dice que va a los diálogos , el presidente dice que está muy ocupado para ir a resolver el problema , los de la policía intentan desbloquear la carretera a las malas , los indígenas dicen que no se van porque les tienen que arreglar sus problemas y cumplirles los compromisos que les habían hecho hace como 15 años y que están en ese link que es una “ carta abierta al presidente ” , entre tanto en las protestas matan a un indígena y hieren como a 10 según las informaciones de El Tiempo , pero que en realidad no son 10 sino 90 según lo dicen los indígenas , y los de la policía dicen que en la manifestación o en el paro hay infiltrados de la guerrilla , los indígenas dicen que no , y justo luego los indígenas descubren que si hay un infiltrado pero que justamente es policía y que tenía unos panfletos de las farc y unas armas para encochinar a los indígenas , y por si fuera poco , justo llega el defensor regional del pueblo , o sea un representante del gobierno , y dice que “ la Fuerza Pública se ha excedido en el uso de las armas de fuego ” .
The indigenous groups decree a strike , the government declares it is illegal , the indians take the panamerican , the government sends a a special force of riot police to unblock the highways , more indians join the marches , the nation 's procurer states they are going to dialogue about this , the president says he is too busy to go solve the problem , the police tries to unblock the road the “ bad ” way , the indians say they are not leaving because the government has to keep their promise to solve their issues as stated in a 15 year old treaty , that there is an open letter to the president , meanwhile in the protest an aboriginal is killed and 10 are injured according to El Tiempo [ ed note .
national newspaper ] , but really they are n't 10 but 90 according to the indigenous organizations , the police state that in the march and strike there are people infiltrated from the guerrilla , the indigenous people say there are n't , and just then the indians discober that there IS someone infiltrated , but that he is from the police force and had some FARC ( Colombian Armed Forces ) pamphlets and weapons to incriminate the natives , and if it were n't enough , the regional defender for the people , a government representative , comes and says that the “ Armed Forces have exceeded themselves in the use of fire weapons ” .
EDITED to add :
The organization who sent in the recording of the hooded shooter among the mob squad team have uploaded it online with other images of the protests .
The images of the shooter amongst the mob squad , shooting at protesters starts at 1:44 .
They also add images of President Uribe calling military leaders to ask about the murders of the protesters , to which the military replied it was a shrapnel wounds from a pipe bomb and was n't a bullet injury .
The indigenous people are also shown with segments of a handmade grenade full of metal pieces and ball bearings they claim the armed forces are using against them .
Authenticating Users with OpenID and the Zend Framework
It goes without saying that the web is the single greatest communications medium ever devised .
Bigger than the local newspaper .
Bigger than TV .
Bigger than radio .
Heck , it 's bigger than all three rolled into one , and one day each will be completely subsumed by this infinitely scalable and flexible new medium .
Perhaps the primary reason we 've seen such tremendous growth is the low barrier of entry .
Armed with little more than a text editor , graphics software , and a hosting account , even novice developers can create impressive websites in a relatively short period of time .
This low barrier of entry has proved to be a bit of a double - edged sword .
Because anyone , no matter their skill level , can build a website , many users have experienced a bit of the digital Wild West over the past 15 years , coming in the form of online robberies in the form of data theft , website hijackings , and even cyberbullying .
There is , however , another significant side effect of the these heady growth stages , one which all of us experience on a daily basis , and one which I call the " passport effect . "
The passport effect is the outgrowth of countless websites instituting their own authentication procedures , thereby requiring you to supply custom credentials to enter each website 's territory .
Some websites require you to supply an e-mail address ; others would like you to come up with a contrived username .
Some desire passwords consisting of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters , while others do not allow special characters .
Some allow you to recover your password simply by clicking on a link sent to your email address ; others will do so only after you answer a host of questions about your first pet and favorite color .
All of this contributes to a chaotic online environment in which users are constantly shuffling through their piles of " passports , " regularly losing them , and generally becoming rather irritated over the whole process .
In this tutorial , I 'll show you how to take advantage of a powerful open user identification service known as OpenID , and show you how to incorporate OpenID authentication and identification features into your Zend Framework - powered website .
Even if you have n't started taking advantage of a web framework such as Zend's , this tutorial will serve two important purposes , demonstrating not only the allure of OpenID , but also how a framework such as the Zend Framework can greatly reduce development time .
Introducing OpenID
As mentioned , OpenID is a user identification service .
More formally , it is an open source service that gives users control over their login information , rather than forcing them to repeatedly reenter and organize this information as they join new online services .
Because the user manages his own login information ( including data like the login password , name , and zip code ) , and uses that information to not only login to an OpenID - enabled website , but also to automatically populate profile fields that you 've opted to share .
What 's more , is because OpenID accounts are identified by a URL , and subject to browser state , you do n't have to be bothered with repeatedly entering a username and password as you move from one OpenID - enabled website to the next .
Although not even four years old , OpenID is gaining quite a bit of traction among Internet heavyweights and startups alike , with Blogger , Plaxo , Yahoo ! and SourceForge all offering OpenID - powered login options .
Creating an OpenID Account
Numerous online services have already started revamping their user authentication system to simultaneously act as an OpenID provider .
Among them are AOL , Blogger , LiveJournal , Yahoo , and WordPress .
For instance , if you blog on Blogger , your OpenID is blogname .
blogspot.com , with blogname being whatever the corresponding name is for your blog .
If you do n't already happen to be using one of the aforementioned services , there are several options for creating your own OpenID .
For instance , when making my initial investigations into OpenID , I created an identity at myOpenID ( https://www.myopenid.com/), which is free and only takes a moment to do .
If you 'd rather not leave third - party providers in charge of personal information , not to mention potentially allow them to track your online movements from one OpenID - enabled website to the next , you can even become your own provider with a bit of simple configuration .
For instance , my OpenID URL is http://www.wjgilmore.com/, which also happens to serve the primary purpose of being my occasional blog .
Noted open source and open standards developer Sam Ruby penned a great tutorial which explains how to do this , which you can read here .
Integrating OpenID Into Your Zend Framework - driven Website
If you 've used the Zend Framework on even a simple project , chances are you took advantage of its Zend_Auth component , which greatly reduces the amount of coding you otherwise need to do to authenticate users and maintain authentication sessions .
Among others , you can use it in conjunction with a variety of authentication solutions , such as LDAP , a database , or text files .
But , unless you have particularly esoteric requirements , why force users to concoct yet another username and password when OpenID already serves that purpose ?
As you 'll see , integrating OpenID into your Zend Framework - driven website is surprisingly easy , leaving you with little remaining reason not to do so .
Creating the Login Form
Let 's begin with the simple task of creating the login form , shown in Figure 1 .
I incorporated the OpenID logo into the form , which they encourage you to do .
Download the OpenID logo here .
Figure 1 : The OpenID login form
Here 's the code .
For reasons of organization , I created a controller named LoginController.php , and within the / views / login / index . phtml I added the login form .
This makes it possible for the user to log in by navigating to http://www.example.com/login/.
Following the form , you 'll check for the existence of a view variable ( $ this -> success ) , and display an appropriate message based on the user 's authentication success .
Listing 1 : The login form
< form method = " post " action= " / login / " > < img src= " /images/openid-logo.gif " /> < b> Login with OpenID !</b>< br /> < input type =" text " name= " openid_id " size = " 45 " /> < input type =" submit " name = " submit " value= " Login " /> </ form > <? php if (! $ this -> success ) { ? > < p >
Sorry , we could not authenticate you .
</ p> <? php } else { ?>

In a boon to cancer treatment and regenerative medicine , scientists have discovered that a trick used by tumor cells that allows them to migrate around the body can cause normal , adult cells to revert into stem cell–like cells .
Large quantities of these reverted cells could be used to treat anything from spinal cord injury to liver damage without the risk of tissue rejection , said Robert Weinberg , a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and co-author of a study appearing in Cell .
Learning more about how cancer cells move around the body is also providing scientists with new insights that could thwart the spread of the disease .
The key to the process is a better understanding of developmental changes in the body ’s two primary cell types : epithelial cells ( those that constitute the skin and most internal organs ) and mesenchymal cells ( which make up connective tissue ) .
The key difference between the two cell categories is that epithelial cells adhere very tightly to one another , making sheetlike layers , whereas mesenchymal cells are only loosely bound and can migrate within the body .
In the developing embryo , an initial group of epithelial cells undergoes a shift called an " epithelial to mesenchymal transition " ( EMT ) to form bones , blood and cartilage as well as the heart .
Likewise , some cancerous cells can perform a temporary EMT transformation to the mobile mesenchymal form .
The conversion improves the cells ' tumor - forming ability , cutting the number of tumor cells required to form a carcinoma from one million to just 10,000 , the researchers say .
" More than 80 percent of cancer in humans occurs in epithelial cells , " says study co-author Sendurai Mani , an assistant professor of molecular pathology at the University of Texas ' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and a former postdoc in Weinberg 's lab .
Previous work in Weinberg 's lab had shown that after a tumor forms in one part of the body , some of the cancer cells undergo EMT , Mani explains .
The now - mesenchymal cells can then travel to a remote site , where they eventually convert back to their epithelial state and clump together into a secondary tumor .
Working with human breast tissue , the new study 's authors attempted to induce EMT in normal cells ; they figured they would just get fibroblasts , a type of connective tissue that is important in wound healing .
When they looked closely , however , they noted that the transformed cells had surface proteins that were common to stem cells .
Cultured in the lab , the changed cells showed an ability to differentiate into ( or become ) two discrete cells found in breast tissue .
And the transformed cells proved to be very similar to actual stem cells from both mice and humans .
" What we 're doing is inducing dedifferentiation , " Mani says .
He noted that it 's not yet clear how far these cells can go down the path to immaturity — and , with it , the ability to become any tissue in the body .
" We found , surprisingly , that EMT and stem cells could be linked ; we show that , yes , they are very closely linked . "
Mani says that the scientists may next pursue two paths :
The team can determine how to stop cancer cells from undergoing this transformation in the first place .
Second — a path they are already pursuing — they can gauge these transformed adult cells ' worth as stem cell surrogates for regenerative medicine .
As far as the promise of regenerative therapies , the team will attempt to determine just how stem cell–like these cells are by inducing EMT in epithelial cells from the mammaries of mice to see if they can grow a breast in the lab .
If they succeed , they can be reasonably confident that epithelial cells can be taken from a patient and used to regenerate damaged tissue in that same person .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Senate plans to vote on the $ 700 billion bank rescue plan Wednesday evening - two days after the House failed to pass it .
The bill adds new provisions - including raising the FDIC insurance cap to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 - and will be attached to an existing tax bill that the House also rejected Monday , according to several Democratic leadership aides .
The vote is scheduled for after sundown , in observance of Rosh Hashanah .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain , R - Ariz. , and Democratic nominee Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and his running mate Joe Biden , D - Del. , confirmed that they would be present for the vote .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , announced the plan Tuesday night .
" Senate Democrats and Republicans believe it is essential that we work quickly on this important legislation to restore confidence to our financial system and strengthen the economy , " Reid said in a statement .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the administration welcomes the " modified bill " and the scheduled vote .
Democratic sources told CNN that they expect bipartisan support in the Senate .
Tuesday afternoon , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair asked Congress to allow her agency to increase the $ 100,000 limit per account that has been in place since 1980 .
To do so would help restore confidence in the markets , she said .
Bair did not say what she thinks the new limit should be .
The revised bill contains provisions that the Senate hopes will appeal to House Republicans , who voted two - to - one against the original legislation .
The sweeteners include renewable energy tax incentives - for individuals and businesses alike - that have been on the table for several months and had a chance of passing at some point anyway .
The bill also includes relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax , without which millions of Americans would have to pay the so - called " wealth tax . "
The debate over extending AMT relief is an annual political ritual .
It enjoys bipartisan support but deficit hawks on both sides of the aisle contend the cost of providing that relief should be paid for .
Others argue it should n't be paid for because the AMT was never intended to hit the people the relief provisions would protect .
Nevertheless , lawmakers pass the measure every year or two .
The revised bailout bill also includes a " Mental Health Parity " provision , which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness at parity with physical illness .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said that House leaders are discussing ideas offered by other lawmakers about how to modify the bill defeated on Monday .
" House Democrats remain strongly committed to a comprehensive bill that stabilizes the financial markets , restores confidence , and protects taxpayers , " she said .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , was consulted on the Senate 's plans and gave his " green light , " Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said .
" We believe we 'll have a better chance to pass this bill than the one that failed [ Monday ] , " Smith added .
However , one aide in the GOP Senate leadership said swaying House Democrats to get on board with the sweetened bill will be " a fairly substantial problem . "
The plan could attract Republicans in the House while simultaneously alienating bailout supporters among the Democrats because the tax cuts in the revenue bill are n't offset by spending cuts or increased revenues .
" I am talking with my House colleagues about the Senate action and how to best proceed taking that into consideration in determining what action in the House will be most successful , " said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland .
Round 1 failed
The bailout package , a collaboration of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and leaders from both parties , was rejected by the House in a 228-205 vote Monday .
Two - thirds of Republicans and about one - third of Democrats voted against the bill .
Following the defeat , the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 777 points , its biggest one - day point decline ever .
The decline of nearly 7 % was the largest one - day percentage decline since Sept. 17 , 2001 , the first day the markets reopened after the Sept. 11 attacks .
( See correction . )
But stocks rallied Tuesday , with the Dow jumping 485 points on bets that Congress will pass a version of the government 's $ 700 billion package .
The bill , if approved , would allow the federal government to buy troubled mortgage - related investments from financial institutions , freeing them up for lending in a bid to pull the economy out of its credit freeze .
Proponents of the bill believe it would prevent the United States from sliding into a serious financial crisis , but opponents saw it as an unbearable burden to taxpayers and a rescue for Wall Street .
The Bush administration and key lawmakers had regrouped on Tuesday and vowed to push ahead .
" Unfortunately , the measure was defeated by a narrow margin , " President Bush said in a brief televised address at the White House .
" I 'm disappointed by the outcome , but I assure our citizens , and citizens around the world , that this is not the end of the legislative process . "
The House is adjourned and not scheduled to return to session until Thursday at noon .
Bush pushed hard for lawmakers to act .
" Our economy is depending on decisive action from the government , " he said .
" The sooner we address the problem , the sooner we can get back on the path of growth and job creation .
This is what elected leaders owe the American people , and I am confident that we 'll deliver . "
On Tuesday , Bush also spoke to Obama and McCain about the financial crisis , according to Fratto .
The presidential candidates " offered ideas and reaffirmed what they have said publicly - that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed , " Fratto said .
CNN 's Jessica Yellin , Deirdre Walsh and Ted Barrett contributed to this story .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the 7 % drop in the Dow on Monday was the second biggest one - day decline since Black Monday in 1987 , when the Dow dropped 22 % .

A new ABC News / Washington Post poll of Ohio released tonight , revealed that Barack Obama has taken a six point lead over John McCain in the state , 51 % - 45 % .
As with other swing states , concerns about the economy are propelling Obama to the advantage .
The economy is the central issue in the state .
Sixty one percent of Obama supporters listed the economy as their most important issue , and even more telling for McCain is that 34 % of his supporters listed the economy as their number one issue too .
Obama is also being powered by an enthusiasm gap .
While the candidates initially are even in terms of enthusiasm , 92 % of Obama supporters say they are enthusiastic , compared to 88 % of McCain supporters , the difference is in those who said that they were very enthusiastic about their candidate .
Fifty eight percent of Obama supporters are very enthusiastic about their candidate , but only 30 % of McCain supporters say that they are very enthusiastic about the Republican .
Interestingly , voters in the state might be more excited by Obama because they have heard from the campaign .
Thirty seven percent of registered voters said that they had been contacted by the Obama campaign compared to 27 % who have heard from McCain .

McCain has a bigger lead among male voters than George W. Bush did in 2004 , but the difference is with women .
Bush and Kerry split the female vote 50 /50 four years ago .
Today , Obama leads McCain , 56 % - 42 % with women .
McCain is also running five points behind Bush ’s 2004 pace with white voters , and 15 % behind Bush with black voters , who support Obama 98 % - 1 % .
McCain is only running 3 points behind the GOP 2004 pace with white men , but he is 7 points behind Bush ’s support with white women .
Obama is still being powered by voters under 30 .
In Ohio , he has a 34 point lead over McCain , 65 % - 31 % .
What is different in 2008 is that voters over 30 are tied at 48 % .
This is a group that Bush won in 2004 .
Overall , there is still potential for an extremely close race on Election Night , but McCain has to perform up to Bush levels in order to even have a chance at winning Ohio .
A more realistic projection is that the economy torpedoes McCain ’s campaign in the state , and Ohio follows Pennsylvania and Michigan into the Obama column .

From that moment on , McCain had nothing more to do with Keating .
And in the end the Senate Ethics Committee decided that McCain had done nothing seriously wrong .
He was guilty only of '' poor judgment . ''
But the Senate Ethics Committee had long before lost its moral authority , and with it , its power to absolve anyone .
Before the dust settled , a poll in The Arizona Republic would show that nearly half of all Arizona residents thought he should resign immediately or at the end of his term .
More importantly , the motives behind his behavior would always be questioned .
For example , in late 1989 McCain called Senator David Boren , an early leader on finance reform , to say that he would like to help .
His offer was accepted , but no one doubted why he had made it .
'' McCain 's only interest in a Boren bill , '' Boren 's chief aide later wrote , '' was to further distance himself from the Keating bombshell . ''
One of the traits McCain 's staff finds most maddening in their boss is his tendency to recall for journalists only his most damning moments .
Ask him about Vietnam and he 'll tell you about the time he stole a washrag from the guy in the adjoining cell .
Ask him about his first marriage and he 'll leap right to his adultery .
It was he who first mentioned Charles Keating to me .
We were sitting together in the back seat of a car on the way to a fund - raiser for another candidate .
McCain was flipping through an album of photographs taken during the Republican convention .
The album was a Who 's Who of Republican politics , and McCain seemed to be at the center of every picture .
I made some comment about how much more valuable his time had become in just the few months since we had met in South Carolina .
He fixed me with a stare .
'' One thing I learned from the Keating affair , '' he said , '' was that this could all end tomorrow .
Just like that .''
He snapped his fingers .
That is one kind of explanation of why he is so insistent on pressing his reform agenda : if he does n't get it done now , he may never have another chance .
But he quickly went on to saying something else , something demonstrating another motive .
'' You know , '' he said , ''my honor and integrity were at stake in Vietnam when the Vietnamese offered me freedom .
I was very tempted to take it .
But when I did n't , it was over -- at least when the beatings stopped it was over .
In the Keating scandal , my honor and integrity were at stake again : I was accused of betraying my oath of office .
I 've never been able to explain very clearly how I felt .
How painful it was .
And , by the way , I did wrong .
I should n't have attended that meeting .
But I do n't think I 'll ever be absolved .
I 'll always be known as one of the Keating Five . ''
The Realist
We tend to assume that the trait that most clearly defines a politician is his party affiliation rather than , say , his temperament or life experience .
But it is hard to imagine a man more different in this respect from John McCain than Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , his fellow Republican Senator .
McConnell has sought and gained precisely those positions that give him the power to block McCain 's reform agenda .
As chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee , for instance , he successfully stymied the investigation of Bob Packwood .
Twice he tried and failed to win the chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , which controls the tens of millions of dollars the party spends on their own .
Last year he finally won the post , which gives him control over the money his colleagues need for re-election .
In a meeting with the Republican leadership earlier this year , called to discuss the McCain - Feingold bill , McConnell reportedly said , '' if we stop this thing , we can control the institution for the next 20 years . ''
It 's one thing for a Senator to work behind closed doors to preserve his job and perks even when there is an overwhelming public objection to his doing so .
It 's quite another for a Senator to summon the nerve to go to the Senate floor and defend the role of big money in politics .
But that is what McConnell has done .
One morning in March , McConnell staged what must rank among the more audacious and brave news conferences ever held .
He gathered together representatives of a dozen special interest groups that had banded together to fight campaign finance reform : the National Rifle Association , the Christian Coalition , the National Association of Broadcasters , the National Association of Realtors , the American Civil Liberties Union .
( The list is strikingly similar to the list of names John Glenn has submitted for subpoenas in the campaign finance probe soon to be conducted by the Government Affairs Committee . )
Perhaps 60 reporters found their seats as McConnell moved to a bank of microphones .
There is something old - fashioned about his appearance .
A high pink tints his soft fleshy cheeks and his lips are pursed in a way that suggests perpetual disapproval .
Beside him was a placard bearing the words of the House minority leader , Richard Gephardt , and his disapproval 's immediate source :
What we have is two important values in direct conflict : freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy .
You can't have both .
The text served as the keynote for McConnell 's address , in which he came down firmly on the side of free speech .
His approach was to steamroller his audience with his superior knowledge of the relevant Supreme Court decision , Buckley v. Valeo , in 1976 .
'' How many of you have actually read the Buckley case ? '' he asked .
Two hands rose -- not enough to stop him -- and before long McConnell was saying things like '' soft money is just a euphemism for free speech . ''
At length , McConnell finished , and one by one the lobbyists took turns at the podium decrying this threat to their First Amendment rights .
Thirty minutes later , they were through , and an uncomfortable hush descended upon the room .
A single hand finally went up at the front of the room .
Ed Chen of The Los Angeles Times had a question .
Although Islam has sustained slavery for 1400 years , a Muslim may never be enslaved .
Only non-believers or kafirs may be enslaved and may be eligible for freedom upon conversion to Islam at the discretion of the slave owner .
Slavery is viewed as a moral good in Islam as it transforms a kafir into a believer .
Slaves have no means for legal action in Islam and their rights are based solely on the good will of their master .
If a slave flees his master , this is view as a sin against Allah .
Slaves have few civil or legal rights .
The following are rules pertaining to slavery from the Shariah :
1 ) Muslim men may have sex with female slaves at any time and it is not possible to “ rape ” a slave .
2 ) Slaves have the same status as animals and it is permissible to whip them .
3 ) No Muslim can be put to death for murdering a slave .
4 ) A slave ’s testimony is inadmissible in court .
5 ) Slaves can be forced to marry whomever their master chooses and may not choose their marriage mate .
6 ) Christians and Jews who do not pay the jizya or protection tax can be enslaved .
At a pessimistic time when “ development ” is often taken as a euphemism for environmental destruction , architect William McDonough offers an optimistic possibility :
What if our buildings and the materials used to construct them could make the world a better place ?
As one of our most forward - looking architects , McDonough has racked up three U.S. presidential awards and numerous blue - chip clients by delivering on that seemingly radical hope .
He calls his design philosophy Cradle to Cradle — a vision of a continuous cycle of use and reuse of materials without any waste .
He hopes to create a new Industrial Revolution through sustainable designs .
The former “ green dean ” of the University of Virginia School of Architecture , McDonough has parlayed his thinking into the influential book Cradle to Cradle : Remaking the Way We Make Things , an international movement , and a thriving business .
As realized by William McDonough +
Partners , his architecture and community design firm based in Charlottesville , Virginia , McDonough ’s projects have garnered wide acclaim .
Ford Motor Company gave him $ 2 billion in 1999 , with which he transformed the company ’s ancient Rouge complex in Dearborn , Michigan , into an icon of green design , complete with the largest living roof on the planet : a 10.4 - acre assembly - plant roof blanketed with sedum , a drought - resistant ground cover .
The firm has done similar work for Gap Inc. , Herman Miller , Oberlin College , and Chicago ’s city hall .
McDonough has also recently drawn up plans for a number of new , ecologically friendly cities in China .
Separately , MBDC ( McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry ) , the company he cofounded with German chemist Michael Braungart , consults on the creation of healthy products and processes , such as utilizing sustainable materials for Nike sneakers .
DISCOVER caught up with the architect and designer at his Charlottesville office .
How do you see the future of architecture and design ?
Given the obvious concerns for human ecological health — in terms of climate change , heavy metal toxification , indoor air quality , air pollution , plastics in the oceans , and things like that — there will be a large - scale trend to buildings that start to act like organisms .
The green - roof movement , for example , will be promulgated so that buildings make oxygen .
We ’ll also see roofs that make energy , as in solar energy .
In effect , the buildings will become photosynthetic and make either oxygen or energy , or both .
We ’ll see materials that are derived from healthy sources and are designed for reuse and recapture .
What kinds of healthy materials will we be using ?
Well , sustainable forestry , recycled metal , things like that .
They ’ll be characterized in terms of where they were sourced .
Right now when you order wood , you do n’t necessarily know where it came from .
If you order metal , you do n’t know if it ’s recycled , you do n’t know where it came from .
But I think in the future , materials will have passports .
We ’ll know where they came from and where they ’re going .
Why is knowing the origins of your materials so important ?
Because in the current system , we take , make , and waste .
Things come from just about anywhere , get used , and then get taken to the landfill or are incinerated when we ’re finished with them .
And it wo n’t be possible for 8 to 10 billion people on the planet to celebrate a high quality of life if we deplete all the resources in a flawed cradle - to - grave system .
When we look at things like plastics , they should be seen as what we call technical nutrients .
They should be materials that get used over and over again for lots of different purposes over time , rather than being used once and then buried or burned .
What do we need to do to realize this vision ?
We need to adopt the Cradle to Cradle approach in the design and deployment of products and systems .
It would mean , for example , in the United States , that we take recycling seriously .
Right now we do n’t have curbside recycling in half of America .
And a lot of the materials that are “ recycled ” are basically being baled up and simply sent to China , where they ’re burned or , in the case of paper , made into packaging .
We need a recycling consciousness .
The other thing we need is to recognize that renewable energy is potentially the largest job - creation program in the history of the planet .
The conversion to renewable power in all its forms — wind , solar , et cetera — will create indigenous jobs because these forms of energy are inherently local and are not exported .
In the deserts , for example : solar thermal .
In the Great Plains : wind .
Once we become aware of that , we ’ll realize that not only will we be getting energy security , we ’ll be getting job security as well , on a global basis .
What are the obstacles to a full - scale embrace of renewables ?
The biggest obstacles are short - term thinking and a short - term economic framework .
As soon as you see some of the longer - term economic drivers become part of the short - term decision making , you can see the transformations .
A really good example of the future in the present is Masdar , this new city that ’s going to be built in Abu Dhabi .
They ’re investing billions of dollars in solar right now .
When you see the oil countries investing in renewables , it ’s a sure sign of something happening that relates to their perception of what the long - term situation will look like .
It ’s not to say that we ’re running out of oil .
It ’s to say that there ’s a new economic opportunity that can be taken advantage of .
And it is now cost - effective thanks to the high price of oil .

You are bringing your philosophies such as Cradle to Cradle to China .
How is that playing out ?
Chinese leaders are concerned about the loss of farmland due to rapid urbanization .
That ’s why we , on a conceptual level , posited the idea of putting farms on the roofs in cities .
These are concepts that are now sort of floating around in the consciousness of the design community .
And I think what needs to happen in order for something like that to actually get built would be for the Chinese to recognize the dire nature of their circumstances and to see this as one of the options that they can take on .
Looking back at your career thus far , what do you consider your greatest successes ?
Buildings such as the one at Oberlin College [ the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies ] , which was an experiment — a tremendous amount of ambition for a really small project .
Trying to make a building like a tree that makes oxygen , sequesters carbon , produces more power than it needs to operate , and purifies its own water — things like that .
That ’s really been tremendously inspirational for us here .
I think getting the Ford roof built was a big success .
It was a testimony to putting together a huge team of people focused on the same thing .
Ford ’s
Rouge complex is huge — at one point it built nearly every part of the Model T .
How do you approach such a massive project ?
We approached it from a principles perspective .
Instead of starting with goals or with tactics or conventional practice , we started with the idea that this was a place that was essentially an unhealthy workplace as a result of years of Industrial Revolution activities .
And so we started with the idea of a healthy workplace .
What would that be ?
From that principle grew the question of how would you have healthy water ?
How would you have healthy soil ?
How would you have healthy air ?
All of those pointed to the idea that you could use nature as the mechanism for creating those conditions .
When we looked at the size of the roof , we said right now , as far as the planet is concerned , that would be a liability if it were an impervious surface .
Because it would just create stormwater problems , it would n’t create habitat .
It would create heat in the summer when you wanted cooling .
It would perform all sorts of things , but it would n’t be regenerative .
It would be degenerative .
It became clear to us that a large green roof would be a marvelous thing , because it would make oxygen , change colors with the seasons , protect the roof from thermal shock , absorb stormwater , absorb particulates , solve a lot of the problems that a regular roof would n’t even begin to address .
And so the question became , could we afford it ?
That ’s where we had to put a big team together and do research .
We went to study the green roofs of Europe and essentially found that lightweight , low - maintenance green roofs had been developed in East Germany during the cold war as camouflage for aircraft hangars .
We could import that technology because it was lightweight and cheap and apply it to an American industrial shed building .
What is so special about the East German roof design ?
It ’s only an inch and a half thick .
And it ’s made of exploded shale , so it ’s stone with sedum growing in it .
That ’s a low - growing succulent plant , a noninvasive species that is very drought tolerant .
How are you applying what you ’ve learned at Ford to your current projects , such as what you ’re doing in China ?
One way is that on large - scale projects we are now able to propose to clients that they use green roofs , because since we ’ve had the opportunity to do one that big , we can say it ’s possible .
So that is giving license not just to us but to a whole profession , to propose large things like this , large - scale green roofs all over , which is really what we were hoping would happen as the result of our work .
What is an example of something you would do differently in the future ?
The thing that I would do differently in a place like China is this : I would go for planted roofs with container gardening for food growing .
The difference as we moved ahead is , we realized that not only could a roof absorb stormwater and things like that , but it could actually be a farm .
I think the next generations of green roofs will be gardens and farms .
How do you see such urban farms working ?
Well , they ’ll require heavier weight , so it ’s hard to do on lightweight , industrial , low - cost buildings .
I think that we ’ll see thin green roofs or solar collectors on lightweight industrial buildings .
But then on residential buildings , where you already have the structure , I think we ’ll see things like pot gardening , you know , big planters with vegetables and things growing in them .
You have gotten involved in designing durable goods that can be disassembled and reused .
What are the coming trends in this area , and how has it changed since you began those types of projects ?
The delightful thing that ’s happened is that most of the examples we have worked through in terms of changing the design of products have resulted in cost savings for the producers , because the products get simpler .
If they ’re designed for disassembly , oftentimes their assembly becomes simpler .
For example , if something is screwed together with 50 screws , when you stop and think about having to take it apart , you start to question every screw .
And you start to wonder why things could n’t clip into each other and get held together by one screw instead of five screws , things like that .
So all of a sudden the whole idea that you would take something apart makes the design of putting it together simpler .
Another thing we ’ve found [ in designing goods for reuse ] is that we ’ve reduced regulations by looking at all of the chemicals that go into products and using chemicals that are safe .
Can you give an instance of how you ’ve reduced regulation ?
Textiles is a good example .
In textiles we ’ve looked at thousands of chemicals .
By using only the ones that are safe , we find that the product does n’t need to be regulated , because there ’s nothing there that ’s dangerous .
Take , for example , a textile from the manufacturers Rohner and Designtex , where we used 38 chemicals instead of the hundreds that would be used normally .
What happens is the water coming out of the textile mill is n’t contaminated .
And the product itself is n’t contaminated .
So all of a sudden the whole regulatory environment is changed .
You do n’t have to handle materials specially because they ’re dangerous .
You do n’t have to file lots of reports on your handling of various materials because you ’ve essentially removed them from the design frame .
How can we spread this approach so we seriously cut back on the use of dangerous chemicals ?
On the design side , there are a lot of tools that will be in the hands of designers .
So if somebody ’s deciding they want to make some plastic red , we ’ve already cataloged the different reds that are n’t dangerous that could be used for plastics .
A designer can quickly access the database with these ingredients that are positively identified , so you do n’t just say , “ Give me plastic , and make it red . ”
You can say , “ Give me this plastic because it ’s recyclable , and make it that red because it ’s safe . ”
What lessons did you learn when you were creating sustainable product designs for Nike ?
I think seeing your customer as part of your family is really important , seeing that you ’re in a relationship with your customer when you sell them a product .
And it ’s not an abstract thing ; there is a physical transaction that ’s occurring that has an emotional connection .
So , for example , say I sold you a pair of shoes , and now you ’re finished with them and they ’re these sweaty old crummy things .
What are you supposed to do with them ?
It would be easy to throw them in the wastebasket , just throw them out .
But if you ’re part of the family , you could say , “ Well , maybe I ’m going to get some money back from these shoes .
I could get a discount on my next pair if I bring them back . ”
And you could ask , “ Why would a company give a discount in exchange for old shoes that they then have to grind up or recycle and take care of ?
It ’s really just a cost . ”
But the fact of the matter is , companies like Nike could really be seen as companies that provide shoe services .
In fact , they ’re servicing your needs for foot coverings .
They can also be seen as design and marketing companies .
They ’re not really manufacturers .
They job out manufacturing .
So , if 75 percent of a company ’s budget is marketing and you develop a way , through the actual materials of the shoe or the product itself , to have the customer come back to you for their next product , then it makes recycling look like a real small part of your marketing budget .
And all of a sudden the product becomes part of your marketing for the next generation .
That ’s the real value in this .
It ’s not going to be the molecules and the value of those molecules per se .
It ’s the relationship between the customer and the supplier that is the valuable thing .
You ’ve been called a utopian .
How optimistic are you now ?
I think we have to stay optimistic if we ’re designers , because designers wake up every morning trying to make the world a better place .
So the idea is to say , “ Things could be better if we apply ourselves in different ways . ”
On the one hand designers are optimistic that , as a species , we ’ll rise to the occasion and see that we have a fundamental design flaw :
We do n’t recognize that our processes could integrate with natural systems in delightful ways instead of destructive ways .
So I ’m optimistic that we ’ll smell the coffee at some point and start to rise to the occasion .
As far as whether it ’s too late or not , there are certainly harbingers of doom and gloom everywhere that we see and hear about on a daily basis .
It sounds like the train has left the station on a lot of these things .
And a lot of these things are going to take decades to transform and to heal .
The climate change and melting [ of glaciers and polar ice ] issue is obviously something that ’s apparently under way and cannot be turned on a dime .
These things are going to take decades to clean up and reverse .
That will be done by design .
From Conservapedia
G. Gordon Liddy ( born George Gordon Battle Liddy on November 30 , 1930 ) was an FBI agent - turned - lawyer who carried out the Watergate hotel break - in masterminded by John Dean which led to a scandal toppling Richard Nixon .
He was imprisoned after Watergate in 1973 following his conviction for conspiracy , burglary and illegal wiretapping .
Liddy headed the Plumbers unit of outside contractors to fix leaks , which was funded by campaign donations .
John Dean , without consulting Nixon , ordered the break in to see if the DNC was in unauthorized possession of leaked or stolen classified government documents at the time .
Liddy was arrested along with several others .
When Nixon learned of the break - in and arrests , rather than cleaning house of anyone connected with the Plumbers , Nixon was loyal to subordinates and approved paying the Plumbers legal expenses and supporting their families with campaign donations while in jail .
Dean turned states evidence and ratted out the payments , implying that the President was submitting to blackmail .
Although some of these practices were legal and common prior to Nixon , the Watergate scandal led to several government reform measures , including FISA , Campaign finance reporting , and FOIA .
After his 1977 release , Liddy became a conservative radio host with his syndicated G. Gordon Liddy Show , starting in 1992 and continuing until 2012 .
His show was known for espousing various conspiracy theories and its rather demeaning treatment of female staff .
Liddy has also acted and written books .
He appeared on the 1980s drama shows Airwolf , Miami Vice and MacGyver , and his autobiography Will was a New York Times best seller .
[ 1 ]
He also authored two works of fiction : Out of Control and The Monkey Handlers .
Neither novel sold well , leading some wags to refer to the first as " Out of Print " .
Liddy has appeared several times as a guest panelist on Fox News Channel .

We hear the parting words from television commercials and radio advertisements : “ Member FDIC Insured . ”
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been insuring our money , our livelihood , up to $ 100,000 .
This was supposed to make working - class people feel safe and comfortable .
But when a series of huge banks collapsed , falling like dominos one after the other , individual financial safety was put in serious jeopardy .
With the passage of the Wall Street bailout legislation , the rules for the FDIC have changed .
The sum per bank deposit guaranteed by the FDIC has been temporarily raised to $ 250,000 .
The FDIC is also allowed to borrow from the Treasury to cover losses that might occur as a result of the new , higher insurance limit .
The FDIC , however , currently has enough in its reserve fund to cover only 1 percent of insured deposits .
As of September 2008 , the Deposit Insurance Fund had a balance of $ 45 billion , which is about $ 10 billion less than the amount projected in March 2008 for the end of the year .
If there is an all - out run on the banks and everyone decides to try to collect their money , millions of workers might not be able to recover any of their money , let alone the up to $ 250,000 now guaranteed by the FDIC .

By now most of you have seen or heard about Republican Elizabeth Dole 's disgusting and desperate " Godless " commercial attacking her front - running opponent , Democrat Kay Hagan .
Not only has Hagan fired back with an ad of her own ( posted above ) , her campaign has now filed a defamation lawsuit against Dole and fiercely punching back against what has to be the lowest of campaign smears in the 2008 campaign cycle .
From The Hill :
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain ’s commander in Afghanistan has said the war against the Taliban cannot be won , the Sunday Times reported .

It quoted Brigadier Mark Carleton - Smith as saying in an interview that if the Taliban were willing to talk , then that might be “ precisely the sort of progress ” needed to end the insurgency .
“ We ’re not going to win this war .
It ’s about reducing it to a manageable level of insurgency that ’s not a strategic threat and can be managed by the Afghan army , ” he said .
He said his forces had “ taken the sting out of the Taliban for 2008 ” but that troops may well leave Afghanistan with there still being a low level of insurgency .
But Afghanistan ’s Defense Minister expressed his disappointment on Sunday at the commander ’s statements , maintaining the insurgency had to be defeated .
“ I think this is the personal opinion of that commander , ” Abdul Rahim Wardak told reporters .
“ The main objective of the Afghan government and the whole international community is that we have to defeat this war of terror and be successful , ” he said .
Wardak said success also depended on how British forces were approaching the problems they faced in Helmand but did not say whether their current strategy was the right one .
Asked if the commander ’s comments came as a disappointment , Wardak said : “ Yes , it is disappointing , for sure . ”
Britain has around 8,000 troops based in Afghanistan , most of them in the volatile southern province of Helmand , where they face daily battles with a growing insurgency .
NO NEGOTIATIONS WITH “ INVADERS ”
NATO commanders and diplomats have been saying for some time that the Taliban insurgency cannot be defeated by military means alone and that negotiations with the militants will ultimately be needed to bring an end to the conflict .
“ If the Taliban were prepared to sit on the other side of the table and talk about a political settlement , then that ’s precisely the sort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this , ” Carleton - Smith said .
“ That should n’t make people uncomfortable . ”
But a spokesman for the Taliban said on Sunday there would be no negotiations with foreigners and repeated calls made by Taliban commanders for the unconditional withdrawal of the more than 70,000 international troops from Afghanistan .
“ They should know that Taliban will never hold talks with the invaders , ” Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf told the Pakistan - based Afghan news agency , AIP .
“ What we had said in the past , we also say once again , that foreign forces should leave without any condition , ” he said .
Violence in Afghanistan has increased to its worst level since 2001 , when U.S. - led and Afghan forces overthrew the ruling Taliban following the September 11 attacks on the United States .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai said last week he had asked the king of Saudi Arabia to mediate in talks with the insurgents and called on Taliban leader Mullah Omar to return to his homeland and to make peace .
Creating a 3D printing file from a Google SketchUp file has never been easy .
Today a new class of 3D printing technology has slashed the time and expense it takes to create a physical model .
Our friends at CADspan just released a plugin that allows for the generation of solid , 3D printable files directly from a Google SketchUp model .
This software re-creates a model by " shrink - wrapping " it with one continuous mesh .
The result is a single object , in STL file format , that is completely solid and ready - to - print .
3D printers create a physical object from a digital model by first dividing it into thin virtual “ slices . ”
Then , the printers build the physical model , one layer at a time .
These machines can typically build a shoe box sized object with almost any detail , overnight .
The new CADspan plugin makes 3D printing from Google SketchUp easier than ever .
Install the plugin , and use the included tools to clean up and put some finishing touches on the model .
When ready to export , click upload and let CADspan 's servers take care of the rest .
Then , go right on to working on your next Google SketchUp project while the first model is being resurfaced .
When it 's finished , simply download the STL file , review it , and the model is ready to print .
Check out their User Guide for video tutorials and informative help .

Ah , beneath the shiny foil wrapper lies a bar of chocolatey lies .
Lies designed with the intent to cover something up .
To cover up what ?
The malty gooey nougat of greed and the peanuts of gluttony .
But who are we to judge ?
Who amongst us has n't bought Halloween candy with the sole purpose of eating half of it before the lil chillens come a -knocking ?
Happy Halloween theWAREHOUSE !
I 'm dressing up insomuch as I 'm wearing a black and yellow bowling shirt that I got for free from a client .
So either I 'm in vague Halloween colors or I 'm dressed up as " Lazy Bowler # 3 " possibly seen in the background of the Big Lebowski .
Which is fitting since the last time I dressed up it was in a bathrobe and sandals for " Laziest the Dude Ever . "
Anyway , hope you ghouls and goblins have a lot of fun tonight !
I do n't know about you but we lucked out ; it 's supposed to be the warmest day of the week here !
Almost mid-sixties !
Also , a second cause for mass celebration : I fixed our house 's water pressure .
I was getting really tired of taking showers under what felt like 20 kids spitting on me .
Your Comments :
Twenty - four hours after taking off from JFK International in Queens , Qantas Flight 108 landed in Sydney .
As the wheels touched the tarmac and 300 passengers applauded a successful landing , I felt an enormous rush of relief .
It was partly because I had been cooped up in a confined space for almost an entire day , aware with every breath I took that the air filling my lungs had probably been circulated through the cabin three or four times already , but also because , in the words of Qantas ' own ( very cheesy ) theme song , I still call Australia home .
At the end of a long flight , and at the end of a much longer year away , the seemingly endless Pacific Ocean suddenly gave way to Sydney Harbor , causing my stomach to jump and a grin to spread over my exhausted face .
The moment was well worth the exhausting flight and 12 months of waiting that had preceded it .
The knowledge that my parents were at the arrivals gate with a thermos of tea and some Vegemite on toast , ready to drive me home through the cold winter morning — because in Australia , the toilet and the seasons go backwards — only added to my sense of anticipation as the landing wheels descended and my ears started to pop .
I am home , if only for a few weeks .
My first days back were full of readjustments — driving on the left , saying " mobile " instead of " cell " and the dreaded 14 - hour time difference .
The people around me have had to adjust a little too .
To my Australian friends and relatives , I sound unforgivably American when I speak .
It 's not just my accent that has changed ; when I open my mouth , it 's usually to talk about American politics , American culture , and my new life on the other side of world .
As I prepared to fly here , I intended to write be about my home country , and what a wonderful country it is .
But the Australia I 'm visiting this August does n't feel like the hometown I left three years ago .
This place feels more like New York than ever , and not in a good way .
Growing up with an American mother and an Aussie father , I often heard my parents compare the two countries , especially when it came to education and culture .
It 's still unclear to me which country has a better education system or a healthier national culture — there are strong arguments in favor of each .
But what has become clear to me is that in my years away , many of the best parts of our Australian culture , the ones we offer up as evidence of our nation 's superiority , have noticeably declined .
Australians will often proudly tell you how " laid - back " we are as a people .
Whether it's the influence of the beach culture or the long tradition as a rural nation , we pride ourselves on the fact that life here moves at a slower pace .
Australians , we tell ourselves , are relaxed , easygoing and friendly .
Even on the streets of large cities like Sydney or Melbourne , we insist , you wo n't feel the frantic urgency and impatience so often experienced in New York or Boston .
Australians are not easily fussed , and not easily provoked into displays of strong emotions , unless sport of some kind is involved .
Perhaps it 's the Olympic Games and our rousing performance in the pool that are throwing off my observations but the Australia , and specifically Sydney , that I 'm visiting this August is not the easygoing place I remember it being .
In fact , it feels decidedly like the East Coast .
In New York , every morning on my way to work I was confronted by the enormous and melodramatic headlines of the National Enquirer in the subway .
Heading home , I had hoped that the front pages in Sydney would n't be totally overrun by mindless and salacious gossip .
But the Games have brought with them the irresistible temptation to tell , and more often to fabricate inspirational and heartbreaking tales , demonstrating , sadly , that tabloid journalism is alive and well in Australia .
The Olympics have brought out the very worst of Australian journalism with sexist headlines and Chariots of Fire - esque tales concocted from even the most insignificant of results .
Although the Olympics have brought out the worst in the Australian media , they have , as always , brought out the best in the Australian people .
Australians are defying their reputations for slow - paced , easygoing friendliness because sports are one of the very few things Australians get really riled up about .
When sport is involved , our usual state of national relaxation is replaced by our own odd brand of national pride — a sense that we 're very good at a few things , and we 'll do our best to wipe the floor ( or in this case the pool ) in those events .
As for everything else , it 's business as usual : we 'll give it a shot , do our best and not take ourselves too seriously .
To quote Qantas yet again , that is the spirit of Australia .
The past few weeks have been a difficult time for economic educators .
Never has it been more obvious that all their efforts have been in vain .
Neither the politicians nor the journalists , who have been spewing out words at a rapid rate with regard to the so - called financial crisis and the proposed financial bailout , have a clue about the economy .
It ’s not simply that these nincompoops use metaphors , rather than more precise terms and ideas , in speaking about the economy .
We all use metaphors to some extent ; we ca n’t talk without them .
But the journalists ’ metaphors are routinely so mixed that one wonders what is going on in their minds .
Many , for example , refer in one breath to financial markets that are “ freezing up ” and in another breath to financial markets that are “ melting down . ”
Which is it ?
Are these markets cold and immobile or hot and fluid ?
The speakers know ( or fancy that they know ) only that something is terribly wrong ; they ca n’t be bothered with understanding exactly what is wrong or why .
Many commentators think of the economy by analogy with an animal ’s body .
Thus , “ credit is the lifeblood , ” and because the animal presumably has sustained a wound , it is losing blood quickly , and therefore the government must rush to “ apply a tourniquet . ”
Others refer to the “ battered financial industry , ” as if it were a boxer pitted against a superior opponent who is mercilessly beating his head and torso .
One wonders : has the financial industry dropped its mouthpiece ?
Has it forgotten to keep up its guard ?
Perhaps it has simply disregarded its footwork , neglecting to “ float like a butterfly , sting like a bee . ”
An extremely common term has been “ toxic assets . ”
Perhaps because of some research I did in connection with mining in the Coeur d’Alene Valley , I cannot hear this term without imagining that the assets are covered with a fine , nearly invisible dust consisting of tiny particles of lead , zinc , cadmium , and arsenic .
Have you noticed that bankers have been wearing respirators lately ?
But perhaps I ’m all wrong about the toxicity , and it actually arises from contact between mortgage documents and the viruses of acute hemorrhagic fevers .
This hypothesis may help us to understand the alleged bleeding and the consequent need for a tournequet .
One article refers to lawmakers ’ fears of “ a crushing economic contagion . ”
I ’m stumped .
I ’m trying to picture how contagion can crush something or someone , but all I can think of is that contagion denotes a pathogen ’s spread from person to person , by either direct or indirect contact or via a vector , such as an insect .
Can mere exposure crush us ?
Does n’t crushing require either great mass or great velocity .
Of course , the most common term of all in the recent reports has been “ distressed ” or “ troubled ” assets .
Try as I may , I cannot picture how all of these worthless IOUs piled in the safe deposit boxes of banks and other lending institutions can feel distressed or troubled — the bankers themselves , maybe , but that ’s not what ’s being said .
I keep imagining a mortgage - backed security or some other type of collateralized debt obligation lying on a psychiatrist ’s couch , as the shrink asks : “ what ’s troubling you , Oliver ? ”
Or perhaps the worthless security is sitting in the confessional , saying to the priest , “ Father , forgive me , for I have promised to pay and offered security for my promise , but I am not paying and my security is worthless . ”
You can easily imagine how many Hail Marys that will get the wayward financial instrument .
Distressed and troubled , indeed .
If journalists have used inappropriate and even screwy language to talk about the economy and the bailout , politicians have been no better .
Thus Rep. Barney Frank , one of the guiltiest parties in this whole criminal undertaking , declares : “ We were the EMTs rushing to the rescue of an economy that suddenly found itself choking , but now we have to perform more serious reform . ”
He promises “ serious surgery ” next year .
Since when , you might wonder , did the removal of an obstruction in the windpipe require “ serious surgery ” ?
Could n’t EMT
Frank simply apply the Heimlich maneuver to expel the economy ’s unsufficiently chewed chunk of credit steak ?
One quakes to imagine Barney Frank cutting into the economy ’s body cavity to . . . what ? . . . cut out its gizzard ?
( I assume here that the markets are birds , not reptiles , because during prosperous times they are said to be “ soaring . ” )
My great fear is that Rep. Frank and his congressional / surgical colleagues will cut into the economy ’s body and , finding no gizzard , satisfy themselves by excising the kidneys or the liver .
After all , they clearly know little or nothing about what goes on in there or how the various parts of the economy work together to keep the economy “ alive ” and “ healthy . ”
Rep. Nancy Pelosi , seemingly punch - drunk from the verbal pounding she has been giving and taking of late , opined that the bailout law will “ begin to shape the financial stability of our country and the economic security of our people . ”
I suppose she meant these noises to sound reassuring to someone , but can one really “ shape ” financial stability or economic security ?
What shape does one best employ ?
I imagine that Pelosi might well select the shape of Devils Tower , much as Richard Dreyfus piled his mashed potatoes on the kitchen table in Close Encounters .
I do n’t know if such artistry is possible in this case , but our devoted public servants are persons of unquestioned imagination and creative genius , so if anyone can pull off this trick , they can .
Pelosi also excused the legislators ’ treachery in facilitating the greatest broad - daylight robbery of all time by saying , “ We must win it for Mr. and Mrs. Jones on Main Street . ”
What does this lady pirate know about Main Street ?
Did she ever do an honest day ’s work ?
And if so , why did she quit that job and turn to crime ?
However elusive the answers to these questions may be , we can all understand why the Speaker of the House did not say , “ We must win it for the Gipper . ”
If she is anything , she is a political partisan .
Finally , we come to Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland , who switched from voting against the bailout on Monday to voting for it on Friday .
His explanation : “ Sometimes you just have to do what is necessary at that moment . ”
This vacuous and dishonest excuse calls to my mind the statement that might be made by a 16 year old boy , explaining why he did what he did last night in the backseat with his overheated girlfriend .
Maybe that boy will grow up and be elected to Congress .
The US has a shameful history of low voter turnout , but that has n’t stopped some people from trying to make it as difficult to vote as possible .
Now you can actually see if your name ( or the names of your family or friends ) have been dropped from the voter rolls , thanks to Project Vote .
They currently have lists for 11 battleground states : Colorado , Florida , Indiana , Michigan , Missouri , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Texas , and hope to add others in the near future .

Ruben Navarrette asks whether Obama 's cool , calm demeanor will be a plus in negotiating with world leaders .
SAN DIEGO , California ( CNN ) --
Make no mistake , Barack Obama is one cool customer .
Now , after the last debate , it seems all but certain that the Iceman cometh to the White House .
Radio talk show hosts and rank - and - file Republicans spent the last few weeks pleading with John McCain to take the gloves off and take the fight to Obama .
How 's that working out , folks ?
In this week 's match - up , Obama snatched the gloves out of McCain 's hands and slapped him silly with them .
I suppose the hope was that Obama would get rattled and make a mistake .
But Obama does n't get rattled or make many mistakes .
I still have no idea what type of president Obama would make .
But he 's an extraordinary politician .
In fact , he may even be better than Bill Clinton who , while he had the IQ and EQ , also had the burden of a legendary red - hot temper .
Obviously , it takes a lot to get under Obama 's skin .
McCain sure tried .
Maybe this is the guy we want negotiating with world leaders .
Maybe after eight years of George W. Bush stubbornness , on the heels of eight years of Clinton emotiveness , we need to send out for ice .
In a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll , 58 percent of those who watched the debate said Obama did the better job and 31 percent said that about McCain .
That makes three skins for Obama .
In earlier polls , 54 percent of those who watched thought Obama won the second debate , and 51 percent thought he won the first one .
This week , McCain turned in his best performance of the debates , and the first 30 minutes -- with McCain bringing up Obama 's problematic encounter with the now famous Joe the Plumber ; and the quip about how he is n't Bush and how Obama should have run four years ago -- were near flawless for the Republican .
iReport.com : Are you Joe the Plumber ?
Get out your plunger and share your thoughts
McCain put Obama on the defensive , and it showed .
If McCain had been that aggressive throughout the first two debates -- firm but not necessary unlikable -- we might be looking at a different race right now .
But , over the next hour , Obama regained his stride and eventually dominated the exchange .
And , in the end , with his sarcastic crack about school vouchers -- " Because there 's not enough vouchers ; therefore , we should n't do it , even though it 's working .
I got it . " -- McCain was profoundly unlikable .
So said the polls .
In the CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll , 70 percent of debate watchers found Obama more likable .
Only 22 percent said that about McCain .
McCain 's supporters wanted him to bring up some of the allegedly shady characters from Obama 's circle of acquaintances that give some Americans pause and lead them to question the Democrat 's values .
There are good reasons to have that conversation , and bad ones .
A friend and fellow journalist told me Obama 's Chicago posse was important because it formed " the political womb where the fetal Obama grew into a politician .
...
That tells us who he is and what either he believes himself or is at least willing to tolerate as president . "
Frankly , that argument makes a lot more sense than what many of the Obama haters are saying about how these " Friends of Barack " prove he is a couple of flag pins short of being a full - blooded American .
That 's nonsense .
For instance , with William Ayers -- the unrepentant domestic terrorist who Obama first claimed was just a guy who lived in his neighborhood but with whom we now know the Illinois senator had a more substantial relationship -- the issue is n't Obama 's patriotism but his truthfulness .
Still , it was obviously a mistake for McCain to bring up Ayers during the debate .
The tactic backfired .
In the CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll , 62 percent of debate watchers said Obama 's connection to Ayers mattered to them " not much " or " not at all . "
Only 23 percent said it mattered " a great deal . "
McCain should leave it to the press to mine the question of whether Obama has been totally honest about his relationship with Ayers -- well , at least those in the press who have n't already sent in requests for tickets to the Barack Obama inaugural ball .
As for McCain , he is an American hero who has given his life to public service , and the country is better for it .
That record of service need not come to an end .
He can still contribute and finish out his term in the Senate .
But , unless the political wind changes -- and quickly -- a promotion to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue does n't appear to be in the cards .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama • William Ayers
UPDATE : The agreement has fallen apart .
After meeting with the President for hours , both sides stormed out of the room .
Paulson and Bernanke now hustling back to the hill to try to salvage the deal .
Some are blaming McCain .
EARLIER : Congressional Republican and Democrat leaders reached an agreement this afternoon for the Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program — also known as the Hanke - Panke bailout .
The provisions of the agreement are vague but differ in surprising ways from what we ’d been led to expect .
Here ’s a rundown of the highlights and lowlights .
Compensation Cap : “ Requires Treasury Secretary to set standards to prevent excessive or inappropriate executive compensation for participating companies . ”
This is broader than the “ golden parachute ” limit reported an hour ago because it applies to all executive compensation for any company participating in the program .
The discretion it gives to the Treasury Secretary will make him a kind of compensation czar for Wall Street , which is a very strange role for the Treasury Secretary .
Fortunately , it may give the Treasury Secretary enough discretion to make this provision toothless enough that financial executives wo n’t have to avoid participation just to preserve their income .
Equity Sharing : “ To minimize risk to the American taxpayer , requires that any transaction include equity sharing . ”
This is more or less a hedge against firms selling their worst junk at inflated prices to the Treasury or otherwise exploiting the bailout for a windfall .
If the firms rake in huge profits from the bailout , the government will get a share of the upside .
Debt Payments : “ Requires most profits to be used to reduce the national debt . ”
Entirely nonsense .
Congress will continue to accumulate budget deficits and the government will increase its debt .
Even if the government spends every dime of the alleged profit from this deal on earmarks , it can claim that it is reducing debt because otherwise it would have to borrow the money for the program .
Weak Judicial Review : “ Treasury Secretary is prohibited from acting in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in any way that is inconsistent with existing law . ”
Hank Paulson had sought unreviewable power to spend the TARP .
This was meant to reduce uncertainty in the markets , which could know that a judge would n’t be able to prevent the Treasury from spending the funds .
The new standard will allow a very weak form of judicial review .
“ Arbitrary or capricious ” is legal mumbo- jumbo for a standard that approves almost every government action .
Meet The New Bosses : “ Establishes strong oversight board with cease and desist authority . ”
How do we get on this ‘ oversight board ? ’
Congressional Oversight : “ Requires program transparency and public accountability through regular , detailed reports to Congress disclosing exercise of the Treasury Secretary ’s authority . ”
This seems straight forward .
We imagine these things will look just like the Fed chief ’s testimony before Congress — expect vague answers from a condescending Treasury secretary and awkward , self - serving , constituent pleasing questions from Congressmen .
A Bureaucracy To Watch The Bureaucracy : “ Establishes an independent Inspector General to monitor the use of the Treasury Secretary ’s authority ” and “ Requires GAO audits to ensure proper use of funds , appropriate internal controls , and to prevent waste , fraud , and abuse . ”
But who will monitor the independent Inspector General and the GAO ?
It ’s bureaucrats all the way down .
More Mortgage Losses Ahead : “ Maximize and coordinate efforts to modify mortgages for homeowners at risk of foreclosure . ”
Does n’t anyone see the irony that modifying mortgages that are causing the trouble will only increase impairment rates , drive down the prices of mortgage backed securities and dig us deeper into the credit abyss ?
Apparently not .
Profit Elimination for Government Owned Mortgages : “ Requires loan modifications for mortgages owned or controlled by the Federal Government . ”
Whoosh !
There go those profits .
If the government buys assets at their expected returns based on their terms , then modifies them , it guarantees a loss .
Blow The Bubble Again : “ Directs a percentage of future profits to the Affordable Housing Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund to meet America ’s housing needs . ”
Get ready for the Revenge of The Housing Bubble : This Time It ’s Personal !
Create Chaos
In the Markets : “ Treasury Secretary ’s request for $ 700 billion is authorized , with $ 250 billion available immediately and an additional $ 100 billion released upon his or her certification that funds are needed . ”
It ’s not like we want to end this awesome volatility right ?
Let ’s keep the markets hanging around , nervously waiting on every incremental piece of that .
That will totally help the economy .
Government Rent Seeking : “ Final $ 350 billion is subject to a Congressional joint resolution of disapproval . ”
Because , you see , congressmen and senators have fiscal needs too .
If they lose their authority to control spending , why are the lobbyists going to raise campaign contributions for them .
Everyone would just lobby the Treasury officials .
This part is the bailout for lawmakers .
So it turns out congressman Paul Kanjorski was right when he said the agreement woud contain “ most everything everyone is asking for as a condition to put this together has already been agreed to and is in the bill . ”
Ain’t democracy grand ?
DeMint thinks the Bush Administration has worn out Americans ' trust on handling the economy .
DeMint : U.S. ca n’t trust Bush on economy
Republican Sen. Jim DeMint ( S.C. ) thinks the Bush Administration has worn out its trust from the American people on handling economy .
“ It 's a sad fact , but Americans can no longer trust the economic information they are getting from this Administration , ” DeMint wrote in a post on Politico ’s Arena forum Tuesday .

DeMint , a harsh critic of the proposed $ 700 billion dollar bailout , wrote that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's market predictions “ have been consistently wrong in the last year . ”
“ Now they want us to trust them to spend nearly a trillion dollars on more government bailouts .
It 's completely irresponsible , ” the South Carolina Republican added .
“ Any Republican or Democrat who shares these concerns cannot in good conscience vote for this bailout and pretend to care about protecting the taxpayer . ”
“ The Administration said the bailout of Bear Stearns would stop the bleeding and solve the problem , but they were wrong .
They said $ 150 billion in new government spending using rebate checks would solve the problem , but they were wrong again .
They said new authority to bailout Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would solve the problem without being used , but they were wrong again . ”
During an interview on CNN’s “ American Morning , ” DeMint said that “ the government has done just about everything it can to bring this economy down . ”
“ I believe the government broke this .
I do n’t think the government can fix this .
What we need to do is get the government out of it and stop undermining our economy .
Looks like the long - friendly relationship between John McCain and David Letterman is on the skids .
The late - night comedian was none too pleased that the Republican presidential nominee bailed on an appearance Wednesday on the “ Late Show ” so he could return to Washington to deal with the economic crisis , particularly since he found time to give an interview to CBS News anchor Katie Couric along the way .
McCain was supposed to make his 13th appearance on Letterman ’s show , but he backed out late Wednesday afternoon , saying he was suspending campaign activities to focus on getting a financial bailout plan through Congress .
During the taping of the show , Letterman told the audience that McCain had called him personally to apologize for standing him up and said he was rushing to the airport .
“ I ’m more than a little disappointed by this behavior , ” Letterman said .
“ We ’re suspending the campaign .
Suspending it because there ’s an economic crisis , or because the poll numbers are sliding ? ”

The audience applauded .
“ You do n’t suspend your campaign , ” he added .
“ Do you suspend your campaign ?
No , because that makes me think , well , you know , maybe there will be other things down the road -- if he ’s in the White House , he might just suspend being president .
I mean , we ’ve got a guy like that now ! ”
Then in the midst of interviewing MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann , Letterman learned that the GOP candidate was about five blocks away at CBS News headquarters , preparing for an interview with Couric .
Incredulous , Letterman interrupted his chat with Olbermann to show the audience a live shot on the internal CBS news feed of McCain getting touched up by a makeup artist as he waited to talk to Couric .

“ He does n’t seem to be racing to the airport , does he ? ” Letterman said , shouting at the television monitor : “ Hey John , I got a question !
You need a ride to the airport ? ”

The conservatives will have you believe that all liberals and all democrats want to " cut and run " away from Iraq .
They believe that just by saying that leaves the impression that they are cowards without their having to actually say the word coward .
There is a popular belief among conservatives that anyone who wants to cut and run is actually supporting the terrorist 's cause .
Here 's the reality ;
Anyone who believes that we should stay the course is simply not supporting the troops .
They are really against the troops .
Anyone who says that stay the course is the right decision to make is making the conscious decision to kill our American troops .
In addition to that , stay the course means that billions more in OUR tax dollars is going to be spent .
Not just on the war , but on benefits that need to be paid to our injured troops , the families of those who died there , all the money that Halliburton will need to complete their non-bid contracts , and much much more .
Cutting and running , as the conservatives put it , is the most patriotic thing American can do right now .
If you want freedom , protect our borders .
If you want freedom , make friends with other nations , not enemies .
If you want freedom , impeach the criminals that have taken over our government .
Additionally I encourage everyone who reads this to read the William Shirer book , " The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich " .
You will see so many similarities between Adolph Hitler and his rise to power in Germany , and George W. Bush and his rise to power in America , it will truly blow your mind .
Do n’t tell anyone , but David Byrne and Brian Eno have a new album .
OK , so it ’s not exactly a secret .
But a key facet of their first extended collaboration in 27 years was their decision not to trumpet the arrival of “ Everything That Happens Will Happen Today ” in the usual way .
There ’s no record company marketing campaign , no ads in trade magazines , on radio or MTV , in part because there ’s no record company .
“ People are just kind of discovering it , ” Byrne , 56 , said from Phoenix on Monday , following a concert the previous night in Albuquerque , part of his tour that reaches the Greek Theatre tonight .
“ We did it without any of the traditional stuff that a record company would do .

“ It ’s an experiment , ” Byrne said .
“ But we ’ve recouped our costs already , and that ’s nothing to sneeze at these days . ”
In the coming weeks , he said , the album will be turning up on iTunes , Amazon.com and other online retailers , but the no-strings - attached delivery method is in keeping with the music itself .
It ’s a gorgeous , ethereal yet intrinsically human meeting of Byrne ’s voice , guitars and other acoustic instruments , and Eno ’s trademark electronic sounds .
They describe the result as “ folk - electronic gospel . ”
Byrne wrote many of the lyrics for a series of ambient soundscapes that Eno had created previously to convey a spiritual dimension , though one that ’s never far removed from the realities of life on Earth :
Tiny little boats on a beach

at sunset
I took a drink from a jar
& into my head
Familiar smells and flavors
Advertisement
Vehicles are stuck on the
plains of heaven
That ’s a verse from the opening track , “ Home . ”
Like the rest of the album ’s songs , it long existed only as an instrumental , one of many Eno never got around to finishing .
The subject of Eno ’s growing stockpile of incomplete songs came up during a conversation with Byrne , and rock ‘ n ’ roll gentleman that he is , the former Talking Head offered to take a stab at writing words for them .
If Eno did n’t like his lyrics , he could feel free to discard them , Byrne offered .
That , of course , did n’t happen .
“ After listening , and living with them for a while ” -- nearly a year , in fact , “ I sent him a note and said , ‘ This is the feeling I ’m getting -- what do you think ? ’ ” Byrne said .
“ And he seemed fine with it .
The spiritual dimension was n’t there immediately , but it surfaced pretty quickly . ”

The songs brim with pop melodies , many of them crafted by Byrne but rooted in snippets of musical lines he found within Eno ’s extended tracks .
The exception is the rhythmically quirky , lyrically disjunctive “ I Feel My Stuff , ” a meditation on a world in disarray .
“ If he started with a certain kind of thing , ” Byrne said , “ I felt I should honor that , or pay attention to it and see if I could take it further . ”
He used the same approach with the few lyric bits Eno had penned .
“ In the song ‘ The River , ’ he had a lyric about a river , and that ’s as much as there was , ” Byrne said .
“ I also wrote about a river , and [ Hurricane ] Katrina , which is what I think the song is about . ”
Katrina is never mentioned by name , yet as elsewhere on “ Everything That Happens , ” grim reality serves as the opportunity for renewal and rebirth .

It ’s making for an uplifting experience for the co-namesake of “ David Byrne on Tour : Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno . ”
The show is built around about half a dozen of the new album ’s songs , along with numbers from the collaborators ’ 1981 album , “ My Life in the Bush of Ghosts , ” and some of the Talking Heads songs Eno produced .
“ It ’s pretty elaborate , ” Byrne said .
“ I have three singers , keyboards and a rhythm section and three dancers . ”
And a horn section for those fat , sweet trumpet and sax parts on the new album ?
“ I wish I did . ”
Even with that note of apology , Byrne said , “ In Albuquerque last night , this scientist came up to me after the show and asked , ‘ How in the world is anything this positive occurring at this point in the world ? ’ ”

Gmail 302 Hijacked …
Thanks to Jake Bohall , our Director of Sales , for noticing this due to a nasty Firefox 3.0 bug , requires that he type URLs into the Google Search App because the location bar no longer works .
It was years ago that the 302 hijack became a popularly abused method to steal rankings but , due to some apparant algo improvements and what I believe to be a well orchestrated misinformation campaign by either people who wanted to still abuse it or Google who did n’t have a good fix , the method seemed to disappear by - and - large .
However , the bug reared its ugly head again today , as Gmail.com itself was hijacked in Google .
As you can see , Gmail.com , or mail.google.com , are not ranking for the keyword gmail.com in Google .
Instead , the ranking is replaced by a spam blog on blogspot.com
The tell - tale 302 hijack can be diagnosed by the cached page , which is of gmail.com
The perpetrator may have done this accidentally , however it appears that he did use spam - links to attempt to rank the site …
Good work Google !
Lucky for Google , the owner of the blog has not replaced the content with something more malicious , like malware or a phishing site .
Update :
It appears that Google has replaced the 302 redirect now with a 301 ( they own blogspot.com ) and , supposedly , shut down the infringing account .
This should clean up the issue quickly , but represents little relief for webmasters who do not have control over the spammer ’s site .
Also , for people who have never heard of a 302 hijack , here is a nice primer : : It appears that Google has replaced the 302 redirect now with a 301 ( they own blogspot.com ) and , supposedly , shut down the infringing account .

As of this morning , Google has fixed this particularly embarrassing hijack .

Over history , many of America ’s former Presidents and even their wives , have made famous quotes . . . ones which have helped shape America to what it is today .
The question remains :
“ Will Barack Obama or John McCain say something so powerful , they will be remembered for it in 50 - 100 years time and help change history ? ”
1 .
“ There are two kinds of success .
One is the very rare kind that comes to the man who has the power to do what no one else has the power to do .
That is genius .
But the average man who wins what we call success is not a genius .
He is a man who has merely the ordinary qualities that he shares with his fellows , but who has developed
those ordinary qualities to a more ordinary degree ” .
Theordore Roosevelt ( 1858 -1919 ) – 26th President of the United States
2 .
“ Our problems are man made , therefore they may be solved by the man .
And man can be
as he wants .
No problem of human destiny is beyond beings ” .
John F. Kennedy ( 1917 - 1963 ) – 35th President of the United States
3 .
“ We grow by dreams .
All big men are dreamers , some of us let dreams die , but others nourish and protect them , nurse them through bad days . . . to the sunshine and light which always come ” .
Woodrow Wilson ( 1856-1924 ) – 28th President of the United States
4 .
“ Most people are about as happy as they make up their mind to be ” .
Abraham Lincoln ( 1809 - 1895 ) – 16th President of the United States
5 .
“ The buck stops here ” .
Harry S. Truman ( 1884-1972 ) – 33rd President of the United States
6 .
“ Change is the law of life .
An those who look only to the past or the present are sure to miss the future ” .
John F. Kennedy ( 1917 - 1963 ) – 35th President of the United States
7 .
“ So let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -
nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat
into advance ” .
Franklin D. Roosevelt ( 1882-1945 ) – 32nd President of the United States
8 .
“ It is hard to fail but is worse to have not tried to succeed .
In this life we get nothing save by effort .
Theordore Roosevelt ( 1858 -1919 ) – 26th President of the United States
9 .
“ Do what you can , with what you have , where you are ” .
Theordore Roosevelt ( 1858 -1919 ) – 26th President of the United States
PRESIDENT’S WIVES :
10 .
“ Never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people – your family , friends and co-workers and even strangers you meet along the way ” .
Barbara Bush – Wife of President George Bush
11 .
“ The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams ” .
Eleanor Roosevelt ( 1884 -1962 ) – Wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt , American Humanitarian , Columnist and Lecturer

En effet , il n’est pas rare que les nouveaux membres d’un e-shop bénéficient d’un bon d’achat .
Alors , avant d’acheter un produit sur votre site habituel , regardez si vous ne pouvez pas bénéficier d’un avantage en achetant sur un nouveau site .
D’autre part , sachez que de nombreux sites vous proposent de bénéficier d’un bon d’achat simplement en vous abonnant à la newsletter du site en question .
Une manière simple et efficace d’économiser encore un peu plus .
Enfin , si vous êtes étudiant , n’hésitez pas à regarder si le site propose un programme de fidélité étudiant .
En effet , de plus en plus de sites , notamment spécialisés dans la mode , proposent des réductions annuelles aux étudiants .
Les systèmes de cash back
Depuis quelques années , le système du Cash - back connaît un véritable succès .
En effet , le principe est assez simple et très attractif .
En fait , à chaque achat réalisé sur internet , vous recevez un pourcentage du montant total de vos achats sur un porte - feuille en ligne .
Bien évidemment , les pourcentages de ces offres sont généralement assez faibles , mais c’est avec les petits ruisseaux que l’on fait les grandes rivières .
Aussi , si vous faites très fréquemment des achats sur internet , ce système de retour d’argent pourrait vous faire avoir une petite cagnotte en ligne que vous pourrez réutiliser pour vos achats plus tard .
Donc n’hésitez pas à regarder ce que proposent les différents groupes qui adoptent ce système .
Faire son shopping sur internet est devenu une habitude pour de nombreux français .
En effet , depuis maintenant quelques années , nos habitudes de consommation ont grandement changé , et nous nous tournons de plus en plus vers internet pour nos achats en tout genre .
Le shopping sur internet a prit une telle ampleur , qu’aujourd ’hui , il existe des milliers de site de shopping en tout genre .
Si certains sont bien connus , d’autres le sont un peu moins .
Mais alors comment choisir le bon site internet pour faire son shopping ?
Aussi , si vous aussi vous voulez connaître tous les bons plans shopping d’internet , on vous fait un petit guide avec une petite liste des sites internet les mieux classés pour faire son shopping .
Alors , sans plus attendre , on vous dit tout !
Les sites de shopping discount
Si pendant longtemps le shopping sur internet était synonyme de vêtement , de produits de beauté , ou encore de livres , aujourd ’hui on peut bel et bien tout acheter sur internet .
Aussi , beaucoup de personnes font leurs courses alimentaires sur internet , ou bien achètent des objets multimédias ou numériques , ou encore des bijoux , bref ont recours à internet pour tout leurs achats .
Aussi , pour optimiser son shopping en ligne , il est en général plus facile de regrouper ses commandes sur un seul et même site .
Pour cela , sachez qu’il existe de nombreux sites qui proposent la vente d’objets en tout genre .
Vous en avez certainement entendu parler , ces sites sont incontournables : Amazon , ou encore Cdiscount sont les sites de shopping leaders sur le marché mondial .
En effet , ces grands groupes livrent aux quatre coins du monde , mais surtout , ils proposent des prix attractifs .
Aussi , il est possible de trouver des objets derniers cris pour pas chers , et même des produits et objets du quotidien pour quelques euros ou dollars .
Bref , vous l’aurez compris , si vous voulez regrouper vos commandes internet en un lieu , c’est sur ces sites qu’ils faut aller pour bénéficier des meilleurs prix .
Les sites de drop - shipping
Phénomène qui commence à faire de plus en plus parler de lui sur la toile , c’est le drop - shipping .
En effet , si le mot de vous dit certainement rien , vous connaissez forcément les sites qui utilisent ce concept .
AliExpress , ou encore Alibaba sont les deux grands géants du shopping version drop - shipping .
En fait , vous trouvez à peu près tout ce que vous voulez sur ces sites aux prix les plus bas possibles .
En effet , les produits ou objets que vous achetez sont souvent produits et envoyés depuis la Chine ou des pays où la main d’oeuvre est bon marché .
Aussi , lorsque vous passez commande , le site va lui-même passer commande auprès du fournisseur qui produit le produit que vous avez commandé .
Cela explique les prix sacrifiés .
D’autre part , si vous avez recours à des sites de drop - shipping , vous verrez que les délais de livraison sont longs , voire très longs parfois .
Si vous bénéficiez des meilleurs prix , vous devrez toutefois prendre votre mal en patience avant de recevoir votre commande .
Enfin , il n’est pas rare de rencontrer de mauvaises surprises en ce qui concerne la qualité des produits .
À défaut de temps ou pour d’autres raisons propre à chacun , l’adoption de l’aspirateur robot est la meilleure solution afin de résoudre les soucis liés aux corvées quotidiennes , notamment au nettoyage de la maison .
Mais , l’aspirateur robot est-il vraiment efficace ?
Comment fonctionne - t- il ?
Et quels sont ses avantages ?
L’aspirateur robot : comment ça marche ?
L’aspirateur robot est un outil d’assainissement , s’inspirant de l’aspirateur traditionnel , permettant de nettoyer le sol .
L’aspirateur robot peut nettoyer tous types de sol ( parquets , carreau , moquette… ) .
En général , cet outil de nettoyage prend la forme d’un disque d’à peu près 35 cm de diamètre et de 10 cm de hauteur .
Pour nettoyer , l’appareil utilise deux types de brosses .
D’un côté , les brosses latérales récoltent les poussières et les ramènent au centre et d’un autre côté , les brosses centrales soulèvent les poussières pour les emmener vers le réservoir .
Cependant , pour certains modèles , l’aspirateur robot n’est composé que de deux brosses centrales seulement .
Contrairement à l’aspirateur traditionnel qui lui est équipé d’un sac , l’aspirateur robot , est équipé d’un réservoir plastique pour stocker les poussières .
En général , ces appareils agissent sans fil et à l’aide d’une batterie chargeable .
Le déplacement et la façon dont il nettoie dépendent en principe de chaque modèle .
Si d’autres se déplacent dans les pièces au hasard , d’autres , par contre sont munies , soit d’une mini-caméra , soit d’un petit laser , afin de mémoriser les pièces à nettoyer et de faire le ménage lui-même .
Avec cette gadget de nettoyage , pour faire le ménage , l’unique attribution du propriétaire est de mettre en marche ou en arrêt l’appareil .
L’aspirateur robot : les avantages
Le premier avantage de ce type d’appareils réside dans le fait qu’il soit autonome .
Ainsi , c’est un outil pratique .
Il libère son propriétaire de l’obligation de passer l’aspirateur .
Il est aussi d’un grand secours pour ceux qui ne peuvent pas passer l’aspirateur à cause de leurs conditions physiques ou de leurs emplois du temps .
Le deuxième avantage de cet outil de nettoyage se trouve dans sa performance .
En effet , il est inutile de surveiller l’aspirateur robot .
Cela s’explique par le fait que c’est un appareil qui est programmé pour éviter les obstacles .
De plus , l’appareil est très efficace puisqu’il permet de nettoyer , même dans les recoins les plus inaccessibles et de se faufiler partout ( sous les armoires , sous le lit… ) .
Enfin , l’appareil octroie à son propriétaire un gain de temps conséquent .
Il libère les propriétaires des tâches ménagères pour s’adonner à d’autres corvées ou pour s’occuper un peu plus de sa famille .
Le prix moyen à débourser pour obtenir un aspirateur robot est de 400 euros .
Selon le prix et chaque modèle , l ’aspirateur robot peut être assorti d’un mur virtuel , d’une télécommande , de filtre , d’une lingette microfibre …

Hi all ,
This might be the last thing I ever post on here but I need to warn you all .
I have been with LAPD for a while and have learned alot of things .
One of them is to be a little more independent .
Do n't put 100 % faith in other humans to take care of you .
And yes that means the government 2 .
Well because things have gotten so bad in LA ( Officers being shot at up 39 % in 2007 ) I decided to move to Idaho .
And I love it by the way .
Anyway what I 'm going to say might shock you or even scare you , but please understand that fear does nothing but makes things worse kinda like stress .
So instead of worrying do something to fix it .
Remember there 's no problems only solutions .
This morning I got a call from my uncle who is very high up in the military and he told me to leave the city now .
I hardly ever talk to him so he was unaware that I had already left LA .
But he seemed very concerned but refused to tell me why .
After about 20 minutes he told me the very basics .
The first thing he said was to buy as much can food and water as possible .
The second was to stock up on ammo .
I have already stacked up on ammo because I knew it would become very expensive later and in LA there was a 1 year wait for .223 bullets for my AR15 .
But I was still very confused as to why he 's calling out of the blue and telling me these things .
Well what he said next is something the american people are n't suppose to know .
He told me that there is an actual plan as to when the economy will completely crash .
As of right now he said it will happen in the middle of sept of this year .
Also he said that our Government will crash in Feb of 2009 .
He said that Mexico and Canada will merge with us and that a new dollar called the Amero is going to replace the dollar .
But the most scary thing is what he told me he 's been doing for the past couple of years .
He 's been overseeing the construction of Prison Camps being built all through out America .
He said a Private company called Haliburton is building them .
He told me that 1 camp in Alaska can hold 2 million people and there 's almost 1000 camps in the USA .
( not including the ones underground )
He also said that these will be used when they declare Martial Law .
There 's some more things but I promised him I would never repeat them .
But just knowing that this could even be possible makes me say to myself " why not buy an extra 20 or 30 bucks of food I can store " each time I go shopping .
I had about 2 weeks worth because in California you never know when that next big earthquake can hit not to mention the last year and a half we have been training on how to handle food riots in LA . (
By the way the first step in the LAPD process is to stand back and observe ) < Crazy Huh .
Well use common sense and get what you can because once everyone wakes up it will be to late .
Last but not least why I believe him is because he is the same one that told me beforehand not to fly in Aug and Sept of 2001 Do I have to go on ?
Take care everyone and GOD Bless !!!

Halliburton 's prison camps in America
Kellogg Brown & Root ( KBR ) , a Halliburton subsidiary , has been awarded a $ 385 million contract to construct a huge facility at an undisclosed location to hold tens of thousands of Bush 's " unlawful enemy combatants . "
Americans are certain to be among them .
Sort of reminds us of REX 84 ( Rediness Exercise 1984 ) .
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , is yet another step toward our supression .
Anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on Bush 's list of " terrorist " organizations , or who speaks out against the government 's policies could be declared an " unlawful enemy combatant " and imprisoned indefinitely .
That includes American citizens .
We can expect the Bush Administration to continue to exploit 9/11 to strip us of more of our liberties .
Our constitutional right to dissent is in serious jeopardy .
Benjamin Franklin 's prescient warning should give us pause : " They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security , deserve neither liberty or security .
When the food riots happen millions of people in the city will kill you for a drop of water .
Thats why you should move out .

But just knowing that this could even be possible makes me say to myself " why not buy an extra 20 or 30 bucks of food I can store " each time I go shopping .
I had about 2 weeks worth because in California you never know when that next big earthquake can hit not to mention the last year and a half we have been training on how to handle food riots in LA . (
By the way the first step in the LAPD process is to stand back and observe ) < Crazy Huh .
Well use common sense and get what you can because once everyone wakes up it will be to late .
Last but not least why I believe him is because he is the same one that told me beforehand not to fly in Aug and Sept of 2001 Do I have to go on ?
Take care everyone and GOD Bless !!!

Jack Cafferty says John McCain shows virtually no intellectual curiosity , emulating President Bush
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Russia invades Georgia and President Bush goes on vacation .
Our president has spent one - third of his entire two terms in office either at Camp David , Maryland , or at Crawford , Texas , on vacation .
His time away from the Oval Office included the month leading up to 9/11 , when there were signs Osama bin Laden was planning to attack America , and the time Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city of New Orleans .
Sen .
John McCain takes weekends off and limits his campaign events to one a day .
He made an exception for the religious forum on Saturday at Saddleback Church in Southern California .
I think he made a big mistake .
When he was invited last spring to attend a discussion of the role of faith in his life with Sens.
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , at Messiah College in Pennsylvania , McCain did n't bother to show up .
Now I know why .
It occurs to me that John McCain is as intellectually shallow as our current president .
When asked what his Christian faith means to him , his answer was a one - liner .
" It means I 'm saved and forgiven . "
Great scholars have wrestled with the meaning of faith for centuries .
McCain then retold a story we 've all heard a hundred times about a guard in Vietnam drawing a cross in the sand .
Asked about his greatest moral failure , he cited his first marriage , which ended in divorce .
While saying it was his greatest moral failing , he offered nothing in the way of explanation .
Why not ?
Throughout the evening , McCain chose to recite portions of his stump speech as answers to the questions he was being asked .
Why ?
He has lived 71 years .
Surely he has some thoughts on what it all means that go beyond canned answers culled from the same speech he delivers every day .
He was asked " if evil exists . "
His response was to repeat for the umpteenth time that Osama bin Laden is a bad man and he will pursue him to " the gates of hell . "
That was it .
He was asked to define rich .
After trying to dodge the question -- his wife is worth a reported $ 100 million -- he finally said he thought an income of $ 5 million was rich .
One after another , McCain 's answers were shallow , simplistic , and trite .
He showed the same intellectual curiosity that George Bush has -- virtually none .
Where are John McCain 's writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time ?
Where are his position papers setting forth his careful consideration of foreign policy , the welfare state , education , America 's moral responsibility in the world , etc. , etc. , etc . ?
John McCain graduated 894th in a class of 899 at the Naval Academy at Annapolis .
His father and grandfather were four star admirals in the Navy .
Some have suggested that might have played a role in McCain being admitted .
His academic record was awful .
And it shows over and over again whenever McCain is called upon to think on his feet .
He no longer allows reporters unfettered access to him aboard the " Straight Talk Express " for a reason .
He simply makes too many mistakes .
Unless he 's reciting talking points or reading from notes or a TelePrompTer , John McCain is lost .
He can drop bon mots at a bowling alley or diner -- short glib responses that get a chuckle , but beyond that McCain gets in over his head very quickly .
I am sick and tired of the president of the United States embarrassing me .
The world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into Vladimir Putin 's eyes and see into his soul .
George Bush 's record as a student , military man , businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure .
And the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself .
He will leave office with the country $ 10 trillion in debt , fighting two wars , our international reputation in shambles , our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises , our citizens ' faith in our own country ripped to shreds .
Yet Bush goes bumbling along , grinning and spewing moronic one - liners , as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been .
I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
All About John McCain • George W. Bush • Vladimir Putin
I hear something like this all too often : I want to vote for the party ( / candidate ) who is most in - line with my values .
Putting aside the fact this is probably not true about either candidate — McCain is an awfully liberal Conservative , and Obama is a pretty conservative Liberal — what really bugs me , especially about the Christian view point , is that this ‘ values based ’ voting is n’t working .
As someone raised with Christian values , I can say definitively that the “ values ” espoused by the most recent Republican president were not similar at all to mine .
Rather , it is the “ party line ” that claims to be Christian in nature .
What ’s clear is that this party line does not necessarily produce a Christ - like result .
Here ’s a tremendous example : Most evangelical Christians hold the belief that sex is for marriage .
Because of that fact , Conservatives would prefer to teach abstinence - only sex education .
We ’ve had a Conservative in power in the States for 8 years now , who ’s party holds firmly to that line .
What ’s interesting is that the approach — the purported “ value ” — has failed to make any difference .
Teenage pregnancy continues to soar , and in fact , is higher among evangelical Christians than any other religious group .
The value may be a good one , but the method of communicating it : fear , disinformation , threats … these things are n’t working .
It turns out that a much better approach is to teach teenagers the reality of the decision — to teach them about the risk and responsibility that comes along with the act , so that they ’re equipped to make the right decision .
You ca n’t teach a value without passing along the reasoning behind it — failing to do so makes the assumption that people are stupid and will follow blindly .
And this , I believe , is the central assumption in the Neo-Conservative movement .
We , the people , are expected to blindly follow our government because they ’ve claimed the moral high ground .
Because their stated values are conservative , every decision they make must be equally righteous .
But they ’re not .
Liberals do a far better job teaching children about the risks involved in pre-marital sex .
We may claim to have the better position , but the fact is , we ’ve failed to communicate it .
Similarily , we can claim to have the better position on abortion — surely killing babies is a horrific thing to have happen .
But we ca n’t legislate it out of existence .
Even if it were illegal , it would happen .
Is n’t it much better to , as a certain candidate recently advocated , try to educate and protect people better so that no one ever has to be faced with that choice ?
The reality is that voting Conservative does not guarantee that your values will be applied to your country .
It guarantees that the candidate who claims to share those values will get to leverage his claimed moral high ground to back his decisions in the press , and on the world stage … but look where that ’s gotten us …
Is n’t it better , then , to vote for someone who will put into place a process which will result in your values being applied ?
If your goal is to see less teen pregnancy , maybe its not better to vote for the gal who says “ pre-marital sex leads to damnation … and by the way , you ’re not allowed to ask me any questions about my unmarried teenage daughter who is pregnant , because that ’s private . ”
Maybe its better to vote for the guy who teaches his children “ teen pregnancy has the following observable and detrimental results … ”
Burying sin underneath a facade of moral values does n’t do anything to improve the state we ’re in .
Burying greed underneath a facade of ( self - ) righteous capitalism does n’t do anything to fix the economy .
Starting oil wars while claiming you ’re on a mission from God does n’t do anything to communicate the love of Christ .
And espousing hatred and fear at your political rallies because you like your voters ignorant and afraid wo n’t fix a nation on its knees .
God gave us brains — they ’re a special gift from Him that allows us to reason , understand and discern — that we can use to teach other .
God gave us His Word because it contains the best plan for His kids .
Everything
He asks of us makes sense .
We do n’t need to follow it out of fear or out of a desire to be holier than those other guys .
We should follow it , share its principles and apply them to our government because they make sense .
Doing so does not require everyone to believe the same thing as us — but we sure could share it a lot better if we did n’t push everyone into one of two obscenely polarized camps .
The New Yorker has an excellent article full of some of the sad facts behind this rant : that we , as evangelical Christians have , at best , failed to impact the world with our values … at worst we ’ve become pharisees : talking a righteous talk , judging everyone around us , but forgetting the message and not doing a lick of good for the world we ’re in .
New evidence from former U.S. officials reveals that the George W. Bush administration failed to adopt any plan to block the retreat of Osama bin Laden and other al - Qaeda leaders from Afghanistan to Pakistan in the first weeks after 9/11 .
That failure was directly related to the fact that top administration officials gave priority to planning for war with Iraq over military action against al - Qaeda in Afghanistan .
As a result , the United States had far too few troops and strategic airlift capacity in the theater to cover the large number of possible exit routes through the border area when bin Laden escaped in late 2001 .
Because it had not been directed to plan for that contingency , the U.S. military had to turn down an offer by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in late November 2001 to send 60,000 troops to the border passes to intercept them , according to accounts provided by former U.S. officials involved in the issue .
On Nov. 12 , 2001 , as Northern Alliance troops were marching on Kabul with little resistance , the CIA had intelligence that bin Laden was headed for a cave complex in the Tora Bora Mountains close to the Pakistani border .
The war had ended much more quickly than expected only days earlier .
CENTCOM commander Tommy Franks , who was responsible for the war in Afghanistan , had no forces in position to block bin Laden ’s exit .
Franks asked Lt. Gen. Paul T. Mikolashek , commander of Army Central Command ( ARCENT ) , whether his command could provide a blocking force between al - Qaeda and the Pakistani border , according to David W. Lamm , who was then commander of ARCENT Kuwait .
Lamm , a retired Army colonel , recalled in an interview that there was no way to fulfill the CENTCOM commander ’s request , because ARCENT had neither the troops nor the strategic lift in Kuwait required to put such a force in place .
" You looked at that request , and you just shook your head , " recalled Lamm , now chief of staff of the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University .
Franks apparently already realized that he would need Pakistani help in blocking the al - Qaeda exit from Tora Bora .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told a National Security Council meeting that Franks " wants the [ Pakistanis ] to close the transit points between Afghanistan and Pakistan to seal what ’s going in and out , " according to the National Security Council meeting transcript in Bob Woodward ’s book Bush at War .
Bush responded that they would need to " press Musharraf to do that . "
A few days later , Franks made an unannounced trip to Islamabad to ask Musharraf to deploy troops along the Pakistan - Afghan border near Tora Bora .
A deputy to Franks , Lt. Gen. Mike DeLong , later claimed that Musharraf had refused Franks ’ request for regular Pakistani troops to be repositioned from the north to the border near the Tora Bora area .
DeLong wrote in his 2004 book Inside Centcom that Musharraf had said he " could n’t do that , " because it would spark a " civil war " with a hostile tribal population .
But U.S. Ambassador Wendy Chamberlin , who accompanied Franks to the meeting with Musharraf , provided an account of the meeting to this writer that contradicts DeLong ’s claim .
Chamberlin , now president of the Middle East Institute in Washington , recalled that the Pakistani president told Franks that CENTCOM had vastly underestimated what was required to block bin Laden exit from Afghanistan .
Musharraf said , " Look you are missing the point : there are 150 valleys through which al - Qaeda are going to stream into Pakistan , " according to Chamberlin .
Although Musharraf admitted that the Pakistani government had never exercised control over the border area , the former diplomat recalled , he said this was " a good time to begin . "
The Pakistani president offered to redeploy 60,000 troops to the area from the border with India but said his army would need airlift assistance from the United States to carry out the redeployment .
But the Pakistani redeployment never happened , according to Lamm , because it was n’t logistically feasible .
Lamm recalled that it would have required an entire aviation brigade , including hundreds of helicopters , and hundreds of support troops to deliver that many combat troops to the border region  far more than was available .
Lamm said the ARCENT had so few strategic lift resources that it had to use commercial aircraft at one point to move U.S. supplies in and out of Afghanistan .
Even if the helicopters had been available , however , they could not have operated with high effectiveness in the mountainous Afghanistan - Pakistan border region near the Tora Bora caves , according to Lamm , because of the combination of high altitude and extreme weather .
Franks did manage to insert 1,200 Marines to Kandahar on Nov. 26 to establish control of the airbase there .
They were carried to the base by helicopters from an aircraft carrier that had steamed into the Gulf from the Pacific , according to Lamm .
The Marines patrolled roads in the Kandahar area hoping to intercept al - Qaeda officials heading toward Pakistan .
But DeLong , now retired from the Army , said in an interview that the Marines would not have been able to undertake the blocking mission at the border .
" It would n’t have worked  even if we could have gotten them up there , " he said .
" There were n’t enough to police 1,500 kilometers of border . "
U.S. troops probably would also have faced armed resistance from the local tribal population in the border region , according to DeLong .
The tribesmen in local villages near the border " liked bin Laden , " he said " because he had given them millions of dollars . "
Had the Bush administration ’s priority been to capture or kill the al - Qaeda leadership , it would have deployed the necessary ground troops and airlift resources in the theater over a period of months before the offensive in Afghanistan began .
" You could have moved American troops along the Pakistani border before you went into Afghanistan , " said Lamm .
But that would have meant waiting until spring 2002 to take the offensive against the Taliban , according to Lamm .
The views of Bush ’s key advisers , however , ruled out any such plan from the start .
During the summer of 2001 , Rumsfeld had refused to develop contingency plans for military action against al - Qaeda in Afghanistan despite a National Security Presidential Directive adopted at the Deputies ’ Committee level in July and by the Principles on Sept. 4 that called for such planning , according to the 9/11 Commission report .
Rumsfeld and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz resisted such planning for Afghanistan because they were hoping that the White House would move quickly on military intervention in Iraq .
According to the 9/11 Commission , at four deputies ’ meetings on Iraq between May 31 and July 26 , 2001 , Wolfowitz pushed his idea to have U.S. troops seize all the oil fields in southern Iraq .
Even after Sept. 11 , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , and Vice President Dick Cheney continued to resist any military engagement in Afghanistan , because they were hoping for war against Iraq instead .
Bush ’s top secret order of Sept. 17 for war with Afghanistan also directed the Pentagon to begin planning for an invasion of Iraq , according to journalist James Bamford ’s book Pretext for War .
Cheney and Rumsfeld pushed for a quick victory in Afghanistan in NSC meetings in October , as recounted by both Woodward and Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith .
Lost in the eagerness to wrap up the Taliban and get on with the Iraq War was any possibility of preventing bin Laden ’s escape to Pakistan .

Trump : Bush impeachment would be ' wonderful thing '
RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday October 15 , 2008
Print This Email This ( AFP ) - Property mogul and diehard Republican Donald Trump told CNN on Wednesday that President George W. Bush misled the US into the Iraq War and should have been impeached when the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006 .
" I was surprised that she did n't do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush , " Trump said in an interview with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , referring to Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
" It ... just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office , which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing . "
Trump , 62 , said Bush misled the United States into waging war on Iraq , a much worse offense than a dalliance with a White House intern his predecessor Bill Clinton was impeached for in 1999 .
" He lied .
He got us into the war with lies , " Trump said about Bush .
" And I mean -- look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant .
And they tried to impeach him , which was nonsense .
" And yet Bush got us into this horrible war with lies , by lying , by saying they had weapons of mass destruction , by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true , " he added .
On the race for the White House , Trump said he was rooting for John McCain to win the November 4 election , and felt sure he could overtake his Democrat rival Barack Obama , whom he trails in opinion polls , in the next three weeks .
" He 's a very smart guy , he 's a tough guy , " he said .
" I think he'd be a great president .
But , he has to be John McCain and he could still probably pull it out .
" But , it 's going to be tough . "
McCain and Obama face off in their third and final televised debate late Wednesday in New York state .
Trump inherited a real estate empire and added an airline , casino , resorts , hotels , skyscrapers in New York , around the world and named them after himself , turning his name into a sort of brand .
He also owns a television show , " The Apprentice , " in which he appears , as well as the Miss Universe contest .

Were software patches that did n't fix problems but instead changed results applied to electronic voting machines in two Georgia counties ?
Were the patches applied at the instruction of a top Diebold executive , without informing local election officials ?
This charge has been leveled several times since a rather surprising election in which two Democratic candidates had comfortable leads in polls just before Election Day yet lost by substantial margins .
Of course , there 's a strong correlation between your degree of suspicion of those results and which party you support .
But we should all be frightened if there 's no way to prove that tampering did n't occur .
And when voting machines are electronic , paperless and proprietary , it 's all but impossible to do a recount or check for errors in a way that can uncover a malicious hack ( or honest mistake ) .
Tech professionals across the political spectrum should be unhappy with that kind of system .
Election consultant Chris Hood told Rolling Stone magazine that he was working for Diebold in Georgia in 2002 when the head of the company 's election division arrived to distribute a patch to workers .
That code was applied to only about 5,000 machines in two counties .
Hood says it was an unauthorized patch that was kept hidden from state officials .
( Diebold says the state approved the update , although state officials have since asked for more information on the patch 's effect . )
The Georgia allegations are disturbing but , sadly , not unique .
An attorney and IT security consultant last month cited that incident to renew challenges to 2004 Ohio elections , which had a similar mix of paperless Diebold machines and statistically curious results .
In Alabama , questions linger about a supposed " glitch " that caused officials to change the winner of the governor 's race six years ago ; a research paper presented to the Alabama Political Science Association later described the new , changed results as statistically " anomalous " and outlined a possible scenario of vote - counting fraud .
Paper is n't perfect , as Florida 's " hanging chad " fiasco of 2000 painfully demonstrated .
And paper systems are n't necessarily 100 percent secure ; it 's certainly possible to destroy or alter paper ballots locally .
But unprecedented statewide and even nationwide tampering with elections is theoretically possible when a company controls the counting devices without the independent verification that paper receipts provide .
Without paper ballots , there 's no way for candidates -- or voters -- to contest a suspicious result , since each person 's action must remain anonymous .
There 's a simple answer to all of this : paper ballots that are scanned and counted by machines .
Automated ballot counting is much quicker than manual counting , but retallying by hand is still possible should the results be doubted .
These systems have the added benefit of being able to easily process large numbers of voters when turnout is unusually high , preventing hours - long waits at polls due to a lack of functioning machines .
It 's a lot easier to ramp up for an unexpected crowd if all you have to do is hand out more paper ballots .
If election officials insist on an electronic system , they should require a paper printout that voters can verify and deposit in a secure storage area .
Those paper ballots can then be counted by hand if need be , and electronic results can be confirmed .
Those of us who vote on paperless machines , whether with touch screens or levers , can never be confident that our votes will be properly submitted , registered and counted .
That leaves our elections under perpetual suspicion , whichever candidates prevail .
It 's time to outlaw any voting machine that does n't offer the possibility of a paper - based recount .

It 's not often that I get surprised by a game — and even less frequently when its a game on the Wii .
But this week , after popping in Disaster : Day of Crisis , I was quite literally ( Ed. note : see the comments ) blown away .
Here is a game that should , by rights , be something of a mess .
The on - rails shooting , the third - person running around and the gesture - controlled action sequences put plenty of ideas into the pot .
Add to this pretty much every cataclysmic plot idea you can imagine and you have a recipe for disaster ( excuse the pun ) .
However , playing the game soon shows how well directed the whole experience is .
Because it understands what sort of game it is , it can deliver .
What results is a well - balanced shooting game with a perfectly brash arcade style .
It 's an experience that easily won me over and had me playing for many hours in my first sitting .
Shooting games can go two ways : free - roaming first person or on - rails pre-scripted action .
* Disaster : Day of Crisis * takes the on - rails formula and wraps it up in a free - roaming environment that is equally convincing .
What sort of game is this ?
Shooting games present a world in which the character must shoot their way out of dangerous situations .
They provide the player with an array of weapons tailored to specific tasks .
This unavoidably involves a combination of fisticuffs and gun-based fighting that dictates the violent nature of these experiences .
Beneath this harsh exterior though is often an intricate tactile game — and this is usually what drives the player .
What does this game add to the genre ?
Sitting between a third - person free - roaming game and an on - rails shooter ( with a little adventuring thrown in for good measure ) makes Disaster : Day of Crisis something of a jack - of - all - trades .
That said , it is most convincing and polished as an arcade ( read : coin- operated machine ) shooter .
The game 's polish and first - party development ( read : Nintendo pumped in some cash ) values create the feel of classic arcade shooters like Virtua Cop and Time Crisis .
In the shooting sections you can press a button to hide behind cover and shake the nunchuck to reload .
Once you are ready to fire you can also press C to zoom in for a head shot .
Other aspects of the game include exploration of environments in third - person view , locating and rescuing civilians .
Here you also get a chance to recharge your health , stamina and stocks of munitions with various hidden items .
Although this has all been seen before , Disaster : Day of Crisis ' polished delivery makes the whole experience thoroughly enjoyable .
The shooter sections are extended by the ability to advance your characters ' abilities and weapon selection as you progress .
Add this to the detailed end of level scores ( again in keeping with the arcade style ) and you have plenty of reason to replay levels .
What do people play this game to experience ?
It 's the quality of the experience that draws players to Disaster : Day of Crisis .
The on - rails shooter - style game is something of a rarity these days — so the chance to play one that pushes the Wii to its limits is pretty attractive .
It is also refreshing to find a game that can engage with an older audience .
Jumping into a new level and watching the well - captured and voiced cut - screen introduce today 's disaster gives a real sense of playing within a summer blockbuster movie .
Raising the Wiimote to your ear to hear the crackly radio broadcast from its speaker is an ingenious touch .
Plunging your way through the ( appropriately ) roller coaster - like levels keeps you locked in all the way .
Popping out the other side , stumbling into the disaster averted clean air simply makes you want to do it all again ( much like the aforementioned roller coaster rides ) .
How much free time is required to play it ?
Disaster : Day of Crisis takes a little time to work out .
Fans of its constituent parts ( shooter , third person and adventure ) need to adjust its amorphous approach .
working through the first mountain side rescue setting does a good job of introducing the basics .
Most levels can be played through in 45 minutes or so .
Although you can save progress at the end of each level , if you do run out of time before you are through you need to start from the beginning in you next session .
However , such is the re-playability of the game that this is n't as big a draw back as you may think .
What factors impact on suitability for novice / expert young / old players ?
Let 's say straight away , Disaster : Day of Crisis is a great game for a more grown - up audience .
The plot ( although appropriately cheesy ) feels just like a blockbuster disaster movie .
The fact that this is then followed up by some compelling gameplay make it a good fit for the intermediate grown - up audience .
Expert players may find the slightly older on - rails approach to be a little dated , although this is no reason to discount the experience .
In fact it is a game that will provide more than enough challenge ( particularly in its re-playable levels ) for the most adroit of gamers .
Shooters are by their nature violent , something that needs to be considered for younger gamers .
The inevitable deaths are quite realistic although there is no excessive blood or gore .
The edge of the seat nature of Disaster : Day of Crisis adds a high degree of suspense and peril to proceedings that younger players may find distressing .
Whereas , the running around sections should be pretty straight forward for most ages and abilities , the Wiimote pointing and shooting can be fiddly to get the hang of for very young or inexperienced players .
For those comfortable with the action this is a good game to be played by parents and offspring in turn taking fashion .

FRANKFURT , Germany ( AP ) –
The world ’s major central banks banded together on Thursday to inject as much as $ 180 billion into money markets in a bid to stave off the growing global financial crisis .
Meanwhile , President Bush canceled his travel plans and addressed the United States about the economy .
The Federal Reserve joined with the European Central Bank , the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank to pump more short - term dollar liquidity into the financial system .
Credit markets have tightened since Monday after the weekend collapse of investment house Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , and central banks already provided billions Monday and Tuesday in hopes of turning the tide and to keep fearful banks from hoarding cash .
In its statement , the Fed said it had authorized a $ 180 billion expansion of swap lines , or reciprocal currency arrangements , with the other central banks , including amounts up to $ 110 billion by the ECB and up to $ 27 billion by the Swiss National Bank .
The Fed also said new swap facilities had been authorized with the Bank of Japan for as much as $ 60 billion ; $ 40 billion for the Bank of England and $ 10 billion for the Bank of Canada .
“ These measures , together with other actions taken in the last few days by individual central banks , are designed to improve the liquidity conditions in global financial markets .
The central banks continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures , ” the Fed said in a statement on its Web site .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) – President Bush says he shares the American people ’s concern about the situation in U.S. financial markets and the economy .
Bush says the markets are adjusting to “ extraordinary measures ” the government has taken to stabilize the economy .
The president delivered a statement to the America people from just outside the Oval Office .
He said that he and his advisers are working to promote stability in the markets .
But Bush did not announce any new policy moves .
The Federal Reserve joined with the European Central Bank , the Bank of England , the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank to pump more short - term dollar liquidity into the financial system .
Credit markets have tightened since Monday after the weekend collapse of investment house Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , and central banks already provided billions Monday and Tuesday in hopes of turning the tide and to keep fearful banks from hoarding cash .
The hope is that that would help stabilize world financial markets that have been reeling .
In its statement , the Fed said it had authorized a $ 180 billion expansion of swap lines , or reciprocal currency arrangements , with the other central banks , including amounts up to $ 110 billion by the ECB and up to $ 27 billion by the Swiss National Bank .
The Fed also said new swap facilities had been authorized with the Bank of Japan for as much as $ 60 billion ; $ 40 billion for the Bank of England and $ 10 billion for the Bank of Canada .
The Bank of Canada said it was “ not necessary ” to draw on the swap facility at the moment .
“ These measures , together with other actions taken in the last few days by individual central banks , are designed to improve the liquidity conditions in global financial markets .
The central banks continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures , ” the Fed said in a statement on its Web site .

Wall Street stocks plunged Wednesday in a day of frenzied trading amid signs that distress among the nation ’s financial giants is growing while the U.S. government ’s ability and willingness to bail them out is shrinking .
Panicked banks sought out mergers that would help ensure solvency .
Washington Mutual , the giant savings bank riddled with debt problems , offered itself for sale , while Wachovia bank announced new losses and approached Morgan Stanley about a merger that would provide the investment house with a more stable deposit funding base while expanding the bank ’s access to capital .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 450 points — its second massive decline this week — as the financial world absorbed the news that American International Group had to surrender control of itself to the government in order to get an $ 85 billion lifesaving loan from the Federal Reserve .
Investors and analysts alike interpreted the government ’s terms for the AIG bailout as an overt effort to ward off further pleas for federal help .
AIG “ pays a steep price ” for the rescue , said Robert Brusca , economist at FAO Economics .
“ Any firm tottering on the edge here is not going to feel that there is a safety net it will want to fall into .
Think Vietnam - era death pits with punji sticks at the bottom . ”
The government ’s own financial outlook took a beating in the $ 85 billion loan deal for AIG .
When added to the potential $ 200 billion rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earlier this month , the $ 29 billion rescue of Bear Stearns in March and increasing bank failures , it leaves the U.S. government in a “ weakened ” financial state though it retains its AAA rating , Standard & Poor ’s Corp. said Wednesday .
Gold prices soared to their highest levels in nine years as investors worried that the deepening credit crisis may tarnish the gleaming reputation of even the U.S. Treasury and its safe - haven securities .
The political world debated the merits of the AIG bailout while the Bush administration explained that it abandoned its free - market policy to rescue the insurer because it was essential to stabilize the broader economy .
Mr. Brusca said the deal may not be as generous as it appears , in part because the government is charging “ an extremely high rate ” of interest on the loans — 8.5 percent above the London Interbank Offered Rate — which will encourage AIG to quickly sell off assets and pay back the Fed .
“ The Fed will get a profit on this , which it should , ” he said .
The deal appears structured similarly to the Chrysler bailout in the 1980s , giving the Treasury warrants or special shares representing 79.9 percent control of AIG .
In addition , the Fed forced out AIG ’s chief executive , Robert Willumstad , and replaced him with Edward Liddy , a former Allstate executive .
“ It was not a nationalization because the Fed does not intend to run AIG , ” Mr. Brusca said .
Edward Hadas , analyst at Breakingviews.com , said the AIG rescue “ leaves the door open to many more costly rescues .
But the damage to the country ’s financial reputation could prove even more painful . ”
Even more expensive bailouts may be looming , he said .
“ The tab could rise quite soon .
Washington Mutual , the largest thrift in the U.S. , is under threat after the rating agencies downgraded its debt to junk , ” and other banks are likely to follow , Mr. Hadas said .
“ When it comes to conventional banks , the government is on the hook through deposit insurance . ”
While the AIG deal was alarming to stock investors in financial firms , it helped to ease strains in the credit markets .
The Fed ’s loan will enable AIG to meet all of its credit and insurance commitments while trying to raise money by selling some of the company ’s sound businesses .
“ This takeover of AIG forestalls to some extent the recent dangerous escalation of the crisis in the U.S. financial markets — a crisis that has been seriously harming the performance of the economy for over a year now , ” said Brian Bethune , chief economist at Global Insight .
“ However , the risks to the financial system and the economy remain massive , and downward pressure on financial asset prices - and the value of their underlying collateral - continues to mount . ”
Some political and financial officials were disgusted with the Fed ’s actions .
“ Where does this stop ?
What other troubled companies will the Fed nationalize , and how much will it cost ? ” asked Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital .
“ AIG is not a bank ; it is not even an investment bank .
The ‘ lender of last resort ’ power was supposed to apply only to banks . ”
“ The move represents the largest lurch toward socialism that this country has ever seen , and signals the end of the vibrancy of America ’s once - vaunted free - market economy , ” he said .
“ Today ’s historic surge in the price of gold shows that at least a few investors are refusing to march in the parade . ”

David Cameron has broken his truce with Gordon Brown over the financial crisis and launched a stinging attack on the PM 's handling of the economy .
He said Mr Brown 's strategy had " fundamentally failed " and accused him of hiding from past policy failures .
The Tory leader said he still supported the PM's bank rescue plan but said Mr Brown 's mistakes had led to a downturn .
Mr Brown brushed off the comments saying his undivided attention was on taking Britain through difficult times .
He said the current crisis had " been created as a result of a global problem that started in America " .
And he added : " I think the whole country wants everybody who can to work together through these difficult challenges .
" ' Irresponsible '
The prime minister has closed the gap on the Conservatives in the opinion polls since since the global financial system went into meltdown , with Mr Cameron holding off on direct attacks to avoid accusations of playing politics .
But the gloves came off earlier , in a speech in the City of London , with the Tory leader attacking Mr Brown 's " irresponsible " economic policies which he said had created an unsustainable boom .
" We need change to mend our broken economy .
This lot cannot do it - not least because they cannot own up to any mistakes , " said the Tory leader .
Mr Cameron said decisions made by Mr Brown when he was chancellor had led to a period of " irresponsible capitalism " and only the Conservatives had a plan to bring it back under control .
The complete and utter failure of their economic record has never been more clear to see
David Cameron
He said he would " never pull my punches in explaining how this government has brought Britain down " and accused Mr Brown of a " complete and utter failure " in economic policy .
He argued that New Labour had embraced free market economics " without question " without " properly understanding how it worked " .
And he said Mr Brown had " spent and borrowed without restraint " and ignored warnings about the consequences .
The failure to control public and private spending over the past decade , leading to unsustainable debt levels , was an act of " intentional " negligence on the part of the government .

The Tory leader accused the prime minister of basing his economic policy on " false assumptions " .
Among them were the ideas that a successful economy could be built on a " narrow base of housing , public spending and financial services " and " that you could abolish boom and bust and that the good times would last forever " .
" Over the past decade , we have seen a total breakdown of economic responsibility , " he added .
In contrast , Mr Cameron said he would entrench fiscal responsibility in government by setting up a new independent body - the Office of Budget Responsibility - to hold ministerial spending to account .
The BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson said it was Mr Cameron 's objective to persuade people that Gordon Brown was the architect of the economic problems not failures in the global financial system .
' Economic failure '
Mr Cameron called for a range of new measures which he said would create a more " balanced and resilient economy " , saying Britain had become too dependent on property and financial services to generate its wealth .
He wants to see much tougher regulation of the banking sector and changes to the insolvency laws to protect sound but struggling businesses .
The Tories have had enough of hearing that Gordon Brown is a super hero and they 've decided to try to bring him down to earth
Nick Robinson
BBC political editor
Read Nick 's blog in full " Some people think that this decision - to support recapitalisation - means that we somehow now subscribe to the government 's entire economic policy and doctrine , " said the Tory leader .
" Let me make it crystal clear - we do not .
" And the complete and utter failure of their economic record has never been more clear to see . "
Ahead of Mr Cameron 's speech , Shadow Chancellor George Osborne rejected claims the Conservatives had effectively agreed with Labour 's economic agenda for most of the past decade and only recently raised concerns .
" We fought general elections on the fact that government had overextended itself and borrowing needed to be brought under control , " he told the BBC .
' Juvenile ' Chief Secretary to the Treasury , Yvette Cooper , accused the Tory leader of indulging in " juvenile political games " .
" It is disappointing the day after the CBI called on the Tories to avoid playing party politics David Cameron has descended to do exactly that , " she said .
" It is ever more clear that the strategy of bipartisanship adopted by David Cameron at his party conference was just a short - term gimmick to get on the news , exactly the same rationale as his intervention today .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's frustrating Cameron feels the need to turn a financial crisis into a political spat E Anderson , Oxford " But at a time when the British people want calm leadership and serious policies to get through tougher times , David Cameron is engaged in playing juvenile political games . "
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservatives had " nothing of real substance " to say about the economic difficulties facing people , saying his party was the first to warn of the UK's " debt bubble " .
" People want practical help at a time of recession not Westminster political point scoring , " he said .

What are these ?
The financial meltdown engulfing Wall Street would not have happened without the advent of complex financial contracts known as derivatives .
Why were they created , and why were so many supposedly smart people fooled ?
What is a derivative ?
In a very real sense , it ’s a bet .
A derivative is a contract in which an investor agrees to pay for either a commodity or financial instrument at a set price today , in return for the right to take profits if that asset ’s value rises .
Some derivatives , such as stock options and commodities futures , have been used for years and are considered completely benign .
A farmer , for example , can agree to sell a ton of wheat he ’ll harvest in three months to a major grain buyer for $ 1,000 .
That deal enables the farmer to lock in the price of wheat as he ’s growing it .
In exchange for that guarantee , the grain buyer gets an assurance he ’ll have a steady supply of grain while also safeguarding against future price increases .
Both sides , in other words , reduce risk and future uncertainties .
But in recent years , a new , highly toxic form of financial derivative has spread like wildfire throughout the financial system , ultimately laying waste to some of Wall Street ’s oldest and most prestigious firms .
What are these new derivatives ?
They ’re called credit derivatives , and were designed to serve as a kind of insurance against borrowers defaulting on their debts .
Credit derivatives first appeared on the scene in the boom of the 1990s , but really became popular in the early 2000s , when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sought to stave off a post - 9/11 recession by slashing interest rates from 6.5 percent to 1 percent .
Money became very easy to borrow , and tens of millions of people bought homes or took out second mortgages , many of which were offered to financially shaky buyers at “ subprime ’ ’ rates .
Those mortgages were then bundled into securities , and firms such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch created credit derivatives to protect investors in case the securities defaulted .
Why were these securities so popular ?
They provided above - market rates of return , and because these complex instruments were so poorly understood , they seemed more solid — and less risky — than they really were .
Investors thought that they were getting AAA - rated securities .
The sellers — caught up in the assumption that housing prices would continue to rise indefinitely — also thought they were safe from losses .
Each security involved hundreds or thousands of individual mortgages , chopped into pieces , so that the risk of default appeared small .
And by selling them , investment banks and brokerage firms made hundreds of millions in upfront fees and premium payments .
That ’s why global insurance giant AIG also jumped into the derivatives game .
“ It is hard for us , without being flippant , to see us losing even one dollar in any of those transactions , ” Joseph Cassano , then AIG ’s head of credit derivatives , declared last year , expressing a common sentiment .
Was everyone so clueless ?
No .
Concern about financial derivatives first surfaced in the late 1990s , and congressional Democrats launched a drive to bring them under federal oversight .
The effort was beaten back by Republicans led by then­ –Sen .
Phil Gramm of Texas , who pushed through a law that explicitly exempted financial derivatives from federal regulation .
By 2003 , the pace of derivatives trading had exploded , leading Warren Buffett , one of the world ’s most successful investors , to call derivatives “ financial weapons of mass destruction . ”
Why was Buffett alarmed ?
Because the well - being of the entire global financial system rested in part on a hidden world of multitrillion - dollar bets that financial regulators could n’t control or even monitor .
Indeed , since 2000 , credit default swaps became one of Wall Street ’s most popular products , with firms such as AIG , Lehman Brothers , and Bear Stearns selling swaps covering trillions of dollars in bonds .
At Cassano ’s urging , AIG became the biggest player in the field , selling protection on $ 527 billion in bonds .
So what went wrong ?
Home prices started to fall and interest rates started to rise .
When rates rose , many subprime borrowers with adjustable - rate mortgages found themselves unable to make their monthly payments .
They also could n’t sell , because the demand for houses began to crash .
Very quickly , as defaults mounted , the derivatives that had made so many bankers and investors rich lost their value .
In turn , firms such as AIG and Lehman , which had guaranteed these securities , could n’t meet their debts .
It was a worst - case scenario , causing the collapse of many banks and investment firms .
Despite the federal government ’s rescue efforts , many financial executives worry that further damage is yet to come , because of bad debt hidden in other banks ’ derivative holdings .
“ It ’s not the corpses you can see that scare you , ” says one Wall Street banker .
“ It ’s the corpses you ca n’t see that could pop out at any time . ”
Can derivatives be brought under control ?
Washington and Wall Street are struggling to find a way .
One of the most popular ideas is to set up a clearinghouse for all financial derivatives trades .
Regulators would monitor the clearinghouse to be sure that no market player took on more risk than it could afford .
And firms would have to keep money on deposit to show that they could honor their guarantees .
The question now is whether safeguards can be put in place before another AIG - style meltdown unfolds .
“ If it all goes horribly wrong , it will not be just Wall Street that suffers , ” says veteran investor Michael Panzer , who has warned against derivatives for years .
“ Those seeking a mortgage , a college education , a job , or even day - to - day sustenance will be left wanting . ”
The derivatives in your portfolio
If some of your savings are in a mutual fund , you ’re probably an investor in derivatives .
Many bond funds , including the nine most widely held funds , use derivatives both to protect against losses and to increase returns , because these swaps can appreciate in value when the prospects for a company and the overall economy improve .
Funds are n’t required to disclose derivatives holdings , although those that make them a major part of their strategy typically do so .
To see if your fund holds derivatives , check its prospectus and the listing of holdings contained in Securities and Exchange Commission form NQ .
Those forms can be accessed at Sec.gov .
If you ’re still unsure about your fund ’s holdings and do n’t want to take the chance , financial advisors say , do n’t hesitate to switch to an ultra - safe government bond fund .
“ Do n’t be complacent , ” says financial advisor Lawrence Glazer .
“ If you are uncomfortable with something , do n’t be afraid to make a change . ”
SAN FRANCISCO 
For months , Google has promised investors that the company ’s online advertising system would do relatively well in an economic downturn .
On Thursday , it showed evidence that it may be able to deliver on that promise .
Google said that its growth rate continued to slow in the third quarter .
But the company fared better than Wall Street expected as it reported a solid 26 percent jump in net income to $ 1.35 billion , or $ 4.24 a share , from $ 1.07 billion in the third quarter of 2007 .
The company ’s results were bolstered by strong gains in online advertising and efforts by Google to slow hiring and rein in costs .
Google ’s shares , which rose to $ 353.02 , or 4 percent , in regular trading on Thursday , jumped another 10 percent after the company reported its financial results .
However , they remain down sharply from their high of just over $ 740 last November .
Google ’s chief executive , Eric E. Schmidt , said the results reflected marketers ’ acceptance of a system that is better and more measurable than other forms of advertising .
He said that while the economic environment was unpredictable , Google was poised to continue doing relatively well .

Every adventure begins with a first step and so it is with the creative world of digital infrared ( IR ) imaging .
That first step is to have a basic understanding of infrared light .
Technically speaking , in IR digital photography , infrared light ( invisible wavelengths to our eyes ) is recorded , as opposed to visible light ( the light that we normally see and the light our cameras normally record ) .
The name infrared comes from the combination of the Latin word “ infra , ” which means below , and red ( which has the longest wavelength visible to our eyes ) .
The IR wavelength is below that of red .
In IR photography , some of the reality is removed from the scene , giving us a more creative and artistic image .
Green grass , foliage , and trees look white — having an ethereal glow .
An IR picture can also look like a dramatic black - and - white image , with a black sky punctuated by brilliant white clouds .
We can even create an IR image that shows part of the image in black - and - white and part of it in color , as we see in the opening picture for this article , which I took at Bodie State Historic Park ( a real ghost town ) in California .
What more could a creative digital photographer ask for ?
Making the change
For creative digital photographers , there ’s a very easy way to get into IR imaging .
Life Pixel ( www.lifepixel.com) and IRdigital ( www.irdigital.net) convert compact and SLR Canon and Nikon digital cameras to IR - only cameras .
They do this by removing the filter that ’s normally over the image sensor and replacing it with a filter that filters out visible light , leaving only IR light to fall on the sensor .
Even with the original filter removed , however , IR images need some Photoshop help with color , contrast , and brightness .
The opening image for this article is one of my favorite IR images .
I shot it with my IR - converted Canon SD800 compact camera .
As you can see , the sky is blue but the landscape is black - and - white — a popular IR effect that ’s easy to create in Photoshop .
The technique
In landscape photography , my technique is to expose for the highlights so that they ’re not washed out and overexposed .
When shooting with my IR camera on automatic mode , that usually means setting the exposure compensation to – 1 .
Then , in Photoshop , I use the Shadow / Highlight adjustment ( Image > Adjustments > Shadow / Highlight ) to open up the shadows .
Those techniques make shooting into the sun relatively easy .
Okay , here ’s how to create the popular blue - sky effect , no matter what camera you have converted .
( Hey , it ’s only one technique , one that works for me . )
STEP ONE :
Set the IR - converted camera to Manual and choose Custom as the white balance setting .
Now , fill the frame with green grass and set the Custom white balance for the grass .
Now all the green tones in your image will look white .
Out - of - the camera image with custom white balance
STEP TWO :
Create a Hue / Saturation adjustment layer ( Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Hue / Saturation ) .
In the New Layer dialog , choose Color as the Mode , then in the Hue / Saturation dialog , move the Hue slider completely to the left and click OK .
At this point , the greens will look white , but the other parts of the image will have an ethereal blue tint .
Now , flatten the layers ( Layer > Flatten Image ) .
Image adjusted with Hue / Saturation
STEP THREE :
Create a duplicate layer ( Layer > Duplicate Layer ) .
You now have two identical layers , one on top of the other , both with a bluish tint .
Click on the bottom layer in the Layers panel .
Go to Image > Adjustments >
Hue / Saturation and completely desaturate that layer ( drag the Saturation slider to – 100 ) .
You ’re almost done !
Click on the top layer .
Select the Eraser tool ( E ) from the Toolbox and erase the area you want to be black - and - white .
As with most digital files , you can create a more dramatic image by adjusting Curves , Levels , or Brightness / Contrast .
I ’ve found this to be especially true with IR images .
So play around with these adjustments to see how you can create more dramatic images .
Blue sky and black - and - white landscape
Variations on a theme
I share the following examples , illustrating different techniques and results , because different photographers like different IR effects .
Grayscale IR : Want an IR image with the look of IR film ( basically a grayscale image ) like this image that I took in Yosemite National Park ?
That ’s easy with an IR - converted camera .
Leave the white balance on Auto then when you open your image in Photoshop , simply desaturate it using a Hue / Saturation adjustment layer .
In Auto mode , however , the blue - sky effect will not be an option .
What ’s more , on your camera ’s LCD monitor , your picture will have a reddish tint , as opposed to looking more like a black - and - white image when you manually set the white balance .
Yosemite National Park
Pseudo IR effect : Creating a pseudo IR effect from an RGB image in Photoshop is easy , which is what I did here from a color file of the church at Bodie .
I admit it does n’t look exactly like an IR photo .
( That ’s why I call it a pseudo effect . )
First , convert your color file to a black - and - white image ( Image > Mode > Grayscale ) .
Next , apply the Diffuse Glow filter ( Filter > Distort > Diffuse Glow ) .
For different effects , play around with the fade filter command ( Edit > Fade Diffuse Glow ) and the contrast of the image ( Image > Adjustments > Brightness / Contrast ) .
Pseudo IR effect
Ethereal blue tint :
As mentioned at the beginning of this article , IR images can look more artistic and creative than color images .
Shooting in IR can also make you see and picture the world more creatively .
These two images , taken at the same location — the ruins of a 1930s country club not far from my home in Croton - on - Hudson , NY — vividly illustrate that point .
The IR image has a blue tint , created using the technique described above .
The unworldly image gave me the idea to use a “ mirror ” effect to create a pond ( that is n’t there ) for an even more creative image .
( The frame was created using a Brush frame from PhotoFrame Pro 3 [ www.ononesoftware.com].)
For this and all my IR images , I set the exposure compensation on my camera to – 1 so as not to blow out ( overexpose ) the highlights in a scene .
That ’s because my camera only shoots JPEG files .
If you shoot RAW files , you can rescue up to one stop of overexposed areas in Adobe Camera Raw .
Still , be on the lookout for overexposed areas on your camera ’s LCD monitor when you ’re shooting , because sometimes with IR photography , the white subjects can be much brighter than the rest of the scene .
So , if you ’re stuck creatively , try your hand at IR photography .
I think you ’ll enjoy the creative opportunity it offers .
What ’s more , once you get into IR photography , you may start to “ see the world in IR , ” as I now do when I travel with my IR camera .
P.S. I always like to give credit where credit is due , so I ’d like to thank Deborah Sandidge ( www.deborahsandidge.com) for inspiring me to work in IR photography .
I ’d known about IR imaging for years , but it was n’t until I saw her work at a photography event that I decided to give it a whirl .
WASHINGTON  The Treasury Department , in its boldest move yet , is expected to announce a plan on Tuesday to invest up to $ 250 billion in banks , according to officials .
The United States is also expected to guarantee new debt issued by banks for three years  a measure meant to encourage the banks to resume lending to one another and to customers , officials said .
And the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will offer an unlimited guarantee on bank deposits in accounts that do not bear interest  typically those of businesses  bringing the United States in line with several European countries , which have adopted such blanket guarantees .
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 936 points , or 11 percent , the largest single - day gain in the American stock market since the 1930s .
The surge stretched around the globe : in Paris and Frankfurt , stocks had their biggest one - day gains ever , responding to news of similar multibillion - dollar rescue packages by the French and German governments .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. outlined the plan to nine of the nation ’s leading bankers at an afternoon meeting , officials said .
He essentially told the participants that they would have to accept government investment for the good of the American financial system .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention failed to act for at least a year on warnings that trailers housing refugees from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita contained dangerous levels of formaldehyde , according to a House subcommittee report released Monday .
Instead , the CDC ’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry demoted the scientist who questioned its initial assessment that the trailers were safe as long as residents opened a window or another vent , the report said .
That appraisal was produced in February 2007 at the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which had received thousands of complaints about fumes since providing the trailers to families left homeless by the devastating 2005 hurricanes .
One year later , FEMA and CDC reversed course and acknowledged that formaldehyde levels in the trailers were five times higher than are typically found in new housing .
Formaldehyde is known to cause cancer , chronic bronchitis , eye irritation and other ailments .
It was used in glue for rugs , plywood , fiberboard and other materials .

“ FEMA was more concerned about legal liability than they were about people living in the trailers , ” said Rep. Brad Miller ( D - N.C. ) , chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee ’s Investigation and Oversight Subcommittee .
“ It certainly appears that [ the agency ] was more interested in giving FEMA what FEMA wanted , amazingly , than it was in its mission of protecting the public . ”
The subcommittee ’s report came three days after a federal judge in New Orleans ruled that FEMA can be sued by hurricane victims who claim they were exposed to toxic fumes .
The CDC issued a statement Monday saying that the subcommittee report focused on the February 2007 assessment and not an October revision or other CDC efforts to address formaldehyde exposure .
“ CDC also shares the desire of advocates and congressional investigators to ensure the best public health processes and science are used to understand the health effects associated with exposure to formaldehyde , ” the statement said .

The subcommittee report noted that the agency took eight months to revise its initial finding and did so only after Christopher De Rosa , then director of the CDC agency ’s Division of Toxicology and Environmental Medicine , publicly flagged scientific errors .
“ We believe that Dr. De Rosa is a whistle - blower and was removed from his position , which he had held for 16 years , in retaliation for his persistent attempts to push the agency ’s leadership to take more substantive actions to protect the public ’s health , ” the report said .
CDC acknowledged in February of this year that a third of the trailers it tested had formaldehyde levels high enough to harm children , the elderly and adults with respiratory problems , prompting FEMA to accelerate its efforts to relocate the 38,297 families then still in trailers and mobile homes .
Fewer than 9,000 remained last month , according to the FEMA website .
The report documented in meticulous detail what the CDC agency knew about the formaldehyde problem , and when .

At congressional hearings six months ago , for example , agency Director Dr. Howard Frumkin and Deputy Director Thomas Sinks testified that they did n’t focus on questions about the CDC ’s formaldehyde assessment until July 2007 , when Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) held the first hearing on the issue .
But an examination of agency agendas revealed that the issue was discussed during at least 13 meetings prior to those hearings , the report said .
At the hearings , Frumkin and Sinks blamed De Rosa for failing to catch the errors in the initial assessment .
Yet the report concluded that Frumkin , Sinks and three others reviewed the assessment , not De Rosa .
The agency ’s “ reaction was marred by scientific flaws , ineffective leadership , a sluggish response to inform trailer residents of the potential risks they faced and a lack of urgency to actually move them from harm ’s way , ” the report said .

Willem Buiter has a penchant for ruffling feathers with his blunt pronouncements .
He caused a firestorm at the Fed ’s recent Jackson Hole conference by , in his presentation , telling the central bank that it was a victim of “ cognitive regulatory capture ” and was excessively sensitive to the needs and special pleading of the financial services industry .
Even though the hosts took umbrage , they should not have been surprised , since Buiter had been saying that sort of thing for months .
Buiter lobbed another bombshell today , but because it was presented on his blog and ( needless to say ) the market meltdow was attention - grabbing , it appears to have gotten little note :
It ’s reasonable to assume that the banking system in the North Atlantic region is insolvent and would be bankrupt but for the reality of recent government bailouts and the expectation of future government bailouts .
Certainly , for the system as a whole , the marked - to - market value of its assets is way below that of its liabilities .
I strongly suspect that even the hold - to - maturity value of its assets is well below that of its liabilities .
Although the system as a whole is broke , there are no doubt individual banks that are solvent .
We may not , however be certain as to which banks are solvent and which banks are not .
This is a bold , troubling , and probably accurate assessment .
Note ( if you read the rest of the post ) that Buiter uses the term bank deliberately ; he is not referring to the larger shadow banking system that has clearly run aground , but to its core , the regulated banking sector ( plus , of course , its new additions , Goldman and Morgan Stanley ) .
More important , Buiter suspects that the banks as a whole are insolvent even if they hold assets to maturity .
In other words , the argument that bank distress is due in large degree to mark - to - market pricing meeting a panicked flight to quality is wishful thinking .
While many readers of this blog would agree with that view , it ’s quite another for an economist with considerable central bank / regulatory experience to voice that opinion .
Assuming that Buiter is correct , then efforts to relax mark - to - market accounting are completely counterproductive .
As discussed here and in the financial media , it serves to heighten mistrust by making financial statements less verifiable , and worse , even trying to put a fig leaf over this mess will not improve the picture sufficiently .
He went on : " I plan to look at mythical accounts of various things and also the scientific account of the same thing .
And the mythical account that I look at will be several different myths , of which the Judeo - Christian one will just be one of many .
“ ProVal Tech analyzed our deployment , made adjustments , organized our process , and got us back on track on just a few months .
Afterwards , they were instrumental in training our Centralized Services team and taking us through a major upgrade .
I ca n’t say enough about the value in getting their help when you run into challenges with managing and optimizing your RMM solution . ”

Back to Labs / Ubiquity .
The Ubiquity team has got a lot of feedback about bugs and limitations in the built - in command set .
The web moves quickly and Ubiquity has the ability to stream commands : it 's silly that we are n't using that ability to let development of those built - in commands rage on , without being impeded by the slower Ubiquity release cycle .
Main Features
Built - in Ubiquity commands have been moved to automatically - subscribed Mozilla feeds .
This means that we can update commands to fix bugs and add functionality , and you 'll get the improvements immediately , without having to download a new version of Ubiquity .
Another benefit is that you can now unsubscribe from built - in commands you 're not interested in using .
Gives better indication for when 3rd party commands have been updated , letting subscribers more easily update to the latest and greatest .
Gives command authors greater flexibility in naming and annotating their command feeds , which in turn let subscribers more easily find functionality they want .
The built - in command editor is greatly enhanced .
Includes an experimental way for command authors to combine templates and Javascript into one unified HTML document .
Makes it trivial for command authors to turn bookmarklets into commands .
Adds the ability for command authors to include synonyms of the command name , to make it easier for users to find the command they are looking for .
Includes an experimental parser - localization API so that the international community can begin to work on versions of the parser for languages besides English .
The parser is generally smarter at recognizing what command you want based on incomplete input , and better at sorting the suggestions it gives you so that the best matches appear at the top of the list .

What ’s behind GregKH ’s ( latest ) Rant ?
September 18 , 2008
If you have n’t seen the latest rant from Novell ‘s Greg Kroah - Hartman , I ’m not going to link to it .
You ’ll have to find it on your own .
Greg has used at least two high - profile speeches this year ( a Linux Plumber ’s Conference keynote , and a Google Tech Talk ) to tear down the contributions of Canonical to the Linux ecosystem .
I hope that people take it for what it is , pure and simple …
a negative marketing campaign
engineered by a high - profile Novell employee
against a key competitor
Greg threw out some numbers in his slides , usually showing a very small number next to Canonical , and then much larger numbers next to Red Hat , Novell , and others , such as IBM .
Full Disclosure …
In the interest of full disclosure , I should mention that :
I am currently employed by Canonical I was an IBM employee from 2000 – 2008 I spent most of 2005 as an IBM employee on - site at Red Hat
Some missing numbers …
I dug up a few numbers that Greg missed .
So , yeah , Canonical is a small , young company .
It would be nice if Greg would normalize some of his numbers against each company ’s size .
But why pick on Canonical and Ubuntu …
Here are some more numbers from Google Trends .
Google searches of “ suse ” vs “ fedora ” vs “ ubuntu ” , over the last 5 years :
Site traffic of opensuse.org vs. fedoraproject.org vs. ubuntu.com , over the last year :
These numbers are corroborated by DistroWatch.com ‘s popularity ratings :
Drum roll please …
Ubuntu ’s popularity has some people from other distributions uneasy .
But I think the next chart is the most impressive , humbling , and telling .
The following shows the Google trend between people searching for “ linux ” vs. “ ubuntu ” :
I left “ red hat ” , “ fedora ” , “ novell ” , and “ suse ” off of this chart because they do n’t even show up .
Click here if you ’d like to see .
At that pace , there will soon be more people searching for
“ Ubuntu ” , than searching for “ Linux ” on the Internet .
So back to this “ ecosystem ” …
As Matt Zimmerman discussed , Greg ’s “ Linux ecosystem ” seems a bit unfairly limited to the kernel , gcc , and binutils , and neglects a wider macrocosm of Ubuntu ’s contributions to the Linux , free , and open source space .
Canonical and Ubuntu actively contribute to GNOME and KDE , as well as dozens of other open source projects ( e.g. , I ’m co-maintainer of the upstream eCryptfs project and have contributed considerable code there on Canonical ’s dime ) .
Something must be said for the user base that Ubuntu brings to the ecosystem .
While some Ubuntu users may have come from Red Hat , SUSE , Debian , Gentoo , etc. , many Ubuntu users are first time Linux users .
I dare say that some of these individuals are Linux users because of Ubuntu .
I personally know Fedora and OpenSUSE users ( I used to be one of them ) who actively search the Ubuntu Forums and the Ubuntu Wiki when they run into problems on their respective distributions .
The Ubuntu documentation spectrum is simply the most informative , comprehensive , and useful in the Linux business .
Reducing the Linux ecosystem down to the kernel , gcc , and binutils is equivalent to reducing the human diet down to bread and water .
I suppose one can do that , but that ’s not a very satisfying existence .
There ’s so much more to a complete and fulfilling life - sustenance .
Or , better yet , let ’s work our way back to the Linux Plumber ’s Conference .
While we need plumbing in our house every day , do n’t we also appreciate a roof , electricity , windows , and furniture ?
And did your plumber also roof your house and wire your electrical sockets ?
Perhaps that was another team of qualified specialists …

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - A Saudi appeals court upheld a jail and flogging verdict against a biochemist and his female student whose research contact was ruled to be a front for a telephone affair that led her to divorce her husband .
The biochemist , Khalid Zahrani , said Wednesday that he found out this week from the court offices that three judges had approved the verdict .
He was sentenced last year to eight months in prison and 600 lashes and his student to four months in prison and 350 lashes for establishing a telephone relationship that the court said led her to divorce her husband .
The man said the only recourse left to him was the Supreme Judicial Council , a court of cassation that only views cases if requested by the king .
He also hopes for intervention from the government ’s Human Rights Commission .
It was not possible to verify the appeals court ruling and a Commission spokesman was not available for comment .
The hospital where the biochemist worked in al - Baha in the southwest of the kingdom put him in charge of the masters research the student was doing at King Abdul - Aziz University in Jeddah in 2002 .
The woman obtained a divorce seven months after she was married in 2004 .
Her husband then raised the court case , saying the supervisor ’s telephone calls led to the break - up .
Rights groups and Saudi reformers have criticized what they say is an arbitrary justice system , based on uncodified Islamic sharia law , unsuited to the needs of a country of 25 million people .
There are less than 1,000 judges , all of them religious scholars .
The government , a key U.S. ally , says the system ensures justice for Muslims and non-Muslims but is in the process of overhauling the organization of courts and putting a formal penal code in writing .

I used Paperclip for my latest project , and I figured I would give a brief tutorial on how to use it .
Paperclip – Paperclip is intended as an easy file attachment library for ActiveRecord .
The intent behind it was to keep setup as easy as possible and to treat files as much like other attributes as possible .
http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/tree/master
In my case , I wanted to allow an attachment to an Event , which will have one photo .
To install :
script / plugin install git : // github .
com / thoughtbot / paperclip .
git
Create your migration , again in my case I was adding the images to my Events model / DB , so I did the following :
script / generate migration AddPhotosToEvents
Open up your newly created migration with your favorite Text editor , and add the following :
class AddPhotoToEvent < ActiveRecord :: Migration def self . up add_column :events , :photo_file_name , : string add_column :events , :photo_content_type , : string add_column :events , : photo_file_size , : integer end def self .
down remove_column :events , :photo_file_name remove_column :events , :photo_content_type remove_column :events , : photo_file_size end end
Then rake your migration so the new columns are added to your database :
rake db: migrate
Next you need to tell your model to use Paperclip , again I am using the Event model as an example , the # Paperclip and below is what you need to add .
If you notice below I added 4 options to the : styles .
I wanted to have a few different sizes generated when a image was uploaded , i named them appropriately ( you can name them whatever you wish ) .
Please note when you put a # on the end it signifies that you want that exact aspect ratio , it will crop your photo automatically .
When you use > on the end it will make the largest side the size you specify and keep the aspect ratio uploaded .
In addition note that because we specified has_attached_file : photo its going to look for that naming convention we created in the migration above .
In addition it uses that name to store your photo in the public folder of your application .
So our photo url is going to be as follows : / public / photos / ( event # ) /( size_name ) /image_name
class Event < ActiveRecord :: Base belongs_to :user validates_presence_of : title , :on => : create , : message => " ca n't be blank " validates_presence_of : teaser , : on => : create , : message => " ca n't be blank " validates_presence_of : subject , : on => : create , : message => " ca n't be blank " # Paperclip has_attached_file : photo , : styles => { : thumb => " 100x100 # " , : small => " 150x150 > " , : medium => " 300x300 > " , : large => " 400x400 > " }
Next you need to make sure you put the html => { : multipart => true } in both your edit and new views for the model you are working with .
Example in my case :
< % form_for ( @event , : html => { : multipart => true } ) do | f | %> <% = f. error_messages %> <% = render : partial => ' form ' , : locals => { :f => f } %> <% end %>
You then need to add the file_field to your new and edit forms or your _form partial like in my case :
< p > <%= f.label ' Photo ' %>< br /> <%= f.file_field : photo %> </ p>
Next up is deciding on how you are going to use / view your images .
In my case I wanted to show a few different sizes in the Event view .
I also wanted to make sure I am only going to show photo ’s if one exists .
In this example I am just showing the small and medium sizes we generated :
< % if @event.photo.exists ?
then %> < p> Small :<%= image_tag @event.photo.url ( : small )
%></p> < p>Medium :<%= image_tag @event.photo.url ( : medium ) %></p> < % else %> < p >
There are no photo's attached , upload one .
</ p> <% end %>
A few other notes …
Calling @event.photo.nil destroys the photo
Also checkout this great tutorial Jim put up here .
Thats all for now , I ’ll try to post an update with some more options / features when using the Paperclip plugin in the future .
*** Checkout my other tutorial on polymorphic paperclip if you would like to have multiple image attachments .

Nader is so pathetic , this interview veers between humor and pathos .
At times , it looks like Nader is about to cry .
But he tries so hard to be in on the joke .
He ca n’t seem to decide whether to attack the dog puppet or to try to get his vote – and he tries to do both .
Towards the end of the interview , Nader attempts to defend himself in a sing - song voice :
Triumph : Come on – you screwed Al Gore .
You campaigned in the swing states .
Nader : Politics has gone to the dogs !
With two parties , Republicans and Democrats !
Triumph : [ interrupting in a sing - song voice ]
You campaigned in the swing states .
You campaigned in the swing states .
Harder .
Harder .
Nader : [ interrupting , in a sing - song ]
You ’re telling a canine lie .
You ’re telling a canine lie .
I would feel bad for the guy if this were n’t all of his own volition .
He did seem to betray a feeling of guilt in how he defended his 2000 campaign – but he refused to acknowledge any responsibility – and deflected the blame onto the Republicans .
But if the past eight years has proven anything it is that Nader ’s core message was wrong – that it would n’t make a difference if a Democrat or Republican was elected , if Gore or Bush won – both were equally bad .
Nader rightfully has much criticism of our two - party system and how it exerts a stranglehold on power – but the Bush administration proved definitively that it matters who is elected .
And Nader , after promising not to campaign in swing states to raise money , decided to campaign anyway and without his support in Florida , we would have had a different president .
Something to remember as we approached another Tuesday in November .

Vegas hacker conference attracts pranksters 3 kicked out of Las Vegas convention after siphoning user names

For the second year in a row , reporters at the BlackHat and DefCon security conferences in Las Vegas have been kicked out for , well , hacking .
This year , three French reporters from Global Security Magazine , one of BlackHat 's sponsors , had their badges seized after they siphoned user names and passwords off the press room 's network from reporters for Cnet in San Francisco and the technology magazine eWeek in New York .
Their goal was to get victims ' credentials posted on the conferences '
" Wall of Sheep , " where people who access the wireless network at the conference without taking security precautions are publicly exposed .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" Potentially everyone in the room had been a victim , " wrote one target , Robert Vamosi of Cnet , in his first - person account , describing how other reporters reacted to the news .
" And as such , we rallied around each other for support . "
Reporters were n't so supportive of each other last year , when a producer from " Dateline NBC " tried to attend DefCon undercover but was found out .
Videos of her fleeing the conference as other reporters taped her exit are still posted on YouTube .
BlackHat and its sister conference , DefCon , are two of the year 's biggest and most entertaining security conferences , and thousands of hackers and wannabe hackers - some wearing tattoos and multiple body piercings and spiky colored hair - attend .
Federal agents try to recruit the ones who have n't engaged in criminal activity to help the government fight cybercrime .
Security vendors hawk their products , researchers hold talks to demonstrate the latest Internet security vulnerabilities they 've discovered , and there 's a large press corps on hand to chronicle it all .
The conferences started out small , but as hacking has changed over the past few years from an anti-establishment hobby to a multimillion - dollar international business controlled by hard - core criminals , conference attendance has grown , too .
As usual , activities have ranged from the comic to the serious .
Some portion of the Internet is still vulnerable to one of the most serious flaws to hit the network in years - a design flaw in the Internet 's Domain Name System , which locates Web sites as users surf the Web , researcher Dan Kaminsky said Wednesday .
He presented a long list of problems the flaw makes possible - from diverting people to fake Web sites to redirecting their e-mails .
The only reason it's not been exploited much so far is that the good guys found it first and are watching for malicious activity , said David Ulevitch , the CEO of OpenDNS in San Francisco , whose software is not vulnerable to the problem .
Researchers at the conference have been meeting this week to negotiate a long - term fix .
( Check doxpara.com for more information and to see if your computer is vulnerable . )
As in past years , the number of new security flaws demonstrated at the conferences is breathtaking .
Hacked iPhones left sitting unattended in corporate mail rooms can scan for nearby wireless connections , and Google Gadgets may harbor malicious code .
Even some experts in security proved they can be tricked .
A couple of pranksters - Shawn Moyer , chief information security officer for Agura Digital Security , and Nathan Hamiel , senior consultant for Idea Information Security - said they attracted more than 50 friends to each of three fake profiles they set up on social - networking sites .
They declined to name the sites or those they lured , but said they included people who should know better - chief information security officers of major corporations and people who work in the defense industry .
" We really were surprised at the level of trust we found , " Moyer said .

A 43 - year - old Japanese woman has been jailed for " killing " her virtual husband to revenge an unexpected in - game divorce .
The unhappy couple 's characters had been " married " in the side - scrolling Korean massive multiplayer game , MapleStory .
Not in real life , mind you , just within the game .
But e-vows were too soon discarded , bringing rise to a plot of digital murder .
She was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of illegally accessing a computer and manipulating electronic data .
Police claim she used the man 's identification and password in order to delete his beloved character , the AP reports .
" I was suddenly divorced , without a word of warning .
That made me so angry , " a police official quoted her as telling investigators .
The 33 - year - old office worker contacted the police when he discovered his character was missing in Mid-May .
He is believed to have freely given the woman his MapleStory password at an earlier date when the two were in the joyous throes of e-marital bliss .
After her arrest , the woman was taken some 620 miles from her home in southern Miyazaki to be detained in Sapporo , where the man lives .
She has n't yet been formally charged , but AP reports she could face a prison term of up to five years in prison or a fine of $ 5,000 ( £ 3,091 ) if convicted . ®
A burning a candle inside a jack - o- lantern on Halloween keeps evil spirits and demons at bay .

To cast a headless shadow or no shadow at all is still believed by many folks in the United States and Europe to be an omen of death in the course of the next year .
The old Celtic custom was to light great bonfires on Halloween , and after these had burned out to make a circle of the ashes of each fire .
Within this circle , and near the circumference , each member of the various families that had helped to make a fire would place a pebble .
If , on the next day , any stone was displaced , or had been damaged , it was considered to be an indication that the one to whom the stone belonged would die within twelve months .
According to an old English folk belief , you will invite bad luck into your home if you allow a fire to burnout on Halloween .
To remedy the situation , the fire must be rekindled by a lighted sod brought from the home of a priest .
If a bat flies around a house three times , it is considered to be a death omen .

In Britain , people believed that the Devil was a nut - gatherer .
At Halloween , nuts were used as magic charms .
Black Cat and Halloween
If cultures of various regions are seen , it can be noticed that cats have supernatural power .
Especially , it is a myth that black cats are most dangerous .
A number of stories at different corners of the world explain the evil influences of cats .
It is believed that black cats not only bring bad luck but also they are associated with various other unnecessary dark things .
A common question crops up that why cats and particularly black cats are said to have these characteristics and attributes ?
Let us look into the details and analyze the reasons behind this myth .
Cats , the nocturnal animals , more often than not can be seen strolling around the premise of every house .
These suspicious animals sneak around , especially at night .
House owners keep their foods safe from these doubtful evils .
It is quite obvious that civilized society still fears the darkness of night and we are carrying forward this old tradition .
The black color of cats can be associated and linked with the darkness of nights .
Certainly , this does n’t help to improve their image .
The black color has always been allied with evil as well .
Long time back , Europeans predominantly were the firm believers of pagan religions .
Witchcraft was a very popular belief .
They were closely attached with nature and animals like cat .
Gradually , Christian religion came into the picture .
Church decided to Christianize everyone .
According to their well made plans they marked witchcraft as evil and since then cats are attributes to witches .
It is a fact that Christians always had an allegation that cats are directly linked with bad luck .
There was also a myth by which people started to think cats as evil animals .
King Charles
I of England was arrested on the day his pet cat died .
An old sailor ’s legend had opined that if sailors meet an ambling cat in the shipyard then there is a possibility that that ship may meet an unpleasant storm on its voyage .
According to the Babylonian folklore a cat on hearth is compared with an evil serpent .
Many times it is noticed that a cat is playing with something which is invisible or even batting at nothing in air .
At the same time they have an uncanny ability to see well in darkness .
These created a fable that cats can see spirits or ghosts .
During witch trial a lot of cats were tortured and even killed by Christian puritans .
It was believed that evil witches can shape themselves up into cats .
So , both the witches and cats should be treated severely .
It was also seen that witches sacrifice cats during their rituals .
This was surprising on their part because witchcraft was a nature friendly and loving religion .
Many animal shelters did n’t allow anyone to adopt cats during Halloween for fear of their mistreatment and abuse .
Even though European countries had treated cats badly but a lot of cultures gave cats the respect that they deserve .
Ancient Egyptians respected cats a lot .
It was not permitted to kill any cat as the Egyptians used to consider cats as kingly animals .
Egyptians even thought of mummifying their cats when they died .
They preserved their cats for afterlife .
Bast was their deity who looked like a cat for its head .
Mummified cats were dedicated to this fastidious deity .
However , the ancient Egyptians were not the only people who respected cats and had treated them nicely .
Maneki Neko ( Bechoning cat ) is considered as a symbol of good luck by the Japanese .
Russian Blue breed of cat is also linked with good luck .
It was believed that black cats exemplify the spirit of Rungis , the Harvest God of Latvia .
According to the Latvian culture Black cats bring good luck for the farmers .

I ’m starting to think of Microsoft as the Sarah Palin of the tech world .
Pretty to look at with quirky and catchy outbursts that get your attention , but when looked at closely turns out to be empty and simply divorced from reality .
Apparently this latest Bizarro World advertising is supposed to get programmers to come to the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference later this month .
Why do I get the feeling they should name this product Windows Se7en instead ?
The company ’s advertising has certainly come a long way since this :
Palin wo n't meet with ' Troopergate ' investigator Associated Press
Published : Monday September 15 , 2008

ANCHORAGE , Alaska - A campaign spokesman says Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin wo n't speak with an investigator hired by lawmakers to look into the firing of her public safety commissioner .
McCain campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan told a news conference Monday that the governor , the Republican nominee for vice president , will not cooperate as long as the investigation " remains tainted . "
He said he does n't know whether Palin 's husband would challenge a subpoena issued to compel his cooperation .
The campaign insists the investigation has been hijacked by Democrats .
It says it can prove Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan was fired because of insubordination on budget issues  not because he refused to fire a state trooper who had divorced Palin 's sister .

John McCain recently tried to underscore his seriousness about pushing through a new energy policy , with a strong focus on more drilling for oil , by telling a motorcycle convention that Congress needed to come back from vacation immediately and do something about America ’s energy crisis .
“ Tell them to come back and get to work ! ” McCain bellowed .
Sorry , but I ca n’t let that one go by .
McCain knows why .
It was only five days earlier , on July 30 , that the Senate was voting for the eighth time in the past year on a broad , vitally important bill 
S. 3335  that would have extended the investment tax credits for installing solar energy and the production tax credits for building wind turbines and other energy - efficiency systems .
Both the wind and solar industries depend on these credits  which expire in December  to scale their businesses and become competitive with coal , oil and natural gas .
Unlike offshore drilling , these credits could have an immediate impact on America ’s energy profile .
Senator McCain did not show up for the crucial vote on July 30 , and the renewable energy bill was defeated for the eighth time .
In fact , John McCain has a perfect record on this renewable energy legislation .
He has missed all eight votes over the last year  which effectively counts as a no vote each time .
Once , he was even in the Senate and would n’t leave his office to vote .
My favorite campaign moment of the day : Wolf Blitzer asking Ed Rollins whether McCain needs an assist from bin Laden to win on Tuesday …
If you told a man that his " penis " was nothing more than the head of his cock — his " glans " — he would laugh in your face .
If he pitied you , he might tell you that there was an important aspect to the penis called the shaft , also the frenulum , and perhaps a foreskin .
His scrotum and balls are part of the essential package as well .
Women 's anatomy education , on the other hand , has been a giant exercise in vacancy .
Until recent times , we 've been schooled that the clitoris — the female analog to the penis — is nothing more than the small glans one can see on the outside of the vulva .
Start laughing .
Women have a big , big , clitoral body — but it 's nearly all on the inside , instead of the outdoor plumbing that 's viewed so easily on men .
The reason you hear so much about the " g - spot , " and controversies over whether women are excited by internal anal or vaginal pressure , is because those areas are all means to massage , and stimulate , the internal clitoral body .
The g - spot is n't some extra accessory ; it 's just one of many inches on the clitoral map .
Remember : the whole clit , and nothing but .
Of course , the female clitoral glans is the super - sensitive part , just like a man's .
But in the same way that men like to have their entire penises taken into account when they 're aroused , women are favored by attention to their entire clitorises .
When I present this information in public , I am hampered by my lack of rendering skills .
Now , finally , I have the genius of Betty " Quick Draw " Dodson to show you what 's it 's all about .
The next time someone asks you , " Where 's the clitoris ?
What does it look like ?
How do you know where to find it ? " — you simply come over here , and press play .
I posted an alternate version of this video before ; but I like this one better ... and it's a great way to launch Betty 's new site , that she 's put together with Carlin Ross .
They have a whole slew of new videos , so check it out !
A new study suggests that entertainment news shows such as The Daily Show or The Colbert Report may not be as influential in teaching voters about political issues and candidates as was previously thought .
Previous studies have reported up to 48 percent of all adults and 60 percent of young voters used fake news shows as a source of campaign news in the 2004 presidential election .
But researchers from Ohio State University have found reasons to discount how effective these shows are in informing the general public .
The study found that people who watch fake news shows learn far less about political issues and candidates than people who watch television news shows on networks such as CNN and NBC .
However , the study also found that people watching fake news shows still learned more than people who did n’t watch any political content .
People watching television news learned more about a candidate ’s position on issues and about political procedures compared to those watching the fake news shows , while fake news shows primarily taught viewers about a candidate ’s personal background .
“ Both news and entertainment media seem to promote some knowledge gain , but people who are exposed to news gain more factual information and learn more about a wide range of important topics than those exposed to entertainment media , ” said Young Mie Kim , co-author of the study and assistant professor of communication at Ohio State .
Kim conducted the study with John Vishak , who is a former graduate student at Ohio State .

The findings , which were recently published in the Journal of Communication , suggest that fake news shows are influential in forming impressions about a candidate based on their background , but are not as useful in learning about the issues and political procedures central to an election .
Kim said these differences in knowledge gain may be due to how people are using fake news shows versus television news .
Once people sit down to watch a show , they may have already decided how and if they will use the information presented in each segment .
“ Entertainment shows may not be the best choice to learn about candidates or issues or political procedures because people use them to pass time or relax .
So they may not be paying attention to all the details .
On the other hand , news is meant to be for learning something new , so people try to remember more of the information shown , ” she said .
The study involved eighty - five people in a Midwestern city who were shown 20 - minute video segments on the nomination of John Roberts for chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 .
Participants ranging from 18 to 64 years old viewed segments from either the NBC evening news and CNN or The Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
Both segments contained information about the nomination procedure , John Robert ’s personal background and issue positions , and reactions from Congress , political parties and issue advocacy groups .
A third group was shown a science documentary of equal length , to compare the effects of both news and entertainment shows to other forms of media without political content .

Before the study began , the participants in all three groups were similar in terms of their interest in politics and their viewership patterns when watching news and the fake news programs .
Participants from the groups were then asked to write down , point - by - point , what they had learned in the videos .
They then rated all the points as to whether they were positive or negative to the person or group mentioned .
The participants also took a 29 question test probing their knowledge of Roberts , the nomination procedure , the nominee ’s issue positions and reactions to his views , and Roberts ’ personal background .
Finally , they were asked to rate how much they liked John Roberts on a scale of - 50 to +50 .
The results showed that people who watched the NBC and CNN news segment were able to recall more details about all topics than those who watched The Daily Show clip .
They also averaged two more questions correct in the test .
The real news clip led viewers to learn about who the nominee was and where he stood on important issues , while also increasing their understanding of political policies and issues .
In contrast , people watching The Daily Show remembered details about the nominee ’s college choice and family members , but were less informed on important political issues and the nominee ’s stance on those issues .
“ Your voting decision should be based on factual information on many topics .
The problem with entertainment media is you might feel politically confident when you watch these fake news shows , but if the information you have is not true or does n’t show all of the facts , then you ’re making a judgment based on incorrect or incomplete information , ” she said .
Overall , results showed people watching the fake news segment tended to use only portions of the information they learned in the segment – whether fact or opinion -- to update their opinion on Roberts , creating a sort of mental tally of the positives and negatives .
Without remembering who said what about the candidate or the specific details about the candidate ’s personal background and party affiliations , people would evaluate the candidate and update their impression based on what they liked and disliked .
“ Say in the beginning you are slightly positive toward John Roberts , but you do n’t think about why .
Then you ’re exposed to some new information saying that liberals are really against him , and you ’re a liberal and now you do n’t like him .
You slightly liked him before the exposure but when you ’re exposed to such information , you just update your overall attitude in real time , ” Kim said .
But news shows were used much differently .
After viewing the news segment , the viewers concluded how much they liked John Roberts overall based on all the factual information they had learned about the nominee .
The end result was people used fake news shows to update their impressions of the candidate immediately , while news shows promoted learning about the candidate , issues , and procedures .
People who watched the news shows will presumably use the knowledge they gain over the long - term to develop their opinions about candidates and issues , she said .
And while the study suggests that entertainment news shows are less important to gaining political knowledge than traditional news , fake news shows may still be beneficial , Kim said .
People who watched The Daily Show segment still gained information about Roberts ’ background , which is important in forming impressions .
More importantly , people who watch entertainment news learn more than people who do n’t watch any political content .
“ A lot of young voters and a lot of people in general watch these shows so we have a lot of entertainment media consumers .
Entertainment media may not be ideal for learning about political issues and procedures , but it is still better than nothing , ” she said .
Dear Colleagues :
Earlier today , Anna and I went to Whole Foods .
We detest shopping there but we have no choice ; our local health food stores have largely disappeared in the wake of chains like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s .
On Sundays , there is an outdoor market in the Whole Foods parking lot .
Local vendors sell fruits , vegetables , baked goods — and animal flesh and products .
One vendor had decorated her “ organic meat ” stall with pictures of her “ free - range ” chickens , pigs , and cows .
We stopped to look at the pictures .
I pointed out to her that there were no pictures of the slaughtering process .
“ Oh , well we slaughter our chickens on the premises and our cows and pigs go to a slaughter facility that is only six miles away .
They do n’t stay overnight and we try to make it as stress free as possible . ”
Another shopper had appeared and said , “ I feel so much better about buying my meat from farms like this . ”
The vendor remarked , “ Oh , yes , these animals are our dear friends . ”
I responded , politely but seriously : “ That ’s an odd thing to say ; I hope that you do n’t treat your other ‘ dear friends ’ this way . ”
The vendor laughed .
She thought I was joking .
“ These animals are our dear friends . ”
Think about that .
Think about what terrible confusion such a statement reveals .
This is where the happy meat / animal products movement is leading us .
This is where the PETA–KFC controlled - atmosphere killing campaign is taking us .
This is where efforts like Proposition 2 are taking us .
We are moving backward .
Go vegan .
It ’s the baseline of the abolitionist movement and is nonviolence in action .

BERLIN , Oct. 25 ( UPI ) -- German officials and researchers said they have given Holocaust researchers in Jerusalem a list of some 600,000 Jews living in Germany between 1933 and 1945 .
The list , which was compiled by the German Foundation for Remembrance , Responsibility and Future , was given Thursday to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem by foundation head Martin Salm and German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann , Deutsche Welle reported Friday .

" It provides information about the fate of Jews in National - Socialist Germany , their place of birth , their place of residence and about whether and when they left Germany or when they were murdered , " said Franka Kuehn , a spokeswoman for the foundation .
The group said researchers worked for four years to compile the list , which is aimed at helping family members and scholars determine the fates of Jews living in Germany during the Holocaust .
An e-mailthat began as a rallying cry from a lone journalist to an influential circle of friends to protest the U.S. government bailout of Wall Street has ignited a national day of street protests .
Some demonstrators plan to dump their rubbish in front of the bronze bull sculpture near Wall Street in downtown Manhattan Thursday .
" People are going to bring their own personal junk that they think is worth as much as the junk financial instruments that the government is proposing to buy from the Wall Street banks , " says Andrew Boyd , an activist and freelance online - video artist for nonprofit groups in Manhattan .
" We 're hoping that people show up with their 8 - track cassette collections , their old Spice Girl CDs , their surf boards that got bit by sharks and old Enron stock certificates . "
Boyd is just one of thousands of Americans from all over the political spectrum who the Bush Administration has angered with its vague proposal to hand $ 700 billion over to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to restore U.S. financial markets ' health .
That anger has manifested itself online through e-mail , web sites and other online chatter , with one site , BuyMyShitPile.com , going rapidly viral this week .
The site , a parody of the dire financial situation , is what is inspiring the self - organizing group of activists to show up in downtown Manhattan Thursday evening with all their junk .
They hope to make their simmering fury palpable to Wall Streeters getting off work .
" Why should people who made financially imprudent decisions be rewarded ? " asks Boyd , who is best known for founding the political protest theater groupBillionaires For Bush .
" It 's our hard - earned tax dollars , and we 're being asked to bail these guys out at the same time as this locks out all the things that we want for the future . "
Boyd 's is one of many voices of frustration .
Other people 's anger spilled out online , which in turn , is fueling the planned protests ' momentum .
Arun Gupta , a 43 - year - old freelance journalist in Manhattan , is someone else who was so upset by unfolding events that he was moved to action .
" I 've been spending a lot of time reading about the intensifying crisis and the bailout plan , " he says .
" The more I read , the more outraged and flabbergasted I was :
It became clear to me that this was the financial equivalent of the Sept. 11 attacks . "
He was so upset that he banged out a passionately worded 629 - word e-mail on his laptop Sunday afternoon urging his friends – and anyone else who would listen – to show up at the southern tip of Manhattan late Thursday afternoon to demonstrate .
He says that he 's never organized a protest before in his life .
" This week the White House is going to try to push through the biggest robbery in world history with nary a stitch of debate , to bail out the
Wall Street bastards who created this economic apocalypse in the first place , " he wrote .
" This is the financial equivalent of September 11 .
They think , just like with the Patriot Act , they can use the shock to force through the
“ therapy , ” and we ’ll just roll over ! "
He added :
Think about it :
They said providing health care for 9 million children , perhaps costing $ 6 billion a year , was too expensive , but there ’s evidently no sum of money large enough that will sate the Wall
Street pigs .
If this passes , forget about any money for environmental protection , to counter global warming , for education , for national healthcare , to rebuild our decaying infrastructure , for alternative energy .
This is a historic moment .
We need to act now while we can influence the debate .
Let ’s demonstrate this Thursday at 4 pm in Wall Street ( see below ) .
The e-mail ricocheted through the electronic ecosystem faster than the implosion of Wall Street itself , tapping into and riding the frisson of resentment among Americans at this monumental financial foul - up .
" I wrote up an e-mail Sunday night , and I sat on it . " he says .
" I
was a bit hesitant because I 'm not an organizer , I 'm a journalist , but I also think that things have to be done in the world . "
He said that he sent it out to best - selling author Naomi Klein , who posted it to her website , and sent it out to her e-mail list .
Then TrueMajority , a 700,000 member activist group headed by Ben and Jerry 's co-founder Ben Cohen , sent out an action alert the next day .
TrueMajority is making a " protest kit " available on its web site with instructions for groups who are interested on how to organize a rally .
One of the instructions is to bring cell phones to the protest , and to have protesters simultaneously call their members of Congress .
The site has also put up a web page that enables people to find an event near them by ZIP code .
" This was a convergence of everyone having the same thought at the same time , " says Matt Holland , TrueMajority 's online director .
He says everybody he knew had received Gupta 's e-mail at least three times from different people .
It 's also been widely circulated on blogs .
Holland says that Gupta 's language just taps into " the strength of the emotion " that many Americans are feeling right now .
TrueMajority 's members themselves have made 20,000 phone calls to Congress , he says .
Members report the calls that they made through the group 's website .
" Everybody is just incredibly pissed off about this , and if there is a place and time for them to express themselves , they 're going to do it , " he says .
Congressional lawmakers have expressed frustration and skepticism over Treasury 's proposal , although they won a concession about CEO pay Wednesday afternoon .
President Bush is scheduled to address the nation about the bailout plan 9 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday , and John McCain has asked Barack Obama to agree to cancel Friday 's presidential debate so that they could both work with the administration to hammer out an agreement .
In the meantime , a proposal to add several restrictions on the package from Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vermont ) has gained traction online .
He 's asked Americans to sign onto the petition , and he intends to present it to Paulson .
The senator 's office reported Wednesday that 8,000 people signed the petition within the first 24 hours .
Another sign that the petition gained widespread notice : " Bernie Sanders , " was one of the most - searched - for terms on Google Tuesday .
Also on Tuesday , a long list of economists from the nation 's top universities sent a letter to congressional leaders voicing their concerns about the too - speedy passage of any bailout package .
They said that they were most concerned about the plan 's fundamental fairness and its ambiguity .
Barack Obama , hoping to inject new energy into the Democratic convention , will break with tradition and deliver his first speech as the party 's presidential nominee before an audience of 75,000 people in Denver .
The party said yesterday it would open up the convention 's pivotal moment to public spectators .
The move was intended to symbolise Obama 's promise of a transformational presidency , as well as the historic aspect of his candidacy as the first African - American to lead a major party into a US election , the party said .
" The Democratic party is nominating a true change candidate this August , and it is only fitting that we make some big changes in how we put on the convention , " Howard Dean , the party 's national committee chairman , said .
" By bringing the last night of the convention out to the people we will be able to showcase Barack Obama 's positive , people - centred vision for our country . "
The plan also aims to capitalise on Obama 's talents as an orator who can excite large audiences , unlike the Republican candidate , John McCain .
Invesco Field , the outdoor stadium in Denver where Obama will deliver his acceptance speech on the last day of the convention , has more than three times the capacity of the centre where Democrats will hold their meeting at the end of August .
That venue holds about 20,000 .
Obama 's speech on August 28 will be on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King 's historic " I Have a Dream " address in Washington .
After a week devoted to themes of God and country , Obama and McCain yesterday shifted the focus of their campaigns to the more immediate issues of the economic and energy crises .
McCain led off his economic campaign with a promise to cut the record deficits of the Bush administration to produce a balanced budget by 2013 .
Current projections suggest there will be a $ 443bn ( £ 224bn ) deficit in 2013 , fuelled by spending on the Iraq war and Bush 's tax cuts .
McCain aides sharpened their attacks on Obama as a conventional liberal who would raise taxes .
In a conference call with reporters , Steve Forbes , the onetime independent candidate who is serving as a McCain economic adviser , said Obama 's policies would devastate the economy .
He also accused Obama of changing positions .
" This gets to the whole credibility problem with Senator Obama saying one thing and then doing another , " he said .
McCain , in a visit to Denver , took Obama to task for his opposition to the Republican 's proposal for a summer reprieve on petrol taxes .
" For a guy whose official seal carried the motto ' Yes , we can ' , Senator Obama 's agenda sure has a whole lot of ' No , we can 't ' , " McCain said .
Obama yesterday outlined a $ 50bn economic stimulus package , which he said would provide some security to middle income families , during an unscheduled stop in St Louis , Missouri .
He had been scheduled to travel to North Carolina , but was diverted to St Louis by technical difficulties .
In his speech , Obama accused McCain of favouring big oil companies and multi-millionaires with $ 300 bn in tax cuts .
" If this sounds familiar , it 's because it 's exactly what George Bush has done for the last eight years , " Obama said .
The Department of Homeland Security should not use the user - generated Wikipedia to decide whether an asylum seeker can enter the United States , a federal appeals court ruled Friday .
That judicial statement of the obvious ( .pdf ) from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals , which said DHS committed no big foul in using a site editable by anyone with a computer to decide the fate of a woman named Lamilem Badasa .
DHS decided to deport Badasa after consulting Wikipedia to decide whether a Ethiopian travel document known as a laissez - passer was adequate to prove her identity .
Using the Wikipedia page as evidence , the government convinced an immigration judge that the document did not prove her identity , calling it a one - way travel document based on information provided by the applicant .
While the Board of Immigration Appeals subsequently said it did n't " encourage the use of resources such as Wikipedia.com in reaching pivotal decisions in immigration proceedings , " it allowed the decision to stand since it could n't find any clear error .
The three - judge panel of the appeals court found that split decision disturbing .
The court reiterated that anyone can edit Wikipedia and there 's no guarantee that the information on the page at the time the government officials looked at it had any correct information at all .
The site may have misled and tainted government officials ' decisions in the case , the judges ruled :
The [ Board of Immigration Appeals ] presumably was concerned that Wikipedia is not a sufficiently reliable source on which to rest the determination that an alien alleging a risk of future persecution is not entitled to asylum . [...]
We do not know whether the [ Immigration Judge ] would have reached the same conclusion without Wikipedia , or whether ( and , if so , why ) the [ Board of Immigration Appeals ] believes that the IJ ’s consideration of Wikipedia was harmless error , in the sense that it did not influence the IJ ’s decision .
The appeals court sent the case back down to the Board of Immigration Appeals to have it explain why it believes Wikipedia did n't taint the entire decision - making process .
Future U.S. asylum seekers are well advised to make sure the Wikipedia page about , say , Burma 's repressive government are adequately dire before submitting their application .

In the shadow of the iPhone
Editor 's note :
This is our first look at Android , and in this review we focus on the primary question on most people 's minds — can this phone knock the iPhone off its perch ?
In the coming weeks , we 'll dive further into the phone , and look more closely at its niche uses , and its open nature .
For today , the focus is on whether or not Google has delivered a product with polish , features , and ease of use .
The T - Mobile G1 Google smartphone , designed by Google and made by HTC , remains firmly in the shadow of the iPhone — for now .
The phone , which goes on sale next week in the US and next month in Britain , was released too early .
The HTC hardware and Android OS that powers it lack the polish and depth of even the iPhone 1.0 in most respects .
It 's not a bad phone , but the software and hardware needed more time in the oven to bring them to a golden brown crispness .
The G1 would come off much better if it was n't competing with the 3G iPhone and iPhone OS 2.1 .
Admittedly , it 's not clear that Google would have been able to sign up carriers back when the original iPhone was released back in the pre-3G and pre-App Store days , back when Google assembled the three dozen firms that form the Open Handset Alliance , without the iPhone as leverage .
While Android 's development predates the release of the original iPhone , phones based on the OS will be pushed onto the market in part because of Apple 's exclusive carrier deals ; carriers left out need an alternative .
The G1 is burdened with a lot of issues that have little to do with the phone itself , but we 'll see if we can get past that to explore the general inadequacy of the phone .
The hardware
You notice the G1's ordinariness as soon as you unpack the phone , which comes wrapped in a small , neatly designed box .
The cables are the kind you find accompanying any phone , which somehow makes the G1 appear bland even before use .
Android's Maps program integrates multiple Google Maps views , and uses the GPS receiver for position .
The G1 guides you through a simple and well - designed setup process for creating accounts and filling in basic parameters .
Oddly , despite the inclusion of a WiFi radio , there 's no option to add existing WiFi accounts during setup .
Instead , the phone defaults to using T - Mobile 's limited 3G network , available in a few dozen cities right now .
( Both data plans for the G1 include unlimited T - Mobile HotSpot use , which includes several thousand locations in the US )
Previews of the phone , produced by reviewers at national publications ( like Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal ) led me to expect a somewhat better piece of gear than what the G1 turned out to be .
The G1 has a slightly rubberized case that 's comfortable in the hand , but the fit and finish is n't all there .
The phone 's slide - out keyboard does n't have a smooth motion — it slams into place .
The display portion wobbles slightly and does n't lock solidly into open or closed positions .
The bottom portion of the phone , when in closed portrait mode , has a slight raise and tilt , and feels exactly right .
HTC crammed five buttons and a trackball nubbin into that area .
When butterflied open , the raised and tilted portion winds up on the right side of the keyboard , and irritates while you type .
The keyboard is quite nice , with all the letters and numbers available , along with keys for period and the @ - sign , plus a dedicated Google search key .
It 's quite similar to a one - letter - per- key BlackBerry .
Ports and buttons seem to be scattered around the phone , based on where they happen to fit , rather than having been placed through a well - thought - out design ; HTC may have based this on a previous model to produce it so fast .
Owners of HTC phones may be used to having volume up / down buttons in a reasonable place ( the upper left side of the phone in portrait mode ) , but the compact USB jack is at the bottom , the camera button at the lower right , and the microSD slot cover is partly hidden when the phone is n't opened .
There 's no standard headphone jack either , although the unit comes with a set of uncomfortable microphone / earbuds that use HTC 's proprietary USB audio connector to hook into the phone .
An ungainly USB - to - 2.5 mm adapter is available , but not included .
The earbuds have good audio quality when listening to music .
There 's a large rectangular bolus in the cable with a thumbnail for adjusting volume , a button for controlling call and music behavior , and a built - in microphone .
In use , the G1 does n't feel overly large unless you 're holding an iPhone in the other hand .
But the slide - open keyboard makes the G1 more practical for large quantities of typing .
As a 100 wpm touch - typist , I 'm still uncomfortable with the iPhone 's glass keyboard ; I could type well on the G1 keyboard immediately .
A built - in speaker produces decent sound and can pump out at extremely high volume .
The speaker is on the back , so it 's easy to muffle if you 're playing back YouTube or using it as a speaker phone when resting it on a table .
The out - of - the - box brightness was far too dim , obviously set to about 35 percent of maximum to preserve battery life .
At its full brightness , video playback from YouTube was far more attractive .
The built - in three - megapixel camera produces extremely sharp , high - quality photos , even at a range of a few inches .
Its auto - focus and exposure adjustments are fantastic .
A third - party bar - code scanner had no trouble instantly recognizing and decoding a photo of a UPC printed on a book , for instance .
However , the best hardware feature of a smartphone should not be its camera .
A photo taken with the G1's camera
The phone comes with a 1 GB microSD card installed , which is used by default to store photos , music , and other items .
Plugging the phone into a computer via USB mounts the card , and its contents can be copied without special software .
This is a meager amount of storage compared with the iPhone 's base 8 and 16GB models , but a 4GB microSD card can be had for as little as $ 14 ; T - Mobile maybe should have opted to eat a few dollars and include that amount of storage .
Although I did n't have a G1 for long enough to test its battery performance during long phone calls or other typical drains , but the battery life seemed adequate .
The unit lasted about a day with heavy data use , downloads , and video playback from YouTube , although that was with the inadequate default brightness .
The Green Party Candidate Only One to Discuss ' Massive Disenfranchisement ' and ' Manipulation of Electronic Voting Machines ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/12/2008 , 6:30 am PT
On Tuesday , while the corporate media was helping along John McCain 's faux controversy over lipstick and farm animals , and while Republicans were otherwise preparing to celebrate 9/11 on Thursday , a group of so - called " third - party " Presidential candidates gathered for a news conference at the National Press Club , as sponsored by Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) 's CampaignForLiberty.org .
Paul 's introductory statement , endorsing third - party candidates as a whole , is here .
Paul recently announced his refusal to endorse his party 's nominee , John McCain , despite their personal entreaties .
The entire press conference is on video here .
The candidates joining Paul included independent candidate Ralph Nader , Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney and Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin .
It was announced that the Libertarian candidate Bob Barr would be present as well , but he became a no - show and then decided to hold his own presser an hour later .
The snub earned him the excoriation and retraction of an endorsement from Adam Kokesh of Iraq Veteran 's Against the War , who I interviewed earlier this week while guest hosting The Randi Rhodes Show .
Kokesh was the awesome dude who held up the " You Can't Win an Occupation " protest sign during John McCain 's RNC acceptance speech last week .
The three candidates who did show , all spoke to various aspects of the detrimental nature of the dangerous two - party duopoly the country is currently saddled with , thanks in no small part to the corporate media 's unwavering support thereof .
( See this condescending coverage from WaPo clown Dana Milbank , whose never run for even dog catcher , as far as I know , much less President on a national party ticket , by way of just one such example . )
Only McKinney spoke directly to the issues surrounding Election Integrity .
She is , to my knowledge , the only Presidential candidate of any party this year , to speak substantively to the most important matter underscoring every freedom we have and every serious issue we face in this nation .
She begins her remarks by pointing out : " What has not been mentioned this morning , and has rarely been mentioned throughout this presidential election season , is the issue of election integrity . "
She speaks rather eloquently both about " massive disenfranchisement " and " manipulation of electronic voting machines . "
The video clip of her comments on the topic ( appx. 3 mins , courtesy Alan Breslauer ) is below .
A text - transcript is included at the end of this article …
None of the candidates , including McKinney , have yet signed the StandingForVoters.org pledge to challenge any questionable election results and not concede until every vote is counted , and counted accurately .
We ( The BRAD BLOG is a co-founder of VelvetRevolution.us , the creators of the StandingForVoters.org initiative ) welcome all such candidates , from any political party , running for any office on the national , state or local level , to sign the pledge and stand up for voters as they have / will stand up for them .
The SFV campaign calls on voters to demand candidates sign the pledge , and makes materials available to hand to them during campaign events .
For more info , see the website or write to info@StandingForVoters.org .
The text transcript of Cynthia McKinney 's statement yesterday on Election Integrity , follows below …
MCKINNEY : I think any construct that encourages people to vote their values is an appropriate one .
However , what has not been mentioned this morning , and has rarely been mentioned throughout this presidential election season , is the issue of election integrity .
And unfortunately what we have are problems that have been compounded – problems from 2000 , again in 2004 , and now in 2008 .
Different problems , unresolved problems , while the Congressional majority – the Democratic majority in Congress had the opportunity to address these issues , they have not done so . : I think any construct that encourages people to vote their values is an appropriate one .
However , what has not been mentioned this morning , and has rarely been mentioned throughout this presidential election season , is the issue of election integrity .
And unfortunately what we have are problems that have been compounded – problems from 2000 , again in 2004 , and now in 2008 .
Different problems , unresolved problems , while the Congressional majority – the Democratic majority in Congress had the opportunity to address these issues , they have not done so .
So , for example , for those of you who are not familiar with the film “ American Blackout ” , it methodologically demonstrates how the election in 2000 , and again in 2004 , how those two presidential elections were stolen , and the use of certain political constructs in order to disenfranchise certain populations .
Now aside from the fact that we do n’t have election integrity , or did n’t have it in 2000 where one million black people went to the polls , and they voted , but their votes were not even counted …
So we should never forget the fact that there was massive disenfranchisement , one million blacks alone whose votes were not counted , and yet there are some who would like to talk about stealing elections .
Basically , here has to be election integrity .
Secondly , in the 2004 election , again what you see is the situation with the purposeful manipulation of electronic voting machines – aside from the fact that electronic voting machines have their inherent problems that have not been resolved from their introduction in 2000 …
Now in 2008 we have the voter ID laws that have been passed , that basically create a two - tiered election system in this country – one for those who show up at the polls on election day with certain sets of requirements , and then , yet another , less - stringent set of requirements for those who mail in their ballots .
And then of course we have the voter caging , and the voter caging also targets certain populations of voters .
So therefore , we ’ve got some severe problems with election integrity , and those need to be addressed in the system , and by those who are campaigning within it as well .
Klein : Bush admin creats crises to ' enrich themselves and their friends ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday October 3 , 2008
Print This Email This On Thursday 's edition of The Colbert Report , bestselling author Naomi Klein argued that the Bush Administration creates crises in order to " enrich themselves and their friends , " drawing parallels between the torture of prisoners and the economic bailout being provided to Wall St. by US leaders .
Previously , Klein called out the sprawling economic crisis as just another example of the Bush ' shock doctrine , ' a key component to the ruling regime 's corporate agenda .
" Now , the name of your book is ' The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , ' " said host Stephen Colbert .
" Okay now , what is the ' shock doctrine ' ?
' Cause , that sounds like a great way to get information out of a prisoner . "
Amused , Klein responded , " Well , there really is a parallel .
If you really want to get information out of a prisoner , you have to put them into a state of shock , and when they 're in that state , they 'll kinda do whatever you want . "
" Exactly ! " exclaimed Colbert .
" So , you agree that we should be torturing prisoners .
You just said that .
Those are your words , madam . "
Laughing , his guest played off the satirical remark .
" Whole societies also go into states of shock when there 's a crisis , like when there 's a terrorist attack , or a huge natural disaster , or a huge economic crisis , " said Klein .
" Something happens , people do n't know what 's going on , and they 'll kinda do whatever people in authority want them to do . "
Klein continued : " They use shocks to enrich themselves and their friends ...
People are becoming shock resistant , which is wonderful because they remember the way this administration used the shock of Sept. 11 to build the Homeland Security industry ; How Rudy Giuliani went into that industry himself as soon as he left office .
They remember how the war in Iraq was used to privatize the government . "

‘ PREEMPTIVE LYING ’….
This may be my single favorite press release of the entire presidential campaign .
McCain campaign spokesperson Brian Rogers issued this statement :
In his rush to score political points on economic disaster , we ’ve heard that at his next event in New Mexico , Senator Obama is about to distort the facts and attack John McCain ’s call for removing the Chairman of the SEC .
Rogers ’ concern , obviously , is that Obama would point out that McCain told voters today he would “ fire ” the chairman of the SEC , when in reality , that ’s outside the president ’s authority — a fact McCain should have realized before tackling the subject .
Regardless , it ’s more entertaining to realize that the McCain campaign is criticizing Obama for something he might say , before he says it , accusing Obama of “ distorting ” the facts , before he ’s even spoken .
In other words , the McCain campaign line is , “ Obama might point out how McCain screwed up earlier , and if he does , he ’s being totally unfair — because we say so . ”
Even by the McCain campaign ’s standards , this is surprisingly foolish .
I know Schmidt & Co. must be kicking themselves for failing to check first to see if the president can fire the SEC chair , but attacking a speech they have n’t heard ?
C’mon .
Greg Sargent asks ,
“ Are we seeing the birth of a new McCain campaign doctrine of preemptive lying ? ”
Apparently , so .
If only I had a nickel each time I was asked this question !
Well , I am vegetarian , and my meals are balanced and healthy .
I have not been diagnosed with deficiencies or malnourishment yet .
On the other hand , I feel light and healthy , eat 25 % less fat ( than meat eaters ) on an average , and save significantly on grocery costs .
The main sources of protein for vegetarians are legumes , nuts , whole grain and dairy products .
The protein content in these foods per serving portion is in fact comparable to that in meats , fish and poultry .
For example , broad beans and fava beans have approximately 26.12 grams ( gm ) of protein per 100 gm , while salmon and some other fish have only 25.72 gm / 100 gm .
Soy based products have 36.49 gm of protein per 100 gm and pork and ham have 30.94 gm / 100 gm .
The vegetarian foods mentioned above are significantly higher in fiber and lower in cholesterol , all of which bumps up their overall nutritive value .
A more detailed break up of individual nutritional value is provided in the USDA Nutrient guide website .
In addition , almost all whole foods are rich in protein , and are great sources of essential minerals like potassium , iron , magnesium and zinc ; making them a well rounded and healthier option .
Of late , there has been a renewed interest in the vegetarian lifestyle , which includes exclusively fruits , vegetables , grains , cereal and legumes and soy products .
The benefits of an exclusively vegetarian diet includes lower risk of cancer , lower overall Body Mass Index , lower risk for diabetes and heart disease .
A recent study by Fu and associates suggested that vegetarians had statistically significant lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure , and lower serum total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides , fasting blood sugar , and hemoglobin levels compared with the non-vegetarians .
Being vegetarian is also better for the environment as a decrease in the demand for beef and poultry will eventually lead to fewer meat farms .
Lower number of cattle and poultry reared will mean decreased depletion of grasslands and fields , which will ultimately free up more pastures for production of food for humans .
There are increasing vegetarian options available at the market and in restaurants .
Numerous recipes are also available and it is easy to modify some of the existing meat recipes to make it vegetarian .
Ethnic cuisines like Thai , Indian and Chinese are especially easier to adapt to suit a vegetarian .
If this is an option you were contemplating , I suggest that you give Vegetarianism a fair shot and observe how your body and mind feel after a sustained period of this lifestyle .

5.2 Score Popularity Activity Freshness
Speaking on CNN last week , former GOP presidential candidate and current McCain economic adviser Steve Forbes belittled the likelihood of McCain ’s plan to combat climate change actually coming to fruition .
When asked about the economic impact of McCain ’s proposed cap and trade , Forbes almost scoffed at the idea of such a policy ever actually being taken up .
Forbes said :
“ I think cap and trade is going to go the way of some other things .
As you may remember , when he came into office , Bill Clinton had a proposal of tax carbons and stuff like that .
I do n’t think those things are going to get very far as people start to examine the details of them . ”
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/aibPg9XHeYY&hl=en&fs=1]
Throughout the Republican primaries John McCain continually pointed to his support for a carbon cap and trading program and the legislation he co-sponsored with Joe Lieberman as one of the critical differences between himself and the other Republicans – as well as between himself and President Bush .
So , is McCain saying one thing on the stump and then planning something completely different with his economic advisors ?
The McCain camp has issued no statement on the Forbes remarks – but I ’m sure they ’ve seen the video .
If Mr. Forbes was speaking out of turn then why does n’t the McCain camp distance themselves from Forbes by reiterating their support of cap and trade ?
Without any such action , one can only assume that Forbes ’ remarks were not too wide of the mark in terms of Mcain ’s priorities .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday proposed overhauling the tax code to lower taxes for the poor and middle class , increase them for the rich and make it so most Americans can file their taxes in five minutes .
Sen . Barack Obama delivers his tax overhal plan Tuesday in Washington .
The tax relief plan he envisions for the middle class alone would mean $ 80 billion or more in tax cuts , he said .
Obama , an Illinois Democrat who is a front - runner for his party 's 2008 presidential nomination , said during a speech at the Tax Policy Center that the present tax code reflects the wrong priorities because it rewards wealth instead of work .
" Instead of having all of us pay our fair share , we 've got over $ 1 trillion worth of loopholes in the corporate tax code , " he said .
" This is n't the invisible hand of the market at work .
It 's the successful work of special interests . "
Watch Obama unveil his tax plan »
The result , according to Obama ?
" Gaps in wealth in this country grow wider , while the costs to working people are greater . "
His plan means billions in breaks by nixing income taxes for the 7 million senior citizens making less than $ 50,000 a year , establishing a universal credit for the 10 million homeowners who do not itemize their deductions -- most of whom make less than $ 50,000 annually -- and providing 150 million Americans with tax cuts of up to $ 1,000 .
" I 'd reward work by providing an income tax cut of up to $ 500 per person -- or $ 1,000 for each working family -- to offset the payroll tax that they 're already paying , " he said .
" Because this credit would be greater than their income tax bill , my proposal would effectively eliminate all income taxes for 10 million working Americans . "
Obama also said he would repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans .
" At a time when Americans are working harder than ever , we are taxing income from work at nearly twice the level that we 're taxing gains for investors , " Obama said .
" We 've lost the balance between work and wealth . "
Obama 's plan is similar in many ways to his Democratic rivals , including Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - New York , and former Sen. John Edwards , D - North Carolina .
Both Edwards and Clinton rolled out their tax plans earlier this year -- with Clinton calling for " rolling back some of President Bush 's fiscally - irresponsible tax breaks for the highest income Americans , " and Edwards pledging to " get rid of Bush 's tax cut for people who make over two hundred thousand dollars a year . "
Tuesday 's announcement in Washington is part of an economic policy push by Obama .
On Monday he was at the NASDAQ headquarters in New York City chastising Wall Street executives for looking out for themselves rather than helping the middle class .
Obama also said he 'd simplify the tax code so that any employed American with a bank account can do their taxes in minutes if they take the standard deduction .
It makes sense , he said , because the Internal Revenue Service already collects wage and bank account information .
" There 's no reason the IRS can't send Americans pre-filled tax forms to verify , " he said .
" This means no more worry .
No more wasted time .
No more extra expenses for a tax preparer . "
Obama proposes funding the tax cuts by closing corporate loopholes , cracking down on international tax havens and increasing the dividend - and - capital - gains tax for the wealthy , he said .
He called his proposal a " fair " alternative to the present tax code and said it was necessary because hard times on Main Street translate to hard times on Wall Street .
" When the changes in our economy are leaving too many people behind , the competitiveness of our country risks falling behind , " he said .
" When that dream of opportunity is denied to too many Americans , then ultimately that pain has a way of trickling up . "

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security will take responsibility from airlines for checking passenger names against watch lists beginning in January and will require all commercial passengers for the first time to provide their full name , date of birth and gender as a condition of boarding a flight , U.S. officials said Wednesday .
The changes will be phased in next year for the 2 million passengers each day aboard domestic and international flights to , from or over the United States .
It marks the Bush administration ’s long - delayed fulfillment of a top aviation security priority identified after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , an effort that has long spurred privacy concerns .
Speaking at Reagan National Airport , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Transportation Security Administration chief Kip Hawley said that by gathering more personal information from passengers , the government will dramatically cut down on instances of mistaken identity that have wrongly delayed travelers or kept them off flights .
Over the years , countless travelers have faced difficulties because their names are similar to those on the agency ’s no-fly list or a second list of “ selectees ” identified for added questioning .
They include infants and toddlers , Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass . , and the wife of Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska , Catherine , whose name is similar to Cat Stevens , the former name of the watch - listed pop singer who converted to Islam .
“ We know that threats to our aviation system persist , ” Chertoff said .
“ Secure Flight will help us better protect the traveling public while creating a more consistent passenger pre-screening process , ultimately reducing the number of misidentification issues . ”

The change of fortune has come so fast that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , which had almost forgotten how to accept an application , has gone into a frenzy of hiring , bringing on hundreds of new engineers to handle the crush of applications .
Many problems could derail the so - called nuclear revival , and virtually no one believes all 34 proposed plants will be built .
It is still unclear how many billions they would cost , whether the expense can be financed in a troubled credit market , and how the cost might compare with other power sources .
But experts who follow the industry expect that at least some of the 34 will be built .
Given rising public concern about global warming and a recent history of reliable operation among nuclear plants , “ the climate for introducing new plants is probably the best it ’s been since the industry started canceling plants ” 30 years ago , said Brian Balogh , a history professor at the University of Virginia .
Unlike most types of power generation , nuclear plants do not emit the gases that cause global warming , once they are completed .
In the United States , orders for new reactors essentially ended in October 1973 .
That was also the month that the Arab oil embargo began , inaugurating an era of economic problems that drove up construction costs and suppressed demand for power .
In the end , more than 100 nuclear reactors , some in advanced stages of construction , were canceled , and tens of billions of dollars were squandered .
On top of that , the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl explosion in 1986 made nuclear power a hard sell .
And cheap turbines were developed to burn natural gas to generate electricity .
By the 1990s , even some nuclear plants that had been running for a few years were deemed too costly and were closed .
As the LHC ’s activation date approaches ( only two days left now , folks ! ) , scientists working on the super - collider have started receiving large amounts of pleas , some which include death threats , asking to stop the potential apocalypse - bringing machine .
According to an article published on the Telegraph , CERN , the organization behind the project , has been bombarded with calls , faxes and e-mails from concerned , wanna - be scientists assuming that the LHC will end the universe as we know it .
Yes , folks , they believe the universe , which is billions of years old , can be destroyed by an insignificant , man -made machine .
Do n’t you find this just a bit ridiculous ?
Reactions like the ones the LHC tries to replicate have been happening on a galactic - level for far longer than what our mind can conceive , so I do n’t think there ’s really a reason why anyone should worry .
Oh , and if you want to try and imagine the kind of attention CERN is receiving right now , you should see some of the search - engine traffic we ’re getting on the only article we ’ve ever published that mentions some of the potential risks of the LHC .
Thousands of people every week search for “ CERN risks ” and similar keywords .
Our guess is that as the month passes , we ’ll see this trend become exponential … while the universe , planet Earth included , continues to safely prosper .
Edit : Oh , and for those of you who ’d like to watch when the Large Haldron Collider goes live on Wednesday , CERN has put up a live webcast section on their site .
You too can now be part of the party when the world goes BOOM !
Pretty cool eh ?
Bianca Jagger Evicted ( Photos )
, once married to rocker , is without a place to call home in the U.S.
The New York Court of Appeals ruled that she was properly evicted from a $ 4,600 a month 18th floor apartment on Park Avenue .
The trendy rent controlled coop building had a requirement that all inhabitants must be able to claim the space as their primary residence .
The East Side Manhattan building owner decided to hold Jagger 's heels to the fire and booted her after twenty years .
She was on a B - 2 visa and could n't prove to the court that the apartment was her primary residence .
Judge Robert S. Smith concluded in a four page decision :
" We conclude that , absent some unusual circumstances , a primary residence and a B - 2 visa are logically incompatible . "
Biana was n't always so in love with her posh Park Avenue pad .
She actually moved out temporarily several years ago citing a mold problem .
She sued the building owner claiming the residence was uninhabitable .
This likely caused him to want to be rid of the jet setter .
The courts have concurred with his right to evict her .
A native of Nicaragua , Bianca is a British citizen who also keeps at least one luxury apartment in London 's Belgravia section .
Interior designer Jade Jagger is Bianca 's daughter .

Apparently so .
The last one is unbelievable !
No matter how poor your memory is , you could n't possibly not remember ... This just shows how much people actually take notice of what is in front of them .
Women are waiting longer to have children , and more women than ever are choosing not to have children at all , according to a new Census Bureau report .
Twenty percent of women ages 40 to 44 have no children , double the level of 30 years ago , the report said ; and women in that age bracket who do have children have fewer than ever  an average of 1.9 children , compared with the mean average of 3.1 children in 1976 .
“ A lot of women are not having any children , ” said Jane Lawler Dye , a Census Bureau researcher who did the report , which looked at women of childbearing age in 2006 .
“ It used to be sort of expected that there was a phase of life where you had children , and a lot of women are n’t doing that now , ” Ms. Dye said .
Women with advanced degrees are more likely to be childless , the study found .
Of women 40 to 44 with graduate or professional degrees , 27 percent are childless , compared with 18 percent of women who did not continue their education beyond high school , the data show .
Artist Evan Roth has been working on a soon to be released project that toys with an innovative and provocative means of communication as a form of protest .
The project , called “ TSA Communication “ , incorporates metal plates with laser - cut messages placed at the bottom of carry - on luggage .
As the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) employees X - ray the luggage , the intended message is presented on the operator ’s display .
Apparently , Roth has made it through three trial airport runs already and was only stopped when trying his box cutter silhouette plate , which he calls “ The exact opposite of a box cutter ” .
They let Roth go after he explained that it was an art project .
Other designs include a simple middle finger , an American flag , and the messages “ Nothing To See Here ” and “ Mind Your Own Business ” .
The plates are 8.5 x 11 - inch sheets of stainless steel and the laser - cutting apparently costs $ 300 per sheet .
That ’s an obscene amount for a DIYer to reproduce .
If you ’re patient and good with a drill and steel - cutting hacksaw blade , I reckon you could make one up for a few dollars .
Definitely would n’t be as neat , mind .
It ’s a fascinating experiment which I ’m sure will lead to some very creative messages if this catches on .
Unfortunately , it ’s not a very effective means of communicating discontent or instigating protests or change of any kind .
The TSA attendants are just employees trying to earn a living , they ’re not on some personal crusade .
A message sent in this manner , while fun , is not going to achieve much and could possibly result in you being singled out for additional screening .
Not pleasant .
It ’s curious that these metal plates are n’t instantly confiscated upon detection .
If one edge were sharpened it could make for a serious weapon .

A credit crisis has been spreading through the economic system .
It began with the collapse of the housing bubble , which was the result of years of Federal Reserve–sponsored credit expansion .
This credit expansion poured hundreds of billions of dollars into the purchase of homes largely by subprime borrowers who never had a realistic capability of repaying their mortgage debts in the first place .
And , not surprisingly , large numbers of them in fact stopped making the payments required by their mortgages .
At first apparently confined to the market for subprime mortgages , the credit crisis has spread to other portions of the mortgage market , to the usually staid municipal bond market , and within the last week or so has led to a run against a major investment bank ( Bear Stearns ) .
Along the way , triple - A rated securities have overnight turned into junk bonds , multibillion - dollar hedge funds have collapsed , and major commercial banks have lost tens of billions of dollars of capital .
All this , despite massive infusions of funds into the market by the Federal Reserve System and other central banks and a reduction in the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent in September of 2007 to 2.25 percent currently .
In the process , the triple - A rated securities that turned out to be junk served to confirm the old truth that lead cannot be turned into gold : the alleged triple - A securities were backed by collections of mortgages that in the last analysis consisted largely or even entirely of subprimes .
An important new truth also appears to have emerged : namely , that PhDs in finance , the likely authors of the schemes for creating such securities , can turn out to be far more costly than anyone had ever dreamed possible .
Currently , untold billions more of banks ' capital now hinge on the survival of bond insurers striving to insure more than two trillion dollars of outstanding bonds on the basis of capital of their own of roughly ten billion dollars .
Collapse of the bond insurers would mean that credit - rating firms , such as Moody 's and Standard and Poor 's , would reduce the ratings of all the bond issues that would consequently be deprived of insurance coverage .
This in turn would serve to reduce the prices of those bonds , because lower credit ratings would make them ineligible for purchase by numerous investors , such as many pension funds .
To the extent that the bonds were owned by banks , the value of the banks ' assets would be correspondingly reduced and with it the magnitude of the banks ' capital .
The decline in the assets and capital of banks that has already taken place has served to reduce the ability of banks to lend money to borrowers to whom they would otherwise normally lend .
To the extent , for example , that subprime mortgage borrowers have stopped paying interest and principal on their loans , the banks do not have those funds available to make loans to other borrowers .
The effects of such credit contraction can already be seen in business bankruptcies precipitated by an inability of firms to obtain refinancing of debts coming due .
It can also be seen in the growing difficulty even of sound firms to obtain financing required for expansion .
The Role of Leverage
Our present circumstances follow decades , indeed , generations of almost continuous inflation and credit expansion , in which almost everyone has become accustomed to assume that asset values will always rise or at least will quickly resume their rise after any pause or decline .
This assumption not only played an important role in the eagerness with which people lent and borrowed in the mortgage market , but also in bringing about the very high degree of financial leverage that has come to characterize practically all areas of our financial system .
( Leverage is the use of borrowed funds to increase the returns that can be earned with a given sized capital .
It equivalently increases the losses that can be incurred on that capital . )
Unduly high leverage explains the failure of major lenders in the prime portion of the real estate market .
As the result of losses sustained in subprime mortgages , banks and other lenders could no longer provide funds as readily for the purchase of prime mortgages .
The resulting few percent drop in the value of prime mortgages has served to wipe out the entire capital of prime mortgage lenders whose capital was so highly leveraged that it constituted an even smaller percentage of the value of their assets than the few percent drop in the price of those assets .
For example , if a mortgage lender initially had assets worth $ 103 and debts of his own of $ 100 incurred in order to finance the purchase of those assets , a mere 4 percent decline in the value of his assets would wipe out his entire capital and then some .
Multiply these numbers by many billions , and the example corresponds exactly to the real - world cases of Thornburg Mortgage and Carlyle Capital reported on the front page of The New York Times of March 8 , and to that of Bear Stearns reported on the front page of The New York Times just one week later .
The liquidation of the assets of such lenders , which consisted mainly of prime mortgages , has meant a further fall in the price of prime mortgages , to the point where the credit even of the government - sponsored mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has come into question .
These two lenders have outstanding mortgage - backed obligations of more than $ 4 trillion , which sum until recently was assumed also to be an obligation of the US government .
Now it has become uncertain whether the actual obligation of the US government extends beyond the less than $ 5 billion in lines of credit these lenders have with the US Treasury .
The Federal Reserve 's rescue of Bear Stearns can be understood in part in the light of its desire to avoid further declines in the assets and capital of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which would have resulted if Bear had had to sell off its holdings of mortgages .
The likelihood that the failure of Bear would have triggered the failure of other major Wall Street firms and thereby have resulted in even more massive sell - offs of mortgages , along with other assets , was a related important consideration .
Remarkably , at the very same time that the Federal Reserve has been striving to cope with the consequences of excessive leverage and possibly thereby help to prevent the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government regulator of these institutions — the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight — is not content with the fact that they are already skating on dangerously thin ice .
Thus ,
The New York Times of March 20 reports that the regulator has just decided to reduce their capital requirements , for the purpose of enabling them to take on still more leverage .
The effect of this will be that an even more modest decline in home prices and mortgage values will be sufficient to drive Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into bankruptcy than is now the case .
As these examples illustrate , the failure of debtors can serve to wipe out the capital of highly leveraged creditors , who then become unable to pay their debts , perhaps causing the failure of their creditors , and so on .
In other words , one failure can set off a domino effect of a chain of failures .
What serves to end the process is when someone in the chain finally accumulates enough salvageable assets from those earlier in the chain to be able to satisfy his creditors .
Leverage and Bank Capital
Operating alongside the process of chains of failures is another , even more important aspect of the leverage present in today 's financial system .
This is the fact that reductions in the capital of banks can result in multiple contractions of credit .
As a rough average , banks are normally required to possess capital equal to five percent of their outstanding loans and investments .
( Investments are purchases of securities . )
The implication of this is that reductions in banks ' capital below the five percent level have the potential to result in contractions of credit twenty times as large , in efforts to reestablish the five percent ratio .
For example , a bank with an initial capital of $ 5 billion could support $ 100 billion in outstanding loans and investments , based on the requirement that its capital be at least 5 percent of the credit it has granted .
But if its capital falls to $ 4 billion , it must reduce its outstanding loans and investments to $ 80 billion to be in compliance with that requirement .
In other words , a $ 1 billion reduction in bank capital can cause a $ 20 billion reduction in outstanding bank credit .
Such announcements as that recently made by Citibank , that it would reduce its holdings of home loans by 20 percent , are entirely consistent with this phenomenon , as are the recent failures of banks and brokers to make bids in markets for so - called auction - rate notes .
( These are credit instruments whose interest rates are set periodically on the basis of auctions and that until recently were billed as the equivalent of cash .
Bidding for them would have placed banks at risk of acquiring additional assets and indebtedness when they urgently needed to reduce their assets and indebtedness . )
Credit Contraction and Deflation
Of the greatest importance is the further fact that credit contraction by banks has the effect of reducing the outstanding volume of checking deposits in the economic system and to that extent the quantity of money in the economic system .
This result follows from the fact that when debtors repay their loans , they do so by means of writing checks , the proceeds of which are subtracted not only from their accounts but also from the balance sheets of the banks on which the checks are drawn .
If those banks do not then make equivalent new loans , accompanied by the creation of equivalent fresh checking deposits for new borrowers , the amount of the checking deposits used to repay the loans simply disappears .
( The same result occurs when banks sell portions of their securities holdings to members of the public .
The buyers of the securities pay for them by means of writing checks , and the proceeds of those checks then disappear not only from the checking accounts of the purchasers but also from the balance sheets of the banks on which the checks are drawn . )
Such contraction of credit and money operates to reduce the amount of spending in the economic system .
The money that is no longer present in the economic system — because the credit that would have provided it has disappeared — is money that can no longer be spent .
Money no longer spent is business sales revenues no longer earned .
A drop in business sales revenues , in turn , causes a drop in spending by the firms that would have earned those sales revenues .
This further drop in spending reduces both the sales revenues of other firms , namely , those that would have supplied the firms in question , and wage payments to workers , as employees are laid off in the face of declining sales .
And , of course , as wage payments fall , so too does the spending of wage earners for consumers ' goods .
The decline in spending , sales revenues , and wage payments is repeated again and again throughout the economic system , as many times in a year as the vanished sum of money would have been spent and respent in that year .
Of no less importance is the fact that a decline in the quantity of money and volume of spending can itself cause further declines in the assets and capital of banks .
This is because as the sales revenues of business firms decline , so too do their profits and their ability to repay debts , including debts to banks .
The resulting further declines in the value of bank assets further reduce the capitals of banks , causing more credit contraction , further reductions in the quantity of money and volume of spending , and still more reductions in the asset values and capitals of banks , on and on in a self - reinforcing vicious circle .
Bank Failures and Bank Runs
Historically , processes such as those just described have not taken place smoothly and gradually , in a manner akin to the air slowly leaking from some kind of giant inflated balloon .
To the contrary , they have been characterized by sudden massive ruptures in the fabric of the system , namely , by bank failures , often precipitated by bank runs .
Sooner or later , the erosion of its capital makes a bank actually fail .
What is meant in saying that bank failures were often precipitated by bank runs is merely that at some point depositors woke up to the fact that a bank 's assets were no longer sufficient to guarantee the repayment of its deposits , and so raced to withdraw their funds while it was still possible to do so .
Bank failures , and even bank runs , are by no means a phenomenon confined to history .
Intermittent bank failures continued to occur through the entire 20th century .
And the present chairman of the Federal Reserve System has said that some bank failures are to be expected in our present crisis .
Only late last summer there was not only a failure but also an actual run on a major British bank , Northern Rock .
If our own credit crisis continues and deepens further , it should not be surprising to start seeing bank runs here in the United States as well .
Indeed , what happened to Bear Stearns — which is an investment bank — on March 13 and made it seek the help of the Federal Reserve System was precisely a run , as large numbers of its clients sought to withdraw their funds all at once .
It is very possible that what has just happened at Bear Stearns will also happen at one or more major commercial banks , whose customers hold checking or savings accounts .
( In this connection , it should be kept in mind that federal deposit insurance is limited to a maximum of $ 100,000 per account .
The run would be on the part of those whose accounts are larger than $ 100,000 . )
When a bank fails , unless it is immediately taken over by another , still - solvent bank , its outstanding checking deposits lose the character of money and assume that of a security in default .
That is , instead of being able to be spent , as the virtual equivalent of currency , they are reduced to the status of a claim to an uncertain sum of money to be paid at an unspecified time in the future , i.e. , after the assets of the bank have been liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the various parties judged to have legitimate claims to them .
Thus , what had been spendable as the equivalent of currency suddenly becomes no more spendable than any other security in default .
This change in the status of a bank 's checking deposits constitutes a fully equivalent reduction in the quantity of money in the economic system .
Thus , for example , if a bank were to fail with outstanding checking deposits of $ 100 billion , say , and not be taken over immediately by another , still - solvent bank , the quantity of money in the economic system would also immediately fall by $ 100 billion .
As a result of this fact , bank failures have the potential greatly to accelerate and deepen the descent into deflation and economic depression .
For they represent much larger , more sudden reductions in the quantity of money and volume of spending in the economic system .
And , just like lesser reductions , their effect , unless somehow checked or counteracted , is to launch a vicious circle of contraction and deflation .
The period 1929 – 1933 provides the leading historical example .
In 1929 , the quantity of money in the United States was approximately $ 26 billion and the gross national product ( GNP / GDP ) of the country , which provides an approximate measure of consumer spending , was $ 103 billion .
By 1933 , following wave after wave of bank failures , the quantity of money had fallen to approximately $ 19 billion and the GNP to less than $ 56 billion .
The failure of wage rates and prices to fall to anywhere near the same extent resulted in mass unemployment .
The Potential for Deflation Today
In order to understand the potential for deflation today , in 1929 , or at any other time , it is necessary to understand the concepts " standard money " and " fiduciary media . "
Standard money is money that is not a claim to anything beyond itself .
It is money the receipt of which constitutes final payment .
Under a gold standard , standard money is gold coin or bullion .
Paper currency under a gold standard is not standard money .
It is merely a claim to standard money , i.e. , gold .
Since 1933 , paper currency in the United States has been irredeemable .
It has ceased to be a claim to anything beyond itself .
Its receipt constitutes final payment .
Thus , since 1933 , the standard money of the United States has been irredeemable paper currency .
Most of the money supply of the United States , today as in 1929 , is not standard money of any kind , but rather fiduciary media .
Fiduciary media are transferable claims to standard money , payable on demand by their issuers , accepted in commerce as the equivalent of standard money , but for which no standard money actually exists .
What precisely fits the description of fiduciary media are checking deposits insofar as they exceed the reserves of standard money held by the banks that issue them .
Checking deposits are , first of all , transferable claims to standard money , payable on demand by the banks that issue them , and accepted in commerce as the equivalent of standard money .
To the extent that they exceed the currency reserves owned by the banks that issue them , they are fiduciary media .
At the present time , there are approximately $ 2.5 trillion of checking deposits in one form or another .
These checking deposits are those reported as part of the M1 money supply ( $ 625 billion ) , plus those reported as so - called sweep accounts by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ( $ 765 billion ) , and those reported as retail money fund accounts ( $ 1078 billion ) .
In addition to these checking deposits , our present money supply consists of approximately $ 800 billion in currency outside the banking system .
Our total money supply is thus currently $ 3.3 trillion .
Of these $ 3.3 trillion , the quantity of standard money is approximately $ 840 billion : the currency outside the banks plus $ 40 billion of currency reserves of the banking system .
There are no reserve requirements on either sweep accounts or retail money fund accounts .
Supposedly there is a basic 10 percent reserve requirement against the checking deposits counted under M1 .
Nevertheless , the actual reserves held against these checking deposits are not $ 62 or $ 63 billion , but merely on the order of $ 40 billion , which implies an overall effective reserve requirement of less than 7 percent against these checking deposits .
When compared to the total checking deposits of the economic system , the roughly $ 40 billion of reserves constitute a reserve on the order of less than 2 percent .
This is the measure of the leverage of today 's banking system with respect to reserves .
In an ongoing process of a vicious circle of bank failures , a falling quantity of money and volume of spending , and thus falling business sales revenues , mounting business losses and business failures , resulting in still more bank failures , the volume of checking deposits might ultimately be reduced all the way down to the system 's $ 40 billion of standard money reserves .
This last is the actual currency either in the possession of the banks or belonging to them while held by the Federal Reserve System .
This currency is the only asset of the banks whose value cannot be reduced by the failure of debtors .
The potential deflation of checking deposits , if nothing were done to stop it , is the difference between their present amount of $ 2.5 trillion and the $ 40 billion of reserves that stand behind them .
The potential deflation of the money supply as a whole , if nothing were done to stop it , is the difference between $ 3.3 trillion and $ 840 billion , i.e. , approximately 75 percent .
Why Massive Deflation must be Prevented
Massive deflation is always something that should be avoided if it is humanly possible to do so .
The surest and best way to avoid it is to avoid the prolonged credit expansions that set the stage for it .
The only way that the economic system can adjust to deflation once it has occurred is by means of corresponding reductions in wage rates and prices .
These serve to increase the buying power of the reduced quantity of money and the reduced volume of spending that it supports .
If they were sufficient , they would enable the reduced quantity of money and volume of spending to buy all that the previously larger quantity of money and volume of spending had bought .
Yet there are powerful obstacles in the way of wage rates and prices falling .
Not the least of these is the prevailing belief that rather than it being the reduction in the quantity of money and volume of spending that is deflation , it is the fall in wages rates and prices that is deflation .
This incredible confusion leads to misguided attempts to combat deflation by means of preventing the only thing that would make possible a recovery from deflation , namely , a fall in wage rates and prices .
This confusion is joined by the even more influential errors of the Marxian exploitation theory , which claims that employers would arbitrarily set wage rates at the level of minimum subsistence if not prevented from doing so by government intervention .
The result of this stew of ignorance is the existence of laws such as pro-union and minimum - wage legislation , which make it extraordinarily difficult or plain impossible for wage rates to fall .
These laws are tantamount to simply making it illegal for the process of recovery to proceed .
To these laws must be added the virtual paralysis of our present - day judicial system .
Not only do convicted murderers often sit on death row for years or even decades before their sentences are carried out or finally set aside , but ordinary law suits now normally take years to wind their way through our court system .
A leading consequence of a massive deflation would be millions upon millions of business and personal bankruptcies , which our court system is simply not equipped to handle .
The functioning of an economic system depends on clear knowledge of who owns what and who has the legal right to do what with what property .
It cannot wait years for judges to make clear and final decisions about such matters , which is the likely period of time it would take them if the present typical performance of our judicial system is any guide .
Given these legal obstacles , the effect of massive deflation would be long - term mass unemployment and economic paralysis .
Literally tens of millions would be unemployed , with no way to find new employment .
Such conditions , in combination with the massive economic illiteracy that prevails in our culture , would likely result in the adoption of many new and additional acts of destructive government interference .
It would not by any means be out of the question that the likes of a native - born Hugo Chavez could be elected president of the United States .
True and False Remedies
It should be obvious from much of what has been said in this article that what is driving our impending deflation is the lack of capital on the part of the banks , resulting from the losses they have thus far sustained on their assets .
This is what has been impelling them to contract credit , and which , if unchecked will serve to reduce their assets and capital further and further , until much or all of the banking system and the checking deposit money it has created collapses under its own weight for a sheer lack of monetary reserves .
In the light of this knowledge , such solutions as the recently enacted " stimulus package " designed to promote consumer spending should be dismissed as laughably naive .
The economic system is not going to be rescued by consumers , let alone by consumers so incapable of producing that they require government handouts in order to consume .
No one benefits by giving people the money with which to buy his products .
Yet this is the position such programs force taxpayers to assume .
Likewise , when one keeps in mind that the problem is a lack of capital , such alleged solutions as the Federal Reserve 's current policy of reducing interest rates must appear as clearly counterproductive .
Reductions in interest rates in the United States relative to those in Europe and elsewhere serve to keep badly needed capital out of our country by making investment there more profitable than investment here .
In keeping down the overall supply of capital in the United States , they contribute to the lack of credit and to making it more difficult for banks to obtain the additional capital they need .
The Federal Reserve has carried this policy a large step further , with its most recent reduction in the federal funds rate from 3 percent to 2.25 percent .
Similarly , the rescue measure proposed for homeowners faced with foreclosure , namely , forcibly reducing interest rates on sub prime mortgages in violation of the contractual terms of the mortgages and against the will of the mortgage holders , would serve further to reduce the earnings , assets , and capital of the banks .
Decisions of judges to place obstacles in the way of the foreclosure process , such as insisting on the presentation of the original mortgage documents , even though it is undisputed that the borrower is in default , also serve to weaken the financial position of banks .
It can do so not only directly but also indirectly , by contributing to the bankruptcy of non-bank mortgage lenders with debts to banks .
The sympathy expressed for the families threatened with foreclosure is very largely misplaced .
It is forgotten how many of them purchased their homes without making any down payment of any kind , and often without being obliged to make any payments of principal on their mortgages .
Many of the homes now being foreclosed were purchased by such buyers not for the purpose of having a place to live , but for the purpose of profiting from a speculative investment .
Of course , there are also some homeowners who did make substantial down payments in purchasing their homes , even during the housing bubble .
But there are many more who purchased their homes before the bubble began but who in recent years foolishly chose to consume their equity , by incurring additional debt to finance consumption in excess of their incomes .
At the time , these people were lauded as pillars of the economy 's strength , on the basis of the same ridiculous beliefs that underlie the proposals to rescue the economy now by still more consumption on the part of people who can't afford it .
The effect of the years of Federal Reserve–sponsored credit expansion and the resulting spending binge on housing that people could not afford was to make housing unaffordable by millions of other people .
It was to raise median house prices in many places to the point where only the top 15 or 20 percent of income earners in the area could afford the median - priced home .
To make housing affordable once again by the mass of people who normally could afford to buy a home , housing prices need to fall to whatever extent their rise in recent years has exceeded the rise in median family incomes .
The foreclosure process is an essential step in bringing that about .
It should not be prevented in any way from taking place .
How to Increase the Capital and Reserves of the Banking System
Since the problem behind our impending deflation is the lack of capital on the part of the banks , and beyond that the lack of monetary reserves to maintain the supply of checkbook money when banks fail , it should be obvious that what is needed to avoid the threat of deflation is an increase in the capital and reserves of the banks .
When the problem is stated this way , a thought that is likely to occur to many people is that the banks should simply go out and raise additional capital .
They should sell stocks and bonds , for example .
And , in fact , that has actually happened in some cases , for example , that of Citibank , which raised $ 14.5 billion in new capital from foreign investors this last February .
One problem with such a procedure is how much of the bank 's ownership has to be given to the new investors to make their investment worthwhile for them .
And , as indicated , raising the necessary capital is made more difficult by Fed 's policy of low interest rates , which keeps down the supply of capital by discouraging foreign investment in the United States .
Another , deeper problem for many banks is that in the minds of potential investors the bank 's actual capital may be negative , requiring investors to put up not only new and additional capital but also capital required to overcome the bank 's negative capital .
( Negative capital can easily result when on the left - hand side of a bank 's balance sheet there are tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of assets whose value can decline , while on the right - hand side there are tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of deposits whose value is fixed .
As we saw earlier , when capital is only a very few percent of assets to begin with , even a modest decline in the value of assets can turn it negative . )
The existence of negative capital entails requiring first an investment sufficient to reach the point of zero capital — and only then the investment of the capital that will enable the bank to maintain and increase its operations .
Moreover , the extent of the capital deficiency may not even actually be knowable .
Such considerations make the raising of additional capital by conventional means extremely difficult or altogether impossible .
It 's a case simply of having to invest too much in order to receive too little .
In these circumstances the only party willing to provide the needed capital funds is the government , i.e. , the Federal Reserve System , which has the power simply to print them if necessary .
At present , the Federal Reserve is already supplying the banking system ( and the major investment banks as well ) with capital .
But it is doing so only to the extent of overcoming negative capital , and perhaps doing that less than fully .
This is the essential meaning of the Fed 's acceptance of billions of dollars of assets of dubious value in exchange for its own assets of relatively secure value , i.e. , US government bonds and Treasury bills .
( The Fed now even accepts assets for which there is no market because finding a market would require a radical reduction in the price of the assets compared to what was originally paid for them , and correspondingly wipe out capital on the books of the banks . )
The Fed has committed almost half of its own principal assets to this project : $ 400 billion out of its most recently reported total holdings of government securities of $ 828 billion .
It will not be able to commit much more of those securities .
Indeed , however ironic it may be , the Federal Reserve — the " lender of last resort , " the alleged bailer - outer of the banking system and of the whole economy — is or may fairly soon be itself technically bankrupt as the result of this operation .
( This would be clear if the assets it receives had to be valued at their actual market value .
The result would be that the assets of the Fed would be less than the face value of its outstanding US currency and other liabilities . )
Unless the Fed 's actions up to now prove sufficient to end the financial crisis , its next step will be the printing of money to prop up the banking system .
Indeed , even if the crisis were to end as of now , there would still be the problem that the Fed 's infusion of capital has thus far been only on a temporary basis .
The banks are supposed to take back their low - grade and non-performing assets within a month or so and return the Fed 's securities .
Clearly , a solution to the problem of a lack of bank capital needs to be long - term , not something that must be renewed month by month .
Moreover , a proper solution to our present crisis should do more than merely overcome the difficulties of the moment .
It should , in addition , provide a guarantee against the recurrence of such crises in the future .
Above all , a proper solution to this or any other economic or political crisis should also meet the criterion of serving to advance the cause of economic freedom and should be designed with that objective in mind .
There is a means of accomplishing all three of these objectives .
That means is the use of gold as a major asset of the banking system .
Despite the certainty that a proposal of this kind will be almost completely ignored and has virtually no chance of being enacted in the foreseeable future , it still must be made .
This is because the most fundamental and important consideration is not what people are willing to accept or reject at the moment but what would in fact accomplish the objectives that need to be accomplished .
Using gold as a major asset of the banking system , in the way set forth below , would in fact safeguard the banking system from possible deflationary collapse , prevent the recurrence of any such threat , and do so in a way that substantially advanced the cause of economic freedom .
Making the proposal is necessary in order to uphold the philosophy of economic freedom , by providing a demonstration that that philosophy offers the solution to the growing monetary problems we face and is not their cause .
Gold as the Source of New Bank Capital and of Reserves
The Federal Reserve System holds approximately 260 million ounces of gold .
The market price of gold recently reached $ 1,000 per ounce .
This means that the Fed 's gold can easily be thought of as an asset with a market value of roughly $ 260 billion .
As an initial approach to understanding the solution to our problem , let us assume that the Federal Reserve declared its gold holding as being held in trust for the benefit of the American banking system , and proceeded to allow every bank to enter on the asset side of its balance sheet a portion of this gold corresponding to its share of the total of the $ 2.5 trillion of checking accounts presently in the economic system .
The banks would not physically possess the gold but only book entries corresponding to it .
The gold entered on banks ' balance sheets could also count as equivalent new and additional bank reserves .
Thus the measure would simultaneously add $ 260 billion of new and additional bank reserves in the form of gold as well as $ 260 billion of new and additional bank capital .
The reserves and the capital would both be essentially permanent .
In order to prevent the monetization of the gold reserves , the Fed could mandate a permanent required gold reserve against all checking deposits — those counted in M1 , those counted as " sweeps , " and those counted as retail money funds — in the ratio of $ 260 billion to $ 2.5 trillion , i.e. , a little over 10 percent .
A major shortcoming of this very simple solution is that the addition of $ 260 billion in gold to bank assets would probably be insufficient .
It almost certainly would be if the Fed decided , as it should , to take back its government securities from the investment banks and give them back their securities of far less value .
That would probably bankrupt most or all of the investment banks .
Furthermore , because the commercial banks are their main creditors , the assets of the investment banks would move into the possession of the commercial banks and do so , of course , at a far lower value than the loans that had been made to the investment banks .
Thus , the present capital of the commercial banks and much more would be wiped out .
Accordingly , the book value placed on the Fed 's gold holding needs to be substantially higher than $ 1,000 per ounce , if it is to result in the creation of sufficient bank capital and reserves .
The question is , how much higher ?
The most logical answer to this question was supplied as far back as the 1950s by the late Murray Rothbard , who argued for the establishment of a 100 - percent - reserve gold standard by means of pricing the Fed 's gold stock at whatever price was necessary to make it equal the outstanding supply of money .
Taking the outstanding supply of money today as being $ 3.3 trillion , Rothbard 's proposal implies a gold price of approximately $ 12,700 per ounce .
At such a price , the Fed 's gold stock would be sufficient to provide a 100 percent reserve against all US checking deposits and all US currency .
The provision of a 100 percent reserve would be an immediate guarantee against any reduction in the supply of checkbook money .
This would obviously be the case if the banks simply paid out gold in response to customers ' demands for the redemption of their checking deposits .
At $ 12,700 per ounce , the banks and the Fed would have enough gold to redeem every single dollar of checking deposits and currency in the economic system .
( That 's the meaning of a 100 percent reserve . )
Of course , in the circumstances envisioned here , the banks would not pay out physical gold .
But they would have the ability to pay out paper currency to the full extent of outstanding checking deposits , and that currency would have an undiminished gold backing at the price of gold of $ 12,700 per ounce .
Thus whatever the recession that might develop in the months ahead , it would be contained , insofar as the money supply of the country would not be reduced .
That would guarantee a major reduction in the possible severity of what might otherwise develop .
This 100 - percent - reserve gold standard as thus far described would obviously be a long way from the full - bodied 100 - percent - reserve gold standard that Rothbard envisioned , and which I myself have elaborated upon and advocated .
It would be a standard that for some time was largely just nominal , in that the actual gold of the monetary system would still be in the possession of the Federal Reserve System .
Nor would there yet be any obligation of the Fed to buy or sell gold at the price of $ 12,700 per ounce or at any other price .
The purpose of the system I have described would simply be the twofold one of providing reserves sufficient to prevent any possible reduction in the supply of checkbook money and also of providing capital to banks sufficient to substantially more than offset the losses otherwise resulting from a decline in the value of banks ' assets .
Indeed , given that what would be present is an addition to the assets of the banking system in an amount equal to the full magnitude of outstanding fiduciary media , i.e. , of $ 2.5 trillion of checking deposits minus $ 40 billion of presently existing standard money reserves , the overwhelming likelihood is that the banks would be handed far too much capital .
Even with losses of $ 1 trillion on their existing assets , they would still stand to gain practically $ 1.5 trillion in new and additional capital .
Such a bonanza would not be justifiable .
The solution would be to pass most of it on to the banks ' depositors in the form of bank stock or bonds paid as a dividend on their accounts .
It is not possible in the space of one article to explore , beyond the very limited extent to which I 've done so , the problems and the solutions entailed in moving on to the full - bodied 100 - percent - reserve gold standard that is the ultimate objective of my proposal .
Under such a gold standard , paper currency and checking deposits will , of course , be fully convertible into gold , physical gold coin will enjoy wide circulation , and the supply of gold in the country will be free to increase or decrease simply in response to market forces .
All I have tried to show here is how the twin problems of a lack of bank capital and of bank reserves , which are the core of the threat of deflation , could be solved by means of establishing the framework of a 100 - percent - reserve gold monetary system .
Needless to say , such a system would not only end the threat of deflation , but , equally important , it could end the threat of inflation as well .
For if it were actually followed , the increase in the quantity of money would be limited to the increase in the supply of gold , which is extremely modest compared with increases in the supply of irredeemable paper money .
This is because gold is rare in nature and costly to extract .
Irredeemable paper money in contrast is virtually costless to produce and is potentially as abundant as the supply of currency - sized sheets of paper , indeed , as abundant as the size of the largest number that can be printed on all such sheets of paper .
Above all , the solution I have proposed would constitute a major step toward the establishment of a full - bodied precious metal monetary system and thus toward ultimately eliminating the government 's physical control over the money supply and all of the violations of individual freedom that that control represents and makes possible .
And what is more , it could be accomplished at a cost to the Federal Reserve not of hundreds of billions of dollars — the sums the Fed is risking in exchanging its government securities for bank assets of vastly lower value — not for the $ 30 billion it has risked to bail out just Bear Stearns , but for a little more than $ 11 billion !
Just $ 11 billion is the value at which the Fed carries its gold stock on its balance sheet , at a price of gold of approximately $ 42 per ounce .
Thus , to say it all in one sentence , the threat of massive deflation can be eliminated , the threat of inflation ended , and the actual and potential domain of economic freedom greatly expanded , for $ 11 billion — an $ 11 billion that would not even be an out - of - pocket expense to anyone but merely a balance - sheet charge on the books of the Federal Reserve System when it deducted its gold holding from its balance sheet and added it to the balance sheets of the banks .
I am indebted to Professor William Barnett , II , of Loyola University , New Orleans .
His recent internet postings on the mises@yahoogroups list made me aware of the fact that the capital requirements of banks under the Basel II Capital Accord , rather than official reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve System , is all that has served to constrain the increase in the quantity of money in the United States in recent years .
His comments also served to provide important insight into understanding the role of banks ' capital requirements in explaining essential aspects of their recent behavior as well as their likely behavior in the weeks and months ahead .

Such is the demand for bikes that shortages were reported in New York earlier this year .
In Taiwan , Giant 's home market , supply is tighter still : for many models , buyers put down deposits months before their bikes come off the assembly line .
After a slow 2006 , sales took off last year in Europe and America as fuel prices shot up .
Suddenly a bicycle seems like the remedy for many modern ills , from petrol prices to pollution and obesity .
Each market has its own idiosyncrasies .
Europeans mainly use bikes for commuting , but have the odd habit of ignoring models made explicitly for that purpose in favour of sleeker , faster models which are then expensively modified .
Americans prefer off - road BMX trail bikes .
Taiwanese demand is led by racing - style bikes used for exercise .
Giant , as the largest producer , makes everything for every market .
Its share price has held up fairly well despite stockmarket turmoil and dramatically higher costs for raw materials , notably aluminium .
Strong demand and a desire for better bikes have allowed bikemakers to pass higher material costs on to buyers .
Since 2004 wholesale prices of bikes have gone up by 23 % in Europe , 45 % in America and almost 50 % in Asia , even as thousands of low - cost factories in China , including some run by Giant , churn out boatloads of cheap bikes .
Giant began in 1972 , taking advantage of low - cost Taiwanese labour to make bicycles for foreign firms as well as domestic buyers .
A critical early order came from Schwinn , the dominant American brand of the time , which wanted to reduce its dependence on a factory in Chicago that was beset by poor labour relations and low productivity .
After contracting out to Giant proved successful , Schwinn shifted its orders to a factory in southern China .
But quality was poor , deliveries were late and Schwinn slid into bankruptcy .
( It is now owned by Dorel Industries of Canada . )
Meanwhile , having started out as a low - cost manufacturer , Giant was moving upmarket .
Even its cheapest bikes , which are sold in China , are relatively expensive ( at around $ 100 ) , yet Giant has the largest market share , at around 7 % , according to Deutsche Bank .
Globally , Giant is one of a handful of big companies that can make frames and forks ( the most important components of a bicycle ) out of sophisticated alloys and carbon fibre .
Components from other manufacturers are then added to the frame .
The resulting bikes are sold under Giant 's own name , or under contract to big customers in Europe and America .
Because frame - and component - makers are happy to sell to potential competitors , there are in effect no barriers to entry to the bike business — all that is needed is a brand name .
As a result , competition is brutal .
Capturing customers at volume , and at ever - higher prices , requires an unending series of improvements .
Giant will soon begin distributing a new frame with built - in lightweight shock - absorbers , which should appeal to riders on potholed streets and off - road trails .
Details of the design remain a secret , because good ideas are commonly copied within a year .
By then , Giant must come up with a further innovation .
It is the only way to survive .
Are you a plumber upset by the sudden competition for all those lucrative pipe snakings ?
Maybe you ’ve lost your seven - figure salary due to some ‘ off balance sheet ’ accounting .
While things may look bleak , there are plenty of jobs to be had by the industrious .
According to the Association for American Opportunists , here are five high paying jobs you can get now .
Arsonist
While torching soon - to - be foreclosed homes and cars may seem like a no - brainer , many people just do n’t have the stomach for it .
That ’s where you come in .
As a professional arsonist you can command a healthy fee for a job that does n’t take long and offers a flexible schedule .
Start small by offering your to burn down the neighbors tool shed – you know he ’s not current on those riding lawn mower payments !
Piggy Bank Mosaic Artist
Now is the time to get into the mosaic business .
With more people breaking into their piggy banks , ceramic shards are everywhere and free for the taking .
Because this is technically recycling , you may be able to get your hands on some government grants .
And remember , soup bowls will be in demand .
Hummer Converter
Construction work may be hard to come by , but clever carpenters can make big bucks converting gas - guzzling Hummers into livable residences .
Roomier than a refrigerator box and cheaper to heat than a trailer , converted Hummers are the perfect solution for those who once lived beyond their means .
Husband to Madonna
With Guy Ritchie out of the picture , this field is wide open .
However , be warned that Madonna ’s lack of preference for gender will create fierce competition for this position .
If Madonna ’s taken , try for Cloris Leachman .
( Some dancing ability may be required . )
Either way , make sure to renew your subscription to AARP magazine and clip your Poligrip coupons first .
Professional Vetter
After the mayhem over McCain ’s choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate , politicians everywhere are taking more interest in the backgrounds of those they associate with .
Work is everywhere .
All you have to do is uncover dirty little secrets .
Somewhere there ’s a PTA board member who hates arts and crafts , a Toyota salesman driving a Prius , and guy dating Jennifer Aniston , but pining for Brad Pitt .
The Association for American Opportunists encourages job seekers to remember that old rules do not apply .
Suits and ties say ‘ I ’m a liar who ’ll steal your money and sabotage your economy ’ .
Now is the time to dumb down your knowledge of the English language and get a new tattoo .
Carrying a 6 - pack ca n’t hurt either .
If you ’re lucky and work hard , you may just get one of those high falutin’ plumber jobs one day .
Recently , I was asked about my views regarding the election .
I think the interviewers were surprised that , as an Evangelical Christian , that I was voting for Obama .
But they were very respectful and they honored my point of view .
As you can see by the video , I have very passionate views !
However , this is just my opinion .
I welcome your comments
In Love ,

So when we talk about the lessons Hollywood teaches kids , do n't tell us it 's all harmless fantasy .
For a generation with one parent in jail and the other passed out drunk at work , the lessons from movies were all we had .
And as you 'll see , most of them were bullshit .
6 Your Single Parent is Really Just Waiting for You to Set Him or Her Up !
As Seen In :
Sleepless in Seattle , The Parent Trap , Kindergarden Cop , The Mighty Ducks
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
There are about 25 million kids in single - parent households in the US alone , and a whole lot of them would like one of those cool dual - parent deals their friends have .
Hollywood knows this .
That 's why they love to show kids scenarios where they help their parents find romance ( just ask the young Lindsay Lohan in the Parent Trap remake ! ) .
Hey , look , the new handsome kindergarten teacher just happens to be the ideal match for your spinster mother , and he 's a former body builder to boot !
The world is magical !
This one has a corollary , which is , " Your step - parents are always jerks who just want to spoil your fun .

In the Real World :
So the movies convince these kids they know everything they need to know to be terrific matchmakers .
Now , how exactly how can we expect people who still think girls have cooties to understand the rules of dating ?
They do n't even understand the fundamentals , like the importance of boobies .
So important .
What kids need to learn is that even though the lunch lady may seem cool because she gave you two churros , your dad is more likely to be concerned about her harelip than her mashed potatoes .
And no , it 's not a good idea to try to reunite your parents by setting them up on an elaborately conceived " coincidental " meeting while you keep your evil stepmom occupied with childish pranks .
If movies worked like the real world , we'd have had nothing but two hours of Lindsay Lohan crying off the pain of being flogged like a redheaded stepchild .
Literally .
AMERICA is regarded by some as a wild and dangerous place .
But violent inner cities and beasts roaming the great outdoors are just some of the potentially fatal situations that the average American faces .
The National Safety Council has compiled a list of the odds of perishing in a variety of accidents which makes for sobering reading .
Among the perils that could claim a life , poisoning is surprisingly likely .
But do n't imagine that bees , flammable nightwear or fireworks are without their ( admittedly more remote ) dangers too .

A signature on a piece of paper in Japan this week means that the country can now start work on commercializing a new generation of high - tech trains that make the current bullet trains look like pedal - bikes .
The progress is as a result of the government approving three possible routes between Tokyo and Nagoya for Japan Railway ’s experimental maglev trains that can hit speeds of around 500 kph ( 310 m ph ) [ Subscription link ] .
Choosing a route is a sensitive issue due to environmental disruption , building costs and economic benefits it can bring to areas with new major stations .
The technology , on the other hand , is already in the bag .
Maglev trains , as the name suggests , levitate on powerful magnetic fields above the tracks .
The lack of friction means they can reach extremely high speeds .
Rather astonishingly for anyone used to most Western trains , the Japanese technology has been in the pipeline since the 1960s , with a major publically viewable 20 km test track to the west of Tokyo since 1997 .
The top speed reached so far at the Yamanashi test facility is 581 kph ( 361 m ph ) .
If that ’s hard to picture , imagine a commercial jet aircraft flying past at full throttle at ground level – that ’s in the same ballpark .
Still , we must n’t get too excited – the Japanese say they wo n’t be ready to put a maglev train into service at those speeds until 2025 at the earliest and that ’s at a cost of around ¥ 5 trillion ( $ 50 billion ) .

Todd Palin seated behind a White House desk and shaping national policy could be one of the most dangerous aspects of a potential Sarah Palin presidency .
An overlooked part of the Alaska state trooper investigation is its finding on the influence of Gov. Palin ’s husband , Todd — the “ First Dude ” or , as he is known around the Alaska statehouse , the “ First Gentleman . ”
This is crucial in view of the age of the Republican nominee , John McCain , 72 , and the fact that he has suffered from melanoma skin cancer .
His doctors have pronounced him in excellent health , but his age and the serious nature of this type of cancer should focus attention on his running mate and her operating methods .
A fascinating picture of Todd Palin ’s influence in Alaska ’s capital is provided in the report of a legislative investigation that concluded that Gov. Palin unlawfully abused her power in seeking the firing of a state trooper once married to her sister .
The report , released Friday , also criticized Palin for allowing Todd Palin to push hard for the dismissal of Trooper Mike Wooten .
Wooten had been married to the governor ’s sister .
Their divorce was messy .
So , apparently , was Wooten ’s career as a trooper .
He had been accused of illegally shooting a moose , drinking beer in a patrol car and using a Taser gun on his stepson .
He was disciplined before Palin became governor and was allowed to remain a trooper .
When Palin took over , the Wooten case was high on the family agenda , with Todd Palin leading the effort to get rid of the trooper .
As Associated Press writer Mike Apuzzo put it in his story on the report , Todd Palin had “ extraordinary access to the governor ’s office ” and he “ used that access to try to get [ Wooten ] fired . ”
His target was Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan , who said he lost his job because he refused to fire Wooten .
The report , by investigator Stephen Branchflower , a retired state prosecutor , shows how Todd Palin operates .
Monegan ’s secretary , Cassandra Byrne , said that on Jan. 4 , 2007 , she received a phone call from the governor ’s office .
An aide told her “ the First Gentleman would like to have a meeting with Commissioner Walt Monegan .
At the time , I was not familiar with the term ‘ First Gentleman . ’ …
So I kept asking ‘ Who ? ’ and she eventually said ‘ Todd Palin . ’
I said , ‘ Oh , OK , ’ so we set the time and the place which was the governor ’s office in Anchorage . … ”
Investigator Branchflower said that when Monegan arrived there he was directed into the governor ’s office .
Todd Palin , wearing a business suit , was alone , waiting for him .
“ Mr. Palin was seated at a large conference table and invited Mr. Monegan to sit , ” the report said .
Monegan said , “ What I recalled was Todd sitting there .
He had three stacks of paper in an array in front of him ” dealing with the Wooten case .
One was from the Department of Public Safety , under which Alaska state troopers serve .
Monegan told Branchflower that he got “ the impression that Todd was not happy with the investigation [ that the department had made before disciplining Wooten ] .
“ He told me that he [ Wooten ] just got a few days off [ suspension ] and did n’t think that was enough .
And this guy should n’t be a trooper . ”
Describing Todd Palin , Monegan said , “ I saw someone who was somewhat animated .
Not certainly out of control but he was passionate about how he was addressing the issue .
“ And my impression was that he was venting .
I mean there was a complaint , the troopers investigated it and that they had come up with a conclusion and that he was not happy with the conclusion . ”
The telling vignette shows Todd Palin ’s position in the governor ’s office .
Dressed in a business suit , seated behind a big conference table with state documents in front of him , he tried to tell the state ’s top cop how to do his job .
This is a man who was a member of the Alaskan Independence Party , a radical group advocating Alaskan secession from the United States .
Gail Fenumiai , director of the Alaska Division of Elections , told TPM Muckraker that Palin registered as an AIP member in October 1995 and continued in that status until 2000 , when he registered as undeclared for a few months .
He registered as an AIP member again and remained with the party until 2002 , when he registered as undeclared .
What other radical ideas are percolating in the mind of a man who is now portrayed in the media as sort of a lovable guys ’ guy ?
If Sarah Palin ever becomes president , it is safe to assume that the First Gentleman of Alaska will slip into the role of First Gentleman of the United States with as much access to the Oval Office as he has to the governor ’s office in Anchorage .
That is a truly scary thought .
USB " External Hard Drive Enclosure " may not provide enough power
It does n't work for me .
Perhaps it 's that my hard drives tend to be large , but the 3.5 " drives that I have require more power than the wall - wart power supply can provide .
When I put a 250 GB drive in it , for example , the drive would start to spin up for about half a second , then quit .
Then start to spin up , then quit .
It would do this as long as I would let it ( which was n't long , since I figured it was straining something ) .
Cleverly , the power supplied by the enclosure is not spec'd in its manual .
The wall - wart says it provides 1.5A at 12 V .
Some of that will clearly be used for the 5V supply to the disk .
I did find a 160 GB 3.5 " drive that works in it .
But what a pain to have some drives work and some drives fail , depending on the fine print on the drives .
This particular USB drive enclosure is n't worth the cheap $ 40 I paid for it .
Here 's another few reports of the same problem .
Motto :
Check the power supply of the power brick and the disk drive before buying one an " external enclosure " , especially a cheap brand .
UPDATE ( December 2005 ) :
These external hard drive enclosures also do n't supply enough cooling , if you 're going to use the drive extensively .
I ran a pair of 400 GB drives for months in these enclosures , which have no fans , and made them seek pretty hard by mirroring other web sites using slow but highly parallel wget 's .
I ran them vertically to help their heat dissipation , but that was n't enough .
Eventually the drives started failing , returning unreadable sectors that stayed unreadable even after the drives cooled .
These cheap consumer products are n't really designed for serious professional work .
Look for one that has a fan !
Keyspan USB serial port with " Linux support " unfree ; use Prolific 's instead UPDATE ( 10 Oct 2005 ) : I 've found a company selling a good Linux - supported USB to serial adapter : Prolific ( tech.prolific.com.tw ) .
Their PL - 2303 USB 1.1 to Serial Bridge Controller chip is fully supported by a free Linux device driver .
Their web site even publishes the driver , and a user guide for Linux users .
( Though they are clueless enough to do their site navigation with idiotic Javascript buttons rather than links , so I can't give you a URL for the right page ; and they distribute their Linux users ' guide as a Microsoft Windows .doc file inside a Zip file ) .
This chip is in various products , such as the IOGear USB to Serial Adapter , model GUC232A .
This product costs $ 34 and is available as CompUSA SKU # 50177640 ) .
I recommend briefly forgiving them for the MS - Word manual , and buying their product , rather than the proprietary and inferior Keyspan product .
I foolishly bought the Keyspan USA - 19HS in August 2005 , because I was impressed that the company had even * heard of * Linux and included it on its packaging .
However , what the package said was " Linux : Supported .
Please visit website for details . "
After buying it , I went to the web site , and its Linux page has n't been updated since 2003 .
There 's nothing about the USA - 19HS model that I bought ( and which seems to be the only model currently for sale ) .
I tried plugging it in anyway .
Debian 's Sarge 2.6.11 kernel does n't recognize the device .
Nothing created the device nodes for it .
The keyspan web site does n't say how to create device nodes -- it has a long song - and - dance about how newbies can run scripts under Linux , but never provides the & % &$ ^# script that you need to run !
So I fell back on Google .
And discovered that there 's been a big tempest over the binary firmware that 's in the driver module .
It 's not released under the GNU General Public License like the rest of the driver ( for no obvious reason -- any real competitor could reverse - engineer it without trouble , so this just causes pain for the product 's users ) .
The result is that Debian wo n't put it into their release , because they actually care whether their release contains free software or not .
The code appears to have been relegated to a package called " kernel- source-nonfree -2.6.11_2.6.11-1_i386 " and " kernel-nonfree-modules -2.6.11 -[ kerneltype ] " ( or something like that ) .
So far , I have n't been able to find clear documentation on how I might get such non-free modules with apt - get ( it does n't work for me ) .
It 's not clear to me that I want to run non -free software anyway ; I 've long made a point of owning no Microsoft or other proprietary software .
Google also showed me a page at keyspan.com that actually does tell you how to manually create the relevant device nodes .
This page is foolishly not linked from the main Linux support page , which is why I needed Google to find it for me .
This page is : http://www.keyspan.com/support/linux/LinuxReadMe.html.
Creating the device nodes does n't help , though , since I do n't have the driver .
Would Keyspan consider releasing its firmware under the Gnu General Public License , or under an X or BSD - style license ?
The GNU license would protect you best from competitors ; if they use it , they have to distribute the sources themselves ( and you can sue them if they do n't ) , and if they improve it , they have to release the source of the changes , which you are then free to use in your own products .
I do n't know that there are many competitors in the USB - to - serial market who are unable to write their own firmware .
What problem is Keyspan protecting itself from ?
I got no response at all from Keyspan to the above message -- and got derision from Greg KH , the kernel driver maintainer who put this non-free code into the stock Linux kernel sources .
He said :
This is due to Debian 's issues , nothing that I , as the kernel driver maintainer can do about that .
Perhaps you should switch to a different distro ? :)
Anyway , this was brought up about 5 years ago on debian - legal .
Back then I proposed a solution for this ( move the firmware to userspace which would solve all of the issues ) and asked for a patch .
I have yet to receive it ...
If I felt like supporting this company , I 'd spend a couple days and reverse - engineer the damn thing myself .
But I do n't feel like encouraging people to buy this product from this company .
I 'd rather keep looking for a company whose products have free software drivers .
And a company that answers emails sent to the email address listed in their web site for Linux support questions .
DAT ( digital audio tape ) drive software to read and write audio tapes Computers have used DAT drives for backup for years .
Initially these drives did not read or write DAT audio tapes ( the application for which the format was invented ) .
SGI ( Silicon Graphics ) eventually caused firmware to be created for a few DAT drives so they could read and write audio DAT tapes , making SGI 's workstations useful for professional audio editing .
Since then , this firmware has fallen into disrepair ( neither SGI nor the manufacturers of the drives will support it -- while both claiming that the other one is the problem ) .
An active community of users is now spreading the firmware around and helping each other to read and write their audio tapes .
An influential piece of software that uses such drives on Solaris and Linux is called DATlib .
The last known version I found links to was called DATlib - 0.81.tar.gz , but all the links were dead .
When I could n't find any versions of it on the net in October 2005 , I emailed Marcus Meissner , its author , who is now working with SuSE .
He pointed me to http://www.lst.de/~mm/datlib.tgz, and I have mirrored a copy of datlib . tgz here as well .
It unpacks as " DATlib - current " , with the latest change in the archive made on September 30 , 1997 .
It refers to itself as DATlib - 0.7 .
This version does not have Linux support -- it is for Solaris ( SunOS 5.5 ) .
There 's a good summary of the firmware 's early history in its README. datlib .
Presumably the 0.81 version was a Linux port done by someone .
An earlier version of this page appealed to anyone to send me a copy ; Lamar Owen responded with copies of DATlib - 0.81.tar.gz and DATlib-0.81-wh0.2.tar.gz ( which unpacks to DATlib - 0.81 - wh0.1 , not wh0.2 ) .
I believe that the standard Linux kernel 's SCSI tape driver supports these audio drives , if you set the density to 0x80 ( " mt setdensity 128 " or " mt setdensity 0x80 " ) .
If you try this code on a modern Linux system , please let me know how it works , and send any relevant patches to gnu@datlib.toad.com .
Debian Sarge Source Code DVDs via " trackerless " BitTorrent UPDATE : I offered these for a few months , but nobody ever accessed them .
I could n't even access them myself , from elsewhere on the Internet .
After talking with Bram , who says trackerless torrents do n't really work due to too many broken ( non-official - BT ) trackerless peers , I 've stopped offering these trackerless torrents .
But for history 's sake , here 's the original notice :
The Debian release now takes 15 ( fifteen ! )
CDs to hold its source code .
The sources fit on only three DVD 's , though .
For some reason , at cdimage .
debian.org , you can get the source code DVDs via " Jigdo " but not via BitTorrent .
I got them via Jigdo and am offering them up via BitTorrent .
debian - 31r0a- source-1.iso.torrent ( 352 K torrent for 4.4GB file ) debian - 31r0a - source -2.iso.torrent ( 352 K torrent for 4.4GB file ) debian - 31r0a - source-3.iso.torrent ( 20 K torrent for 0.2 GB file )
I 'm using " trackerless " Torrent files , which is a feature of the 4.1.x and 4.2.x and 4.3.x releases of BitTorrent .
Get a stable or newer beta version of BitTorrent from www.bittorrent.com; it 's got a decent GUI and many other improvements besides trackerless operation .
These Torrents probably wo n't work with most implementations of BitTorrent , since only a few of them have implemented trackerless support .
Encourage your BT client supplier to implement it -- trackerless operation eliminates one point of control which can be used for censoring particular uses of BitTorrent .
Meanwhile , use the official implementation , at least for these and other Trackerless torrents .
Do n't put these Torrents ( or the .iso images ) in the same directory as copies of the Debian Sarge Source CDs , if you have them .
Unfortunately the three DVDs ' ISO images have the exact same names as the first three CDs ' ISO images .
But of course the CD images and the DVD images are very different ( 600 MB versus 4.4GB ) .
Disk drive recovery : ddrescue , dd_rescue , dd_rhelp
If you have a disk drive with errors on it , that you 'd like to be able to read the recoverable data from , GNU ddrescue is your best friend .
It is modeled after the two preceding programs , dd_rescue ( with an underbar ) , and dd_rhelp .
But GNU ddrescue it 's far better than both -- I 've tried all three , on the same drive , as well as trying to use plain old " dd " .
You should skip my learning process and just head straight for the best way , which is GNU ddrescue .
I 'll tell you about it .
So , a brief tutorial on things I learned about copying disk drives .
" dd " will make a copy of a disk drive with errors , if you set " conv=noerror " so it will keep going after errors .
The catch is that it just * removes * the erroneous sectors from its output , as if they did n't exist , which totally screws up the file system image .
Fsck will tell you just how unhappy it is with such an image ; it 's unrecoverable without massive manual work , shifting big blocks of data around .
Instead , you can use " dd conv=noerror , sync " which will write an output record ( zeros ) even if the input record has an error .
You had better do this on single disk sectors , thus " dd bs=512 conv=noerror , sync " .
If you use a larger blocksize ( read multiple disk sectors ) at once , the first one that has an error will stop the read , and what will get written out will be zeroes for not only the bad sector , but for all subsequent sectors in that block .
" dd bs=512 conv=noerror , sync " works , but has many drawbacks .
It 's slow even on the error - free stuff since it 's doing tiny reads and writes .
It spends a lot of time chewing through the erroneous parts of the drive , rather than reading as much error - free stuff as it can , THEN going back to do the hard stuff .
( When your drive is crapping out , it has a tendency to die the big death at any moment .
You 'd like to get as much info off it as possible before that happens .
One example is if small particles of stuff are rattling around inside the drive ; they make more and more errors , as you run the drive .
Sometimes , putting the drive in the freezer for a few hours , in a ziploc bag to keep the moisture off , will revive it briefly ; electronics work better at low temperatures than when they get hot . )
Kurt Garloff 's dd_rescue was the first attempt to improve on this .
It reads and copies bigger blocks until it sees an error , then slows down and goes back , and reads single sectors .
After a while it speeds up again .
It can also read backward , and can quit after it gets some specified number of errors .
It keeps a 3 - line display updated in your text window so you can see what it 's doing .
If you run it simply , it just does what " dd bs =64k " does until it sees an error , then backs up and does " dd bs =512 " .
If it gets an error reading a sector , it does n't write to that sector of the output file , but it skips past it to write the next good one , so everything stays in sync .
It seeks the input and output in parallel so it makes an exact copy of the parts that it can read .
LAB Valentin's dd_rhelp .
is a complex shell script that runs dd_rescue many times , trying to be strategic about copying the drive .
It copies forward until it gets errors , then jumps forward by a big jump looking for either the end of the drive , or more easy - to - read stuff .
Once it finds the end of the drive , then it starts working backward , trying to close up the " hole " that it has n't read yet .
As it encounters errors , it skips around looking for more error - free parts of the drive .
It only reads each sector once .
It reads the logfile output of dd_rescue to see what happened and to figure out what to do next .
One problem with dd_rhelp is that it's a shell script , so it 's really slow and consumes massive resources .
On one of my drives that had about 2900 bad sectors on it , dd_rhelp would waste upwards of 15 minutes deciding what blocks to tell dd_rescue to try reading next .
During that time it makes about 100 new Unix processes every second .
Antonio Diaz Diaz 's GNU ddrescue learned from these experiences .
It combines both dd_rescue 's ability to read big blocks and then shift gears , with dd_rhelp 's ability to remember what parts of the disk have been looked at already .
It keeps this info in a really simple logfile format , and keeps it updated every 30 seconds , or whenever it stops or is interrupted .
It 's written in C++ and it 's small and fast .
It starts off running like " dd " , blasting through large error - free areas .
When it gets an error , it writes out any partial data that it received during that read , and KEEPS GOING to the next big block .
It notes in the logfile that a bunch of sectors ( the first erroneous one , plus whatever ones followed it in the multi- sector read ) were skipped .
And keeps going .
So it reads through the entire disk in big blocks first .
Then it goes back to " split " the skipped parts , trying to read each sector individually .
The compact logfile always shows which chunks of disk have been read OK , have been read with errors , have been read one sector at a time with errors , or have never been read yet .
One catch about GNU ddrescue is that the author has some strange ideas about what " ought to " be in the C++ library .
So in the current version ( 1.1 ) , you 'll be lucky to get it to compile without errors .
All the errors are minor , and are not in key parts of the software , so you can dike them out if you need to .
Sometime soon I 'll make some nice clean patches for these parts , and submit them , but it 's been this way for a year and people complain about this every month on the bug - ddrescue mailing list , and the maintainer does n't fix it , so I 'm not optimistic that the patches will be accepted .
But use his software anyway ; other than this quirk , it 's really nice .
As an aside , it takes a lot of time and screen space for the kernel to log all the error messages from when you 're reading from a failing disk drive .
The messages also tend to screw up the screen that you 're trying to work in .
To speed up the logging , you can edit /etc/syslog.conf and insert a " - " before " / var/log/ messages " , then restart the syslog daemon .
This tells syslog to not do an " fsync " after every log message it writes out .
If you crash you 'll be missing the last few messages , but if you do n't crash you 'll run about eight times as fast .
Also , to make it stop printing those messages on your console , you have to edit the arguments to the " klogd " daemon , which is usually started by the same script that starts the syslog daemon ( /etc/init.d/syslog ) .
On my Red Hat 7.3 system , you can edit / etc / sysconfig / syslog and change the KLOGD_OPTIONS line so it includes " -c 0 " which will suppress all console messages , then restart the syslog daemon .
( If you can figure out the " logging level " of the disk error messages , you can set the level higher than 0 , but I was in a hurry . )
Change these things back when you 're done doing disk recovery , so you 'll see kernel error messages , and so they 'll get logged reliably , when the kernel is crashing a year later for some totally unrelated reason .
Speculation about fixing bad disk blocks to keep using the disk
When I have a drive with only one or two failing sectors , I often find them with " smartctl -t long " ( one at a time , sigh ) and then write to them with a complicated series of commands .
The very smart smartmontools maintainer , Bruce Allen , has written a BadBlockHow To. txt about how to do this .
( I hope somebody automates this error - prone process soon . )
I have done this many times , on many generations of disk drives ; on old 1980s SCSI drives there were utility programs that would reallocate individual sectors .
I know of no free software program for doing this kind of low - level drive formatting , unfortunately .
Modern drives just do it when you write .
OK , this next part is pure uninformed speculation .
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS ON MY DISKS , AND YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS TO YOUR DISKS UNLESS YOU ARE A WIZARD AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING , AND YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISKS YOURSELF WITHOUT WHINING .
It occurs to me that it OUGHT to work to do this :
First , copy the entire drive to somewhere else with GNU ddrescue .
The logfile will show you exactly where the erroneous sectors are .
Look at it with a text editor .
Make sure that 's what it says .
Then , make a copy of that logfile , and ( here 's the tricky part ) run GNU ddrescue in a very strange way to write zeroes onto those bad sectors :
ddrescue - r1 / dev/zero / dev / baddisk my - logfile - copy
Note that your bad disk is the OUTPUT of this command , while the system file " / dev/zero " ( as many zeroes as you ever wanted ) is the INPUT to the command .
If you had n't specified the logfile and the " - r1 " , this would copy zeroes over your entire bad disk .
The logfile points out what disk blocks it could n't read , so ddrescue will only try to read the parts it has n't read before .
The " - r1 " tells it to go back and try to read them again , even though it failed the first time .
But since it 's reading from / dev / zero this time , all of those reads are going to succeed -- and then it will write those zeros into the exact places on the bad disk drive where you need to write new data to reallocate the bad sectors .
In the process , it destroys the logfile , which is why you made a copy of it .
When it 's done , the logfile will report that the entire disk was readable , because it was able to read from every " bad " sector in / dev/zero .
LIKE I SAID ABOVE , this is all pure speculation .
I have never done this on my own drives .
I might try it someday ( the drive with >2000 errors would be a good candidate , except that it's a very old 2GB drive , it has already reallocated every spare sector in it , and I do n't know what trashed those 2000 sectors so I do n't really trust the drive anyway .
Better to try it on a 200 GB or up drive ( newer , with better error recovery firmware ) and with only a few errors ( that probably were n't cause by some massive internal problem ) . )
Do n't blame me if you trash your drive this way .
But do tell me what you think of the idea .
Disk drive recovery : ddrescue on MacOSX
My friend 's Macintosh started acting very strange and slow today , and we eventually figured out that it 's the disk drive , which shows failing SMART status .
( MacOS is too stupid to give access to the real SMART info like the free smartctl , it just provides a red FAILED indication .
However , smartctl may have been ported to MacOSX by now . )
So the race is on to get as much data as possible off the drive .
We immediately copied off a few key documents onto a USB Flash drive , then hooked up a spare USB hard drive .
Then the question became : what software do we have to copy this failing drive to the external USB drive ?
The snooty Mac utility Carbon Copy refused to copy to a USB drive .
( And I do n't know whether it would handle a source drive full of errors , anyway . )
I looked for MacOS ports of ddrescue , but there were n't any in a form that I could simply download and run ( or even download , install , and run ) .
Instead there was Darwinports , which wanted me to install almost a gigabyte of Apple proprietary versions of the GNU tools ( Xcode ) , with a license agreement that you MUST CLICK AGREE on or it REFUSES TO INSTALL , even though the GNU license does not work that way .
Plus their own small wart on the side of that , which seems to be some scripts that suck down sources and run them through " ./ configure ; make ; make install " .
I aborted that all - night download as soon as I found an alternative ; I do n't know if this disk drive is up to installing a gigabyte of software and then configuring and compiling a GNU program .
Fink at least has the concept of installing binaries rather than compiling everything from sources .
But I downloaded it and tried running its installer , and the installer failed with an error message that did n't appear in the documentation , saying that the installation had failed but I should retry it .
When I retried it , of course , it said it could n't install on top of an existing installation .
When I tried to run the half - installed one , it would instantly fail .
And when I removed it according to the documentation , and tried a reinstall , I got the exact same problem .
Yeah , I know , it 's free software , so it 's my problem .
I do n't recommend Fink to you .
So I have fallen back on trusty old " dd conv=sync , noerror " and I hope it does n't lose my friend too much of the drive .
My hat 's off to the Mac community for the elaborateness of its infrastructure .
Does n't it need a few more bells and whistles , guys ?
Someday if I ever waste a week installing a compiler on a Mac , I 'll build a simple binary of ddrescue , and put it up on this web site to help the next person who 's trying to rescue their data from a failing drive .
OK , so John Perry Barlow came over , and had the development environment handy , so we built ddrescue by downloading the sources ( ddrescue -1.1.tar.bz2 , unpacking them in the Finder , opening a terminal , going into the unpacked ddrescue - 1.1 folder , and typing " ./ configure " and " make " .
Here 's the resulting binary of ddrescue and the matching documentation on how to use it .
As I type this , it is copying my friend 's whole dying hard drive onto an identical Firewire drive .
If your disk dies on MacOS , grab a copy of this binary and use it to copy the whole disk onto an identical ( or larger ) spare disk drive .
If it works at all , you 'll probably recover 99 + % of your files .
In fact , why do n't you grab it now and put it on your Mac , so it 'll be handy when you need it ?

How to change channel by simply waving your hand :
The new webcam that could kill off remote controls
It may be called ' gesture interface technology ' but it is as simple as waving your hand .
In fact it is waving your hand - and could mean the days of the television remote control ( and the days of arguing over who has it ) are over .
Scientists at a Toshiba research laboratory in Cambridge have created the technology that allows viewers to operate their TV purely by gestures .
Futuristic : Engineer Catherine Breslin's hand signal pauses the new TV
For example , raising a hand in a ' stop ' sign will pause the action on TV .
Flapping a hand up or down can raise or lower the volume .
And the technology could be customised to suit individuals .
Touching your right ear , for instance , would increase volume , while touching your left ear would lower it .
The software could also recognise viewers as they walk into a room and switch automatically to their favourite channel - opening a whole new area for family disputes .
No hassle : Dr Breslin demonstrates how to use the TV 's computer mouse '
Toshiba said its gesture recognition system was already extremely accurate as it responded to the shape , colour and motion of hands .
But , of course , there are always potential hazards , such as the TV misinterpreting a stretch or a sneeze .
But Toshiba is working on it .
It said its technology , which can also be used with PCs , is being finetuned to differentiate between someone making a control gesture and an unthinking movement .
how it works
The system went on show in Berlin this week and could be on the market within five years .
It follows similar work at the University of Wollongong , Australia , last year and brings the world of futuristic Hollywood films a step nearer .
For example , Tom Cruise 's character in the thriller Minority Report uses hand movements to manipulate images - such as magnifying them - on a computer screen .
Dr Kate Knill , who works at the Toshiba laboratory , said : ' Technology is going to become more and more accessible and much less scary for everyday users . '

By David Spratt
October 10 , 2008 -- A year ago I was researching what was intended to be a short submission to the Garnaut review [ commissioned to advise the Australian federal government of Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ] , when events in the polar north turned the world of climate policy upside down .
It was found that eight million square kilometres of sea-ice — an area the size of Australia — was melting , in the immortal words of one glaciologist , " a hundred years ahead of schedule " .
Yet the international policy debate carried on as if this had not happened .
Out - of - date scenarios , research and observations were being used to propose emission reduction targets that would still lead to catastrophe even if fully implemented .
And so a short submission became a long detour into how the climate debate is being constructed , and the result , with Philip Sutton , was a book we did not intend to write , Climate Code Red .
We came to the conclusion that most of the public policy debate on climate is delusional , that is , a fixed , false belief resistant to reason or confrontation with actual fact .
In the new Quarterly Essay , Tim Flannery says “ There is no real debate about how serious our predicament is ” , nor has there been the “ understanding of just how profoundly we are influencing the very Earth processes that gives us life ” .
Neither of the major political parties [ in Australia ] at the national level have bothered to tell the electorate what they consider to be dangerous climate change .
Neither party in government has ever said how hot would be too hot — one degree , or two , three , four or five ? — and then committed themselves to actions consistent with that target .
And both seem to have difficulty in saying unambiguously that the loss of the Great Barrier Reef ( now inevitable ) or the salination of Kakadu ( predicted to occur with a half - metre sea - level rise this century ) mean that global warming is already dangerous .
The Australian federal government ’s climate vision does not extend beyond the terrain described by the reports of the IPCC , which Flannery notes are “ painfully conservative ” because the IPPC “ works by consensus and includes government representatives from the United States , China and Saudi Arabia , all of whom must assent to every word of every finding ” .
Thus the IPCC ’s most recent report has already been found badly wanting on such issues as the Arctic sea-ice , ice sheet loss and sea - level rises , nor did it not seriously concern itself with the possibilities of non-linear climate change and the long - term effects of carbon - cycle feedbacks ( carbon emission - induced warming causing the release of more carbon into the air , for example by the melting of permafrost ) .
Put simply , the debate in Australia is not evidence based .
Political pragmatism , window dressing and incremental solutions that will fail take precedence over the scientific imperatives .
The result can only be a suicide note for most people and most species on the planet .
The conclusion we came to was that unless we adopt the strongest measures — emergency action — it will be too late .
It is no longer a matter of how much more we can heat the planet , but how quickly can we cool it .
Serious impacts already underway
Serious climate - change impacts are already happening , both more rapidly and at lower global temperature increases than projected .
In 2005 the eminent climate scientist Dr James Hansen warned that : “ We are on the precipice of climate system tipping points beyond which there is no redemption . ”
Three years later , we now know that we have already crossed some of those tipping points : for ice - sheet disintegration , significant sea - level rises and species loss .
Hansen says that the “ Elements of a `perfect storm ' , a global cataclysm , are assembled ” .
The complete loss of the Arctic sea-ice in summer is now inevitable .
" The Arctic Ocean could be nearly ice - free at the end of summer by 2012 " , says Dr Jay Zwally , a glaciologist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center .
He concludes that : " The Arctic is often cited as the canary in the coal mine for climate warming … and now as a sign of climate warming , the canary has died . ”
The Arctic is key to the world ’s climate , and Arctic changes have the potential to seriously destabilise the global climate system .
Dr Neil Hamilton , Director of the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) Arctic programme , says that Arctic climate models are breaking down and no longer work because " we are moving to a new Arctic climate system " .
He says the WWF is no longer trying to protect the Arctic ecosystem because it is no longer possible to do so , and that carbon sinks in the Arctic are changing very , very quickly and it is not clear what any Arctic ecosystem will look like in 50 years .
The danger is that an ice - free state in the Arctic summer will kick the climate system into run-on warming and create an aberrant new climate state many , many degrees hotter .
The Arctic sea-ice is the first domino and it is falling fast .
Other dominos will inevitably fall unless we stop emitting greenhouse gases and cool the planet to get the Arctic sea-ice back .
Those dominoes include the Greenland ice sheet .
The loss of the Arctic summer sea-ice will cause a large local warming in the Arctic region of around 5 ºC and a smaller but very significant global warming of around 0.3ºC .
This further warming of the Arctic will add to the speed of disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet .
“ We are close to being committed to a collapse of the Greenland ice sheet ” , says Tim Lenton of the University of East Anglia .
If Greenland totally melts , global sea levels will rise by 7 metres .
The question , given the present trajectory of the climate system is not if , but how fast ?
The general view is 1 – 2 metres this century , but Will Steffen of the ANU says 4 metres cannot be ruled out ; in past climate history 14,000 years ago , sea levels rose as fast as 5 metres per century .
I are not aware of any well - informed climate scientist who thinks that it is possible to have a safe climate or avoid dangerous sea -level rises with the permanent loss of the Arctic summer sea-ice .
This topic is not being addressed in Australia , though it must frame the whole debate .
To not forcefully consider the Arctic is to ignore the biggest issue today in global warming .
The rapid regional warming consequent to the sea-ice loss also has grave repercussions for the permafrost .
The National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder predicts that half of the permafrost in the Arctic north will thaw to a depth of 3 metres by 2050 .
Glaciologist Ted Scambos says , “ That ’s a serious runaway … a catastrophe lies buried under the permafrost . ”
Permafrost specialist Sergei Zimov says : “ Permafrost areas hold 500 billion tonnes of carbon , which can fast turn into greenhouse gases …
If you do n’t stop emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere … the Kyoto Protocol will seem like childish prattle . ”
The western Siberian peat bog is amongst the fastest - warming places on the planet , and Sergei Kirpotin of Tomsk State University calls the melting of frozen bogs an “ ecological landslide that is probably irreversible ” .
In August 2008 , Örjan Gustafsson , the Swedish leader of the International Siberian Shelf Study confirmed that methane was now also bubbling through seawater from permafrost on the seabed .
So the question is no longer whether the permafrost will start to melt , but if and when the time - bomb will go off .
When it does , it will sweep the climate system away from our capacity to stop further dramatic " tipping points " being passed .
All the carbon in the permafrost is equivalent to twice the total amount of all carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , so losing even a significant portion of it will create a very different planet from the one we know .
Scientists are warning that the temperature at which it will be triggered is closer that we think .
Research published in mid-2008 by Dmitry Khvorostyanov shows the trigger is warming in the Arctic of around 9 ºC , and that once initiated it will maintain itself , leading to three - quarters of the carbon being released within a century .
It could happen as early as mid-century .
Act now to avoid catastrophe
For these and many other reasons , I can only conclude that a temperature cap of 2 – 2.4°C , as proposed within the United Nations framework , would take the planet ’s climate beyond the temperature range of the last million years and into catastrophe .
" Two degrees has the potential to lead to three or four degrees because of carbon - cycle feedbacks " , says the University of Adelaide 's Barry Brook .
And so the conclusions we reached in November 2007 were :
• Because of the dangerous knock - on effects caused by its loss , the Arctic sea ice must be restored to its normal extent as fast as possible .
• To get the Arctic sea ice back we need to cool the earth by about 0.3ºC .
If we do n’t , we can not avoid very dangerous climate impacts .
There is no third way .
This is the new very inconvenient truth politicians seek to avoid .
• To cool the earth fast enough to get the Arctic sea-ice back quickly , we need to move to zero greenhouse gas emissions as fast as the economy can be restructured , and is environmentally safe to do so , and take about 200 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide out of the air .
We also need to find environmentally - safe mechanisms to actively cool the earth while navigating this transition .
• Taken together this is a staggering task in terms of the necessary scale and speed of action , but there is simply no alternative if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change .
We were not alone .
In December 2007 , James Hansen spoke of his very similar conclusions .
He says , " Recent greenhouse gas emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate change that could run out of our control , with great dangers for humans and other creatures .
There is already enough carbon in the Earth ’s atmosphere for massive ice sheets such as West Antarctica to eventually melt away , and ensure that sea levels will rise metres in coming decades .
Climate zones such as the tropics and temperate regions will continue to shift , and the oceans will become more acidic , endangering much marine life .
We must begin to move rapidly to the post - fossil fuel clean energy system .
Moreover , we must remove some carbon that has collected in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution . "
In September 2008 , John Schellnhuber , director of Germany ’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and advisor to the German government and the European Union , told David Adam of the British Guardian that only a return to pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide would be enough to guarantee a safe future for the planet .
He said that current political targets to slow the growth in emissions and stabilise carbon levels were insufficient , and that ways may have to be found to actively remove carbon dioxide from the air .
Adam reported : “ [ Schellnhuber ] said even a small increase in temperature could trigger one of several climatic tipping points , such as methane released from melting permafrost , and bring much more severe global warming .
` It is a very sweeping argument , but nobody can say for sure that 330 ppm [ parts per million carbon dioxide ] is safe , ’ he said .
[ The present level is much higher at 387 ppm . ]
‘ Perhaps it will not matter whether we have 270 ppm or 320 ppm , but operating well outside the [ historic ] realm of carbon dioxide concentrations is risky as long as we have not fully understood the relevant feedback mechanisms ’. ”
Talk to most climate scientists , and they will privately agree .
Many are already concerned that it may be too late ( partially because of their very jaundiced view of the political elite up close ) , and they know that the politically accepted targets cannot be scientifically justified as likely to save the planet from disaster .
Recently , 49 Australian grassroots climate action and environment advocacy groups told Ross Garnaut in an open letter that “ the tipping points for large ice sheet and species loss have already been crossed , as we are witnessing in the Arctic .
It is no longer a case of how much more we can safely emit , but whether we can quickly stop emissions and produce a cooling before we hit tipping points and amplifying feedbacks — such as large - scale release of greenhouse gases from melting permafrost — that will take the trajectory of the earth ’s climate system beyond any hope of human restoration . ”
This statement was endorsed by five [ Australian ] state - based conservation councils , and Greenpeace is also moving to this “ new realist ” position .
And of all the large environment - oriented organisations , it was the Australian Greens ’ Christine Milne who took the lead in recognising that “ that the expectation of failure has become the norm in climate policy ” and engaged with the zero emissions goal .
So we can see a sweeping change in the public perspective of scientists and most environmentalists , whom opinion polls show are the two most credible voices in the climate conversation .
Unfortunately , some of the more corporate - cuddle climate groups , trapped in a conservative mode of operation , are caught a long way behind the contemporary debate and the new , evidence - based understanding of the urgent need for zero emissions and the cooling of the planet back to a safe zone .
Obstacles are political
Stop all greenhouse gas emissions and cool the planet : it sounds impossible , but it is not .
I am convinced that the obstacles to such a path are not principally technological or economic , but political and social .
[ Other speakers at this forum will be talking in detail about what those solutions can be . ]
Renewable energy is not rocket science , nor is electrifying our national train network , improving energy efficiency or planning to live sustainably .
A McKinsey &Company report finds that many of the emission reduction opportunities are actually cost - positive ( they cost less than they save in energy costs ) .
And rebuilding a post - fossil - fuel economy will be job rich .
In July , Al Gore issued his challenge to the United States : " Today I challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 % of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon - free sources within 10 years … This goal is achievable , affordable and transformative .
To those who argue that we do not yet have the technology …
I 've seen what they [ entrepreneurs who will drive this revolution ] are doing and I have no doubt that we can meet this challenge . "
Here is the key : the challenge of climate is politically transformative .
In the dense fog that passes for the national climate policy debate , the major players stumble from one lamp post to the next , unable to see the bigger picture in the murky light .
Devoid of context , their climate view is so constrained that they fail to identify the core problem : that the world stands on the edge of a precipice beyond which human actions will be no longer able to control in any meaningful way the trajectory of the climate system , or the fate of human life in a rapidly degrading natural world .
Climate policy is characterised by the habituation of low expectations and a culture of failure .
There is an urgent need to understand global warming and the tipping points for dangerous impacts that we have already crossed as a sustainability emergency , that takes us beyond the politics of failure - inducing compromise because we are now in a race between climate tipping points and political tipping points .
Our political leaders are not taking the actions that the science demands , because the conventional mode of politics is short term and pragmatic .
It seems to be about solving 10 % of the problem , or blaming the other side for problems , or putting it off until after the next election , or pretending it does n’t exist at all .
Politics is more and more spin and less and less substance .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and [ climate change minister ]
Penny Wong have adopted a traditional Labor Party approach to the climate problem : something for the environment lobby and something for business .
But the problem is that solving the climate crisis cannot be treated like a wage deal , with the demands of each side balanced somewhere in the middle .
It is not possible to negotiate with the laws of physics and chemistry .
The planet can not be bought off .
There are absolute limits that should not be crossed , and doing something , but not enough , will still lead to disaster .
We can't wait for the market
They seem wedded to market - based solutions rather than having the imaginative capacity to construct a future nation in which we will actually be able to survive .
We face systemic breakdown .
Speed is of the essence in making the transition to a post - carbon economy as quickly as humanly possible .
We cannot wait for the market to build a sustainable society .
We all have to be part of it .
Even the President of France has declared that " laissez - faire is over " ; Sarkozy said : " the idea that the market is always right is a crazy idea . "
Britain 's Nicholas Stern says global warming is the greatest market failure of all time , so in climate policy what do the major parties turn to : a carbon market !
The climate crisis will not respond to incremental modification of the business - as - usual model .
Fortunately we have another model we can turn to when we really want to fully solve a problem : emergency mode , whether it be flood or fire or tsunami or earthquake .
In these circumstances we do n't wait for market mechanism or price signals or policies that will be implemented in 2 or 3 years time to solve it .
No , government authorities go and directly apply the people and resources to fully solve he problem .
The same is true in war time , where the government controls the economy to produce what is needed quickly and efficiently in order to solve the problem .
In war if you only half solve the problem , you lose .
The same is true of the fight against global warming .
Climate Code Red
What we need to do is recognise , as people such as the UN Secretary General , the head of the UNFCCC , the Victorian state governor in launching Climate Code Red , and many others have said , that we face an emergency that requires emergency action .
The climate emergency requires leadership and courage , and an imaginative capacity almost completely lacking in Australian politics today .
We need to inspire people with the idea of transformative action , the willingness to promote a new vision of the future and make it the number one goal of our society and economy .
It requires governments to put much of the enormous wealth generated by our economy into the solving the climate crisis .
So how much economic capacity should be devoted to making the necessary rapid transition to a post - carbon society ?
The only realistic answer is that we must devote as many resources as are necessary , and as quickly as possible , to the climate emergency .
During the last global mobilisation , World War II , more than 30 per cent , and in some cases more than half , of the economy was devoted to military expenditure .
Yet today we have a delusionary public discussion about how spending 0.5 or 1 per cent on the problem is too much !
We need to be prepared to make that level of commitment again if it is necessary to save most humans and species from a global warming apocalypse .
Shifting to a war - type economy will require us to live better by consuming less as we rebuild a sustainable society .
We can't drill and burn our way out of the current crisis .
But , working together , we can invest and invent our way out .
If politicians cannot lead , then we all must , in building a movement across society that uses the brutal reality of our position to advocate and inspire the nation to take transformative action .
We can only play this game once .
If we do n't do enough , or at sufficient pace , in building a post - carbon economy , the climate system will get away from our capacity to correct it .
Trial and error climate policy is not an option .
Waiting for the market is not an option .
The Arctic is our Pearl Harbor .
And the impacts will be global and overwhelming .
For example , the scientifically conservative 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report said that the Himalayan glaciers might be gone by mid-century .
One - sixth of the Earth ’s population relies on the melting of glaciers and seasonal snow packs for water , yet the federal Labor government ’s unofficial target of 3 degrees is consistent with their destruction .
Taken together with those on the neighbouring Tibetan plateau , the Himalayan– Hindu Kush glaciers represent the largest body of ice on the planet outside the polar regions , feeding Asia 's great river systems , including the Indus , Ganges , Brahmaputra , Salween , Mekong , Yangtze and Huang He .
The basins of these rivers are home to over a billion people from Pakistan to China .
The Himalayas supply as much as 70 per cent of the summer flow in the Ganges and 50 – 60 per cent of the dry - season flow in other major rivers .
In China , 23 per cent of the population lives in the western regions , where glacial melt provides the principal dry season water source .
The implications of the loss of the Himalayan ice sheet are global and mind numbing , but such a calamity rarely rates a mention in Australia .
Do our politicians understand how global warming impacts in the Himalayas will unravel the lives of a billion people ?
In their letter to Garnaut , the grassroots climate groups asked : “ What are our values here ?
Should we ‘ wait and see ’ if the whole world will act , before we do ?
Or should we take the only possible moral course and do what we need to do now , without waiting , because if other nations were to act similarly it may be possible to stop those billion people facing a catastrophe beyond words ?
“ We cannot wait , as one of the world ’s highest per capita emitters , we have a greater responsibility to lead , in proportion to our responsibility for the problem …
Playing a game of ‘ blink ’ with the international community when the stakes are the survival of most people and species is clearly indefensible .
If all nations know that we all have to take drastic action , then the first and best choice is for all nations is to act unilaterally , because we can and must .
We do not have to wait for an international agreement .
To decide not to act with urgency now is to choose failure .
In so doing , bold leadership would replace the pervasive failure on climate in Australia politics . "
Sir Nicholas
Stern said that climate impacts were likely to be greater than the two world wars and the Depression put together , and that ’s on the light side .
When profligacy wrecked the global finance markets in 2008 , governments and central banks readily stumped up more than a trillion dollars to “ bail out ” the economy .
But when profligate human carbon emissions threaten the planet , such a rescue plan is not even the subject of serious conversation .
Perhaps we may take solace in the thought that when global capital , at whose behest most governments rule , understand the new climate realism and conclude that they can’t build an economy on a dying planet , then those who have sat on their hands at the global negotiating tables will miraculously find the political will to plan and build a zero-emissions economy at great speed .
Our role is to lead people across this nation to understand that the transformation to a sustainable society , and rebuilding our economy , is now an emergency .

MR. FREEZE ….
A couple of weeks ago , at the first presidential debate , Jim Lehrer noted that the cost of the response to the financial crisis is still undetermined , but it ’s likely to be enormous .
He pressed John McCain on how it would affect his presidency .
After initially dodging the question , McCain responded , “ How about a spending freeze on everything but defense , veteran affairs and entitlement programs . ”
Asked if he was really proposing a spending freeze , McCain added he would “ seriously consider ” it .
I assumed , at the time , that McCain just came up with that on the spot .
A spending freeze was never part of McCain ’s policy agenda , and it was hard to believe he was serious about this .
But he was .
McCain has emphasized the notion of a spending freeze several times over the last couple of weeks , including in his latest “ reboot ” speech in Virginia this morning .
“ I will freeze government spending on all but the most important programs like defense , veterans care , Social Security and health care until we scrub every single government program and get rid of the ones that are n’t working for the American people . ”
It really would be helpful if McCain fleshed this out a bit .
Are defense , veterans care , Social Security , and health care the only parts of the budget that will be isolated from this “ freeze ” ?
As Mark Schmitt recently asked , “ In a recession , are Food Stamps frozen ?
Student loans ?
Unemployment benefits ?
Pell Grants ?
S- CHIP ?
Low - Income Home Energy Assistance ( LIHEAP ) ?
The list is long , and different states and constituencies naturally have their own programs that they would like to know whether McCain would freeze them or not . ”
Quite right .
A spending freeze would have dramatic real - life consequences .
As Yglesias recently noted , a spending freeze would , in real terms , mean “ less money for your local police department .
Less money for the FBI .
Less money for Head Start .
Less money for Pell Grants .
Less money for infrastructure .
Less money for everything except failed banks and endless wars . ”
This proposed spending “ freeze ” seems to be getting no real attention at all , perhaps because reporters assumed , as I did , that McCain did n’t mean it and was just throwing out nonsense to get through a debate .
But he seems to be serious about this and it deserves a lot more scrutiny .
Inside - out Frieze Symmetries in Ancient Peruvian Weavings Posted October 2008 .

The pre-Columbian civilizations of Peru had no written language and , as far as we know , no formal mathematics beyond the still inscrutable recording of information by patterns of knots in strings called quipu .
But thanks to their custom of burying large quantities of textiles with their dead , and to the unusual aridity of the coastal area in central and south central Peru , many of their woven , embroidered or painted textiles have been preserved .
The intricate symmetries of the decoration bear witness to the pre-numerical mathematical genius of these peoples , and give us a rare window into cultures which were first superseded by the Incas and then extirpated in the aftermath of the Conquest ( 1532 ) .
Branko Grünbaum ( see References , below ) has analyzed the Peruvian exploitation of planar symmetries in textile decoration .
In this column I plan to examine frieze symmetries as manifested in woven strips , and especially the uniquely Peruvian device of using double - and multiple - weaving to create an additional symmetry between the front and the back of a textile .
Some of the textiles I am using as examples can be assumed to date from the " Late Intermediate Period " ( 1000 - 1400 AD ) and to originate in the central or south - central coast .
Adele Cahlander shows several similar examples which are reputably dated and sited .
For others ( the first and second groups below ) I have not been able to find such exact published parallels .
They are certainly pre-Inca and from that part of Peru .
Frieze symmetries Frieze symmetries ( the possible symmetries of a 1 - dimensional strip of decoration ) were completely analyzed ( Speiser , Pólya , Niggli , 1924 ) in the early twentieth century .
There are 7 possibilities : FFFFFFFF ( T : translation ) bpbpbpbp ( TG : translation and glide reflection ) EEEEEEEE ( THG : translation , up - down mirror symmetry , glide reflection ) TTTTTTTT ( TV : translation and left - right mirror symmetry ) ZZZZZZZZ ( TR : translation and 180 - degree rotation ) bdpqbdpq ( TRVG : translation , 180 - degree rotation , left - right mirror symmetry , glide reflection ) HHHHHHHH ( TRHVG : translation , 180 - degree rotation , up - down and left - right mirror symmetry , glide reflection )
Double weaving Double - weaving is a widespread technique which allows decoration of both sides of a textile at once .
In the most common form , warp - faced double weaving , the warps for a cloth are set up on the loom with two yarns of complementary color in each position .
The fabric is woven as usual by leading the weft over and under the warps , but here at each intersection the weft passes over one color and under the other .
The result is that the two sides of the fabric bear mirror - image designs in opposite colors .
Double weaving and frieze symmetries
The ancient Peruvians combined double weaving and pattern symmetry , using color as an extra variable , to achieve symmetries between the two sides of a textile .
Suppose that a strip is double - woven with dark green and orange so that on one side ( " recto " ) it shows the frieze pattern p p p p p p ... .
The other side ( " verso " ) will then show b b b b b b ... , i.e. the pattern from the recto , translated one step and reflected .
Here is an example : Frieze symmetry T implemented in double weaving ( width of decoration : 34 mm ) .
The color substitution from front to back corresponds to the translation .
Therefore the back decoration is a ( reversed ) translated copy of the front .
This principle was exploited with more complex frieze symmetries : Frieze symmetry TG implemented in double weaving ( width of decoration : 21 mm ) .
Whenever the symmetry involves the glide - reflection G , then the pattern on the verso exactly replicates that on the recto after a translation .
Frieze symmetry TVG implemented in double weaving ( width of decoration : 18 mm ) .
Frieze symmetry TRVG implemented in double weaving ( width of decoration : 28 mm ) .
Multiple weaving with three colors A singular achievement of the Peruvian weavers ( I do not believe this was duplicated by any other civilization ) was the production of textiles in which more than two yarns occupy each warp position .
In ordinary cloth this is impossible , because one yarn is up , one is down and there is no place for others .
The Peruvians solved the problem by using two sets of wefts : at each intersection one warp would go over the top weft , one warp would go under the bottom weft , and the rest would be hidden inside the double fabric so constructed .
( In practice , a single weft was led across on the top and back on the bottom ; the resulting very sturdy but bulky construction , aptly described by d'Harcourt as " tubular , " was only used for belts and straps ) .
Here , as in the examples , blue is used as a background with two additional colors , yellow and red ; four warps are strung in each position : two blues , one red , one yellow .
In the diagram the wefts run vertically , with one set shown in front and one in back .
The blue appears outside or inside simultaneously in front and in back , but yellow and red alternate .
Frieze symmetries T ( width 40 mm ) , TG , TVG ( width 42 mm ) implemented with three warp colors ( two working colors and one background ) .
A band similar in size and construction , but with non-zoomorphic designs , is illustrated in Cahlander , Figs 5 - 6a , b ; it is described as a " Nasca ' turban , ' " which would date it around 500 AD .
Multiple weaving with four colors
With four colors typically one ( usually red ) is used as a background color and three others work the design .
This extremely complex work was usually reserved for the backstraps the weavers themselves used to maintain tension in their looms .
A specimen similar to this example , with the simpler T inside - out symmetry , is in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History 41.2/5104 ( shown in Cahlander ) ; another with TVG color - coded front - back symmetry ( undoubtedly ; Cahlander shows only one side ) is in the collection of the Lowie Museum of Anthropology , University of California , Berkeley E13-1-3969 .
Frieze symmetry TR , implemented in four - color multiple - warp weaving ( width of decoration : 50 mm ) .
Here the working colors are blue , yellow and green .
The white paper clip is a reference point .
The pattern in this example is the superposition of two two - color patterns , each with color - coded translation - rotation symmetry :
In the yellow - green pattern , interchanging yellow and green corresponds to a 180 - degree rotation .
Similarly for the blue - green pattern .
In the weaving of this textile , the green in the yellow - green pattern is matched by yellow in the verso ( and the yellow by green ) , whereas the green in the blue - green pattern is matched by blue ( and the blue by green ) .
In this way the entire front - back color substitution corresponds to a 180 - degree rotation , and the verso shows the recto pattern translated , reflected and rotated by 180 degrees .
Since reflection in the longitudinal axis and rotation by 180 degrees is equivalent to reflection in the transversal axis , we can appreciate the phenomenon by giving the image of the recto an additional transversal reflection :
Note the position of the paper clip .
When the image of the verso is flipped across a transversal axis , it exhibits the same pattern as the recto ( up to a translation ) .
The juxtaposition shows up a couple of small errors in the weaving .

WASHINGTON , March 11 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush 's fellow Republicans in Congress on Tuesday upheld his veto of a bill to ban the CIA from subjecting enemy detainees to interrogation methods denounced by critics as torture .
A largely party - line vote of 225- 188 in the Democratic - led House of Representatives fell short of the needed two - thirds majority to override the president .
Bush maintains that the United States does not torture , but has refused to discuss interrogation techniques , saying that doing so could tip off terrorists .
The CIA has acknowledged using a simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding on three terrorism suspects , including accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , but says it stopped using that method in 2003 .
Waterboarding has been condemned by many U.S. lawmakers , human rights groups and foreign countries as a form of torture .
In voting to sustain Bush 's veto , Rep. Pete Hoekstra , a Michigan Republican , attacked Democrats for failing to approve a stalled Senate - passed bill that would expand the government 's ability to track foreign targets .
" Rather than holding a vote to give terrorists our ( interrogation ) playbook , Congress should be voting to strengthen the intelligence community 's ability to spy on them , " Hoekstra said .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , a Maryland Democrat , said Bush 's veto had degraded the country 's moral standing , undermined its international credibility and could expose U.S. military and intelligence personnel to the treatment .
The bill vetoed by Bush was a sweeping intelligence authorization measure .
A key provision would have required the CIA to comply with the rules set by the Army Field Manual in questioning detainees .
The rules forbid eight interrogation methods , including waterboarding , electric shock , beatings and mock executions .
They permit 19 techniques , mainly psychological , such as trying to convince detainees that cooperation will shorten the war and save their country .
White House press secretary Dana Perino hailed the vote .
" The CIA program has produced critical intelligence and helped us prevent a number of attacks , " Perino said .
" An override of the president 's veto would have diminished the intelligence community 's ability to protect our nation . "
Sen .
John McCain , an Arizona Republican who was tortured while a prisoner in the Vietnam war and is now his party 's presumptive presidential nominee , opposed the bill .
" I think that waterboarding is torture and illegal , but I will not restrict the CIA to only the Army Field Manual , " McCain said last month .
Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois , competing for the Democratic presidential nomination , both backed the bill and denounced Bush 's veto .

Understanding the Significance of Mark - to - Market Accounting
" Suspending mark - to - market accounting , in essence , suspends reality . "
- Beth Brooke , global vice chair , at Ernst & Young
>
Misinformation , bad dope , and spin seem to be dominating the current discussion on Mark - to - Market accounting .
Let 's see if we cannot simplify the arcane complexity of the accounting rules regarding FASB 157 .
Understand why this is even an issue : Many banks , brokers , and funds chose to invest in certain " financial products " that were difficult to value and were at times thinly traded .
If you are looking for the underlying cause of why some arcane accounting rule is an issue , this is it .
In my office , we do n't buy our clients beanie babies or Star Wars collectibles or 1964 Ferrari 275GTBs .
We purchase stocks and ETFs and bonds and preferreds for them ( some clients also own options and commodities ) .
Why ?
Because we believe -- and our clients have insisted upon -- the need for instant liquidity .
Nothing we have purchased cannot be liquidated on a moments notice .
We know what the fair value of these holdings are second by second .
While we may have been tempted by potential greater returns that some of these other products offered , we simply could not justify the risk of owning hard to value , thinly traded , hard to sell items .
And , we never had to rely on the models of the individuals who created and sold us these products in the first place , to determine an actual price .
If ever a product was rife with self - interested conflicts of interest , this one is it .
That is one of the key elements of the current situation .
A decision was made to bypass the broad , deeply traded traditional markets ( Equities , Fixed Income , Commodities and Currency ) and instead create new markets for new products .
No one should be surprised that the net result was a flawed system of garbage paper , with too little room at the exits in case of emergency .
Let 's puts this into some context :
" Accounting is a way of portioning economic results by time periods .
It does n’t affect the cash flows , but tries to allocate economic profits proportional to release from risk .
If we were back in an era where the financial instruments were simple , then the old rules would work .
But once you introduce derivatives , and securities that are called bonds , but are more akin to equity interests , you need to mark them to market . "
- David Merkel
Exactly .
Otherwise , you are left with public companies , who have made capital allocation and investment decisions that are hidden from their owners ( shareholders ) and the investing public .
Now that the garbage is on the books , no one wants to admit the original error of purchasing this class of assets .
Its not just that the trade has gone bad , its the original buying decision was so flawed even if the trades were not such giant losers .
Recent actions of corporate titans in the financial sector are essentially an admission that their business model was deeply flawed .
No one would invest any capital for a ROI of 50 bps per year .
They of course knew this -- so they leveraged up that 50 bps 35X or so , creating the false appearance of more attractive returns .
This higher risk , potentially higher return paper was part of that misleading process .
Suspending FASB 157 amounts to little more than an attempt to hide this broken business model from investors , regulators and the public .
Its not just getting through the next few quarters that matters ;
Rather , its allowing the market place to appropriately reallocate this capital to where it will serve its investors best .
That is what free market capitalism is , including Schumpeter 's creative destruction .
( A WSJ OpEd today get this issue precisely wrong ) .
I have been steadfast over the past 2 years about why I did not want to own any of the financials that held this paper on its books .
The key was that we could not figure out what the liabilities were relative to the assets .
That is investing 101 .
If FASB 157 is suspended , I would advise our clients and the investing public that owning any financials that failed to disclose their holdings accurately were no longer investments -- they were pure speculations , with more in common to spinning a roulette wheel than owning Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK ) or Apple ( AAPL ) or Google ( GOOG ) .
Indeed , I know of no faster way to end up on the DO NOT OWN list than to hide from your shareholders what is on your books .
If investors cannot trust the valuations of what is on a firms books , they simply cannot invest in these firms PERIOD .
There are other alternatives for the institutions that now must deal with this discounted , thinly traded hard to value junk paper .
They can sell it for whatever price a the market will bear , they can spin it off into a separate holding company , they can write it down to zero and reap the rewards of mark ups in future quarters .
But suspending the proper accounting of this paper is the refuge of cowards .
It reflects a refusal to admit the original error , it hides the mistake , and it misleads shareholders .
I find it to be totally unacceptable solution to the current crisis .
As Japan learned , not taking the write downs only delays the day of reckoning .
They propped up insolvent banks , and suffered a decade long recession for it .
That way disaster lay . . .

( Part 1 in a 4 - Part Series on Elemental Art Featuring Natural Wonders of the World )
From alluvial fans and massive holes , the sheer scale and splendor of certain magnificent land formations is difficult to capture in words or even images .
Like stunning natural fractals on a much more massive scale , here are some of the most profound , stunning and awe - inspiring examples of ‘ natural art ’ in the world .
One cannot fail to appreciate the unparalleled visual wonders of our world , so stayed tuned for next week ’s amazing natural water and ice formations .
Alluvial Fan , China
This stunning alluvial fan sprays across the Kunlun and Altun mountain ranges , which are located at the Southern end of China ’s Taklimakan Desert .
Alluvial fans are defined as soft , relatively flat , gently sloping planes of loose rock and sediment , comonly found in mountains and deposited by water .
This is one of the largest in the world .
Mt. St. Helens , Oregon , United States
This volcanic mountain of St. Helens , part of the Cascade Mountain range that runs through the Pacific Northwest into Canada , is famous for its violent explosion in May of 1980 that devastated the region and sent a cloud of ash and debris around the world .
Over 200 square miles of forestland were flattened and turned to ash .
A new lava dome has continually grown in the decades since , and with steam escaping daily and mild tremors , scientists keep a close eye on it .
As you can see from the lower right image , the land has gradually begun to rebound , with light vegetation and animals beginning to return – until the next eruption .
Brandberg Massif , Africa
Image via mromeijn
Like a giant , knobby mesa , the Brandberg Massif rises out of the Namib Desert in Namibia , Africa .
This granite intrusion is riddled with caves full of art and is home to many unusual plants and animals that flourish in the hot , dry environment .
Shoemaker Impact Structure , Australia
Image via UCSB
Hundreds of millions of years ago – between 1000 and 600 , scientists estimate – a meteor crashed into Australia and created this 30 km wide basin formerly known as the Teague Ring ( it was renamed after a renowned USGS scientist named Eugene Shoemaker ) .
It is arid and harsh , full of dry lakebeds and encrusted with salt .
Great Barrier Reef , Australia
The iconic , massive and complex Great Barrier Reef is just as beautiful from the aerial view as when one is swimming near it .
Home to an incredibly diverse array of sharks , fish , plants , coral and other marine wildlife , the Barrier Reef stretches over 2,600 km in the Coral Sea off the coast of Australia .
It ’s the largest reef system in the world , with 900 islands and 2,900 coral reefs .
Like the Great Wall of China , this unique structure is one of the few structures made by organisms ( in this case coral , not people ) that is visible from space .
Grand Canyon , Arizona , United States
The famous Grand Canyon is one of the most beautiful examples of earth art .
Carved over the course of 6 million years by the waters of the Colorado River , the Grand Canyon is 277 miles long , 4 to 18 miles wide and in places over a mile deep .
The steep - sided gorge was once populated by Native Americans and artifacts of up to 12,000 years in age have been found .
The Grand Canyon was one of the first lands to be preserved and made a national park ( by Teddy Roosevelt ) .
African Richat
Image via UCSB
This unique structure in the Sahara Desert of Mauritania can be seen from space .
It is 50 miles wide and rather unusual for the fairly featureless Sahara .
Though people often refer to it as an impact structure , it ’s actually the natural result of hundreds of thousands of years of erosion .
Formed from layers of sedimentary rock , fierce winds and shifting sand dunes have worn away at the material , leaving a crater impression behind .
It is also known as the Eye of Africa .
Namib Sand Dunes , Namibia
Images via UCSB and Photographic Arts
The Namib Sand Dunes are part of the Namib Desert , which is Africa ’s 2nd largest desert after the Sahara .
The desert is famous for these massive and eternally shifting sand dunes , which are larger than any others on earth and can reach up to 1,000 feet in height .
One of the oldest deserts on earth , Namib is home to unusual plant and animal species that can survive the incredibly harsh , arid conditions .
Alien Boulders ?
Images via Mondo Vista
Of course no earth art series would be complete without the requisite conspiracy theory .
Rock outcrops and unusual formations that seem difficult to explain away through natural phenomena are popularly held up as proof of aliens , unknown civilizations , government conspiracies and more .
Usually , these rock structures – such as the ones shown here , in Oklahoma and West Virginia – can in fact be explained by geological history and even weather , intentional in design as they may appear to be .
Giant ’s Causeway , Northern Ireland
Case in point : Giant ’s Causeway .
Though it certainly looks chiseled and hewn , this incredible rock bridge is completely natural .
40,000 interlocking basalt columns which are mostly hexagonal .
These basalt rocks were formed when molten lava was pushed through cracked chalk beds .
As the lava cooled , the liquid basalt contracted into the distinctive shapes that are so famous .
Barringer Meteorite Crater , Arizona , United States
The Barringer Meteorite Crater in Arizona was formed 50,000 years ago when a meteorite impacted land in what is now Arizona .
Basically a giant hole , the Meteorite Crater ( or Meteor Crater ) has 150 rims with stones the size of houses and spans a mile .
It ’s also 570 feet deep .
Remnants of meteoric iron are scattered around the crater for miles .
The Green Bridge of Wales
Image via Wikimedia
The Green Bridge of Wales , in Pembrokeshire , was formed through the natural erosion of limestone , of which the arch is made .
It ’s the largest natural arch in Wales and one of the biggest in the world , to boot .
Due to coastal erosion and waves , eventually it will collapse .
Alum Bay , Isle of Wight
Images via BBC , Botley Leisure and Robert
The gorgeous waters of Alum Bay off the Isle of Wight are distinctive enough , but the special exhibit on display here is the cliffs .
Seen at certain times of day , particularly sunset , the cliffs deceive the eye and appear to be striped in diverse bright colors .
In truth the cliff sands do vary in color noticeably , but certain shadows and angles heighten the difference into a dramatic display .
The Himalayas , Asia
Images via ABC Science and Geographic Guide
The Himalayas , which separate the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau in Asia , are the largest mountains in the world .
Mt. Everest , the tallest peak on earth , is found in this astonishing mountain range of icy , jagged peaks and soaring ridges .
( Over 100 of the range ’s mountains are higher than 7,200 m . )
The range is over 2,400 km long , and its water basin supports 1.3 billion people .
Cathedral Caves , New Zealand
Images via Photoseek and Uleth
The magnificent Cathedral Caves are found in Catlins , New Zealand on the South Island .
Featuring two massive caves with distinctive narrow , tall openings , tourists enjoy exploring them from the broad , sandy beach of Catlins .
The two caves are actually one cave , so you can enter through the first and exit from the second .
Because the caves are in these towering beach bluffs , they can only be accessed for two hours at low tide .

“ The federal incentives drive the system .
The more divorces , and the higher the child - support guidelines are set and enforced ( no matter how unreasonable ) , the more money the state bureaucracy collects from the feds .
Follow the money .
The less time that non-custodial parents ( usually fathers ) are permitted to be with their children , the more child support they must pay into the state fund , and the higher the federal bonus to the states for collecting the money .

A suicide bomber struck the headquarters of the Anti-terrorism Squad of the Islamabad police force Thursday afternoon , just as lawmakers were preparing to convene 15 miles away to discuss growing militancy in the country .
The incident added to the rise in bomb attacks that Pakistan has seen over the past year , not only in its troubled northwestern region but also on high - profile targets in major cities like Islamabad , the capital .
" The message [ from Thursday 's attack ] could n't have been clearer , " says Hassan Askari Rizvi , former professor of Pakistan Studies at Columbia University .
The militants , he continues , " want to show that they have the capacity to hit Pakistani institutions – even those ones trusted with the responsibility of protecting the rest . "
Suicide bomb attacks have spiked in Pakistan , from two in 2002 to a record 56 in 2007 , according to the Institute for Conflict Management , based in New Delhi .
As of August of this year , the country had seen 25 suicide - bomb attacks , ICM reports .
In a grim indicator of the rise in attacks , according to Pakistan 's intelligence agency , this year Pakistan has overtaken Iraq in suicide - bomb deaths .
It counted 28 suicide bombings in Pakistan that killed more than 471 people in the first eight months of this year .
By comparison Iraq saw 42 such attacks and 463 deaths ; Afghanistan , 36 incidents and 436 casualties .
Thursday 's bombing in Islamabad left no casualties .
But it capped off a week of deadly attacks throughout the country .
In Dir , near the northwestern Swat Valley where the Army is currently battling militants , a roadside bomb targeted a bus carrying prisoners and killed 11 people , including four children in a school bus that was passing by .
On Wednesday , three bombings in Lahore targeting a spot where young men and women are known to mingle freely , injured several women and children .
Earlier attacks in the past week targeted politicians .
The attack came the day after Pakistan 's newly appointed intelligence chief delivered a rare briefing to lawmakers on the country 's militant threat .
Lawmakers will reconvene Monday behind closed doors to discuss a unified strategy to combat the growing militancy in the country .
But more than political will , Pakistan will need to improve its counterterrorism abilities , says Khalid Rahman at the Institute of Policy Studies in Islamabad .
" Most of the time there is no claim of responsibility , and investigations do n't uncover much , " he says .
" Unless we have concrete information on where this is coming from and why , it will be a hard fight to fight . "
THE global economy is facing the toughest conditions in 25 years , federal Treasurer Wayne Swan has warned .
Mr Swan 's comments came as the International Monetary Fund released its latest economic outlook , which described the world economy as being in " a tough spot " , and said that the slowdown would be longer and deeper than forecast three months ago .
" The first - quarter slowdown was somewhat less sharp than predicted in the April 2008 World Economic Outlook , " the IMF said .
" However , recent indicators suggest a further deceleration of activity in the second half of 2008 .
In advanced economies , business and consumer sentiment have continued to retreat , while industrial production has weakened further .
There have also been signs of weakening business activity in emerging economies . "
Mr Swan said while global inflation was on the rise , and borrowing costs had risen , Australia was well insulated .
" We have highly regarded regulators and do not face the same problems being experienced in the US subprime mortgage market , " he said .
He said that the IMF 's forecasts for growth in Asian and emerging economies also remained robust .
" In particular , the growth outlook for China remains supportive of continued growth in Australia , " he said .

Josem plotted the win rate of several thousand players against the suspicious accounts and found the cheats won money at a rate that was 100 times faster than a good player could reasonably win .
The cheating accounts played every hand as if they knew every card that the other players had and folded hands at just the right time .
The findings led to an investigation by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission , which licenses several hundred online casinos and poker rooms .
It found Absolute Poker attempted to cover up the cheating by deleting gaming logs and records and fined it $ US500,000 .
Absolute Poker repaid those who had lost money but refused to release the cheater 's identity because a private settlement was reached .
A few months later , Josem and players from the Two Plus Two online poker forum used the same methods to uncover almost identical cheating occurring at Absolute Poker 's sister site , UltimateBet .
One player account , NioNio , netted a profit of $ 300,000 in just 3000 hands and won 13 of the 14 sessions recorded on the MyPokerIntel.com website , which tracks high stakes online tournaments .
" The chances of a player winning at those rates is approximately equal to winning a one - in - a - million lottery on six consecutive occasions , " said Josem .
" In poker , a contest of limited information , if you know what cards your opponent has , you 'll never lose - and this is precisely what happened . "
The cheats passed their fraudulent winnings between multiple user accounts in an attempt to avoid detection .
The Kahnawake Gaming Commission today released the initial findings of an audit it is conducting into UltimateBet .
It named World Series of Poker winner Russ Hamilton , previously associated with Ultimate Bet 's affiliate program , as the main perpetrator .
Commission spokesman Chuck Barnett said the names of others involved would come out when the final report was released in November .
The commission ordered UltimateBet to begin refunding all players adversely affected by the cheating scheme and remove any staff connected with the scheme by November 3 .
The site has also been fined $ US1.5 million and will have its licence revoked if it does not comply with any of the sanctions .
An Australian company , Gaming Associates , conducted the official investigations on both UltimateBet and Absolute Poker for the commission .
Its principal consultant , Alan Pedley , refused to discuss the specifics of the findings as he was bound by a non-disclosure agreement .
As a result of his detective work Josem has been employed by the leading online poker site , PokerStars , to work on its security team .
He said other sites were n't vulnerable to the same cheats because they used different software and had more credible operators .
" Just as not all insurance companies behave the same way as HIH , and not all politicians are the same as Brian Burke , not all poker companies are the same as UltimateBet and Absolute Poker , " Josem said .
" The employees of the leading online poker operators simply do n't have the feature or ability to view hole cards of players during a hand and they do n't have this ability because of a security decision that was made when their software was first written many years ago . "
Josem said people could still be confident about playing on online poker sites because , if something untoward happened , it could easily be caught by statistical analysis , precisely as happened in this situation .
" Every online poker hand is recorded electronically and can be analysed after the fact .
Just as the third umpire video replay can be used to enforce the rules in cricket , third - party analysis can be used to enforce the rules of poker . "

While they have their backs turned , fighting wars in Asia and the Middle East , it seems that US troops have allowed a counter - invasion of their country by marauding legions .
An infestation of the Turkistan cockroach , which can carry diseases such as typhoid and dysentery , can be blamed on a handful of the insects hitching a ride with soldiers returning from the war zone , experts say .
Now the fast - breeding cockroaches , which are adept at dodging pesticides , have spread from California to New Mexico , threatening mayhem further afield as they seek new territory .
" It started with soldiers and equipment coming back from the first Gulf war in the early 1990s , but it 's still happening and they 're spreading to other areas , " said Philip Koehler , a professor of entomology at the University of Florida , Gainesville .
Experts say that the Turkistan cockroach , native to many countries including Iraq , Afghanistan and Iran , is particularly troublesome .
Its natural habitat is the desert , of which there are large areas in California , Arizona , New Mexico and Texas .
It breeds quickly at room temperature and , according to Koehler , is not timid .
" They like to live around the outside of houses , but also to invade them , " he said .
While the spread of the Turkistan is his biggest worry , Koehler warned that warmer areas of the US were also under threat from other newly imported species such as the Madagascar hissing roach , the lobster roach and the orange spotted roach .
" We have 69 species of cockroaches in the US and 29 of them were brought in from other countries , " he said .
Are we real ?
Is our existence the result of an accident , or was it planned by a higher conscience ?

Senator Conroy ’s office could spin a thread of gold from a lump of crap , I ’ll give them that .
But if you ’ve read the Tasmanian filtering report , it probably did n’t take long before you noticed red flags .
I decided to compare the report to what Mr Conroy says in his press release and show why the trial is nothing but a miserable failure .
What Senator Conroy says :
The performance or ‘ network degradation ’ for one of the tested products was less than 2 % , whilst three products were less than 30 % and two products were in excess of 75 % .
What the report really says :
The filter that showed less than 2 % network degradation was also one of the least accurate filters at identifying illegal and inappropriate sites .
The more accurate filters showed a larger drop in network performance .
What Senator Conroy says : Successful blocking ( the proportion of illegal and inappropriate content that should have been blocked that was successfully blocked ) was between 88 % and 97 % with most achieving over 92 % .
What the report really says :
It probably wo n’t take any more than 12 or 13 clicks before a filtered user can access a site containing adult or inappropriate content .
What Senator Conroy says : Overblocking ( the proportion of content that was blocked that should not have been blocked ) was between 1 % and 6 % , with most falling under 3 % .
What the report really says :
Even if you choose the best result ( 1 % ) , out of every one million websites , 10,000 will be blocked when they should n’t be .
What Senator Conroy says :
All filter products tested were able to block traffic entirely across a wide range of non-web protocols such as instant messaging and peer - to - peer protocols .
However , most filters are not presently able to identify illegal content and content that may be regarded as inappropriate that is carried via the majority of non-web protocols .
What the report really says :
The only way the filters could block traffic on non web protocols was to ban access to them completely .
That means if you want to chat to Gran about her garden or drinking habit on Messenger , you would n’t be able to .
No matter how innocent .
Those are just the starters .
Here ’s the main course :
1 ) The number of simulated users was too low .
Large ISPs have hundreds of thousands of customers and even small ISPs have thousands .
2 ) During the trial , only 3930 URLs were filtered .
When you consider Mr Conroy wants to block ‘ inappropriate content ’ to children , 3930 URLs is simply too low and does n’t show the potential real impact on network performance or filtering effectiveness .
The Internet contains hundreds of thousands of websites not appropriate for children by our classification standards .
3 ) The report claims all but one of the six filters was able to ‘ filter ’ HTTPS traffic .
That means the Government could intercept your private and secure banking details ( or PayPal transactions ) and leave the door open to fraud and identity theft .
Nobody wants their online purchases monitored by the Government let alone their banking put at risk .
4 ) There is no analysis of circumvention methods and that ’s crucial to understanding why filters – ISP and software based – are ineffective .
Filtering can be bypassed in minutes by a savvy net user and in hour by anyone following instructions .
5 ) There is no analysis of the costs of deploying and implementing a filter at ISP level , nor is there any analysis of the associated costs that will be passed onto customers .
That to me looks like a failure dressed up by a Senator with an obsession on controlling what you can and ca n ’t see .

I for one would n’t want my blog or businesses website blocked for no reason .
Oh !
If you spotted other doozies in the report , please post them in the comments .
No doubt I ’ve missed many .
Update : More flaws surface .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
If we take Sarah Palin at her word — and despite the blog chatter to which I sacrificed my Labor Day weekend , there ’s no reason why we should n’t — she learned last December , four months into her pregnancy , that the baby she was carrying possessed an extra 21st chromosome , the cause of Down syndrome .
Then she made an unusual decision , one made by only 10 percent of US women who receive a similar prenatal diagnosis :
She decided to carry her baby to term .
No doubt this was a difficult personal decision , made in consultation with her doctor and with the advice of her husband , Todd .
As a dedicated foe of abortion rights , Palin might have leaned against termination from the start , but if it were all a slam dunk one has to wonder why she had any prenatal genetic tests at all .
I suspect that when Palin and her family received the news they agonized late into several nights before deciding they could take on the challenge of raising a disabled child .
Now we have the additional revelation that Bristol Palin , Sarah and Todd ’s 17 - year - old daughter , is about to have her own baby in a few months .
No doubt this provoked a heated family debate as well , one that ended in Todd and Sarah ’s affirmation of unconditional love and support .
And , you know , that ’s great .
It really is .
Some may talk about overpopulation and whether a mother of five can govern ( accusations of sexism , in that case , stick ) ; others may talk about moral values and the failure of abstinence education and accuse Republicans of hypocrisy .
But teenagers are mercurial , parents busy , and mistakes get made .
The day we can no longer welcome a new life into the world , we might as well hang it up as a species .
The warm reception given baby Trig and the pride the Palins claim to feel about Bristol ’s pregnancy speaks to the sincerity of their convictions .
It would be small - minded of all of us not to admire what is in fact not hypocrisy , but a stunning absence of it .
It would also be taking a narrow view of things , however , to forget that the Palins are a two - income family :
The mother is a public servant , the father is a union worker , and they no doubt have excellent private health insurance .
Both Bristol and Sarah Palin have the luxury of exercising true reproductive choice , and continuing with pregnancies that would have devastated — financially and emotionally — many an ordinary family .
A recent Gates Foundation survey found that one - third of female teenage dropouts cited pregnancy as the reason they could n’t stay in school .
Another survey studied women in their 30s who were once teenage moms and found that only 3 percent of them completed a college degree .
Just in Alaska , families with Down syndrome children — half of whom have congenital heart defects in addition to some degree of mental retardation , hearing , and vision problems — report long wait lists for subsidized medical care and special education programs .
If John McCain wins the election and Palin becomes the kind of vice president who exerts any influence over policy , she will no doubt do what she can to overturn Roe v. Wade and make abortion illegal again .
That ’s her calling and her base ; that ’s the reason she has , as campaign talking points would have it , “ energized ” the conservatives who eluded the maverick McCain .
But what I wonder is this :
Can we also expect that she will fight for longer maternity leaves and subsidized child care ?
Will she fight for programs that assist parents in raising disabled children , and force private insurance companies to pay for their care ?
Will she make it possible for a working - class college student to provide her child with a solid education in a safe neighborhood , and finish her education herself ?
Doubtful .
Paradoxically , kindness toward mothers and children in need — in the form of food , shelter , and education — is not a value the party she belongs to , including that energized base , upholds .
Just this year , Palin used her gubernatorial power to reduce funding to Convenant House Alaska ’s Passage House , a program that “ assists young mothers in developing skills such as healthy parenting , money management , priority setting , housing acquisition and social skills development . ”
John McCain ’s health care plan , which promises only to lower the costs of medical care and offer families health savings accounts , would do little to lessen the financial burden of expectant mothers or parents with disabled children .
Consequently , it will do little to reduce the number of abortions .
As the Guttmacher Foundation has found , in more than 32 studies conducted in 27 countries , the second most common reason women give for terminating a pregnancy is socioeconomic , including “ lack of support from the father , poverty and unemployment . ”
If Sarah Palin ’s pro-life agenda does n’t factor that in — and does n’t fight to give families equal access to health care and education regardless of their economic status — it ’s not only inhumane but ineffective .
As Hillary Clinton reminded us so long ago , raising a child takes a village .
And if the McCain - Palin ticket wants any segment of her disaffected supporters , they will spend their time in Minneapolis crafting a new plan for the nation ’s 47 million uninsured — one that will allow them , like Sarah and Bristol , to have their babies in a political culture of unconditional love and support .
And , even , pride .

CSRF , or Cross - Site Request Forgery , is a vulnerability very common in websites .
In short , it means that if you have your site at foo.com , and an attacker at badguy.com can display a form similar to one of your site ’s , and make users on his site submit the forms on your site , possibly without their knowledge .
This can be dangerous , especially if your admin interface is compromised :
There may be a button on the other site which goes to your admin interface and deletes the latest blogpost for example – and you would n’t want that !
Let ’s look at a simple way to prevent CSRF attacks , and then how to apply it in Zend Framework apps to automatically secure all forms .
Preventing CSRF
Preventing CSRF requires three things :
Make sure your forms use POST
Make sure your site is not vulnerable to XSS Make your forms use a CSRF key
Step 1 is n’t really a requirement – you could CSRF protect forms which use GET too , but it ’s generally a bad idea to have forms use GET for any possibly dangerous things .
In fact , the only good use for GET forms I can think of is a search query , so that you can easily use it in the future by just changing the query in the URL .
Step 2 is quite critical .
It ’s difficult to protect forms against CSRF if there ’s a script in the page which sends the CSRF key to the attacker .
Step 3 is the actual anti-CSRF measure .
It ’s quite simple , actually – create a key , store it in the session , and require it as a value in form submissions .
If the form does n’t contain the key generated on the previous request , it ’s probably not a proper form submission .
A simple protection script
It ’s relatively simple to protect a form against CSRF .
We first need to generate a key , store it , and put it in the form .
In the next request , the script needs to check whether the value was actually in the request or not ..
<?php if ( $ _SERVER [ ' REQUEST_METHOD ' ] == ' POST ' ) { //
Here we parse the form if ( ! isset ( $ _SESSION [ ' csrf ' ] ) || $ _SESSION [ ' csrf ' ] !== $ _POST [ ' csrf ' ] ) throw new RuntimeException ( ' CSRF attack ' ) ; //
Do the rest of the processing here } // Generate a key , print a form : $ key = sha1 ( microtime ( ) ) ; $ _SESSION [ ' csrf ' ] = $ key ; ?> < form action = " this.php " method= " post " > < input type =" hidden " name = " csrf " value= " <? php echo $ key ; ? > " /> <!--
Some other form fields you want here , and of course a submit button --> </ form > <? php if ($_SERVER [' REQUEST_METHOD ' ] == ' POST ' ) { //
Here we parse the form if (!isset ($_SESSION [' csrf ' ] ) || $ _SESSION [ ' csrf ' ] !== $ _POST [ ' csrf ' ] ) throw new RuntimeException ( ' CSRF attack ' ) ; // Do the rest of the processing here } // Generate a key , print a form : $ key = sha1 ( microtime ( ) ) ; $ _SESSION [ ' csrf ' ] = $ key ; ?> < form action = " this.php " method= " post " > < input type =" hidden " name = " csrf " value= " <? php echo $ key ; ? > " /> <!--
Some other form fields you want here , and of course a submit button --> </ form >
This example is simplified a lot .
In reality you would probably want to at least have the HTML code in a template file .
It does demonstrate the protection method , though .
Zend Framework CSRF protection plugin
I ’ve written a ZF controller plugin which automatically secures all your forms – neat , huh ?
Download CU_Controller_Plugin_CsrfProtect
Using it is really easy .
Just register it with your front controller and that ’s it :
// this is in your bootstrap or such $ fc = Zend_Controller_Front :: getInstance ( ) ; $ fc -> registerPlugin ( new CU_Controller_Plugin_CsrfProtect ( ) ) ; // this is in your bootstrap or such $ fc = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance ( ) ; $ fc->registerPlugin( new CU_Controller_Plugin_CsrfProtect ( ) ) ;
There are also two parameters that you can use to configure the class :
$ protect = new CU_Controller_Plugin_CsrfProtect ( array ( ' expiryTime ' =>
60 , // will make the CSRF key expire in 60 seconds .
Defaults to 5 minutes ' keyName ' => ' safetycheck ' // will make the CSRF form element be called " safetycheck " .
Defaults to " csrf " ) ) ; $ fc -> registerPlugin ( $ protect ) ; $ protect = new CU_Controller_Plugin_CsrfProtect( array ( ' expiryTime ' => 60 , // will make the CSRF key expire in 60 seconds .
Defaults to 5 minutes ' keyName ' => ' safetycheck ' // will make the CSRF form element be called " safetycheck " .
Defaults to " csrf " ) ) ; $ fc->registerPlugin( $ protect ) ;
The expiry time parameter is more of a nice to have feature .
You may not require it , so it defaults to a relatively lenient 5 minutes time .
How does all this work ?
It ’s really thanks to ZF ’s request / response architechture and regular expressions .
When you open a page , the plugin will check if this was a POST request , and will compare the submitted form to a key automatically stored in the session in the previous request – just like the simple script .
Just before your code sends the HTML response to the user , it also looks at the code and automatically adds a hidden element to all forms , thus securing them against CSRF with it .
I ’ve tried to make it detect the content - type of your response .
If you send out something else than html / xhtml , it will not add the elements .
Note that if you have forms inside CDATA blocks or inside JavaScript code , it will also add the hidden field to those .
This is because detecting if the code is inside CDATA or JS is probably more time consuming than it ’s worth .
Of course , I ’m open to suggestions in this regard .
I ’ve tested the class , but do tell if you find any issues with it .
There ’s also the matter of what to do when a CSRF attack is detected .
For this , I recommend reading Preventing CSRF Properly at Tom Graham ’s blog .

With all kinds of loans hanging on our heads , becoming debt - free sounds like a dream .
The money you owe a friend , student debt , car loans , mortgages , etc. — all combined become a hard - to - manage disaster .
Plus , becoming debt free is more than paying off a credit card loan .
It means prioritizing debts , changing spending habits , learning how to budget and much more .
Check out these tested and proven ways to get out of debt .
Adjust Your Spending and Values
Do n’t fall into the big - spender territory by trying to appear to have it all .
Start avoiding overspending by adopting new habits , analyzing your credit card spending and building a good budget .
If you can , pay off one debt at a time ?
starting with the one with the lowest balance or highest interest rate .
A budget is your debt payoff plan so it does n’t have to be complicated Live with a bare - bones budget until you ’re out of debt to pay down debt faster .
With this kind of approach , you ’ll need to cut your spending as much as you can .
Get rid of any “ extras ” like cable TV and going to eat out .
Consider also downsizing your lifestyle and sticking to your spending rules like avoiding buying stuff out of boredom .
Making a list of essential items and evaluating your spending every month can help align your spending with your values .
Save for Emergencies and Goals
Saving for an emergency fund while paying off what you owe is one of the best financial decisions you can ever make .
While this may sound counterintuitive for those trying hard to pay off their outstanding balances , it ’s often not .
Emergency funds are meant to bail you out of your difficulties .
If you lose your job , for example , you can use it to save yourself from going into debt .
A typical emergency fund should hold about six months of living expenses .
If you can achieve that amount , aim for a month ’s living expenses which is still a good starting point .
Store your savings somewhere risk - free and liquid .
You can put it in an interest - earning account so it earns some extra cash while you are n’t using it .
Earn More
One of the ways to becoming debt - free is getting enough money to sustain your life and extra cash to pay down your debts .
While cutting spending can help you earn more , it does n’t always work for everyone .
Consider looking for a higher paying job or getting a second job to add more money to your monthly income .
The truth is , second jobs are n’t always exciting but are a sure way to help you get out of debt fast .
Putting in additional hours working gigs , for example , can be exhausting but will help reach goals faster .
The good thing is that nearly everyone has a skill or talent they can use to earn extra cash on the side .
There are plenty of apps and online resources , such as Fiverr or TaskRabbit , that allow you to find quick work .
Another option is starting a part - time business , like selling stuff on eBay or running a blog .
Also , sell items you do n’t need and those you can live without .
Consider digging through your closet to find stuff you can sell via the numerous online resellers out there .
Use the money to pay down your debts .
Increase Your Monthly Payment
You do n’t always have to make the monthly minimum payments .
Whether you ’re carrying student debts , personal loans or credit card debts , paying them earlier is considered a good idea .
Even just a few extra dollars every month will help .
Paying loans sooner is not only a great way to save on interest but will also increase the speed of the payoff process .
However , if you pay off your loans early , ensure they do n’t charge prepayment penalties .
It makes sense to pay the bare minimum on some of your debts when you have a loan repayment plan .
The goal is to make significant dips in at least one of your unpaid loans each month .
Talk to a Credit Counsellor
Knowing where to find help when things seem not to work is a good step towards becoming debt free .
Talking to a credit counselor can put you on the right path to paying down your debts .
A counselor can recommend and assist you in understanding the programs available to help you get out of debt .
The best part is consulting with credit counselors can be inexpensive and is almost always confidential and non-judgmental .
When shopping around for a debt solutions service , it ’s important to find out if the company is licensed .
You should also check for reviews to figure out how the company treats its customers .
You can always enlist the help of a good debt resolution service to help with your credit score and learn more about paying down debts .
Ask for Lower Credit Card Interest Rates
The higher the credit card interest rates , the longer you ’ll pay debts .
This is because much of what you pay will go toward the interest charge instead of the actual balance .
Asking for your interest to be reduced is quite commonplace so call your card issuer for negotiation .
There ’s a possibility to negotiate lower interest rates successfully if you have a good payment history
Creditors lower rates as they see fit so if your request is turned down , you can always take advantage of promotions .
And there are many .
For instance , some creditors offer lower rates to customers who pay off their balance within a specified period .
Consider Consolidation
Turn all your debts into one single debt .
Check if your credit union or bank can consolidate all your debts into one loan at a lower interest rate .
This strategy works best for credit card loans as they often attract high - interest rates .
Put Yourself
On the Path of Becoming Debt Free
The decision to becoming debt free is life - changing and it ’s something you can do yourself .
It often requires self - motivation , some learning and willingness to use the right tools to get there .
Applying these strategies is the right step towards paying off your debts .
But remember , everyone ’s financial burdens are different so it ’s always advisable to seek personalized guidance and plan .

Orson Scott Card Rhinoceros Times Article
-- best - selling author , political writer , speaker , and self - described Democrat , takes on the Democratic Party and mainstream media in an open letter making it 's rounds on the internet .
In the article , which first appeared in Card 's hometown newspaper , The Rhinoceros Times of Greensboro , North Carolina , he blasts the media for " consenting to or actively promoting a big fat lie , " about who is to blame for the housing crisis , and throwing away " everything that journalism is supposed to stand for , " to " get people to vote for Barack Obama . "
" Your job , as journalists , is to tell the truth .
That 's what you claim you do , when you accept people 's money to buy or subscribe to your paper . "
" Meanwhile , you have participated in the borking of Sarah Palin , reporting savage attacks on her for the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter — while you ignored the story of John Edwards 's own adultery for many months . "
I , for one , applaud Card 's sentiments .
Journalists are supposed to report the facts -- unbiased and objectively .
Lacking journalistic integrity , what we get from the media is information skewed to suit the political agenda of the reporting agencies .
The public is forced to sort through the propaganda to ascertain the truth -- a task most people are not willing to tackle .
Confused , they simply spout the latest dogmatic rhetoric .

An open letter to the local daily paper — almost every local daily paper in America :
I remember reading All the President 's Men and thinking :
That 's journalism .
You do what it takes to get the truth and you lay it before the public , because the public has a right to know .
This housing crisis did n't come out of nowhere .
It was not a vague emanation of the evil Bush administration .
It was a direct result of the political decision , back in the late 1990s , to loosen the rules of lending so that home loans would be more accessible to poor people .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were authorized to approve risky loans .
What is a risky loan ?
It 's a loan that the recipient is likely not to be able to repay .
The goal of this rule change was to help the poor — which especially would help members of minority groups .
But how does it help these people to give them a loan that they can't repay ?
They get into a house , yes , but when they can't make the payments , they lose the house — along with their credit rating .
They end up worse off than before .
This was completely foreseeable and in fact many people did foresee it .
One political party , in Congress and in the executive branch , tried repeatedly to tighten up the rules .
The other party blocked every such attempt and tried to loosen them .
Furthermore , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were making political contributions to the very members of Congress who were allowing them to make irresponsible loans .
( Though why quasi - federal agencies were allowed to do so baffles me .
It 's as if the Pentagon were allowed to contribute to the political campaigns of Congressmen who support increasing their budget . )
Is n't there a story here ?
Does n't journalism require that you who produce our daily paper tell the truth about who brought us to a position where the only way to keep confidence in our economy was a $ 700 billion bailout ?
Are n't you supposed to follow the money and see which politicians were benefiting personally from the deregulation of mortgage lending ?
I have no doubt that if these facts had pointed to the Republican Party or to John McCain as the guilty parties , you would be treating it as a vast scandal .
" Housing - gate , " no doubt .
Or " Fannie - gate . "
Instead , it was Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank , both Democrats , who denied that there were any problems , who refused Bush administration requests to set up a regulatory agency to watch over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and who were still pushing for these agencies to go even further in promoting sub - prime mortgage loans almost up to the minute they failed .
As Thomas Sowell points out in a TownHall.com essay entitled " Do Facts Matter ? " ( http://snipurl.com/457townhall_com] ) : " Alan Greenspan warned them four years ago .
So did the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the President .
So did Bush 's Secretary of the Treasury . "
These are facts .
This financial crisis was completely preventable .
The party that blocked any attempt to prevent it was ... the Democratic Party .
The party that tried to prevent it was ... the Republican Party .
Yet when Nancy Pelosi accused the Bush administration and Republican deregulation of causing the crisis , you in the press did not hold her to account for her lie .
Instead , you criticized Republicans who took offense at this lie and refused to vote for the bailout !
What ?
It 's not the liar , but the victims of the lie who are to blame ?
Now let 's follow the money ... right to the presidential candidate who is the number - two recipient of campaign contributions from Fannie Mae .
And after Freddie Raines , the CEO of Fannie Mae who made $ 90 million while running it into the ground , was fired for his incompetence , one presidential candidate 's campaign actually consulted him for advice on housing .
If that presidential candidate had been John McCain , you would have called it a major scandal and we would be getting stories in your paper every day about how incompetent and corrupt he was .
But instead , that candidate was Barack Obama , and so you have buried this story , and when the McCain campaign dared to call Raines an " adviser " to the Obama campaign — because that campaign had sought his advice — you actually let Obama 's people get away with accusing McCain of lying , merely because Raines was n't listed as an official adviser to the Obama campaign .
You would never tolerate such weasely nit-picking from a Republican .
If you who produce our local daily paper actually had any principles , you would be pounding this story , because the prosperity of all Americans was put at risk by the foolish , short - sighted , politically selfish , and possibly corrupt actions of leading Democrats , including Obama .
If you who produce our local daily paper had any personal honor , you would find it unbearable to let the American people believe that somehow Republicans were to blame for this crisis .
There are precedents .
Even though President Bush and his administration never said that Iraq sponsored or was linked to 9/11 , you could not stand the fact that Americans had that misapprehension — so you pounded us with the fact that there was no such link .
( Along the way , you created the false impression that Bush had lied to them and said that there was a connection . )
If you had any principles , then surely right now , when the American people are set to blame President Bush and John McCain for a crisis they tried to prevent , and are actually shifting to approve of Barack Obama because of a crisis he helped cause , you would be laboring at least as hard to correct that false impression .
Your job , as journalists , is to tell the truth .
That 's what you claim you do , when you accept people 's money to buy or subscribe to your paper .
But right now , you are consenting to or actively promoting a big fat lie — that the housing crisis should somehow be blamed on Bush , McCain , and the Republicans .
You have trained the American people to blame everything bad — even bad weather — on Bush , and they are responding as you have taught them to .
If you had any personal honor , each reporter and editor would be insisting on telling the truth — even if it hurts the election chances of your favorite candidate .
Because that 's what honorable people do .
Honest people tell the truth even when they do n't like the probable consequences .
That 's what honesty means .
That 's how trust is earned .
Barack Obama is just another politician , and not a very wise one .
He has revealed his ignorance and naivete time after time — and you have swept it under the rug , treated it as nothing .
Meanwhile , you have participated in the borking of Sarah Palin , reporting savage attacks on her for the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter — while you ignored the story of John Edwards 's own adultery for many months .
So I ask you now :
Do you have any standards at all ?
Do you even know what honesty means ?
Is getting people to vote for Barack Obama so important that you will throw away everything that journalism is supposed to stand for ?
You might want to remember the way the National Organization of Women threw away their integrity by supporting Bill Clinton despite his well - known pattern of sexual exploitation of powerless women .
Who listens to NOW anymore ?
We know they stand for nothing ; they have no principles .
That 's where you are right now .
It 's not too late .
You know that if the situation were reversed , and the truth would damage McCain and help Obama , you would be moving heaven and earth to get the true story out there .
If you want to redeem your honor , you will swallow hard and make a list of all the stories you would print if it were McCain who had been getting money from Fannie Mae , McCain whose campaign had consulted with its discredited former CEO , McCain who had voted against tightening its lending practices .
Then you will print them , even though every one of those true stories will point the finger of blame at the reckless Democratic Party , which put our nation 's prosperity at risk so they could feel good about helping the poor , and lay a fair share of the blame at Obama 's door .
You will also tell the truth about John McCain : that he tried , as a Senator , to do what it took to prevent this crisis .
You will tell the truth about President Bush : that his administration tried more than once to get Congress to regulate lending in a responsible way .
This was a Congress - caused crisis , beginning during the Clinton administration , with Democrats leading the way into the crisis and blocking every effort to get out of it in a timely fashion .
If you at our local daily newspaper continue to let Americans believe — and vote as if — President Bush and the Republicans caused the crisis , then you are joining in that lie .
If you do not tell the truth about the Democrats — including Barack Obama — and do so with the same energy you would use if the miscreants were Republicans — then you are not journalists by any standard .
You 're just the public relations machine of the Democratic Party , and it 's time you were all fired and real journalists brought in , so that we can actually have a news paper in our city .

( CNN ) --
A magnitude 6.9 earthquake rattled Japan on Thursday , within minutes of a magnitude 6.6 earthquake in Indonesia , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from either quake , but both prompted tsunami warnings , although Japan 's Meteorological Agency predicted it would be small , about 50 centimeter ( 20 inches ) .
The Indonesian quake occurred at exactly 9 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) , the USGS said .
Its epicenter was offshore , about 75 miles ( 120 km ) north of Ternate in the province of Moluccas in eastern Indonesia .
The quake was strongly felt in Ternate .
The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Department issued a tsunami warning shortly afterward -- standard procedure for a quake of magnitude 6.6 or higher with an epicenter offshore .
The Japanese quake occurred at 9:21 a.m. ( 0021 GMT ) .
The USGS initially classified its magnitude as a 7.2 , but later reduced it .
The quake 's epicenter was offshore , about 80 miles ( 125 km ) south - southwest of Kushiro on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido , and about 21.7 miles ( 35 km ) below the Earth 's surface .
The Indonesian quake was much deeper -- about 57.9 miles ( 93 km ) .
In general , earthquakes centered closer to the Earth 's surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground .
Earthquakes between magnitude 6.0 and 6.9 are considered " strong " by the USGS .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said neither quake posed a Pacific - wide tsunami threat .
However , " earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a hundred kilometers of the earthquake epicenter , " the administration said .
CNN 's Andy Saputra in Jakarta , Indonesia , and Junko Ogura in Tokyo , Japan , contributed to this report .

Targeted memory erasure is no longer limited to the realm of science fiction .
A new study describes a method through which a selected set of memories can be rapidly and specifically erased from the mouse brain in a controlled and inducible manner .
New and old memories have been selectively and safely removed from mice by scientists .
" While memories are great teachers and obviously crucial for survival and adaptation , selectively removing incapacitating memories , such as traumatic war memories or an unwanted fear , could help many people live better lives , " says Dr. Joe Z. Tsien , brain scientist and co-director of the Brain & Behavior Discovery Institute at the Medical College of Georgia School of Medicine .
" Our work reveals a molecular mechanism of how that can be done quickly and without doing damage to brain cells , " says the Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Cognitive and Systems Neurobiology .
Dr. Tsien 's research team , in collaboration with scientists at East China Normal University in Shanghai , were able to eliminate new and old memories alike by over - expressing a protein critical to brain cell communication just as the memory was recalled , according to research featured on the cover of the Oct. 23 issue of Neuron .
Dr. Tsien had already created a mouse that could n't form memories by eliminating the NMDA receptor , which receives messages from other neurons .
He then garnered international acclaim by making " Doogie , " a smart mouse in which a subunit of the NMDA receptor is over - expressed .
Younger brains have higher amounts of this NR2B subunit which leaves communication channels between brain cells open longer .
That is why young people can learn faster than older adults .
This time he was examining downstream cascades of the NMDA receptor to learn more about memory formation .
An abundant protein found only in the brain , called αCaMKII , was a logical place to look because it's a major signaling molecule for the NMDA receptor .
He found that when he over - expressed αCaMKII while a memory was being recalled , that single memory was eliminated .

Receptors such as the NMDA receptor are like front doors to cells , providing an opening for signaling molecules such as calcium .
Synapses are the point of communication between two cells , and NMDA receptors are on the receiving end of the message .
Like people , neurons change with the signals they receive .
" Learning changes the way cells connect to each other , " says Dr. Tsien .
To form a memory , the NMDA receptor is activated , which results in the insertion of AMPA receptors into those synapses and subsequent strengthening of the synaptic connections among hundreds of thousands of neurons .
Scientists believe that αCaMKII plays an important role in the insertion of AMPA receptors into synapses during learning and subsequent strengthening of connections between neurons to create a memory .
Memory has four distinct stages : learning , consolidation , storage and recall .
It has been difficult to dissect the molecular mechanisms of these stages because researchers lacked techniques to manipulate proteins quickly .
For example , when researchers disable a gene suspected to play a role in the memory process , the deletion typically occurred throughout the entire period so it was impossible to tell which parts of processes were impaired .
Previous technology would take several days to switch off a protein , which is the product of a gene .
So Dr. Tsien 's team developed a powerful chemical - genetic method that allows him to use a pharmacologic inhibitor to instantly turn αCaMKII off and on in a mouse that he genetically engineered to over express this signaling molecule .
That enabled him to study exactly what happened if he threw off the natural balance during the retrieval stage .
Much as a war veteran remembers a fateful patrol when he was fired upon , mice can establish a very long - lasting emotional memory about a place if , for example , they receive a mild shock to the paws while there .
The researchers showed if they over - expressed αCaMKII , this powerful memory was rapidly erased as the animals tried to retrieve them while other memories remained intact .
A similar approach was taken with object recognition memory , giving mice a couple of toys to play with then erasing their memory of one of them .
" You will feel like every time , it 's a new toy , " says Dr. Tsien .
While the ability to rapidly erase a selective memory is exciting , he cautions that its translation to humans would be difficult at this stage .
" We are barely at the foot of a huge mountain , " says Dr. Tsien .
A possible strategy for humans would be a drug that mimics the αCaMKII over expression that researchers accomplished through genetic manipulation .
Or , further downstream substrates that αCaMKII acts upon could become possible drug targets .
The research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health , the National Institute on Aging and the Georgia Research Alliance .
NEW PORT RICHEY , Fla .  Jim Piccillo lost his job at a bank in August , applied for food stamps to support his two young daughters and swore off a life of loyalty to the Republican Party .
He now volunteers here in Pasco County for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois .
Madeline Aquanno ’s change of heart came more recently .
Two weeks ago , she said , she had planned to vote for Senator John McCain of Arizona , the Republican , who impressed her with his knowledge of the world .
But as the economy began to scare her more than terrorism , she reconsidered .
“ Obama is more for the people , ” she said , near the pool at her middle - class retirement community in Broward County .
“ I ’m worried about the jobs that are being lost , for my son , my daughter , my granddaughter .
You have to look down the line . ”
Here in a swing state of severe economic hurt  a leader in foreclosures where empty offices now litter strip malls  there are signs that Mr. Obama is gaining ground .
In interviews and surveys , voters across Florida said the debate in Washington over how to fix the credit crisis had fueled frustration with the Bush administration and pushed them away from the Republican ticket .

Storm chasers know what they 're getting into when they go put themselves in the middle of nature 's fury , but when that fury helps itself to a piece of this Toyota 4 Runner , the results are pretty shocking .
This fellow was out hunting weather and his 4 Runner got nailed at the ham radio antenna mounted on the roof .
The juice flowed down into the truck and found its way to the ground through the wheels , punching little holes in the rims in the process .
The antenna was just plain vaporized , as , we 'd guess , was the guy 's underwear .

Doug Wilder , 77 , still meets people who wanted to vote for him when he stood for governor of Virginia back in 1989 but found they just could not do it .
They said they would .
They even thought they would .
But when it came down to it , they just could not vote for a black man .
" I 've had people who tell me ' I did n't vote for you for lieutenant governor or governor .
I wish I had that chance again ' , " he says .
On the eve of his election he led in the polls by 9 % .
On the day he won by less than 0.5 % .
They call it the Wilder effect - the shortfall between white voters ' professed support for black candidates and their propensity to actually vote that way .
They also call it the Bradley effect , after the Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley who stood for California governor in 1982 .
Back then the deception continued even after some had cast their ballot .
Bradley 's exit poll lead was so significant that early editions of the San Francisco Chronicle projected his victory .
He lost by just over 1 % .
The question over the next two months is : will there be an Obama effect ?
And if so will it end like Wilder , in victory ; or like Bradley , in defeat ?
At its heart lies the issue of how America understands the relationship between race and racism , and the degree to which claims of his post - racial candidacy have been misconstrued .
The issue here is not whether racism will cost him the election , but whether the race we think we are watching is in fact the race that is taking place .
In essence , the Wilder effect exposes the gap between how comfortable a minority of white voters are in admitting their prejudice and how ready they are to act upon it .
Over the past 40 years racism has ceased to be socially acceptable .
Nonetheless , it maintains broad appeal .
The nation 's most popular radio host , Rush Limbaugh , has referred to Obama as the " little black man-child " ; and Fox News branded his wife , Michelle , as his " baby - mama " .
Yet while few are comfortable being called racist , racism persists .
" Do I think there 's been a seismic change ? " asks Wilder , who is now the mayor of Richmond .
" Yes .
Do I think racism is still around ?
Yes .
Do I think it 's as pervasive as it has been ?
No .
I do n't subscribe to the idea that the majority of Americans are racist . "
Quite .
Yet black Americans are three times more likely to live in poverty and twice as likely to be unemployed or drop out of school .
Such disparities do not happen by accident .
So we have racism but no racists .
A system of discrimination - albeit much altered from 40 years ago - remains , yet no one will take responsibility for it .
There are views that pervade , but apparently no one who actually holds them .
Such is the contradiction that plays out between what some people tell pollsters and what they actually do at the polls .
Navigating these particular incongruities is the challenge of a new generation of black candidates .
" In so much of the work I 've done , I 've found that you had to put people at ease on the question of race before you could even start to talk about what you were doing , " explains the Massachusetts governor , Deval Patrick .
" I do n't fit a certain expectation that some people have about black men .
And I do n't mean that as anything other than an observation about my life . "
This is simply a candid assessment of black middle - class life in America in or out of politics .
Those who are keen to succeed must first negotiate racism in all its subtlety and plausible deniability .
Wronged or not , they must avoid any hint of complaint lest it be taken for grievance ; talented or not , they must avoid any hint of over - accomplishment lest it be taken for hubris .
Last week , one Georgia congressman referred to the Obamas as " uppity " .
After Obama delivered a throwaway line about Republicans trying to scare voters because he " does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills " , the Republican attack machine went into overdrive .
" There 's no doubt in my mind that what Senator Obama is trying to suggest - that he's a victim of something , " said the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham .
An uppity black man playing the victim - meet Willie Horton 's 21st - century cousin .
" Is it fair ? " asks Wilder , referring to the demands placed on black candidates .
" No .
Life is n't fair .
That 's what you have to overcome ...
If that 's the bar , you meet it .
What do I have to do to have that door opened for me ?
Knock on it .
Or break it down .
You tell me what I need to do .
If it does n't open and I have to break it down , I will develop the strength .
If I knock on it and it does n't open , I want to know why .
Do n't complain about it .
Just do the job . "
Obama has so far been knocking firmly and politely and doing the job with a sly cunning .
His strategy has been to play up the historical resonance of his candidacy while downplaying any overt mention of either race or black people .
This was particularly clear during his nomination acceptance speech in Colorado , which was deliberately timed to coincide with the anniversary of Martin Luther King 's " I have a dream " speech .
Yet he did n't once mention King 's name , referring instead to a " young preacher " and quoting one of the more forgettable parts of the most memorable speech in American history .
Race is central to his meaning , but absent from his message .
This is less a criticism than a description .
Obama is navigating uncharted and decidedly choppy waters .
It is difficult to see how else he could play it .
And yet it is not without its problems .
At any moment , while passing for the presidency , he can be outed by anything from a preacher to a fist bump or a magazine cover .
Such is the lot of the incognegro .
For what people really mean when they refer to his candidacy being post - racial is that it is " not too obviously black " .
The trouble is that is as racial a category as any other , albeit a negative one .
The paradox is that , with historically low levels of black and Hispanic support , John McCain 's is the most " racial " candidacy we 've seen for a long time .
The days of the Wilder effect may be waning .
A report by the Pew Research Centre , following the 2006 midterms , found the polls on black candidates to be highly accurate .
" Fewer people are making judgments about candidates based solely , or even mostly , on race itself , " it concluded .
But then it only takes a few , and Wilder believes they are still out there .
" It does n't have the same salience .
It does n't have the same impact .
But are there going to be people who swear they 're Democrats ; who swear they like him ; who swear they believe in what he 's saying ?
But yet when they go to the polls and grab that lever their hands will shake and tremble and they wo n't be able to pull it ?
Yes . "
But the chance that Obama may follow in his footsteps does not worry Wilder .
" I hope he does , " he says .
" Because if he repeats it , notwithstanding what it looked like , he would still win ...
The only poll that counts is the one on election day . "

Oct. 15 , 2008  -- Teresa Dillon was surprised to learn four years ago that what she deemed as an average sore throat actually was stage 2 cancer on her tonsil .
" People think the face of oral cancer is a 70 - year - old man who 's been chewing tobacco and drinking whiskey all his life , " she said .
" But the face of oral cancer now is — it 's me , a young woman , healthy , nonsmoking , fit . "
But what really shocked the waitress and then 38 - year - old was that the human papillomavirus may have caused her illness , a illness that is often sexually transmitted .
" It was a virus that caused my tumor , the HPV virus , which just knocked me over , " Dillon said .
The HPV Cancer Connection
Dillon is part of a new trend that 's puzzling scientists .
While most HPV infections clear on their own , there is an alarming surge of oral cancers linked to the virus .
Johns Hopkins researchers reported in a study published in February in the Journal of Clinical Oncology that between 1973 and 2004 the incidence of HPV - related oral cancers among people in their 40s nearly doubled .
Today more than 34,000 people have oral cancer and 39 percent of those cases are related to HPV , according to data from the American Cancer Society .
" These are patients that are young .
They are in their 30s and 40s .
They are nonsmokers , and they do n't drink alcohol excessively .
And every time we look we are able to find HPV - 16 in their tissue , in the biopsy specimen , " said Dr. Robert Haddad , a Dana Farber Cancer Institute head and neck surgeon .
High - risk HPV strains cause cancer by using special proteins to disrupt healthy cells .
It makes cells unable to repair themselves and unable to control how they are duplicated .
The virus is transmitted by direct contact .
You only get HPV in the location it attaches to , so it never travels through the bloodstream .
So just exactly how it gets in the mouth may stun you .
" There is absolutely a link between oral sex and oral cancer , " said Dr. Ellen Rome , of the Cleveland Clinic .
Although no proof exists yet , there is a chance that HPV can be transmitted mouth to mouth .
" We can't rule out the virus could be transmitted in saliva by other types of contact — like for instance sharing a drink or sharing a spoon , " said Dr. Maura Gillison , of Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center .
And once the virus is in your mouth , you can't just wash it out .
The only way to get rid of it is extensive drug treatment .
HPV Oral Cancer : Who 's at Risk ?
Men are 35 percent more likely than women to develop HPV - related oral cancer , according to the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology .
But both men and women are susceptible .
While scientists do n't know yet how sexual orientation factors into the equation , they know the No. 1 risk factor is a high number of sexual partners .
So straight or gay , the more partners , the more risk .
" That does n't mean it 's a magic number .
Unfortunately , it only takes exposure to one infected partner to actually acquire the infection , " Gillison said .
Infection with the virus usually happens in adolescence .
And while oral sex today is n't necessarily more prevalent than it was in the past , it certainly is more accepted .
And some often presume it is free of risks .
A 2005 study in the Journal Pediatrics found that teens think oral sex is less risky to their health than vaginal sex .
" I think it 's obvious right now to really say that oral sex is not a safe way of having sex and it could have consequences , " Haddad said .
" The risks associated with it do n't get as much press as the risks you can see with vaginal sex , " Rome said .
" You do n't see someone pregnant after oral sex . "
And many do n't even know they 've contracted HPV and Dillon was one of those people .
" You 'd be hard - pressed to find anybody , " she said , " who would say that I 'm promiscuous , because I 'm not . "
Dillon , who after six months of grueling chemotherapy is now in remission , said she wishes she had known the risk as a teen .
" You have to be careful .
Know who you 're with and you have to take precautions .
You need to educate yourself .
You need to know what 's going on , " Dillon said .
Obama keeps up ' same ' attack on McCain Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 2 , 2008
Print This Email This Ending a detente to partisan politicking observed as Hurricane Gustav ravaged the Gulf Coast , Barack Obama 's campaign unveiled a sharp new television ad arguing that John McCain would represent a continuation of President Bush 's policies .
The ad superimposes the words " The Same " in large block letters over photos of Bush and McCain embracing , smiling , shaking hands , laughing and talking to reporters before replaying a clip of McCain boasting that he voted with the president more than 90 percent of the time .
Although it posted the ad to YouTube on Saturday , Obama 's campaign did not begin purchasing air time until Tuesday , the first full day of the Republicans ' convention .
The ad will run on national cable networks .
A female announcer tells viewers that Bush and McCain " share the same out of touch attitude ... the same tax cuts for huge corporations ... the same plan to spend $ 10 billion a month in Iraq . "
Sounding similar themes of an ad unveiled last week after McCain announced Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
That ad also highlighted McCain 's Bush connections and Iraq spending plans .
After polls earlier this year showed that the president was among McCain 's biggest liability heading into this year 's election , tying the two to each other has proved to be the most consistent line of attack from Obama -- who has made " change " the theme of his campaign -- and the Democratic party .
In releasing an ad at the beginning of the Republican convention , Obama is following an example McCain set last week , when he launched a rehash of Hillary Clinton 's infamous 3 a.m. ad as Democrats were gathering in Denver .
Obama 's campaign began airing " Same " on Tuesday ( full script below ) :
BARACK : Im Barack Obama and I approved this message .
ANNCR : They share the same out of touch attitude .
The same failure to understand the economy .
The same tax cuts for huge corporations and the wealthiest one percent .
The same questionable ties to lobbyists .
The same plan to spend ten billion a month in Iraq when we should be rebuilding America .
McCAIN : I voted with the president over 90 percent of the time , higher than a lot of my even Republican colleagues .
ANNCR : We just cant afford more of the same .

Introduction
There are many ways to measure a database ’s performance .
We can look at its overall availability ; that is : are our users able to get the information they need when they need it ?
We can consider its concurrency ; how many users can query the database at one time ?
We can even watch the number of transactions that occur per second to gauge its level of activity .
Often for our users however , it comes down to one very simple , but somewhat nebulous , measurement – perceived responsiveness .
Or put another way , when a user issues a query does he receive his results without having to wait too long ?
Of course , there are many factors that influence this .
There is the hardware itself and how its configured .
There is the physical implementation of the database ; the logical design of the database ; and even how the queries themselves are written .
In this article however , I will focus on one specific technique that can be used to improve performance – creating covering indexes .
An indexing refresher
Before taking on the challenge of covering indexes , let ’s take a moment for a brief but very relevant review of index types and terminology .
Indexes allow SQL Server to quickly find rows in a table based on key values , much like the index of a book allows us to easily find the pages that contain the information we want .
There are two types of indexes in SQL Server , clustered and nonclustered indexes .
Clustered Indexes
A clustered index is an index whose leaf nodes , that is the lowest level of the index , contain the actual data pages of the underlying table .
Hence the index and the table itself are , for all practical purposes , one and the same .
Each table can have only one clustered index .
For more information on clustered indexes , see the Books Online topic “ Clustered Index Structures ” ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177443.aspx).
When a clustered index is used to resolve a query , SQL Server begins at the root node for the index and traverses the intermediate nodes until it locates the data page that contains the row it ’s seeking .
Many database designs make prolific use of clustered indexes .
In fact , it is generally considered a best practice to include a clustered index on each table ; of course that ’s painting with a very broad brush and there will most assuredly be exceptions .
For more information about the benefits of clustered indexes , see the SQL Server Best Practices Article entitled “ Comparing Tables Organized with Clustered Indexes versus Heaps ” on TechNet .
Lets ’ consider an example .
In the Figure 1 , the Customers table has a clustered index defined on the Customer_ID column .
When a query is executed that searches by the Customer_ID column , SQL Server navigates through the clustered index to locate the row in question and returns the data .
This can be seen in the Clustered Index Seek operation in the query ’s Execution Plan .
Figure 1 . Clustered index execution plan
The following Transact - SQL statement was used to create the clustered index on the Customer_ID column .
1 2 3 4 CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX [ ix_Customer_ID ]
ON [ dbo ] . [ Customers ] ( [ Customer_ID ] ASC ) WITH ( PAD_INDEX = OFF , STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF , SORT_IN_TEMPDB
= OFF , IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF , DROP_EXISTING = OFF , ONLINE = OFF , ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON , ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON ) ON [ PRIMARY ]
Nonclustered indexes
Nonclustered indexes use a similar methodology to store indexed data for tables within SQL Server .
However in a nonclustered index , the lowest level of the index does not contain the data page of the table .
Instead , it contains the information that allows SQL Server to navigate to the data pages it needs .
For tables that have a clustered index , the leaf node of the nonclustered index contains the clustered index keys .
In the previous example , the leaf node of a nonclustered index on the Customers table would contain the Customer_ID key .
If the underlying table does not have a clustered index ( this data structure is known as a heap ) , the leaf node of the nonclustered index contains a row locator to the heap data pages .
In the following example , a nonclustered composite index has been created on the Customers table as described in the following Transact - SQL code .
1 2 3 4 5 CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [ ix_Customer_Name ] ON [ dbo ] . [ Customers ] ( [ Last_Name ]
ASC , [ First_Name ]
ASC ) WITH ( PAD_INDEX = OFF , STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE
= OFF , SORT_IN_TEMPDB
= OFF , IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF , DROP_EXISTING = OFF , ONLINE = OFF , ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON , ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON ) ON [ PRIMARY ]
In this case when a query that searched by customer last name was executed , the SQL Server query optimizer chose to use the ix_Customer_Name index to resolve the query .
This can be seen in the Execution Plan in the following figure .
Figure 2 . Nonclustered index execution plan
For more information on clustered indexes , see the Books Online topic “ Nonclustered Index Structures ” .
Using Nonclustered indexes
As illustrated in the preceding example , nonclustered indexes may be employed to provide SQL Server with an efficient way to retrieve data rows .
However , under some circumstances , the overhead associated with nonclustered indexes may be deemed too great by the query optimizer and SQL Server will resort to a table scan to resolve the query .
To understand how this may happen , let ’s examine the preceding example in more detail .
Key Lookups
Looking again at the graphical query execution plan depicted in Figure 2 , notice that the plan not only includes an Index Seek operation that uses the ix_Customer_Name nonclustered index , it also includes a Key Lookup operation .
SQL Server uses a Key Lookup to retrieve non-key data from the data page when a nonclustered index is used to resolve the query .
That is , once SQL Server has used the nonclustered index to identify each row that matches the query criteria , it must then retrieve the column information for those rows from the data pages of the table .
Since the leaf node of the nonclustered index contains the key value information for the row , SQL Server must navigate through the clustered index to retrieve the columnar information for each row of the result set .
In this example , SQL Server choose to do this using a nested loop join type .
This query produced a result of 1,000 rows and nearly 100 % of the expense of the query was directly attributed to the Key Lookup operation .
Digging a little deeper into the Key Lookup operation , we can see why .
Figure 3 . Key lookup operation properties
This Key Lookup operation was executed 1000 times , once for each row of the result set .
Resorting to Table Scans
As the number of rows in the result set increases , so does the number of Key lookups .
At some point , the cost associated with the Key Lookup will outweigh any benefit provided by the nonclustered index .
To illustrate this point , let ’s modify the query so that it retrieves more rows .
Figure 4 . depicts the new query along with the actual execution plan used to resolve the query .
Figure 4 . Resorting to a table scan
The new query searches for a range of customers whose last name is between “ Roland ” and “ Smith ” .
There are 69,000 of them in our database .
From the actual execution plan , we can see that the query optimizer determined that the overhead cost of performing a Key Lookup for each of the 69,000 rows was more than simply traversing the entire table via a table scan .
Hence , our ix_Customer_Name index was not used at all during the query .
Figure 5 shows some additional properties of the table scan .
Figure 5 . Properties for the table scan operation
One may be tempted to force SQL Server to resolve the query using the nonclustered index by supplying a table hint as shown in the following illustration .
Figure 6 .
Using a table hint to resolve the query
This is almost always a bad idea since the optimizer generally does a good job in choosing an appropriate execution plan .
Additionally , the optimizer bases its decisions on column statistics ; those are likely to change over time .
A table hint that works well today , may not work well in the future when the selectivity of the key columns change .
Figure 7 shows the properties for the Key Lookup when we forced SQL Server to use the nonclustered ix_Customer_Name index .
The Estimated Operator Cost for the Key Lookup is 57.02 compared to 12.17 for the Clustered Index Scan shown in Figure 5 .
Forcing SQL
Server to use the index significantly affected performance , and not for the better !
Figure 7 .
Properties of the Key Lookup for the table hint
Covering Indexes
So , if Key Lookups can be detrimental to performance during query resolution for large result sets , the natural question is : how can we avoid them ?
To answer that question , let ’s consider a query that does not require a Key Lookup .
Let ’s begin by modifying our query so that it no longer selects the Email_Address column .
Figure 8 illustrates this updated query along with its actual execution plan .
Figure 8 . Reduced query to eliminate the Key Lookup
The new execution plan has been streamlined and only uses the ix_Customer_Name nonclustered index .
Looking at the properties of the operation providers further evidence of the improvement .
The properties are shown in Figure 9 .
Figure 9 . Reduced query to eliminate the Key Lookup properties
The Estimated Operator Cost went down dramatically , from 12.17 in Figure 5 to 0.22 in Figure 9 .
We could also look at the Logical and Physical Read characteristics by setting STATISTICS IO on , however for this demonstration it ’s sufficient to view the Operator Costs for each operation .
The observed improvement is due to the fact that the nonclustered index contained all of the required information to resolve the query .
No Key Lookups were required .
An index that contains all information required to resolve the query is known as a “ Covering Index ” ; it completely covers the query .
Using the Clustered Key Column
Recall that if a table has a clustered index , those key columns are automatically part of the nonclustered index .
So , the following query is a covering query by default .
Figure 10 .
Covering index using the clustered index keys
However unless your clustered index contains the required columns , which is not the case in our example , it will be insufficient for covering our query .
Adding Key Columns to the Index
To increase the likelihood that a nonclustered index is a covering index , it is tempting to begin adding additional columns to the index key .
For example , if we regularly query the customer ’s middle name and telephone number , we could add those columns to the ix_Customer_Name index .
Or , to continue with our previous example , we could the Email_Address column to the index as shown in the following Transact - SQL code .
1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [ ix_Customer_Email ] ON [ dbo ] . [ Customers ] ( [ Last_Name ]
ASC , [ First_Name ]
ASC , [ Email_Address ]
ASC ) WITH ( PAD_INDEX = OFF , STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF , SORT_IN_TEMPDB
= OFF , IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF , DROP_EXISTING = OFF , ONLINE = OFF , ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON , ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON ) ON [ PRIMARY ]
Before doing so , it is important to remember that indexes must be maintained by SQL Server during data manipulation operations .
Too many index hurts performance during write operations .
Additionally , the wider the index , that is to say the more bytes that make up the index keys , the more data pages it will take to store the index .
Furthermore , there are some built in limitations for indexes .
Specifically , indexes are limited to 16 key columns or 900 bytes , whichever comes first , in both SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 .
And some datatypes cannot be used as index keys , varchar ( max ) for instance .
Including Non-Key columns
SQL Server 2005 provided a new feature for nonclustered indexes , the ability to include additional , non-key columns in the leaf level of the nonclustered indexes .
These columns are technically not part of the index , however they are included in the leaf node of the index .
SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 allow up to 1023 columns to be included in the leaf node .
To create a nonclustered index with included columns , use the following Transact - SQL syntax .
1 2 3 4 5 6 CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [ ix_Customer_Email ] ON [ dbo ] . [ Customers ] ( [ Last_Name ]
ASC , [ First_Name ]
ASC ) INCLUDE ( [ Email_Address ] ) WITH ( PAD_INDEX = OFF , STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE
= OFF , SORT_IN_TEMPDB
= OFF , IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF , DROP_EXISTING = OFF , ONLINE = OFF , ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON , ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON ) ON [ PRIMARY ]
Rerunning our query yields an execution plan that make use of our new index to rapidly return the result set .
The execution plan may be found in the Figure 11 .
Figure 11 .
Covering query with included columns
Notice that even though our query selects columns that are not part of the nonclustered index ’s key , SQL Server is still able to resolve the query without having to use a Key Lookup for each row .
Since the ix_CustomerEmail index includes the Email_Address column as part of its definition , the index “ covers ” the query .
The properties of the Nonclustered Index Seek operator confirm our findings as depicted in the Figure 12 .
Figure 12 .
Execution properties for the covering query with included columns
From this execution plan , we can see that the Estimate Operator Cost decreased from 12.17 in Figure 5 to 0.41 .
Including an additional non-key column has dramatically improved the performance of the query .
For more information about including non-key columns in a nonclustered index , See “ Index with Included Columns ” in Books Online .
Summary
By including frequently queried columns in nonclustered indexes , we can dramatically improve query performance by reducing I /O costs .
Since the data pages for an nonclustered index are frequently readily available in memory , covering indexes are the usually the ultimate in query resolution .
Nested eager loads are a not entirely obvious bit of rails syntax .
It ’s not hard once you get it though .
In a nutshell you have to tell ActiveRecord how it should walk through the associations ( i.e. just listing them is n’t enough ) .
Before we get going it ’s worth pointing out that although I ’ve written : include everywhere , everything I ’ve said applies equally to : include and : joins ( see my previous post on the difference between the two ) .
When you are nesting includes , you ’re building up a data structure that is inherently recursive .
There are 3 rules for nested : includes : – Always use the association name .
Not the table name , not the class name but the association name ( whatever it is that you typed just after belongs_to , has_many etc… ) .
A correlation is that if you do n’t have all your associations set up , you ’re dead in the water .
If you ’ve got one side of a relationship Rails wo n’t infer the other for you .
–
If you want to load multiple associations from a model , use an array .
–
If you want to load an association and some of its child associations then use a hash .
The key should be the parent association name , the value should be a description of the child associations .
Now just combine those 3 rules and apply recursively .
As an aid here ’s a quick snippet that takes an include option ( such as [ : comments , {: posts => :authors} ] ) and describes which associations are loaded .
The structure is the same as the code in activerecord that handles the : include option , so it should give some insight into how things work .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def describe associations , from = ' base ' case associations when Symbol then puts " load #{ associations } from #{ from } " when Array then associations .
each { | a | describe a , from } when Hash then associations .
each do | parent , child | raise " Invalid hash - key must be an association name " unless parent .
is_a ? ( Symbol ) describe parent , from describe child , parent end end end
This code is n’t too hard to understand .
It ’s all about the class of the associations parameter –
The easy case is if it ’s a string or a symbol : what we ’ve got is just the name of an association , so just go ahead and load it .
–
If what we ’ve got is an array , then just call ourselves recursively on the contents of that array .
– if what we ’ve got is a hash , then for each key value pair : – Load the association specified by the key ( the parent association ) – Load the associations specified by the value ( from the from the parent association ) .
It produces ( ugly ) output like this :
1 2 3 4 describe [ { : comments => : user } , : category ] load comments from base load user from comments load category from base
which is exactly what activerecord would do .
If you see something like “ load user from comments ” but instances of Comment do n’t have an association named user then you ’ve screwed up .
Examples
Still confused ?
Here are some examples , from simple to complicated ( these are purely examples of the : include syntax – do n’t see this as a recommendation to actually load 10 layers of nested associations ) .
The models are from a hypothetical book selling application and are : – Book – Author – Comment – User
Books belong to authors , and users of the site can leave a comment on any book .
The obvious associations are defined .
In addition user has a favourite_books association and through the friends association they can list other users who taste in books they generally share .
1 Book .
find :all , : include => :author
I hope I do n’t have to explain that one to anyone : –)
1 Book .
find :all , : include => [ :author , : comments ]
We want to include both the author and comments , so we place the two names in an array
1 2 3 4 Book .
find :all , : include => [ :author , { : comments => : user } ]
Book .
find :all , : include => [ { : comments => : user } ]
Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => : user } Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => [ : user ] }
In the first example we still want to include author and comments , but now we want to include an association from comments .
From the 3rd rule we need a hash containing the key : comments and with corresponding value a description of the associations from the Comment model that we want to load ( ie just : user in this case ) .
In the next 3 examples we just want to include the comments and the user from each comment .
These three forms are entirely equivalent ( which should be fairly obvious ) .
1 2 Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => { :user => : favourite_books }} Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => { :user => { :favourite_books => : author }}}
Here we are loading the books ’ comments , the user for each comment and the favourite books for each of those users .
In the second example we ’re also loading the author for each of those favourite books .
You can keep on nesting these as far as you want .
1 Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => { :user => { :favourite_books => [ :author , : comments ]
}}}
Now we ’ve come full circle – on each favourite book we ’ve loaded the comments
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => { :user => [ : friends , { :favourite_books => [ :author , : comments ] } ] }} Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => { :user => [ { : friends => : favourite_books } , { :favourite_books => [ :author , : comments ] } ] }} Book .
find :all , : include => { : comments => { :user => { : friends => :favourite_books , :favourite_books => [ :author , : comments ]
}}}
Our final examples .
In addition to the favourite_books association , we ’re loading a user ’s friends , and in the second case the favourite books of those friends .
The last two examples are identical : we can either have an array with two 1 item hashes , or just one hash with 2 items .
We ca n’t do that in the first example : because we ’re not loading any associations from friends we ca n’t make it into a hash ( what would the corresponding value be ? )
Sony to pull controversial CDs , offer swap By Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY Related item : Firestorm rages over lockdown on digital music ) LOS ANGELES  Sony BMG Music Entertainment said Monday it will pull some of its most popular CDs from stores in response to backlash over copy - protection software on the discs .
( Sony also said it will offer exchanges for consumers who purchased the discs , which contain hidden files that leave them vulnerable to computer viruses when played on a PC .
" Sony BMG deeply regrets any inconvenience to our customers and remains committed to providing an enjoyable and safe music experience , " the company said .
Sony says more than 20 titles have been released with the XCP copy - protection software , and of those CDs , over 4 million have been manufactured , and 2.1 million sold .
Details about how long it will take to replace the XCP CDs and about its consumer exchange program will come later in the week , Sony said .
For now , pulling the CDs off shelves " could go a long way toward making a consumer feel comfortable that the CD they just purchased is n't going to mess up their computer , " says record store owner John Kunz of Waterloo Records in Austin .
Country - rockers Van Zant's Get Right with the Man kicked off the firestorm when a blogger traced a hidden , spyware - type file on his computer to the CD .
Other XCP copy - protected CDs include new releases by Neil Diamond , Celine Dion , Cyndi Lauper and Burt Bacharach .
Before Sony 's announcement , Van Zant manager Ross Schilling urged the label to recall all the CDs .
" I said we 've got to be proactive , or it could destroy the business model , " Schilling says .
" Sony should be in the artist business , promoting and selling records .
This type of issue sheds a negative light on their ability to do that . "
Sony began adding copy - protection to its CDs in June 2004 with the release of a record by the band Velvet Revolver , saying it was taking a step against unauthorized online file - sharing and CD burning .
The label says it will issue all major releases with copy - protection in 2006 , as will rival label EMI .
The other major labels , Universal Music and Warner , have yet to release copy - protected CDs .
Sony also issues copy - protected CDs using software from digital rights management company SunnComm .
But those , which include releases by the Foo Fighters and the Dave Matthews Band , have n't come under the same kind of attack .
However , many artists have spoken out about all forms of copy - protected CDs , including Matthews , the Foo Fighters and Christian rock band Switchfoot .
Bela Fleck and the Flecktones are set to release a new album on Sony in January , and it will not be copy protected , says Fleck 's manager , David Bendett .
Frustrated when he bought a copy - protected Dave Matthews release and could n't copy it to his Apple iPod , Fleck insisted that Sony not release his new album with such restrictions , Bendett says .
Sony says its copy - protected CDs are clearly marked , but the front labels do n't identify whether they use the XCP software .
That information is included in small print on the back of the CD , which reads " ?cp.sonybmg.com /xcp " .
